30-09-2021||Lucknow||As monsoon departs, Uttar Pradesh records normal but scattered season||The monsoon season across Uttar Pradesh concluded on Thursday with the state recording another year of normal rainfall, Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) data read. While the state recorded normal rainfall, the rainy days were fewer and scattered as compared to previous years, the data showed.Uttar Pradesh recorded a total of 758 mm average rainfall between June 1 and September 30 which is 5% less than the normal 790 mm. Considering that the shortfall was only 5%, it was categorised as normal by the IMD.The departure from the normal was more in western UP districts than compared to eastern UP. The eastern UP districts recorded an average of 867 mm rainfall which is 3% more than normal rains of 839 mm this monsoon season. During the same period, western UP districts of the state recorded just 572 mm of average rainfall that is 21% less than normal rainfall of 721mm.“The rainfall data shows that western UP districts received less rainfall as compared to eastern UP districts during the monsoon season this year. This has been a trend in the last few years,” said JP Gupta, director, state MeT department. “In all, 36 districts of UP received normal rainfall, 11 districts received excess rainfall, and the rainfall in two districts was large excess. Close to 70% of these districts are in central or eastern UP. Twenty-six other districts received deficient rainfall this monsoon,” Gupta added.The IMD rain data which is collected with help of daily rain inputs from each of the 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh showed that most of the rain was concentrated in the months of June and September with average or deficient rains in the months of July and August. The West UP region recorded deficient rainfall in 12 out of 18 weeks of monsoon season.Experts suggest that this shows the increased fluctuations of monsoon rain which directly impacts the weather and farmers. “The lack of rain in some weeks and excess rain in some weeks during the monsoon should be looked at to understand the quality of the monsoon season. The difference in weeks with excess and deficient rain make it difficult for farmers to plan and sustain their Kharif crop forcing them to rely on groundwater which increases the cost of farming,” said Dinesh Kumawat, a Delhi-based agriculture scientist. “It also causes problems to the administration because excess rain within a few days leads to flooding, bringing life to a standstill especially in the cities,” he added.UP recorded extreme rain on September 16, when the state recorded over 334% excess rain within 24 hours. Several cities including the state capital remained inundated with rainwater for over two days and at least two dozen people were killed in rain-related incidents across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/as-monsoon-departs-uttar-pradesh-records-normal-but-scattered-season-101633026515882.html

Once the agency determines this, we will start leasing residential land back to the farmers,” said Pravin Mishra, the additional chief executive officer of Noida authority.The Noida authority has decided to resolve the leaseback cases after the farmers protested against the authority for not leasing the land back to them.“In view of this, we have leased 80 lands (related to old cases) in five villages back to the farmers. And now, we will also go to other villages and leaseback lands to the farmers... We have hired an agency to study the new cases. wherein the authority and the farmers are in a dispute over land claims. The study is going to be completed in a month. If the farmers claim that the land was used for residential purposes before 2011, we do not have any issue in leasing it back to them,” Mishra added.The authority had acquired agricultural land and houses of the farmers for planned development of industrial, residential, group housing, and commercial projects in the city decades ago. Farmers have been protesting the acquisition, saying that the residential land was meant for their families. The authority, however, has argued that the land was for the development projects in the city. Later, the farmers said that they could let go of the agricultural land, but not the residential land meant for their families.Leaseback means that the authority will give the land acquired for developmental purposes back to farmers.Meanwhile, the farmers said that the authority should resolve the leaseback cases at the earliest instead of delaying it any further. “The Noida authority started acquiring the land from 1976, but the leaseback cases are yet to be resolved. Why is it taking so long? We hope that the authority will not delay the process any further,” said Anil Yadav, a senior farmer leader from Navada village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/abadi-land-dispute-noida-authority-ropes-in-private-agency-to-leaseback-residential-land-to-farmers-101633026151277.html
30-09-2021||Other||Mahant’s death: CBI team returns from Haridwar with Anand Giri’s laptop, mobile||A team of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officials returned to Prayagraj on Thursday afternoon after seizing the laptop, mobile phone and several documents from Haridwar-based ashram of Anand Giri—one of the accused in the death of Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad president Narendra Giri. Mahant Narendra Giri’s body was found hanging in his room at the Baghambari Gaddi Math in Prayagraj on September 20 evening. Later, the UP government recommended a CBI probe and the central government issued a notification.After arriving in Anand ashram situated in Gazivali, Shyampur area of Haridwar on Wednesday evening, the seven-member CBI team interrogated nearly a dozen ashramites, close aides of Anand Giri, some property dealers and seers. Giri was grilled for almost five hours by the CBI team at the ashram. He was taken to Haridwar by CBI officials for recovery of his laptop and mobile.Senior superintendent of police, Haridwar, Yogendra Singh Rawat said though the CBI team had arrived, he could not divulge or say anything as the case was being handled by the central agency.“CBI questioned separately the ashramites and other people associated with Anand Giri. They had sought police deployment which was provided and nothing related with probe or seizure by the CBI team was shared with local police,” a local intelligence police personnel said in Haridwar on condition of anonymity.The CBI team refrained from talking to media in Haridwar and even directed Anand Giri not to say anything to media while he was being taken in the car.The CBI team also asked local (Haridwar) police to check the Digital Video Recording (DVR) of the ashram’s CCTV which had gone missing from the ashram and provide it to them as soon as it was recovered. Police officials said they were looking for the missing DVR from the ashram, which was sealed for the past one week by Haridwar-Roorkee Development Authority, for it being unauthorised, and enquiring from ashramites in this regard.Officials are focusing on establishing the allegations made by Mahant Narendra Giri in his purported suicide note in which he had mentioned that Anand Giri might release a morphed obscene video of him to defame him.The CBI will now scan the laptop and the mobile phone of Anand Giri to search for any morphed obscene video or photograph which could have been used for defaming Mahant Narendra Giri. The officials will also take help of CFSL experts to recover the deleted or formatted data from these gadgets. The CBI investigations are based on abetment of suicide case lodged against Anand Giri, Aadya Tiwari and his son Sandeep. Mahant Narendra Giri in his purported suicide note alleged that he was taking the extreme step following harassment by the trio. On September 24, a senior CBI official had confirmed that a case of abetment of suicide under Indian Penal Code section 306 was registered in connection with the Mahant’s death by the special crime branch of CBI’s Delhi unit. Moreover, the CBI probe also revolves around the possibility of any foul play behind Mahant Narendra Giri’s death. Akhada Parishad has earlier rejected the suicide angle while claiming that suicide note found in Mahant’s room was forged.The CBI investigation recently revealed that CCTV cameras at Baghambari Gaddi Math were not functioning at the time of the incident. The Math authorities had claimed that power was disrupted during that period of time following which the cameras went defunct. However, further probe revealed that although there was power disruption for about 42 minutes, the Math was equipped with a four-kilowatt inverter and a 63 KVA generator. As per the arrangements made many years back, the inverter started functioning soon in case of power disruption while generator was also started after a few minutes. CBI officials are now investigating if inverter and generator connections were made with the CCTV cameras.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mahants-death-cbi-team-returns-from-haridwar-with-anand-giri-s-laptop-mobile-101633025971162.html
30-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi University cut-offs may go higher this year, say college principals||With around 70,000 students scoring 95% and above in the CBSE Class 12 exams this year, the Delhi University undergraduate cut-offs that will be released on Friday are expected to be higher than last year in some popular courses, principals said, adding that the revised evaluation pattern for Class 12 students are likely to impact the numbers as well.In the absence of final end-term board exams, due to the pandemic, the Class 12 Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) results were prepared on the basis of students’ Class 10, 11, and 12 internal scores, with a weightage of 30:30:40, respectively.Miranda House principal Bijayalaxmi Nanda said the jump in cut-offs for students in the general category will be higher than for those in the reserved ones.“The cut-offs are likely to be around one percentage point higher [than last year] in popular subjects such as economics, English, history, political science and some combination of BA programme courses. However, since we want to ensure diversity on campus, the jump in cut-offs for reserved categories will be relatively lesser. As a policy matter, we want to focus on inclusivity, especially for students under the people with disabilities category. The intersection of gender and disability is an important one and we need to ensure that the cut-offs there aren’t as high as other courses.”Around 220,000 students scored 90% and above marks in the CBSE Class 12 results this year and 70,000 of them scored around 95% or more. A senior DU official told HT that of the 250,000 paid applicants this year, around 9,600 scored between 99% and 100% this year. Every year, 70-80% of DU applicants are from CBSE-affiliated schools.Institutions such as the Shri Ram College of Commerce, Ramjas College, Hansraj College, and Kirori Mal College are also expected to increase their cut-offs this year.Hindu College is also planning to increase its cut-offs by between 0.25 to two percentage points. Last year, the college kept its highest cut-off at 99.5%, for the political science programme.Hindu College principal Anju Shrivastava said, “All courses will see an increase in cut-offs, particularly in the unreserved category. Last year, the cut-off for some courses was set around 95-96%, which will see a jump of up to two percentage points. Popular courses such as political science, history, and physics also saw over-admissions last year. For a sanctioned strength of around 60 students for political science, we had to admit over 100.”In Delhi University, colleges are required to admit all applicants who meet the announced cut-off criteria, hence often leading to ‘over-admissions’. There is no ‘first-come, first-served’ policy. This is also why colleges tend to keep the first cut-off on the higher side and announce subsequent reductions if seats are available.The cut-offs are expected to be on the higher side in the science programmes as well. Hansraj principal Rama Sharma said the cut-offs will be increased in a few subjects for the college. “We will not keep 100% cut-off in all subjects... we may increase cut-offs in economics and commerce and keep it at around 99.75%. However, we are yet to submit the final cut-offs and so these may change,” she said. Manoj Sinha, general secretary of the DU Principals’ Association and head of Aryabhatta College, said the institution has increased cut-offs by between one and six percentage points. “Depending on the response we receive under the first list, there might be some adjustments in subsequent ones. Since around 70,000 students have scored between 95% and 100% this year in their CBSE results, principals are cautious and may refrain from going below 95% in most popular courses.”Like last year, the admission process is completely online, and students will not have to visit the university campus for the admission process. While students can access the cut-offs on the admissions website on Friday, they can take admission from 10am on October 4 till October 6. Colleges have been asked to complete approvals for admission against the first cut-off by October 7 (5pm). Candidates can pay their fee till October 8 (5pm).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-university-cut-offs-may-go-higher-this-year-say-college-principals-101633025911355.html
30-09-2021||Noida||Wildlife week in Gautam Budh Nagar: Forest department to educate poor students this year||To break economic barriers around the exploration of wildlife and biodiversity, the Gautam Budh Nagar forest department is gearing up to celebrate wildlife week -- from October 1 (Friday) to October 7 -- by educating students from marginalised sections, officials said on Thursday.According to officials, the department will hold several educational nature walks and tours for school students, and also hold competitions such as debates and photography at the Okhla bird sanctuary.“We are celebrating wildlife week with students after two years. Last year, we marked the week through virtual conferences, and no nature walks were held. This year, we have also decided to introduce topics related to wildlife and biodiversity, such as recognising different species, basic or nature photography, etc., for students from the marginalised sections of the society,” said Gautam Budh Nagar divisional forest officer PK Srivastava. The forest department has organised the seven-day programme in association with different NGOs and corporates, said the officials.“While students from well-off families can easily afford a ticket to places like wildlife sanctuaries, bird sanctuaries or national parks, those from the economically weaker section can hardly think of it. So, this year, we have invited a number of students from slum areas or from schools in slums -- with the help of different NGOs which work with/teach children there -- to participate in wildlife week. With their help, we will make these students participate in different activities, like recognising different species of birds and animals, basics of nature photography, nature walk, birdwatching, among others,” said Arvind Mishra, range forest officer and head, Okhla bird sanctuary in Gautam Budh Nagar.Fifty students are supposed to take part in the events on a daily basis, said Mishra, adding, “Apart from educational tours and briar walks, wildlife week will also include several competitions, and there will also be a prize distribution on the final day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/wildlife-week-in-gautam-budh-nagar-forest-department-to-educate-poor-students-this-year-101633025551598.html

30-09-2021||Lucknow||Go for aggressive campaign, Priyanka tells cadre||Lucknow: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday asked her party leaders and workers to reach out to the people and effectively convey the party’s points, besides strongly countering any vicious propaganda. Though she did not name any political party directly, her reference to the BJP, SP and BSP was obvious as she referred to 32-year rule of non-Congress parties that had taken the state on the path of decline. She said aggressive campaigning for the party and countering the vicious propaganda of non-Congress parties was as important on social media as it was on the ground. “We need to bring out the truth,” she said while pointing out how campaigns based on spreading hatred and lies were launched on social media. Priyanka, who is likely to wind up her five-day visit on Friday, also addressed senior leaders at a meeting of the advisory committee. She said the party’s campaign should be aggressive and sought opinion of members before the campaign was launched in the second week of October in Varanasi, the Lok Sabha seat of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Those aware of developments said the Congress Pratigya Yatras may be launched on four different routes on October 17. Through these yatras, party leaders had been asked to convey the promises the party proposed to make to the people in the 2022 assembly elections. The party proposes to hold a rally at Meerut on October 20 and a mega public rally is likely to be held in Lucknow on November 19. As the Congress has launched micro plans for every assembly constituency, an aggressive campaign to reach out to the people by going door to door is likely to be launched after the Lucknow mega rally. A meeting of the Congress’ screening committee and Pradesh Election Committee was also held here. Senior party leaders Bhanwar Jitendra Singh chaired the meeting that was also attended by Randeep Singh Hooda (MP) and Varsha Gaekwad, MLA. The party has invited applications from aspiring candidates for the 2022 assembly polls by October 10. The Congress leaders pointed out that youths and women should be given preference in distribution of tickets. The party has given indications that the first list of candidates will be out by the second week of October. Speaking to media persons later, Hooda did not share much about the screening committee meeting and said only preliminary discussions about the selection of candidates were held on Thursday. A number of delegations also met Priyanka here on Thursday. A party functionary said the delegations included those from weavers, banjara, Rajbhar and Nishad communities and the discussions focused around the issues concerning them. “This is the time for Congress to set its own house in order. Senior Congress leaders are questioning the party leadership and all this does not send a good message to the people at this juncture. The Congress should strengthen its organization at grassroots level to give a categorical message that the party is there in contention, otherwise no campaign is going to help the party,” said professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/go-for-aggressive-campaign-priyanka-tells-cadre-101633025192461.html

The court did not find allegations levelled against them true,” said lawyer Manish Tripathi, who represented all three in court. Rishi Kumar Pandey, a resident of Gorakhpur district, had lodged an FIR at the Cantonment police station in Lucknow on August 6, 2014, accusing Aman Mani, Sandeep Tripathi and Ravi Shukla of kidnapping him at gunpoint from the state capital at around 1am (on August 6, 2014).In the FIR, Pandey had accused the three of taking him hostage when he was on way to New Delhi by a car along with his ailing wife, daughter-in-law and two sons for the treatment of his wife. According to the FIR, the incident took place in front of the Housing Board office in the state capital when Aman Mani and two others forcibly stopped Pandey’s car and dragged him to their vehicle and sped away. Kidnappers had demanded ₹1 lakh ransom and later dumped Pandey in front of the VVIP Guest House in the state capital at around 2.30am the same day, Pandey had claimed in the FIR. The defence argued before the court that all allegations levelled against Aman Mani were politically motivated.“How can you expect a well-off person who drives an expensive car to kidnap a person for ₹1 lakh?” questioned Manish Tripathi. All charges were politically motivated, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/kidnapping-case-mp-mla-court-acquits-aman-mani-two-others-101633024891719.html

30-09-2021||Delhi||Two men held, two juveniles detained for gangster’s murder in southwest Delhi||Police on Thursday said they have arrested two men and apprehended two minor boys for the murder of 20-year-old alleged gangster Tinku Kharab, three days after he was gunned down by two men who intercepted his car on south-west Delhi’s Khaira Road, near Najafgarh. The arrests were made following an encounter near Jharoda Kalan village in the early hours of on Thursday, police said. All four belong to the Nandu gang, led by fugitive gangster Kapil Sangwan alias Nandu, which has a longstanding rivalry with jailed gangster Manjeet Mahal’s gang, of which Kharab was a member, police said.Four pistols and nine cartridges were recovered from the four persons. The arrested duo, identified by their first names as Vinay,24, and Sourabh,18, were the two who opened fire at the car being driven by Kharab on the evening of September 27. Eyewitnesses told the police that 8 to 10 rounds were fired by the two men, killing Kharab on the spot. Kharab was involved in three criminal cases, including a case of extortion, police said.Police said that one of the apprehended juveniles was also involved in the murder of a 24-year-old man, who was killed in a firing at a hotel in south-west Delhi’s Chhawla on August 24. That was a case of mistaken identity -- two juveniles had opened fire at the hotel reception where the man was seated in the manager’s chair, though they had come to allegedly kill the hotel owner. One suspect was apprehended in that shooting, while the other was on the run, said a senior police officer, who did not want to be named. On Wednesday, the special staff team from Dwarka district received information that four suspects who were allegedly involved in Kharab’s murder would arrive near Ganda Nala Road in Jharoda Kalan village in the early hours of Thursday. Accordingly, a trap was laid and the suspects were asked to surrender when they turned up, said additional deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Vikram Singh.“Two of them fired at our team with the intention to kill. One bullet hit the bulletproof vest of assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Umesh, who escaped unhurt. Three rounds were fired by police in retaliation, and the four were overpowered,” added the additional DCP. Police said they are questioning the four persons to as certain who had planned the hit on Kharab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-men-held-two-juveniles-detained-for-gangster-s-murder-in-southwest-delhi-101633024472932.html

30-09-2021||Delhi||HC unhappy over Delhi govt reply to plea seeking lifting ban on herbal hookahs||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday expressed its displeasure at the Delhi government’s response to pleas seeking lifting the ban on use of herbal hookahs in public places, noting that its affidavit did not make it clear whether the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has reconsidered the prohibition order.“Unfortunately even though the respondent (Delhi government) has filed an affidavit trying to justify why the sale of flavoured hookah is not permissible, there is no whisper if the matter has been reconsidered by the DDMA or not,” said Justice Rekha Palli, while hearing Delhi government’s response filed on the pleas of restaurants seeking the non-interference of the state and police in the sale of herbal flavoured hookahs.The court has now granted a week’s time to the Delhi government and directed it to file an affidavit specifically stating whether the DDMA has reconsidered the August 2020 order, along with the reasons for continuing with the decision. The matter will now be heard on October 8.On September 17, the high court had specifically directed the Delhi government to ask DDMA to reconsider its August 3, 2020, order prohibiting the use of herbal hookah in public places to contain the spread of Covid-19.During the proceedings on Thursday, the court told the petitioners’ counsel that the authorities are not permitting many activities amid Covid, adding that it needs to be seen whether it should force them to allow this activity. While perusing the government’s affidavit, the court said it was not in compliance with the last order and that it was not happy with the response.Delhi government standing counsel Santosh Kumar Tripathi said the situation is very alarming and people need to be disciplined. He said he has apprised the DDMA about the court’s order and sought some more time to get its response.During the last hearing on September 17, the high court had asked the Delhi government why the DDMA has not reconsidered the ban on the use of herbal hookahs in public places when breath analyser tests are allowed now.Separate petitions were filed by Breath Fine Lounge and Bar, TOS, R High Speedbar and Lounge, Verandah Moonshine, and Sixth Empirica Lounge in West Punjabi Bagh, challenging the order of the Joint Commissioner of Police (Licensing Unit) prohibiting and excluding the sale or service of herbal flavoured hookahs in restaurant/bar being run by them.The pleas said the petitioners are serving herbal hookahs for which no licence is required as they do not contain tobacco but pointed out that police are conducting raids, seizing equipment, and issuing challans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hcunhappy-over-delhi-govt-reply-to-plea-seeking-lifting-ban-on-herbal-hookahs-101633023930950.html
30-09-2021||Pune||Dabholkar case: Defence lawyer files contempt application against lawyer alleging conspiracy||PUNE: The special Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) court in Pune was presented with an application for initiating a contempt of court hearing against advocate Nihal Singh Rathod for writing an article about the Narendra Dabholkar court case accusing the court and accused to be hand in glove in a conspiracy to ensure acquittal for those booked in the case. Additional sessions judge SR Navandar had declared in open court during the hearing of a bail application by one of the accused, Virendrasinh Tawade, that his court was specially notified to hear cases under UAPA. Advocate Singh, in his article, claimed that there is no official notification to prove that and the court machinery was gearing up to give this advantage to the accused so they could use the technicality of the matter being out of his jurisdiction in order to get out of the jail. Upon being presented with the application, Judge Navandar said, “I will study it, read it and if it is found to be written with an intention to malign the court, action will be taken. The way it has been done is absolutely improper, especially on the day of the hearing.” The contempt of court application was filed by advocate Prakash Shalsingikar who alleged that the article author-lawyer has vested interests in the matter which has led him to ensure that the article be published on a day when the case was entering its first day of trial. “A reading of the article shows that the same predicts the outcome of the trial and such a prediction is per se an act contemptuous towards the court. Secondly, it claims that this honourable court is conducting a trial without authority. There is apparent possibility that such claim would give an impression to the readers that this court does not have knowledge of law as regards its own jurisdiction. Thirdly, it suggests that the accused are quiet/silent since they want to take advantage of alleged technical loophole. Such a suggestion has an apparent possibility of giving an impression to readers that the court does not have knowledge of law, but the accused have knowledge of law better than the court. Lastly, the article specifically alleges that the technical flaw with regard to jurisdiction is created deliberately and that such a thing would not be tolerated,” reads a part of the application by Shalsingikar. Special public prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi narrated a similar incident from the time when he was prosecuting a sex scandal from Parbhani and said, “I learned the lesson to take such applications and throw them in the dustbin.” He said that the court acknowledging the article will be giving it undue legitimacy. The defence lawyer, however, also asked for the newspaper and its editors to be prosecuted for allowing Rathod’s article to be published. To this, judge Navandar said, “When they can comment on the fate of the trial, they can certainly predict the fate of their decisions too.” The judge addressed a reporter from the English daily of the same company that publishes the Marathi daily to become a media between the court and the establishment and send a message. The reporter had come to cover the ongoing proceedings. The application has been set aside for the judge’s consideration and a decision will be made on it in later hearings, according to the judge’s claims in open court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dabholkar-case-defence-lawyer-files-contempt-application-against-lawyer-alleging-conspiracy-101633023690917.html
30-09-2021||Mumbai||Often affected by droughts, 8 Marathwada districts facing agrarian crisis due to floods||Eight districts of central Maharashtra (Marathwada), known for frequent droughts, have been battling with the agrarian crisis due to huge losses of crops in three floods in the ongoing monsoon season. Crops on as much as 2.6 million hectares have sustained damage since the outset of monsoon on June 1, while the recent flooding early this week is expected to increase the figures further as the spot assessment of the losses are still underway. All the eight districts of the central Maharashtra witnessed heavy rainfall resulted out of the remnants of cyclone Gulab since Monday. More than 1.1 mn hectares under cultivation of the agricultural crops has damaged in the downpour, while the consolidated figure of the affected areas since June 1 has touched 25.98 million hectares. 3.56 lakh farmers have been affected in the three floods reported in the region, according to the figures by the divisional commissioner of Aurangbad. The divisional administration has estimated the compensation towards the losses to the crops, roads, government buildings, lives and livestock etc to be worth ₹2254 crore. Of it, ₹1796 crore needs to be disbursed towards the losses of the crops. The region has reported 22 deaths, 12 of which are reported this week. “We have​ started conducting spot assessments in the areas affected this week. Though discharge from some of the rivers is still on, water has receded from flooded areas. Rainfall has stopped. People who were evacuated to safer places have started going back to their homes. The officials are still finding it difficult to reach to the farms because of the water logging and mud filled farms. The estimated losses are expected to go up once the assessment is completed. Central Maharashtra has witnessed highest losses than other parts this monsoon as it was hit in all the three downpours since June,” said a senior official from divisional commissionerate, Aurangabad. Three teams of NDRF and a chopper bound rescue team of Air Force rescued more than 100 people struck in flooding in Latur, Osmanabad and Aurangbad early this week. The teams have now been withdrawn by the respective agencies. District administrations of the respective districts have opened the gates of large dams including Jayakwadi, Purna have opened to enable the discharge. Most of the large dams in central Maharashtra have overflown. In Nashik too, discharge of water from Gangakhed and Girna dams has been increased. According to the report from the disaster management unit of the state government, three more deaths (one each in Nashik, Jalgaon and Buldhana) were reported in last 24 hours. The death toll due to the rains related incidents this monsoon across the state has touched 439, while six people are still missing. Opposition and elected representatives from central Maharashtra have demanded to announced the wet drought in affected districts. Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said that the decision over the demand will be taken in the state cabinet next week once the figures of the losses are submitted to the state government. Meanwhile, the central team of officials is visiting parts of state affected in the flooding in July from October 3. The team will visit parts of Konkan and Western Maharashtra for three days to assess the losses due to the flooding in third week of July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/often-affected-by-droughts-8-marathwada-districts-facing-agrarian-crisis-due-to-floods-101633023151112.html

No injury or casualty was reported.Fire department officials were informed that sparks from electrical wires had resulted in the building catching fire at 3.21am. “The security guards at the warehouse alerted us about the incident. Immediately, two fire tenders each from the Manesar and Sector 29 fire brigades were dispatched. When our firemen reached the spot, they alerted us that the intensity of the blaze was huge and one fire tender each from Bhim Nagar, Udyog Vihar and Sector 37 fire brigades as well as from Honda and Maruti were called upon,” Sukhbir Yadav, assistant fire officer, Haryana Fire Services, said.Yadav said that no workers were present on the premises of AG Industries Private Limited.“Both the hydrants and the water sprinklers were functioning and they helped restrict the blaze to a portion of the building. However, the portion on the ground floor and first floor of the building which were not covered by the sprinklers suffered extensive damage,” Yadav said.Officials of AG Industries Private Limited declined to comment on the matter.Yadav said that with the Manesar fire station located less than four kilometres from the site, the response was swift, failing which it would have taken over six to seven hours to douse the blaze.“By 5.30am, we were able to douse the blaze and by 6.20am, the last fire tender left the spot. We suspect a short circuit was the cause. However, we are investigating to ascertain the exact cause,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/fire-in-manesar-sector-3-two-floors-of-automobile-parts-warehouse-gutted-101633022857016.html

This time, our sample size was four to five times more than the previous surveys, and the processing of all these samples takes time. Earlier, samples used to get processed in respective districts, but now, it is being done at a single place at the state level,” a senior health department official said, requesting anonymity.The survey covered 3,000 people in Gurugram, including 1,200 children aged six to 17 years, who are currently not covered under the Covid-19 immunisation programme.Across the state, 36,520 samples were collected, including 3,600 from children aged six to nine years and about 11,000 from those aged 10-17 years. The sample size is considerably higher than the 18,500 samples covered in the second survey held in October 2020.A serological survey finds the level of antibodies that may have been developed either after an infection or being vaccinated. The results will help the department plan strategies and assess their preparedness for the third wave of Covid-19.In the first statewide serological survey, held in August 2020, 18,905 samples, including 844 from Gurugram, were tested, following which a seropositivity rate of 8% was recorded, with the urban population showing a seropositivity rate of 18.5% and the rural population 5.7%.In the second statewide serological survey, held in October 2020, 16,512 samples, including 800 from Gurugram, were tested, following which a seropositivity rate of 14.8% was recorded, with the urban population showing a seropositivity rate of 25.9% and rural population 10.1%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19third-statewide-serological-survey-results-to-be-released-mid-october-says-health-dept-101633022855911.html

Directions are also being shared with different agencies to ensure that such activities do not take place in the city and daily action taken reports is submitted to the pollution control board.”Earlier this year, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) directed the board to control fires at landfills and open fires.Residents on Thursday took to social media to complain about persistent open waste burning in Sector 58.Sarika Panda, a resident of Sector 58 said, “Over the past year, I have seen solid waste being burnt every day, either early in the morning or at night. I reported it to the authorities five to six times, but no strict action was taken. At any particular time, waste is being burnt in at least three locations of the area. Over the past week, waste burning has increased.”Residents said that due to the lack of a common helpline number, it is difficult to report such incidents.Vaishali Rana, a city-based environmentalist, said, “There is rampant open waste burning in all urban villages in the city, be it Gwal Pahari, Baliawas or Balola. We raise the issues on social media and by the time the action is taken, waste burning is completed. The authorities should at least have a common helpline number where people can report such issues immediately.”In June, residents, under the banner of Citizens for Clean Air, wrote to the authorities about three different waste burning sites within a one-kilometre radius near South City-2, Emaar housing societies, and Golf Course Extension Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/pollution-board-will-start-night-patrols-to-check-open-waste-burning-101633022852062.html

The executive, identified as Anil Hasija, the vice-president of Gopal Dass Estates and Housing, was taken on three-day police remand, a week after an FIR was registered on the recommendation of the Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) for alleged forgery of documents over 45 acres to procure a licence for Ardee City in Sector 52. The police said that action was taken on a complaint filed by Mahender Singh, an EWS plot allottee, at the Sector 53 police station. A case was registered under sections 120B, 406, 420, 467, 468 And 471 of the Indian Penal Code. In his complaint, Singh alleged that even after 26 years since his application, the developer has failed to develop the area earmarked for the EWS category and hand over plots to hundreds of allottees. He alleged that the developers always delayed possession on one pretext or the other and recently, refused to give possession or return the money.Officials of the realty firm could not be reached for comment.It may be noted that the licence of the colony was cancelled by DTCP earlier this month and the department also decided to take over the colony. The developers had obtained a licence for Ardee City colony, on 200 acres, in 1996.

30-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body draws up detailed SOP for restart of schools||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday told all schools that 100% attendance is not mandatory, and parents’ consent is necessary for students to attend school, in its extensive standard operating procedure (SOP). Schools in Mumbai are set to reopen for classes 8 to 12 from October 4 (Monday). The SOP details guidelines across nine parameters, including attendance, safety and Covid-19 hygiene, teaching, seating arrangements in classrooms, for school managements, teachers, students, and parents.The BMC on Wednesday issued a circular that all public and private schools will restart classes from 8 to 12, from October 4, 19 months after they shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In its SOP released on Thursday, BMC has mandated that school managements should link their schools with the nearest primary health centres before restarting classes, to better deal with health emergencies among students and staff.As schools restart, a maximum of 15-20 students will be allowed per classroom at a time. If there are more students, the school can conduct classes a two batches, by dividing students in two groups, and calling them on alternative days. Actual classrooms will operate for not more than three-four hours, and there will be no lunch breaks. Air conditioning will not be operated in classrooms.Schools have also been instructed not to give out certificates or awards for 100% attendance owing to the Covid-19 situation. While on campus, masks are mandatory. All teachers attending school for teaching classes 8 to 12 need to be vaccinated with both doses, or need to take an RT-PCR test 48 hours prior, and the school management is required to verify such reports with the laboratory.The guidelines also mandate regular disinfection of premises such as toilets, classrooms, benches, door handles, and other commonly used property on the premises. Thermal screening of all students will be done every day before entering the school premises.In its circular issued on Wednesday, BMC also instructed all assistant commissioners of the 24 administrative wards in Mumbai to shift any existing vaccination or quarantine centres operating from municipal school premises to the nearest feasible locations. Additional municipal commissioner in-charge of the education department in BMC on Thursday held a review meeting with staff of the education department, ward officers, and deputy municipal commissioners on preparations to be completed over the weekend to facilitate reopening of schools on Monday.Presently there are 16 municipal schools that have quarantine centres, and 35 schools that have vaccination centres operating within their premises. There will be shifted to nearest marriage halls, or civic amenities buildings over the weekend, a senior civic officer from BMC’s education department said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-draws-up-detailed-sop-for-restart-of-schools-101633022377451.html
30-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai over 3,000mm of rain this monsoon||With the official southwest monsoon period ending on Thursday, Mumbai received over 3,000mm of rainfall in the fourth months between June 1 and September. This is 957.7mm more than the seasonal normal of 2205mm, or 30.27 percent departure from the long-period average.The 2021 monsoon season also marks the third consecutive year in which Mumbai received over 3000mm of rain, and follows 2020’s seasonal total of 3,759.7mm (which was just 70mm short of being the wettest September on record), as per the met department’s monitoring station in Santacruz.In September alone, Mumbai recorded 741.7mm of rain (as against the normal of 341.mm) making it the third-wettest September in a decade. While the average daily rainfall during the month ranged between 40mm and 60mm, a 100mm downpour occurred in the 24-hours ending 8:30am on September 29, making a significant contribution to the monthly total.August was the only month this season which recorded below normal rain, seeing a negative 46% deficit at the end of the month. The highest rainfall recorded was 78.44mm of rain in the nine hours ending 5:30pm on August 31, categorised as ‘heavy rain’ by the IMD. The total amount of rainfall received until 8:30 am on August 31 stood at 338.8mm (against the monthly normal of 531.3mm), making it the fourth-driest August in a decade as per IMD records. This follows last year’s above normal reading, when August recorded a whopping 1,247.7mm of rain.This year, the city saw three ‘extremely heavy’ rainfall days (one in June and two in July), receiving over 204.5mm in 24-hours. The first of these events occurred on June 10 (231.3mm), coinciding with the arrival of the south-west monsoon two days prior to the official onset date of June 11. On the day, Mumbai received 220.6mm rain of between 8.30am and 5.30pm, or 43.6% of the monthly normal in just nine hours. The city witnessed a total of 961.4 mm of rainfall for the month (against the normal of 505mm), making it the third-wettest June in the last decade.The highest amount of rain -- 1222mm -- was received in July. The month also saw two consecutive, atypical thunderstorms which dumped more than 500mm rain over the city, resulting in the second and third ‘extremely heavy rainfall’ events of the season. A convective thunderstorm, described by meteorologists as “monstrous”, deposited a whopping 235mm rain between 12am and 4am on July 18, less than 48 hours after a similar high rainfall event resulted in the season’s highest daily rainfall on July 16 at 253mm. July rains saw a 48% departure from the monthly normal of 822mm.Officials in the India Meteorological Department (IMD), including KS Hosalikar (scientist, surface instrument division), did not offer any comments on this year’s monsoon, stating that all notable features will be covered in an upcoming monsoon report by the IMD which is expected within the next day or so. Experts, however, pointed out that despite receiving excess rains, this past season has been marked by very significant “intraseasonal variability” -- a phenomenon which bears a clear signature of climate change.“In terms of high-impact rainfall events in Mumbai-MMR, the second half of the southwest monsoon season has been relatively quiet than the first one. Across India, we have witnessed a very strong intraseasonal rainfall variability between August (sixth driest since 1901) and a very wet September (tenth wettest since 1901), a pattern which is projected to become more robust due to climate change. Such a strong intraseasonal rainfall variability rainfall has a lot of implications for agriculture and flood risk mitigation. Another peculiar feature of the 2021 monsoon is that we got only a single low-pressure system (LPS) in June, 3 in July, 2 in August, but 6 in September. The increased LPS frequency in September did not actually translate to heavy rainfall events in Mumbai, so there’s definitely a lot to investigate meteorologically,” said Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and a PhD candidate at the University of Reading, UK.” A senior meteorologist at IIT-M in Pune, seeking anonymity, said that despite receiving excess rains for three years in a row, monsoon patterns over the Konkan (as with the rest of India) are now showing intermittent dry periods with short spells of heavy rains within the monsoon season, and that the number of extreme rainfall events have increased by at least three times over the city. “This also poses a huge challenge to forecasting, because the IMD and our models are not able to predict such intense bursts early enough. So the time for evacuating vulnerable populations also becomes very less. This year’s monsoon is in keeping with trends that are going to significantly exacerbate climate risk in the foreseeable future,” the scientist said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-over-3-000mm-of-rain-this-monsoon-101633021291115.html
30-09-2021||Other||Allahabad University mulls fee hike as UGC slashes grant||The University Grants Commission (UGC) has slashed the recurring non-salary grant of Allahabad University (AU) by 40%, a move that has now forced the university authorities to think of revising existing fees to meet the shortfall. “Now we have no option left other than to garner our own resources. We will have to start new courses having new fee structures and at the same time revise existing fee structure for various undergraduate and postgraduate courses”, said AU’s vice chancellor professor Sangita Srivastava. For the past many years UGC has been constantly asking universities including AU to raise its own resources to meet the expenses. AU officials admit that the fourth oldest university of the country would now face problems in meeting expenses related to paying electricity bills, house, water tax, while undertaking building repairs and maintenance, housekeeping, security, contractual engagements. “Hiring guest faculty, procuring journals and books in the library etc too could be a problem as expenses for these heads are met by the grant under recurring non-salary head,” AU officials said. The slash in recurring non-salary grant is going to hurt all the more to AU whose annual electricity expenses are pretty high, and it also has electricity dues of around ₹7 crore of past years that it is yet to clear. AU public relations officer (PRO), Jaya Kapoor said, “Now, AU is exploring all avenues in order to meet the shortfall that threatens to cripple the day to day functioning of the university and its associated institutions.” The fees of various courses at AU have not been raised over the past three decades. The annual fee for UG courses at AU ranges from ₹800-1200 and for PG courses, it is from ₹1300-2000. How low the fee of courses at AU are can be gauged from the fact that annual fee at Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi, also a central university in UP, is more than double than that of AU.

30-09-2021||Mumbai||Trial run for Mumbai Metro-3 at Marol Maroshi underground track: CMO||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has decided to hold a trial run for Metro-3 railway line at Marol Maroshi on an underground track. Thackeray asserted that location was outside the Aarey Colony forest and not a single tree at Aarey Colony would be cut for the trials for Metro-3 line which runs between Colaba and SEEPZ.The statement released by the Chief Minister’s office (CMO) said the ramp was being put near Aarey, but it was outside the protected forest. “In order to solve the problem of traffic congestion in South Mumbai, it has been decided to conduct trial run of Colaba-SEEPZ metro line at Marol Maroshi,” said the release. “For the Metro-3, the Alstom company has in Sri City in Andhra Pradesh manufactured a metro train of eight compartments. They have completed the technical tests of this train and will be brought to Mumbai for the trial run for 10,000 kilometres,” it added. It said once the trial runs are successful, 31 trains can run on this corridor.The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC) said the decision will provide an impetus to the project. “With 97% of tunnelling and about 70% of civil work completed, start of technical trials of the prototype train is another milestone on the project. The work to set up temporary facility will begin shortly and may take about 2.5 months to complete. Field trials will immediately start post arrival of the trains,” said Ranjit Singh Deol, managing director, MMRC.The ambitious 33.5-km corridor has already been delayed, with a cost escalation of around ₹10,270 crore. In this, 70 % of the work including 95 % of tunnelling is already completed. The project has already been stuck, after the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government ordered a stay on constructing of the depot at Aarey Colony in November 2019. The previous BJP-led government was a strong votary of the Aarey land. Thackeray announced the state’s decision to shift the car shed to Kanjurmarg in October last year. Last December, the Bombay High Court stayed the decision of the suburban collector to hand over the Kanjurmarg plot for car shed. Since then the matter has been pending before the Court.Transport expert Paresh Rawal said the state needs to solve this car shed tangle. “We can have multiple trial runs, but Metro will not be functional till you have a car shed in place. We have already overshot the deadlines and this project may further get delayed till we don’t finalise on the car shed,” said Rawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/trial-run-for-mumbai-metro-3-at-marol-maroshi-underground-track-cmo-101633020811145.html
30-09-2021||Mumbai||BJP takes on Shiv Sena over potholes on Mumbai roads||As the elections to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation near, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has stepped up its attack against Shiv Sena, now over the potholes on roads in Mumbai and other cities of the state. The BJP has also questioned if the warning of action against the errant contractors was hogwash and accused that the mayor of Mumbai was giving false figures of potholes to facilitate the contractors.BJP leader and former minister Ashish Shelar, while speaking to the media on Thursday, questioned over the disparity in claims by BMC administration and the mayor. “Mayor has been claiming that they fixed 42,000 potholes, while the civic body portal says, to have fixed 927 potholes. Why has been Sena shielding the contractors? The CM has been warning of the action against the contractors. Has the Sena-led civic body taken action against any contractor, holding him responsible? The BMC has spent Rs21,000 crore in last 25 years on road construction and repairs. The contractors have made a bomb out of it, but the city roads have gone to the dogs,” he said.CM Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting of related departments and state entities and warned to take action against the contractors responsible. Shelar has termed the meeting hogwash. “Neither action was taken against any contractors, nor a probe was announced to check the material used to construct the roads. He did not even invite all agencies responsible for the road construction to the meeting. The meeting was just a hogwash, but it could not resolve the real problem,” he said.Shelar also took a dig at Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Supriya Sule, reminding her about her “selfie with potholes” drive during the BJP-led government in the state. Shelar questioned why the NCP MP has disappeared and why is she not taking up the issue again. Party has also made an appeal to the people in Mumbai to participate in their protest against potholes by clicking pictures of potholes and send them for the exhibition announced by the party.Taking a leaf out of Sule’s book, the party’s south-central district ward has organised a competition “Selfie With Potholes”. “We have received good response from the citizens in Mumbai to the competition. We will hold an exhibition in our office at BMC and will award the best selfies. The exhibition will be taken to various parts of the city as a bid to make way to plight of the people. The potholes on the city roads is just because of the corruption in the road construction and it is the failure of the civic body ruled for more than three decades by Shiv Sena,” said Rajesh Shirwadkar, district president of the ward.Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar on Wednesday had said that BMC officials have been directed to fill all potholes by the end of October. Pednekar had also said that engineers have been directed to report, in case of any problem with filling of potholes. Additionally, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal has also asked BMC officials to fill all potholes in the city within next 2-3 weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-takes-on-shiv-sena-over-potholes-on-mumbai-roads-101633020512297.html

30-09-2021||Mumbai||Centre gives nod to Mumbai coastal zone management plans||The union ministry for environment and climate change has given its nod to the Coastal Zone Management Plans (CZMPs) for Mumbai city and suburban districts, to the relief of developers and sparking ire among environmentalists. The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) had green-lit revised draft CZMPs for Mumbai in March this year. State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, in January, had written to former Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar seeking inclusion of Coastal Zone Management Plans (CZMP) under the Coastal Regulation Zones (CRZ) Notification, 2019 for the districts of Maharashtra, including Mumbai, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg. The draft CZMP maps were prepared by the NCSCM under the Union environment ministry in 2019 for all coastal districts in Maharashtra based on the 2019 Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms. They were published on January 22, 2020. These maps use distinct colour codes to demarcate CRZ areas (I to IV), high tide and hazard line, fishing zones, intertidal areas, mangrove forests and buffer areas, turtle nesting sites, cyclone shelters, koliwadas and gaothans. These maps also identify coastal areas that can be opened up for infrastructural development. “Public hearings were held in February to receive objections and suggestions on the previous iteration of the CZMP, which was published in January 2020. It was learnt that the main objection is with regards to the coastal mapping in which regulatory zones have been delineated. The maps were revised keeping in mind public feedback. The MCZMA gave a go ahead on these changes, and the revised plans have now received the MoEFCC’s nod,” said an official privy to the development. “It is astonishing that the plans have been approved on the basis of 1:25000 scale maps. The MCZMA and the Maharashtra Environment Department have confirmed in writing that they do not have 1:4000 scale maps, without which no planning agency can consider proposals within the CRZ. Secondly, the demarcation of the hazard line is one crucial component of the CZMPs, to prevent construction on their seaward side. In view of the recent admission by the Municipal Commissioner of Mumbai that 80% of Mumbai city will be underwater by 2050, it will be very interesting to see how the hazard line has been demarcated in these CZMPs. Fortunately, it seems that they have been approved subject to certain conditions and that this is not a final approval,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust (CAT).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/centre-gives-nod-to-mumbai-coastal-zone-management-plans-101633020155083.html

The SGPGI faculty forum disagrees with this decision, which will stop development of second line of doctors and hamper patient care, as older faculty members are not able to serve patients professionally. They lack the required energy levels,” said Sandeep Sahu, secretary, SGPGIMS Faculty Forum and Dr PK Pradhan, president of the forum. Pradhan said, “Nowhere in the country are people forced to work till 70 years.”“If doctors don’t retire, then new posts will not be created, new medical students will not get a chance for faculty jobs. The PGI Faculty Forum will request the state government to reconsider the proposal in the wider interest of public and future of young doctors. The forum will also call for implementation of rotary headship of each department so that all faculty members get administrative experience,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sgpgi-docs-oppose-proposal-to-increase-retirement-age-to-70-yrs-101633019974623.html
30-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to decide on lifting remaining Covid-19 restrictions after a week||With the Covid-19 cases on a declining trend in the state, the Maharashtra government is considering lifting the remaining restrictions after reviewing the situation after the first week of October. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Tuesday said state authorities will meet after October 8 and if the cases continue to decline, the government will lift the remaining restrictions that are still in force in the state.Barring a few districts, the daily caseload across the state is on a downward trend. The Covid-19 cases in September has seen a 46.64% decline from the previous month. The state has logged 85,980 cases in September. In August, the state had recorded 161,161 Covid-19 cases. In terms of fatalities, the state has registered a 61.21% drop. In August, Maharashtra had reported 4,522 fatalities due to Covid-19, which dropped to 1,754 in September.Pawar, while speaking to mediapersons on Thursday, said that “gradually” the situation is getting better and the state is looking at reopening all remaining restrictions in the state. The state government started its graded unlocking of restrictions since August.“We will have a meeting after October 8, in which, we will decide whether to allow other activities as well... The chief minister has decided to reopen all activities gradually, like theatres, etc, which were not allowed so far. We are taking stock of the situation and taking steps [to reopen] and if the situation keeps improving then definitely we will see a different picture in Maharashtra,” Pawar said.Last week, the state government announced reopening of schools and places of worship from October 4 and October 7, respectively. Later, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that the state will allow cinema halls, auditoriums to reopen from October 22. The state government, which is yet to issue guidelines for reopen theatres and cinema halls, is expected to allow it with 50% capacity and also keep it open only for double-vaccinated citizens.Senior officials said that the state will evaluate the situation after October first week to reopen the remaining activities that haven either partial or complete restrictions. Although the situation is improving, festive season is a concern, the official said. Activities such as religious, political, social gatherings are still not allowed in the state. Weddings and funerals are allowed only with limited number of people in venues at half the capacity. Officials said that relief in these activities could be given by mid-October in a graded manner.Pawar, however, cautioned people that although the state is seeing an overall downward trend in Covid cases, the people must continue to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and must ensure proper masking in public places. “Last year, we had experience that Covid-19 cases have increased after eight to 10 days after Ganpati festival. In the last state cabinet meeting, held on Tuesday, we saw the figures that showed a downward trend. However, people must continue to follow all Covid-19 protocol, including wearing masks. People do get lax in following basic Covid-appropriate behaviour. It is not only bad for the person, but it will also become a factor in increasing the spread. Everybody needs to take all precautions,” the deputy chief minister said.On Thursday, the state reported 3,063 fresh Covid-19 infections, taking the tally to 6,550,856. It reported 56 fatalities, pushing the death toll to 139,067. A day after crossing 500 cases on Wednesday, Mumbai reported 451 fresh Covid-19 infections in the city. It also reported seven fatalities, taking the toll to 16,110.Ahmednagar, Pune, Sindhudurg, Palghar, Nashik, Osmanabad, Sangli, Satara, and Ratnagiri districts continue to report a chunk of the daily cases in the state. The weekly positivity rate in these districts is higher than the state’s overall weekly ratio, state health department’s data showed. In the last 24 hours, the state tested 144,845 samples, and had a positivity rate of 2.11%. Overall, the state has tested 58,739,974 samples, while its overall positivity rate is 11.15%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-decide-on-lifting-remaining-covid-19-restrictions-after-a-week-101633019969883.html

30-09-2021||Mumbai||New species of eel discovered by Maha CM’s son||A new species of swamp eel was discovered from a well in Mumbai by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s younger son Tejas Thackeray and the team at Thackeray Wildlife Foundation. Found in a 40-feet deep well located on the premises of a blind school at Jogeshwari West, the eel is named Rakthamichthys Mumba– the Mumbai blind eel. It belongs to genus Rakthamicthys that is endemic to India.Besides Thackeray, scientists including Jayasimhan Praveenraj, Anil Mohapatra, Annam Pavan-Kumar collaborated in making this discovery. Thackeray’s younger son is a wildlife enthusiast and has been involved in discovering other species in the past, including of gecko, snake and crab.Unlike other species of its genus, the mumba lacks eyes, fins and scales, has jaws equal in forward extent, different gill aperture, crescentic-shaped cephalic. This is the first completely blind subterranean freshwater fish species to be described from Maharashtra and the Northern western Ghats. The species name ‘mumba’ refers to the locality in Mumbai. The word ‘mumba’ derives its roots from the Marathi language, which honours Mumba Aai, a deity worshipped by the inhabitants of this city.‘Rakthamichthys Mumba, a new species of Hypogean eel (Teleostei: Synbranchidae) from Mumbai, Maharashtra, India’ was published in September 2021 in Aqua International Journal of Ichthyology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-species-of-eel-discovered-by-maha-cm-s-son-101633019190746.html
30-09-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena leader Anandrao Adsul moves HC against ED||Shiv Sena leader and former MP Anandrao Adsul has moved the Bombay high court seeking relief against the Enforcement Directorate, which has been conducting raids at his residence and office in connection with a money laundering case wherein he is alleged to be the beneficiary of the misappropriated funds of City Cooperative Bank. The petition has sought quashing of the ECIR, the investigation report filed by ED in connection with the June 2020 FIR relating to fraudulent loans wherein Adsul was alleged to have been the beneficiary of loans worth ₹98 crore. The petition also seeks protection against the summons being issued by the ED and the possible arrest in the case. On Thursday, the petition was mentioned before a division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar. Advocate Abhinav Chandrachud appeared for Adsul and informed the bench that the ED had been questioning Adsul regarding the fraudulent loans and during the questioning his health had deteriorated and had to be admitted to a private hospital. In light of this, he sought protection. However, additional solicitor general Anil Singh for ED opposed the petition and informed the bench that Adsul was in good health and hence the petition should not be entertained. The court was also informed that Adsul had been shifted to another hospital as a precautionary measure. After the bench heard the submissions sought the health report of Adsul and posted hearing of the petition on Friday. The ED had gone to Adsul’s house on Monday and questioned him when his health had deteriorated after which his family moved him to a private hospital. Adsul had lodged a complaint in June 2020 pertaining to the alleged ₹980 crore worth financial irregularities in disbursement of loan funds and other financial transactions in the bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-leader-anandrao-adsul-moves-hc-against-ed-101633018771926.html
30-09-2021||Ranchi||Dhanbad judge death: We have got certain leads, CBI tells Ranchi HC||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) informed the Jharkhand High Court (HC) on Thursday that they have got “certain leads” in the Dhanbad judge death case, and they are investigating further on those lines, a lawyer participating in the proceedings said.Forty nine-year-old district judge Uttam Anand died on July 28 this year after he was run over by an auto-rickshaw when he was out for a morning walk in Dhanbad. The two occupants of the three-wheeler, Lakhan Verma and Rahul Verma, were later arrested. The CCTV footage from the location had showed that the three-wheeler swerved abruptly to hit the judge from behind. The Supreme Court and the Jharkhand HC had taken suo motu cognisance of the incident, with the HC directing the CBI to file probe status report every week. Last week, the central agency had informed the court that the district judge was “apparently hit intentionally”. However, the agency said that it was yet to get any concrete evidence to prove the case as that of murder.Appearing before a division bench of chief justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and justice Sujit Narayan Prasad on Thursday, the CBI said it is interrogating the accused afresh, said the aforementioned lawyer. Earlier on Tuesday, the CBI had again taken custody of the two arrested accused, who have been in judicial custody in Dhanbad central jail since they were arrested on July 29. They have already got scientific tests such as brain mapping and narcotics test conducted of the two accused. Bench unhappy with state govt reply on FSLThe bench, meanwhile, expressed unhappiness over the state government’s reply on modernising and upgradation of forensic science laboratories (FSL) in the state. The government, in its reply, had submitted that it would release funds for upgradation in six months. “The bench took exception to it and directed the state government to submit a detailed upgradation plan by next week and also directed the state home secretary and FSL director to be present in person during the hearing next week,” a lawyer involved in the proceedings said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/dhanbad-judge-death-we-have-got-certain-leads-cbi-tells-ranchi-hc-101633018350863.html

In September, at least 23 road accidents were registered so far while the highest number of accidents occurred in January, which saw 42 mishaps and 24 fatalities.Residents shared that the increasing number of flyovers and road expansion in the capital city has made transportation easy but they have also emerged as accidents spots due to reckless driving and poor traffic monitoring system.Meanwhile, the state transport department shared that several measures are being taken to achieve the set target of minimising road accidents by 50% by 2030.Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said, “The department has asked every district to identify highly sensitive stretches. After compilation of data, we would prepare action plans, including educating locals, engineering innervations and emergency care services, for bringing down accidents and fatalities.” “There are 115 black spots in the state mainly identified on national highways and state highways,” he added.“Flyovers have reduced travel time but there is no traffic regulation on them. Over speeding, reckless driving and craze among people for shooting photos and videos on flyovers are the major cause behind road accidents,” said Deepak Kumar, a school teacher near Bypass Road.As per transport officials, several safety measures have been adopted to minimise road accidents.“Intense helmet and seatbelt checking drive, encouragement to good Samaritans for helping accident victims have yielded positive results. The department has also established automated driving schools for proper training of drivers while other hi-tech projects are in pipeline, which will bring a significant decline in road mishaps in coming years”, said a senior official of the transport department. The transport department claimed an 8% fall in road accidents during January to June this year in comparison to the corresponding period in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-saw-over-300-road-mishaps-in-last-9-months-traffic-police-dept-101633018291746.html

As per 2018 tiger census, VTR had 31 tigers and eight cubs, of which three tigers have died.Speaking to reporters on Thursday on the occasion of “India for Tiger — A rally on wheels”, being organised by National Tiger Conservation Authority across the country, HK Rai, wildlife conservator and field director of VTR said, “The increase in grassland coverage and water holes has resulted in a sharp surge in the population of herbivores and carnivores in the VTR. Since tiger is at the apex of the biological pyramid, VTR could well be a home to close to 65 tigers or so, according to our assessment.”VTR is country’s 18th tiger reserve, declared in March 1994.Spread over an area of 900 square kilometres of forest area and divided into eight ranges, it has 22 water holes and grassland on eight per cent of the total forest area. Officials put the total number of bears between 400 and 450, leopards at 98 and gaur (indian bison) at 250-300.Earlier in the day, Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, BJP MP from West Champaran and the party’s Bihar unit president, flagged off a rally on wheels from Bettiah, the district headquarters, as part of NTCA’s plan to spread the message of biodiversity conservation under the ambit of Project Tiger and Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) programme of ministry of environment forest and climate change (MoEFCC). The rally on wheel from Bettiah would terminate at Palamau tiger reserve in Jharkhand after passing through over half a dozen districts of the two states, officials said.Forest officials here said rally on wheels is scheduled to be taken out from 42 of the existing 51 tiger reserves of the country which would cover a distance of over 7500 kilometres across the country and terminate at designated focal points of celebration after following assigned routes. “First nine tiger reserve designated during the inception of tiger project in 1973 have been made focal points of celebration. The rallies from 42 reserve would terminate at one of the first nine reserves between October 2 and October 8, 2021,” said Rai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vtr-can-accommodate-60-65-tigers-says-chief-101633017930695.html

The BMC has said navratri will be celebrated low key, on the lines of Ganesh festival, wherein organising garba is restricted and not more than five people will be allowed inside pandals. The BMC, in a circular, has appealed organisations to hold blood donation camps or create public awareness regarding vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue, instead of organising garba events. The BMC in a circular said, “Conducting any religious ritual of worship there should not be any kind of crowd gathered around the pandal. No distribution of ‘prasad, flowers has been allowed and so has the setting up of stalls around it been restricted.” “The organising of garba is restricted as that brings people in close contact with each other. There will also be no artificial immersion sites and all idols will be immersed in natural immersion sites only,” said deputy municipal commissioner Harshal Kale in the circular. The BMC has also restricted the height of the idol to 4 feet in case of public mandals and two feel for home like that during Ganesh festival. Meanwhile, during immersion and during bringing the idol, not more than 10 people will be allowed, who should be preferably fully vaccinated and not more than five people, in case of those taking the idol at home.

Maha home minister says lookout circular issued||Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil on Thursday said the state government or the investigative agencies are not aware of the whereabouts of former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who is accused in an alleged money laundering case.Speaking to the media on rumours that the former top cop has fled to Russia, Patil said a lookout circular has been issued after Singh failed to report before the investigative authorities despite multiple notices served to him, and the government is looking for him.“Along with the Union home ministry, we're also searching for his (Param Bir Singh) whereabouts. I've heard something like that but as a government officer, he can't go abroad without government clearance,” the Maharashtra home minister. “We've issued a Lookout Circular (LOC) and if he went away, then it is not good,” Patil added.Singh is wanted in an investigation into an allegation of corruption that he levelled against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, in which the former Mumbai Police claimed that the minister was involved in an extortion racket and asked police officials to collect money from bars and restaurant owners. He also named disgraced encounter specialist Sachin Waze in his complaint.Deshmukh resigned in April after the Bombay high court asked the Central Bureau of Investigation to carry out a preliminary enquiry.Earlier this month, a probe panel led by retired Bombay high court judge Justice Kailas Uttamchand Chandiwal issued a bailable warrant against Param Bir Singh after he failed to appear before the investigative authorities. The state government had formed the single-member commission to probe the allegations levelled by Singh. But, the former top cop moved the Bombay high court in August requesting it to disband the Chandiwal commission on the grounds that the issues referred to the commission were already adjudicated on by the Bombay HC and the Supreme Court and thus there was no need for the Chandiwal probe.Last week, the Bombay high court dismissed a petition filed by Singh for quashing the two preliminary inquiries against him by the state government.The Mumbai Police had in June lodged four FIRs against the former commissioner over alleged charges of extortion, cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy after a builder complained against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-ex-top-cop-in-russia-maha-home-minister-says-lookout-circular-issued-101633012063825.html
30-09-2021||Dehradun||Senior AAP leader and former state president’s son found dead at Dehradun hotel||Senior Aam Aadmi Party leader and former president of the state unit SS Kaler’s 24-year-old son was found dead in a hotel room in Dehradun on Friday, police said. Abhinay Chaudhary, in-charge of Rajpur Road police station said Sikander Kaler, the son of AAP leader SS Kaler was found dead at a hotel on Rajpur Road on Friday. “In the morning when he didn’t respond to the calls of his family members and the knocking on his hotel room door by the hotel staff went unanswered, the police was called. When we went there, we found him lying dead in the room,” he said. Chaudhary said that in the preliminary investigation it was been revealed that he had checked into the hotel on Thursday. “He had a transport-related business. On Thursday evening, he had gone out to drink with his friend. After returning, he entered his room and locked it from inside. It is likely he had drunk a lot as he had vomited a lot in the room, including on his own clothes,” he said. Chaudhary said the body had been sent for a post-mortem examination. “The exact cause of death will be known after the post mortem result is received. We have started an investigation into the matter. We are taking statements of the hotel staff,” he said. SS Kaler, the father of the deceased had resigned from the post of state president of the AAP Uttarakhand unit earlier this month. At that time, he had said that he was resigning from the post of state president as the party had decided that he would be contesting the assembly polls from Khatima, the home turf of Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/senior-aap-leader-and-former-state-president-s-son-found-dead-at-dehradun-hotel-101633016730446.html
30-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai schools in prep mode to welcome students back on campus on October 4||Classrooms and playgrounds across schools in Mumbai will be welcoming their students back to campus for the first time in more than 18 months. The recent decision of reopening schools for Class 8 to Class 12 students has invited mixed reactions from educational institutes as well as parents, but for the time being, schools are gearing up for October 4.While several schools and colleges have for some time now toyed with the idea of hybrid classrooms, many feel that the actual implementation of the hybrid model might be more difficult than it seems. “We plan to start classes in the hybrid mode starting Monday (October 4) but are still unclear how it will work out. We are expecting a teacher to conduct a split classroom, where they are expected to pay attention to students who are online as well as those present physically in a classroom. Practically, this option sounds difficult,” said Rupa Roy, principal of Balmohan Vidyamandir, Dadar.She added that as 70% of their staff is young, most teachers are yet to get their second vaccination dose. “It would be difficult for those not fully vaccinated to travel as not all live in the vicinity. Moreover, we hardly had any time in hand to implement all the measures as it was a sudden decision by the government. However, we have started taking consent from parents to send their children to school,” said Roy.While lectures are one part of the situation, many are unsure how their children will travel every day, as public transport is still not safe, especially for children. “We outsource school buses, and while we can maintain sanitisation within our premises, we cannot guarantee the same outside the school premises. We’ve requested parents to find alternative ways to travel to school,” said the principal of a school in Colaba.A group of 50 principals, part of Mumbai International Schools’ Association (MISA), got together on Thursday to discuss the future plan of action and unanimously agreed to first start physical classes in order to lend emotional support and ease students into eventual physical classes. “Most international schools are conducting their end-of-term exams currently, so we have decided to bring not more than 45-50% of the class strength back to campus for a session of non-academic activities and to lend emotional and mental support to those who have been personally affected by Covid-19,” said one of the participating principals, on the condition of anonymity.While physical classes will be for interaction among students and teachers, the academic work will still continue online, said the principal. “We will gauge the situation first by inviting students for non-academic activities and only once we are sure of the safety of staff and students will we start physical classes in a staggered manner,” added the principal.Jyotsna Mayadas, principal of Euro School, said, “We have set up a system wherein there will be a proper mechanism to check the temperature of staff and students. We have mask disposal provisions and are also leaving markings on the floor for students to follow social distancing. We have trained the staff to manage the isolation rooms in case anyone feels unwell.”Parent groups, have for some time now, not appreciated the efforts of the state government and local municipal corporation to restart physical classes, especially for school students, from the past few months. “Why is the most vulnerable section of the society being expected to start attending physical classes first? None of the students studying in Class 8 to Class 12 are vaccinated yet. So we suggest that the government delay this move for a few months,” said Anubha Sahai, president of Indiawide Parents’ Association.Maitreye Dutta, parent of a 14-year-old studying in Holy Family School, Ghatkopar, said, “Even if social distancing is followed within the school, staff and students come from different areas and use various modes of transport. Sending my daughter to school would be compromising her safety. I would prefer online classes instead.”Junior colleges unclear about rules Most city colleges have decided to call students in a staggered manner to first start practical classes only. “As a pilot, we will call our students who require practical classes, especially those who are struggling with understanding concepts in virtual classes. We’ve also sought consent of parents and plan to decide the next step based on what parents have to say. As some of our students as well as staff are still in their respective native towns, we will consider the time they will take to get back, and unless we are comfortable with this process, we will not start hybrid classrooms,” said Neha Jagtiani, (in-charge) principal, RD National College, Bandra.Most schools and colleges have already started sanitising their classrooms and common areas. Many plan to sanitise a classroom after a batch leaves and before a new batch arrives. “There’s no way of finding out how students will react to and follow Covid-19 protocols, including wearing masks and social distancing on campus. Once the practical sessions begin, we will understand how strict our rules need to be and accordingly then start bringing students back in a staggered manner,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal, KC College.Some await clear directions One of the major concerns for most junior colleges at present is travel, both for staff and students. “BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) circular specifically mentions schools, and unless we receive a circular from the office of the deputy director of education (DYDE), we can’t decide whether to start physical classes or not,” said Rajendra Shinde, principal of St Xavier’s College, Dhobi Talao.Most students are currently planning to travel by school buses to and from school, however, there is no standard operating procedure (SOP) announced for it yet. “We need compensation from the government for the losses we have faced and also as part of maintenance. Umpteen letters to the authorities have received no response. Moreover, there is no mention of school bus in the reopening protocols shared by various authorities. With the hike in diesel and petrol prices, we shall have to increase our fees by 30% as well,” said Anil Garg, president, School Bus Owners Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-schools-in-prep-mode-to-welcome-students-back-on-campus-on-october-4-101633016670301.html

He has demanded relief from potholes for the commuters. He stated that the concerned government agencies should follow the directives given by the High Court in 2015 regarding potholes.He also stated that when senior BJP Leaders visited some of these potholes, they realised that the material used was of inferior quality. In the PIL, More mentions that the government should take the filling of potholes and road repair work on a war footing basis and relieve the commuters of the hassles.“These potholes have caused traffic snarls in the city, inconveniencing many, making it difficult for ambulances as well to pass through,” added More in his PIL.

However, the state government also said that the existing restrictions in place to check the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases have been extended till October 30.In its latest circular, the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government said the existing restrictions on the movement of people and vehicles between 11pm and 5am will be relaxed for 10 days — from October 10 to October 20 — when the state celebrates Durga Puja. “In view of the ensuing festive period the said restriction relating to movement of people and vehicles between 11pm and 5am is relaxed during 10th October 2021 to 20th October 2021,” the government said in its order.However, on other days the night curfew would continue except for “health services, law and order, essential commodities including agricultural produce and other emergency services," the government announced.Also read | No Chhat puja at public places, river banks in Delhi: DDMAFurther, the state also stressed the need for wearing of face masks and maintaining physical distancing and other health and hygiene protocols at all times. It also said that work from home should be encouraged as much as possible. “Employers/ management bodies/ owners / supervisors of all offices, establishments and work places shall be responsible for provisioning of all COVID safety measures including regular sanitization of work places, vaccination of employees and for compliance of stated directives and COVID appropriate norms. Work from home must be encouraged as far as possible and practical,” the order said.Warning of legal action against any violations of the Covid-19 norms, the state also asked district administration, the police and the local authorities to ensure strict compliance of the rules.The new guidelines have been issued by the state as the existing Covid-19 rules are set to end on Thursday, according to an earlier order on September 15.The orders came even as the Centre directed the states to enforce adherence to Covid-related guidelines especially during the festive season."With the decline in the Covid-19 cases, there is a possibility that Covid Appropriate Behaviour (CAB) is not adhered to strictly, especially during the upcoming festivals. It is therefore critical to enforce adherence to guidelines which allows regular festivities in a cautious, safe and Covid-appropriate manner. Utmost vigil has to be maintained in respect of mass gathering events, so as to avoid any possibility of surge in Covid-19 cases. Consequently, large scale gatherings in fairs, festivals and religious events and functions may lead to afresh surge in Covid-19 cases in the country," the Union home ministry on Tuesday wrote to state chief secretaries.Meanwhile, 749 people tested positive for the disease on the day as the state’s total caseload reached 1,569,070, a bulletin from the state government showed. Also 15 people succumbed to their infection and the death toll climbed to 18,793. The state currently has 7,570 active cases of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-relaxes-night-curfew-during-durga-puja-extends-covid-19-norms-till-october-30-101633014213384.html
30-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai residents in home isolation more than double in a month||Over the past month, the number of citizens in home quarantine across Mumbai has more than doubled, according to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). At the same time, the bed availability in the city rose from 86% to 89% even as the city reported a minor spike in the number of cases being reported daily.According to protocol, those in home isolation are Covid-19 patients with mild or no symptoms or are high-risk and low-risk contacts. According to the data, in the last week of August, the city was reporting cases between 300 and 350 that has now gone up to 450-550 cases. The data revealed that on August 23, 31,382 citizens were under home quarantine, which has now gone up to 72,460 , as of September 28.Civic officials attributed the spike in the number of citizens under home quarantine to various factors — increase in contact tracing owing to fear of third wave followed by partially vaccinated citizens getting infected, but having mild symptoms due to which they are eligible for home quarantine. Lastly, the 14-days home quarantine rule for international passengers are some of the reasons for the doubling of the number of citizens in home isolation.Earlier, in the first week of September, the BMC had ruled that all international passengers must give a self-declaration form with an undertaking to undergo home quarantine for 14 days.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC, said, ‘We increased contact tracing to 1:20 from the 1:10, wherein we are tracing 20 people behind every positive case, which may have resulted in an increase in the number of citizens under home isolation. Also, another reason is quarantining incoming international passengers starting September.”According to BMC officials, many partially vaccinating citizens are also getting infected, but are not requiring hospitalisation due to mild symptoms. Out of the 9.2 million eligible adult population, close to 90% have got at least one dose. Prashant Gaikwad, assistant municipal commissioner of the BMC’s D ward, that covers areas like Malabar Hill, Chowpatty and Girgaon said, “In our ward, there was always high demand of home isolation considering there are citizens residing in big houses. In the case of slums and chawls, we are seeing almost no cases. However, in the past one month the number of home isolation cases has increased in our ward due to increased contact tracing.” Gaikwad added, “Also, another reason for increase in home isolation is that those infected are young and can manage symptoms at home. Earlier, those who were immuno-compromised got infected and hence there was huge demand for hospitals. But now we have vaccinated such citizens on priority.”Meanwhile, Dr Vasant Nagvekar, infectious disease consultant at Global Hospital, who is also a member of the state Covid-19 task-force, said, “ The reason why we are seeing more people under home isolation is because many those who are infected are young, say in the age group of 18 or 20 years. They are able to manage symptoms at home. The contact tracing has definitely increased along with it the 85% of the cases are having very mild symptoms due to maybe say at least one dose of vaccination. Alongside this, many people are also undergoing cocktail therapy, which has a shorter stay at hospitals leading to more bed availability. These are the factors resulting in fewer hospitalisations and more home isolations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/home-isolation-cases-in-mumbai-more-than-double-in-a-month-101633014997782.html
30-09-2021||Mumbai||Pandemic effect: Hybrid learning for students||Two teachers, including the head of the life sciences department at Churchgate’s KC College took a stroll through the Sagar Upvan Botanical Garden in Colaba last October as Covid engulfed the city. The garden was closed to public, but the professors were here on work. As they started to record their walkthrough using a smartphone, 300-odd students watched the livestream from their respective homes. “We had visited this garden as part of our first year syllabus and seen the various medicinal plants and trees there. So the virtual visit refreshed our memories,” said Aryaman Tulpule (21), a third year student who viewed the recording. The difference was that this time around, when they had a question, they could raise it immediately during the livestream – either their professor, or a staff of the garden present during the recording, answered it. Students from various departments of KC College, for instance, participated in virtual industrial visits, including the Embryology Academy for Research and Training (EART) in Dahisar through such virtual walkthroughs. “This year, we approached different companies and organisations to allow virtual tours. Surprisingly, everyone welcomed the move,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal of KC College. It has been well over a year since students set foot in their classroom. During this time, teaching media, tools, pedagogy and assessment—everything that defines a classroom has metamorphosed to bridge the physical gap between the student and the classroom. Many of these changes may well be permanent in nature. Bridging a gap Not all sciences lend themselves to virtual learning methods and physical experiments are necessary. “Final year students of Biology are supposed to know how to use a photospectometer to measure the amount of photons absorbed by plants. But because of the pandemic, they had to watch their instructors explain the apparatus during online lectures,” said Rajendra Shinde, principal, St Xavier’s College, Mumbai. But virtual labs allow students to simulate experiments, and serve as a useful study aid. Almost all major Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) have set up virtual labs under the Virtual Labs Initiative of government of India. Though the initiative has been around since 2012, it was brought it into the spotlight by the pandemic. Here’s how it works. The virtual lab offered by IIT Bombay, for instance, is a website that allows students to simulate an actual lab experiment on their device. For example, if a student is trying to verify the Beer-Lambert’s Law in molecular chemistry, they start by turning on a spectrophotometer. Students then pour the aqueous solution to measure into a beaker and place it on the experiment table (i.e they use their mouse to drag the beaker and place it on the experiment table). Using a micropipette, they draw small amounts of the solution and pour them as samples in conical flasks and cuvettes. They place these flasks and cuvettes in the spectrophotometer. Scan results pop up almost instantly on the computer screen. Kannan Moudgalya, professor and associate faculty at the Interdisciplinary Programme in Educational Technology, IIT Bombay, said, “We are continuously working on bettering the experience for students. Now, using the virtual lab a student can simulate a chemical experiment and take recordings. These tools are becoming increasingly popular in schools.” Part of the reason is that these tools make it easy to learn concepts: instructions have become multi-pronged and immediate, and students -- all digital natives -- are primed for it. Education technology (ed-tech) platforms have figured that out. According to one study released by a venture capitalist firm that invests in ed-tech startups, the market in India saw a nearly 200% increase in funding in 2020. Welcoming phones in classrooms “During lectures, while a concept was behind taught by the teacher, students would receive links to YouTube videos to see live demonstration of the subject matter. Similarly, we were also allowed to virtually perform experiments where one got real-time feel of how the experiment is conducted including handling of pipettes, chemicals, cultures etc; precautions were discussed and explained as well,” said Chitra Lahoti, a recently graduated student from the microbiology department of KC College, Churchgate. Teachers also shared quizzes with students to gauge how much of the concept was understood by students, Lahoti said. “We usually discourage students from using mobile phones in classrooms but in the online classes, I realised it helped to encourage students to use their mobiles to research for the trending new topic on Twitter, or check out the latest photo story uploaded by a famous photographer. I’ve decided to continue this teaching method even once physical classrooms commence,” said Lokesh Tardalkar, assistant professor, Mass Media & Film Making course, UPG College. During the pandemic, the institute started hybrid classes where a small number of students would attend college and the same lecture was [simultaneously made available online for those attending lecture from their respective homes, Tardalkar said. “For subjects like photography and cinematography… teachers have made use of videos and online content to explain concepts more creatively. Many teachers have started creating their own content which we plan to continue using in classrooms even once physical lectures commence,” said Anju Kapoor, principal of UPG College, Vile Parle. “Last year the pandemic was new and everyone was unaware of how long it’ll last, it was necessary to reduce the portion to give teachers and students ample time to complete the required portion and at the same time, also adjust to online learning,” said Vasant Kalpande, former chairman of state education board who was part of the committee to reduce the state board syllabus by 25% across all classes in the Maharashtra State Board for Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE). He said that the need of the hour is for the schools and teachers to focus on using technology better in classrooms and changing pedagogy. “With technology at their disposal, teachers can work wonders and ensure regular classrooms are filled with innovative methods to teach the same subject. However, most schools in the state are still using technology just to conduct lectures, and not to make their lectures interesting for students,” said Kalpande. An opportunity and challenge For ed-tech platforms, the hybrid model is a nod to the future. Cuemath, an ed-tech startup that provides online Math and coding classes for K-12 students, conducted physical classes before the pandemic. “As soon as the pandemic broke out, we trained all our instructors and brought them online. For us, our growth trajectory is going to be skewed towards more online,” said Mannan Khurma, founder, Cuemath. But this would mean developing a new kind of classroom ethics, he said: “Unless online classes are evolved into a very personalised monitoring, tracking and helping out students, the online format will not achieve its full potential.” Other challenges in the hybrid mode of education persist. The primary concern for schools is smartphone penetration. “Based on my own experience with students and my conversations with other educationists, I can say that hybrid education may not necessarily work, especially in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. First and foremost, unless teachers are trained en masse on how to use the latest technology, we won’t see a major revolution. Most teachers simply replicate what they would do in a physical classroom on a video call. Many are not aware of the latest tools. Then there is the question of infrastructure,” said Aniket Sule, associate professor, Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, Mumbai. “In rural Maharashtra, many families have a single device on which all their children are studying. Many students have fallen out of the education system because of this digital divide,” Sule added. Teachers also said that learning outcomes were difficult to measure online. “Learning outcomes and effectiveness are difficult to track. Effectiveness is a bigger problem with respect to K-12, given the amount of engagement and handholding involved. Test prep, upskilling, and reskilling startups would showcase a lower delta in terms of learning effectiveness between online and traditional channels,” said Pearl Agarwal, founder and managing director, Exemius Ventures, a venture capitalist firm which invests in ed-tech companies and in May, released an analysis of the COVID-19 induced growth of India’s ed-tech sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pandemic-effect-hybrid-learning-for-students-101633014693715.html

All evidence was removed. The state government should provide ₹2 crore financial assistance to the victim’s family. Our party will also provide ₹20 lakh to them,” said Yadav. Earlier, high voltage drama unfolded at Barra as the police took away Gupta’s family just before the SP chief’s arrival, said locals. They returned to the house only after SP workers protested. The Kanpur-based businessman had died on September 28 during a raid at a hotel room in Gorakhpur, following which six policemen were suspended.“The police, under the BJP rule, are taking lives than protecting them. The way cops have behaved in the last four and a half years is unprecedented.

According to the police, Archana Singh, a resident of Noida’s Sector 76, said that on September 22 she attended a meeting in Noida’s Sector 39. “Later, I went to Sector 116 to see the construction site where we are building a new house. I returned home in the evening and found my mobile phone missing. The mobile phone had two SIM cards and one of them was linked to my bank account,” she said. She visited the nearest police check post and the officers on duty asked her to file a complaint with the Sector 49 police. She said she filed a complaint at the police station the same evening. Singh said that she was confused after the loss of the mobile phone and could not immediately get the SIM cards blocked. “On September 23, I visited my bank and found that someone had fraudulently shopped online for ₹10.96 lakh from my bank account via three transactions,” she said.Singh then filed a complaint with the cyber cell. Baljeet Singh, inspector, cyber cell, Noida, said that the police swiftly investigated the matter and talked to the management of the e-commerce company where the perpetrator had shopped. “We managed to reverse the transaction worth ₹7.5 lakh and returned the money to Singh’s account. We are working to recover the remaining amount and also arrest the suspects involved in the fraud,” he said. The cyber cell directed the Sector 49 police to register a case in this regard. Vinod Kumar, station house officer, Sector 49 police station, said a case has been registered against unknown persons under Section 420 (cheating) and Section 66-D of IT Act. The inspector of the cyber cell said that from January to October 2021, Noida Police’s cyber cell investigated several cases and recovered ₹1.43 crore, and returned the money to the victims’ bank accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gzb-doctor-loses-mobile-phone-in-noida-gets-robbed-of-11-lakh-101633013550194.html

In Raigad, we have these birds coming in from the month of May to October at various places. One of the popular spots for the birds to migrate is Karnala Bird Sanctuary, wherein the forest officials had also shot a documentary,” Tatkare said. This tiniest migratory bird, only 13cm in length, visits the sanctuary every year for two-three months and attracts bird watchers in large numbers. “To spread more information on this bird and create awareness to save this species, a documentary titled ‘The Life Journey of a Forest Jewel’ was made by Maharashtra Forest Department. The documentary got nominated in the Natural History category among a hundred-plus wildlife movies from India and other countries in Nature in Focus, an International Film Festival of Bengaluru. The documentary finally bagged the fourth position,” a forest official said.“This bird is a breeding visitor here. Also known as ‘Flying Jewel’, the vibrant colours of the bird is the major attraction. They migrate to the places near the forest stream as they need fresh flowing water,” Nikhil Bhople, a wildlife expert and conservationist from Navi Mumbai, said. The bird builds its nest in the radius of one metre in the forest, near the streams and humus land. Known as ‘Tiboti Khandya’ in Marathi, it has black spots on forehead, blue and white colour on neck, dark blue and black colour on feathers. The neck is yellowish saffron, the beak is yellowish orange and the tail is orange pink of the bird. The legs of the bird seem to have three fingers and hence it is called ‘Tiboti’ (three fingers) in Marathi. According to district officials, there is no record maintained on the number of birds in the district as it is a migratory bird and is found here only for four months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/oriental-dwarf-kingfisher-given-pride-of-place-in-raigad-to-boost-tourism-101633012234416.html

Speaking to ANI, she said, "Madan Mitra, a TMC MLA, has purposely shut the voting machine here as he wants to capture the booth.""A man confessed to me that TMC paid him ₹500 to cast vote.

30-09-2021||Lucknow||Ayushman Bharat scheme: Patients in UP may soon get kidney transplant facility||LUCKNOW Poor patients enrolled for medical care under the Ayushman Bharat scheme may soon get financial assistance for kidney transplant and other major procedures, under the central government’s flagship scheme. “A recommendation has been sent to the National Health Authority (NHA) and soon facilities such as kidney transplant and cornea transplant will be available along with 1,500 other packages already available,” said Sangeeta Singh, CEO, State Agency for Comprehensive Health Insurance and Integrated Services (SACHIS), the nodal agency for Ayushman Bharat scheme in Uttar Pradesh. The state has 1.75 crore families (approximately over 8 crore individuals) covered under the scheme and 1.60 crore Ayushman cards have been made against a target of 6 crore. UP has 2,775 hospitals, including government and private, empanelled to give treatment under the scheme. “During the pandemic, a new category of infectious diseases, including mucormycosis, was added and there is a pre-existing unspecified package for providing treatment for diseases that are not included in the list of diseases,” said Singh at a function organised on Thursday to mark three years of the Ayushman Bharat scheme. Apart from kidney transplant, cornea transplant and a few terminal illness conditions have been recommended by Uttar Pradesh for inclusion in Ayushman Bharat scheme. “We inform the NHA when we get repeated requests for treatment of certain ailments that are not in the existing package,” said Singh. Doctors said transplant facility will be a major relief. “Kidney transplant facility under the Ayushman Bharat scheme will mean that the waiting list of hundreds of patients at government centres will be reduced. This because more options (hospitals) will then be available in private sector for poor patients,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors. A lesser known benefit of the Ayushman Bharat scheme is portability. This enables beneficiaries of Uttar Pradesh get treatment in other states’ empanelled hospitals in case they need hospital care. “So, if a resident beneficiary of UP takes ill in Madhya Pradesh, the person may contact an empanelled hospital there,” said Singh. According to statistics, 8,58,296 lakh beneficiaries have got treatment since the scheme started on September 23, 2018. Among them 43% (3,69,067) patients were females and the remaining 57% (4,89,229) males. “UP has an assurance model to take care of medical expenses up to a certain level unlike insurance services where they (insurance companies) deduct payment citing different reasons when a claim arises,” she said. In UP, 51000 eligible patients got treatment despite not having Ayushman cards made. This was possible as their names were on the list of beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ayushman-bharat-scheme-patients-in-up-may-soon-get-kidney-transplant-facility-101633009949745.html

30-09-2021||Chandigarh||Cinnamon cultivation introduced in Himachal||The CSIR’s institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT) has introduced cinnamon cultivation in Himachal Pradesh on pilot basis.If successful, it will be launched on a commercial scale, eventually cutting down India’s import of cinnamon that amounts to a whooping ₹909 crores per annum.The cultivation was launched on Wednesday with state agriculture minister Virender Kanwar planting the first sapling in Una district.Cinnamon, popularly known as dalchini, is an evergreen bushy tree whose bark is primarily used as a spice, said IHBT director Dr Sanjay Kumar.In addition to its culinary uses in Asian and European recipes, cinnamon has critical applications in medicine and in boosting immunity. The true cinnamon is derived from Cinnamomumverum.Cinnamomum cassia is yet another species used in place of true cinnamon, but has high coumarin content which is not good for health and the variety is banned in the United States of America, Ireland and the European Union.True cinnamon or Cinnamomumverum is grown mainly in Sri Lanka, while minor producing countries include Seychelles, Madagascar, and India, said Kumar, adding that India imports 45,318 tonnes of cinnamon annually from China, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Indonesia and Nepal.No organised cultivation in IndiaOf the total imports, 37,166 tonnes of C cassia are imported from Vietnam, China and Indonesia. There is no organised cultivation and processing of cinnamon in the country.“Realising the large import of cinnamon in the country and that the one imported in India is C cassia and not C verum, it was envisioned to extend its production after identifying the potential areas for cultivation,” said Kumar.Our data suggested, he said, districts of Una, Bilaspur, Kangra, Hamirpur and Sirmour in Himachal Pradesh that have potential areas for cinnamon cultivation.“Accordingly, we made efforts for introduction and processing of C verum in Himachal Pradesh. This project has been conceived by CSIR-IHBT and is being implemented in association with ICAR’s Indian Institute of Spice Research, Calicut, Kerala and Department of Agriculture, Himachal Pradesh,” said he.Earlier this year, the IHBT had successfully launched cultivation of monk fruit in Kullu of Himachal for the first time in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cinnamon-cultivation-introduced-in-himachal-101633008632348.html

The app, too, is in the process of being developed,” assistant municipal commissioner, Sanjay Kakade, said.The corporation has also planned to fine housing societies of ₹50,000 if they denied entry to the hotspot areas for dengue and malaria for investigation and preventive action.“The cooperation of housing societies and people is very important in the prevention of dengue and malaria and if any housing society denies us entry, it will be fined ₹50,000 and in repeated offence, an FIR too would be registered,” NMMC medical health officer, Dr Pramod Patil, said.Recently, the corporation had found breeding spots in the vicinity of a mall in Turbhe and at a car shed area in Sanpada. In both the places, there were suspected cases in its vicinity. “Every time a breeding spot is identified, it is eliminated and the people around are made aware of the consequences of such breeding spots and the measures to be taken to make sure that such breeding spots are not formed again,” Dr Patil said.Currently, Navi Mumbai has nine positive dengue cases. “In addition to the patients coming to the municipal health centre, the corporation also needs to know the total number of patients going to the private medical professionals. Hence, the health officials have been asked to keep a tab of all suspicious cases going to the private hospitals as well. The officials have also been asked to visit the hotspots for dengue and malaria,” NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said.The commissioner also directed the medical officers of the civic health centre to pay close attention to the preventive work being done by the contractor’s staff and to submit a daily report regarding the same. The commissioner also said that if the contractor or his workers are found to have committed negligence, punitive action will be taken against them and if no improvement is seen, strict action will be taken to cancel his contract and blacklist them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-civic-body-plans-to-map-mosquito-breeding-spots-to-prevent-dengue-from-spreading-101633007974256.html

While Kejriwal is trying to project the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as a serious contender in the Punjab legislative assembly elections which are due next year, SAD president ‘ridiculed’ that the AAP has to send a major leader from Delhi to promise better reforms and questioned if there is a ‘lack’ of local AAP leaders.“Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal announced his second guarantee today for Punjab. I find it ridiculous that he comes to Punjab and says that these are guarantees given by the Delhi chief minister. Is there no leader left in the AAP here, someone who can say that they're Punjabi, live in Punjab and it is their guarantee?” the former Punjab chief minister Badal said at a press conference.Kejriwal announced a set of measures related to the healthcare sector that his party would implement if voted to power in Punjab. “The condition in Punjab’s government hospitals is so bad that people are forced to go to private hospitals where they are looted. In the government hospitals of the state, people are facing problems with regard to medicines, availability of doctors and better equipment,” Kejriwal said.He said that people in Punjab will be given free and better treatment in government hospitals and the hospitals will also be brought at par with private hospitals. He also said that people incurring expenses on operations up to ₹10-15 lakh will also avail the services free of cost. He also said that citizens will receive a health card containing all health-related information of that particular individual and ‘Pind Clinics’, which are modelled after Delhi’s Mohalla Clinics, will be set up across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ridiculous-that-kejriwal-has-to-come-to-punjab-badal-takes-jibe-at-aap-101633006434451.html

We have served a show cause notice to them asking to explain why there was no effective waste management in their specific areas. We will wait for the explanation from the officials and based on that, action will be taken against the concerned officers,” said Kokre.On Monday, the residents of New Pinky Housing Society in Tisgaon Naka, which falls on the Pune Link Road , Kalyan (E), wrote to the KDMC asking it to take action against the waste dumped at the entrance of their building by the nearby slum dwellers.Dattatray Thorat, secretary of the society, said, “The entrance of the building is littered with waste dumped there on a regular basis and no action is taken by the civic body. The civic body is going garbage bin-free city. However, the spot where the residents used to dump waste in the bins for years continues to dump at the same place despite having no bin. There are garbage vans coming twice a day but they only stop at the main road as there is no way to reach the slum. Many people skip dumping into the vehicle and tend to dump it on the road during late evening hours.”Under the Smart City mission, KDMC has installed CCTVs across the city to keep a watch on waste management. Earlier, the civic body had levied a fine on the contractor for failing to lift the garbage on time. The officials are now under the watch for not doing their job on time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/show-cause-notice-to-19-kdmc-officials-for-not-picking-up-garbage-from-kalyan-roads-101633005271078.html

He also said that no important field postings be given to any tainted police officers and personnel.Yogi Adityanath issued these police-specific instructions at the Covid-19 review meeting. The CM’s statement came following the death of a Kanpur businessman at a hotel in his home district Gorakhpur. Manish Gupta, 36, died on Monday night after he was allegedly beaten up by some policemen, prompting the authorities to register a murder case against them. “Of late, there have been complaints of involvement of police officers, personnel in unauthorised activities. This is just not acceptable. The police department has no place for any such persons. Identify all such personnel, make a list along with the evidence against them and act against them as per the rules and regulations. Dismiss from the police services all such officers and personnel who are found involved in serious crimes. Do not post those with tainted images on any important field postings,” Yogi said, according to the statement issued by the chief minister’s office.

30-09-2021||Chandigarh||Pompous pamphlets and their many practical uses||As I picked up the Sunday newspaper on a dewy morning, a cascade of pamphlets slithered out. Two-toned, multi-coloured, matte and glossy, the eye-catching elves demanded attention as I gathered them and skimmed through the content. Aesthetically designed, full of pomposity, these may broadly be put into three categories: First, the academic oriented that included school/college/coaching institute advertisements or the super/multi-speciality hospitals; second, the market-oriented ones, including offers from grocery stores, supermarkets, salons, parlours; and third, the shady ones, including quacks and healers of varied kinds. The bright pamphlets catch immediate attention, and these are generally institutional ones. A hackneyed language runs through them: Qualified faculty, congenial atmosphere, spacious playgrounds etc or there will be a page full of photos of toppers and achievers. The coaching institutes lure you with their promises as if one only needs to enrol and a lucrative future would unfold. The ones of hospitals promise what not with the names of doctors followed by a string of abbreviations, accentuating their status. At times, I wonder if I should grab an offer of multiple tests just on merit of being pocket-friendly? The foodie in me finds it hard to resist the jingling offers accompanying photos of delectable, luscious dishes. I always succumb to the ‘buy one get one free’ or ‘combo’ offers. Similarly, the shopaholic in me blatantly gives in to multiple offers, the glossy sales announcement and the reduction offers. It’s difficult to control the urge to forget morning household chores and rush to shop lest the best bargains are taken up. The freebies are the hardest to combat. I may not savour a particular item/brand, but the free container is simply irresistible. Similarly, where a meagre service would suffice, one tends to splurge for the ‘savings offer’. The shady black and white dubious pamphlets trouble me the most. Visiting healers and ‘godmen’, the least said the better. Monday here, Tuesday there. How many gullible fall prey! History is witness that pamphlets came into existence with the invention of printing. In the 16th century, they were widely distributed to garner support for religious doctrines. They were used for romantic fiction and social criticism in the Elizabethan age. As political weapons, they garnered a powerful influence. This formative function was put in use during the recent farmers’ agitation when point-wise policy matters were circulated through newspapers. Not to digress, over the years, pamphlets have been used as agents of publicity. As a publicist genre, the pamphlet, “is designed to influence public opinion directly and is characterised by pungent aphorisms, rhetorical intonations, vivid epithets, and expressiveness”. Nevertheless, in our family, they are called ‘causality warriors’ and are strategically saved under the mattress. They can be pulled out in a jiffy to mop an accidental spit/sneeze droplet or for an emergency throw-up when kiddos gobble too many goodies or even as wrappers to dispose of. My mom prefers them over kitchen napkins to drain excessive oil as they are excellent absorbents. I love using the bright, glossy ones as placemats. They not only look attractive but can be easily replaced and also give a sense of utilising than discarding. And I’m comforted in doing my bit towards conservation. kalrasuruchi@yahoo.com The writer teaches English at Hindu Girls College, Jagadhri||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pompous-pamphlets-and-their-many-practical-uses-101633004129504.html
30-09-2021||Mumbai||Ulhasnagar NGO comes to rescue of 58 students who lost one or both parents to Covid||Meera Jodgand, 35, a mother of three girls, lost her husband to Covid in April this year. She was clueless until recently as to how to fund for education of her three daughters, aged 14, 13 and 11 years. Even though she works in a private firm, her income alone would not be sufficient to educate them.Jodgand, a resident of Mharal near Ulhasnagar, said, “The Soham Foundation in Ulhasnagar came to my rescue. They approached me and assured me to provide monetary help to fund the education of my daughters. They provided money to pay their school fees. The help came as a major relief for us.”The foundation has, so far, helped 58 such students with their school or college fees after one or both parents died due to Covid.In a programme held recently at the Maharashtra Mitra Mandal School, Ulhasnagar, the financial help was given to the students.Shreya G, a 21-year-old resident of Bengaluru, said, “Through my friend, I came to know about this initiative and we approached the Foundation. They helped me with ₹2 lakh for my 15-year-old brother’s education. My mother, who was a teacher, passed away due to Covid. My father, who is a heart patient, is not earning much. I completed my graduation but things were very difficult after my mother’s demise.“The Foundation paid the fees to my brother’s institution. We had missed several deadlines for paying the fees and this help came as blessing to us.” In May, Soham Foundation posted a message on the social media to collect information of such students who have lost their parents during the pandemic. Through the post, they received several inquiries and finalised 58 students from Ulhasnagar, Kalyan, Mumbai and different parts of Maharashtra and Bengaluru.“We learnt that there are several such students who are unable to continue with their education after the demise of their parents. We managed to raise the funds and then finalised the students,” said Rajendra Dethe, founder of Soham Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ulhasnagar-ngo-comes-to-rescue-of-58-students-who-lost-one-or-both-parents-to-covid-101633003889444.html

We have renovated Gandhi Mandir structure and will set up a Gandhian study centre and archives there to attract tourists as well as researchers”, said Arvind Gaur, Nainital tourism officer.Gaur said Mahatma Gandhi visited Takula village in 1929 and 1932 and stayed there for three and ten days, respectively.“Mahatma Gandhi was to address a public rally in Nainital but Britishers stopped him 3 km from the venue and didn’t let him proceed. In such a situation, local people arranged his stay at Takula village for three days. He not only addressed a rally at Takula but also laid the foundation stone for a temple and it was known as ‘Gandhi Mandir,” he said.Gandhi returned to the village in 1932 along with Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant, Jamnalal Bajaj, when the construction of the temple was completed and stayed there for 10 days. Local villagers used to organise programmes on national festivals but this monument failed to attract tourists”, said Gaur.Last year, the tourism department took initiative and renovated the dilapidated Gandhi Mandir structure under the heritage circuit scheme for ₹1.96 crore through Asian Development Bank funding.Gaur said after renovation, the tourism department decided to turn it into a Gandhian study centre and archive. “With a ₹77 lakh budget, we will arrange Gandhi-related books in multiple languages, furniture for fifty visitors and other historical items related to the Mahatma’s life and teachings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/nainitals-gandhi-mandir-to-be-developed-as-gandhian-study-centre-101633001969300.html

30-09-2021||Pune||Taste of Life: Food for thought... business, caste and taste, all in this serving||It’s been almost 25 years since I had my first meal cooked by Chavan mami. She ran a khanaval in a two-room apartment in the famous Khandke chawl in Dadar. Most of her clients were students from my college. They knew where to head to after they could no longer endure the food served in the college mess. Mami was always smiling, and she never counted the rotis her customers, mostly young men with enormous appetites, ate. The chicken curry she cooked on Fridays and Sundays was loved by all.Mami’s husband was 70 and diabetic. He used to work in a mill in Parel and was forced to sit at home after he lost his right foot several years ago. Since Mami found him useless in the kitchen, he would often sit with the diners and regaled them with stories that had local goons and famous gangsters, cricketers, politicians, and union leaders as heroes.Mami’s father-in-law had come to Mumbai to earn a living in the last decade of the 19th century with his wife and a toddler from a village in Konkan. Proletarian Mumbai had then been flourishing in Parel. The textile mills always needed workers, and migrants from Konkan and Marathwada regions ensured a steady supply. They worked together in the mills and lived together in newly constructed chawls nearby. When it came to food, caste decided who cooked for whom, and who ate with whom.Most of the workers would come to Mumbai without their wives. When they moved to Mumbai to earn a livelihood, they carried with them the deep-rooted ills of the caste system. They would mostly eat in khanavals owned by men or women of their own castes. A person risked “pollution” if he accepted food from the hands of people of so-called “lower castes” than his own. Eating in a khanaval ran by a person of “higher caste” was sometimes allowed. There were separate seating arrangements for customers of the so-called “lower castes”. They were supposed to eat in separate utensils, too.As the number of workers increased, khanavals prospered too, but not all could afford to eat in a khanaval. An ingenious system emerged for such people. Families looking for extra income welcomed workers who did not wish to eat in khanavals, to their homes. Each family would take two to three diners at the max. The diners would eat whatever was cooked for the family and paid a fixed amount for the food each month. The monthly charges would be typically 25% less than what they would pay in a khanaval. The women of the families offering food did not mind cooking for a couple of people extra every day since the arrangement was extremely profitable.The customers not only saved money but also did not worry about dining with people from “lower castes”. There would always be rumours about food being cooked in a khanaval by someone from a “lower caste”, or a diner lying about his caste to gain entry into a khanaval. This deep-rooted mistrust involving food followed everyone everywhere. The families offering food would always know the caste of their customers because admission was strictly based on references provided. This eliminated the risk of “pollution”.Since some khanavals were “strictly vegetarian”, thus bolstering the notion of “purity” associated with caste, customers had a choice of selecting families which served non-vegetarian food.Mami’s mother-in-law too fed a couple of workers from their village in Konkan all through her life. This institution and the arrangement have unfortunately not been documented properly to date. It finds a fleeting mention in the Marathi novel “Godu Gokhale”, written by BV Varerkar, in 1932. A friend of the protagonist Godu dines at her neighbour’s house with her husband because she has no time to cook, and wants to save money.I had often wondered if this system existed in Pune too. There were families who fed students daily, but that arrangement did not involve any monetary transactions. Since Pune did not have a vast proletariat population, and the caste system dominated and controlled by the “upper castes” being rigid, it was highly unlikely that such a system would exist in the city. While documenting khanavals from the 19th and 20th centuries, I had never come across families who offered food to only two or three people for money. Until, Induaji Nalawade introduced me to Tarabai Mahadik.Nalawade claimed to be 104-years old when I met her five years ago. She sold flowers outside the Kasba Ganpati Temple. Talking to her was delightful. Her memory was razor-sharp, as was her wit. She knew Pune like the back of her hand, and would always answer my questions in detail.Mahadik was her distant relative who lived in Ganesh peth in Pune. She had come to Pune from a village in Satara district in 1930 at the age of ten, after being married to a vegetable vendor. Mahadik had 14 members in her family, who lived in a three-room block in a dilapidated wada. Her husband and his elder brother were the only earning members of the family. Mahadik started working at the age of 15 after giving birth to a boy. She was employed to wash utensils in a nearby khanaval.Two years, and another baby later, one of her neighbours asked her if she would cook for a friend of his who worked at the Ammunition Factory in Khadkee. Her husband agreed. Since Mahadik would not go to his place and cook, the gentleman started having his dinner at Mahadik’s house.Mahadik would cook for the entire family, and the guest, while her husband served food to him in the living room. She soon had two more customers. Mahadik continued this till the 1980s, after which her family forced her to retire.Mahadik never spoke to her customers. She never ventured into the living room while they had their dinner. They all belonged to her caste.Maintaining caste integrity was, and unfortunately still is, greatly dependent on who cooked or handled the food. It also depended on who you dined with. What you ate decided your social status, your economic worth, whom you marry, and where you live. Women like Chavan mami’s mother-in-law, and Tarabai Mahadik, earned for their families and maintained the “sanctity of the caste system”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-food-for-thought-business-caste-and-taste-all-in-this-serving-101632999519650.html

The group wrote to the Uttar Pradesh Fire Service and demanded the facilities for the city's 7X area where lakhs of people reside in hundreds of highrise apartment towers.In a letter addressed to Uttar Pradesh's director general of fire services Anand Kumar, the group brought to his notice various fire safety-related issues, including the lack of a fire station in Noida's 7X area, comprising housing societies in sectors 74 to 79.The letter, penned by the Progressive Community Foundation (PCF), also reminded the top officer of his online meeting with residents of Noida in June last year that he had held to review the fire safety situation in housing societies."There was a lot of discussion on the topics and problems related to group housing societies, but even after one year, nothing has been done on most of these topics except fire inspection," the PCF wrote in the letter sent earlier this week.Emphasising on the lack of a fire station in the area, the group requested the officer to at least set up one unit to cater to over 50,000 flats in the area."In Noida, there is no fire tender system which can access above the 12th floor of a tower.

Also read: Amarinder Singh meets NSA Ajit Doval day after talks with Amit ShahSidhu, who had sent his resignation as state unit chief to Congress president Sonia Gandhi two days ago, said that he will reach Punjab Bhawan in Chandigarh for any discussions. “The chief minister has invited me for talks…will reciprocate by reaching Punjab Bhawan, Chandigarh, at 3pm today, he is welcome for any discussions,” he tweeted a day after putting out a video to raise questions over key appointments by the chief minister. Channi battles first major political crisis as CMBattling his first major political crisis created by Sidhu’s resignation just 10 days after he took over as the chief minister, Channi struck a conciliatory note on Wednesday and offered to sit down and iron out differences. “Whoever is party president is head of the family. I had told him (Sidhu) that the party is supreme, and the government follows its ideology. I spoke to him over phone and told him to come, sit and talk to resolve issues,” Channi said on grievances voiced by Sidhu in his four-and-a-half-minute video message. The cricketer-turned-politician’s abrupt resignation on Tuesday, barely 72 days after he was appointed the state unit chief, has pushed the Congress into a fresh crisis in poll-bound Punjab before it could recover from months of turmoil due to a bitter tussle between Sidhu and his bête noire, former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. Sidhu is peeved at not having his way in the cabinet appointments and other key official picks as those recommended by him for the post of AG and DGP got overlooked. The induction of former minister Rana Gurjit Singh into the cabinet is also learnt to have upset him. Before his meeting with the chief minister, Sidhu posted another tweet, taking a dig at Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota’s appointment as the Punjab Police chief. “DGP IPS Sahota was head f the SIT investigating the Beadbi case under the Badal government, he wrongfully indicted two Sikh youth for sacrilege and gave a clean chit to the Badals. In 2018, I along with INC (Congress) ministers, then PCCC Pres and present home minister assured them of our support in the fight for justice,” he tweeted, making public his displeasure over the appointment.

Put an end to attempts to undermine the authority of the CM time and again.

Tough stand against transport mafia With elections four months away, Warring, who has taken a tough stand against the transport mafia, is looking to promote STUs, such as PRTC, Punbus and Punjab Roadways, which are running in loss at present. Nearly, 8,200 contractual and outsourced roadways employees have been protesting in support of their demand to regularise their services and want more than 1,000 new buses introduced in the STUs. Warring has been critical of the private bus services, particularly those run by high-profile politicians in Punjab. Even during his election speeches in the 2017 assembly elections and 2019 general election, he demanded the Punjab government act against the transport mafia so that public transport network can be strengthened. Increase frequency during peak hours: Commuter The few passengers on board the bus from Rajpura to Patiala were surprised to find the minister amid them and warmly interacted with Warring, while his security personnel accompanied him throughout the journey. Ajaydeep Singh, who travels from Patiala to Chandigarh on daily, said the government should add buses in the PRTC fleet and increase the frequency, particularly in the morning and evening, for the convenience of commuters. “Due to the rush of passengers during peak office hours, people have to wait longer to board a bus and get a seat,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pollbound-punjab-s-new-transport-minister-takes-bus-route-to-reach-out-101632984507945.html

Other demands raised by the outfit include a law guaranteeing minimum support price (MSP) for 23 crops, implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report, full waiver of farmers’ debt, and government jobs and a financial compensation of ₹5 lakh each to the families of farmers who lost their lives while protesting against the farm laws on the outskirts of Delhi.Also Read | KMSC announces ‘rail roko’ stir in Punjab from Sept 30On September 19, the KMSC had announced its plan to organise this rail blockade. “We have planned to hold protests outside deputy commissioner offices in Punjab from September 28. If our demands are not met by then, we will be forced to protest on the railway tracks from September 30,” Satnam Singh Pannu, who heads its Punjab unit, had said, also extending support to the Bharat Bandh, which took place on Monday.This is not for the first time when the KMSC will hold a “rail roko” against the farm laws. Previously, its members blocked the Amritsar-Delhi and Tarn Taran-Ferozepur railway tracks for 169 days, from September 2020 till March this year.On Delhi borders, protests against these laws have been going on since last November. While the central government has described the legislation as a “major agriculture reform,” farmers believe that it will do away with the MSP, thus leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre’s repeated assurance that the support price will not cease to exist has failed to convince the farmers, who want the laws to be withdrawn, a demand rejected by the government.Total 11 rounds of talks have failed to resolve the impasse between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kmscs-rail-roko-agitation-against-farm-laws-from-today-101632960531950.html
30-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The Jurassic Netflix||When icons fall out of use, what shall we turn them into?Named after a centuries-old ruin, the iconic Siri Fort Auditorium is lying in ruins, metaphorically speaking. This afternoon, most gates are locked. Entry is forbidden without a prior appointment. An empty water tank is lying forlorn in the middle of a driveway.Opened in 1982, Siri Fort Auditorium in south Delhi used to be our window to the world cinema. It hosted the international film festivals. The history-minded millennials might decipher the landmark as a kind of ancient Netflix site, the only place then in the city where one could get the chance to experience globally renowned movies (Priya Cinema in Basant Lok screened only the American blockbusters). Desperate cinema fanatics would scheme and plot to get passes for the festival, an impossibility if a film was lucky enough to be tainted with even a whiff of sensational controversy. Indeed, memorialising the subculture of Capital’s film festivals in one of her Hindustan Times columns, critic Anupama Chopra recalls “the madness around the Maya Memsaab screening in 1993—it felt like Siri Fort might collapse under the weight of the rushing crowds.”Today, Siri Fort has fallen as subdued as a cemetery (though some offices inside are open). It hasn’t hosted a single screening, or any other event, since the pandemic—a staffer confirms. One wonders if the auditorium can ever regain its exclusivity. Why would you any longer brave the traffic to Siri Fort to watch an Iranian art house hit when it is so easy to curate personalised international film fest on your mobile phone screen.This sunny afternoon, despite its gleaming white facade and clipped lawns, the sprawling complex feels deserted. The pavement outside is littered with rotting leaves. The fences are barely holding onto signages of the past—“Eatables, drinks, helmets, briefcases and cameras not allowed inside the auditorium.” A faded blue board explains that Gate 1 is for VIPs/Stars/ Artists and Gate 2 is for the rest. (A hawker is lying flat in front of this board, her eyes closed. She must be asleep.)One winter evening, Siri Fort Auditorium was packed with a great number of people. Author Dan Brown, of the best selling Da Vinci Code, was to give a lecture on ‘Codes, Science and Religion’. As the celebrity novelist appeared on the stage, the entire auditorium 1 (full capacity: 1,865 seats) broke into a thundering applause. The year was 2014. That evening now looks as far removed as 1914.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-jurassic-netflix-101632960585718.html
30-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi Cantt rape case: Cops to file extra charge sheet by Oct 15, court told||The Delhi Police on Wednesday informed a local court that it is likely to file a supplementary charge sheet by October 15 in the alleged gang rape and murder of a nine-year-old Dalit girl at a crematorium near Delhi Cantonment on August 1.The investigating officer (IO) in the case informed additional sessions judge Ashutosh Kumar that forensic reports were likely to arrive by October 15 upon which the supplementary charge sheet will be filed. The judge directed the director of Rohini FSL (forensic science laboratory) to expedite the process and posted the matter for hearing on October 21.The girl who lived in a nearby village was found dead by her parents at the crematorium, triggering protests by activists and politicians in the Capital.Police filed a charge sheet on August 28, formally accusing four people—Radhey Shyam (a priest who worked at the crematorium), Kuldeep Singh, Salim Ahmed and Laxmi Narayan—for rape, wrongful confinement, murder, destruction of evidence under Indian Penal Code sections, and under POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989.The judge took cognisance of the charge sheet on September 9 and asked the accused to appear before it on September 29.On Wednesday, they were produced through video conferencing from jail where they are incarcerated pending trial. The victim’s parents were present in the courtroom with their counsel from the Delhi State Legal Services Authority.During the proceedings, the judge was informed that the previous IO Richhpal Singh has been replaced by Mayank Bansal, who was also present in the court.Meanwhile, the court sought the IO’s reply on an application by Radhey Shyam through his counsel LK Verma, seeking the preservation of CCTV footage of the crime scene on the day of the incident and the day after—August 1 and 2 — saying that it would add to a fair trial.The accused had also applied for protection, claiming that they faced a threat to life in prison and were beaten up in a police van while being brought to court. The court dismissed it after the jail authorities submitted that they were completely safe in prison.“It is not possible to provide a separate van for their court production. However, directions have been given to all the officials to ensure their safety during court production and in jail,” the judge said.During the hearing, Laxmi Narayan’s counsel claimed that a case of murder was not made out against his client and there was a delay of 10 hours in the registration of the FIR. He also said that the girl was cremated only after her mother had given her consent and signed the crematorium register.However, the judge said that they should wait for the FSL reports. He also said that there were extra-judicial confessions and even the victim’s mother had said that all the accused together burnt her daughter.Police said in their chargesheet that Radhey Shyam and Kuldeep Singh made extra-judicial confessions to two witnesses when the public had barged into the Shamshan Ghat, nabbed the accused, asked them questions about the pyre on which the girl was allegedly cremated.“How can you say it now that such a case is not made out against the accused? There are extra-judicial confessions. An extra-judicial confession is admissible although it is a weak piece of evidence,” the court said. The police earlier told the court that the girl died due to “suffocation” while she was being sexually assaulted, but the accused tried to dress up the crime scene to show that she died of electrocution while fetching water from a cooler. For this, they even threw water on the body. The court will now hear arguments on the framing of charges against the accused on October 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cantt-rape-case-cops-to-file-extra-charge-sheet-by-oct-15-court-told-101632959100755.html

Chairing his first meeting with the officials as minister, Warring said encroachments at the bus stands not only inconvenienced people but were also causing a huge loss to the state exchequer. “This needs to be checked at the earliest. Every encroachment — whether big or small — has to be removed or strict action will be taken,” he added. The minister also asked the general managers to make efforts for enhancing revenue of the department. “Officials indulging in fraudulent activities will not be spared at any cost. Ensure speedy recovery of arrears from willful defaulting transporters. Also, due taxes must be collected from the transporters and anyone who defaults should be dealt with sternly,” he added. He called upon the employees to perform their duties fearlessly and meticulously as per the laid down policy. Warring also asked them to ensure checking of government and private buses. Proper cleanliness should be ensured at the bus stands and that general managers will be responsible for the upkeep of buses under their jurisdiction, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/free-all-bus-stands-of-encroachments-in-punjab-transport-minister-warring-tells-officials-101632948924350.html

The Akali leaders, including Prem Singh Chandumajra, Bikram Singh Majithia, Daljit Singh Cheema and NK Sharma besides Sukhbir, were taken to the Mataur police station but were later released on submitting bail bonds. Earlier, they staged a dharna at the border of Chandigarh where they were stopped. The representatives of the Road Sangarsh Committee seeking higher compensation for 25,000 acres of land acquired under the road project in 19 districts also joined the protest. Sukhbir said, “The Congress government in Punjab was not accepting the demand of nearly 2 lakh farmers for fair compensation. The farmers have been duped by the government by offering a compensation of ₹30-70 lakh per acre against the market value of ₹2-3 crore.” On the other hand, the Akali government gave compensation to the tune of crores of rupees to farmers, he claimed. “Besides, tubewells were dug up free of cost and registration of land they purchased elsewhere was done free of cost,” he added. Claiming contradictions in CM Charanjit Singh Channi’s statement that anyone linked with the mafia should not approach him, Sukhbir said he had inducted tainted MLAs, including one accused of rape and another named in a murder case, in his cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/protest-over-land-compensation-sukhbir-badal-other-akali-leaders-marching-to-cm-s-residence-detained-in-mohali-101632948325945.html

Seeking their support of the industry to the party in the forthcoming assembly elections, the AAP chief said, “You have already voted for other parties over the years and seen the outcome. Give us an opportunity and you will forget all other parties,” he said. Kejriwal said the the five-point agenda included peaceful atmosphere with law and order, an effective mechanism wherein the industry representatives get to decide what is needed to be implemented, an end to ‘inspector raj’ and corruption, a 24-hour helpline for industrialists and cheap electricity round the clock. The AAP leader, who addressed nearly 200-odd traders said just like Arjuna of the Mahabharata he wanted the business fraternity in the state to be on his side. “Unlike other parties, I do not want your money. I want you,” he said. Pankaj Sharma, general secretary, Chamber of Commercial and Industrial Undertakings (CICU) who attended the meeting, said, “We were hoping that Kejriwal will announce tax reforms which will benefit the industry, but nothing of that sort happened. Even electricity rebates promised are not enough as the power tariff for industry in Punjab is almost same as that of industry in Delhi,” said. Delhi CM’s security breached, inquiry ordered Ludhiana police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar marked an inquiry into an incident of security breach when Kejriwal’s car was about to enter Hotel Park Plaza at around 4pm.

Newly inducted cabinet ministers Pargat Singh and Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, who had visited Sidhu a day before, met him again on Wednesday morning before leaving for Chandigarh to attend a cabinet meeting. Sidhu reportedly told them that he won’t budge and they should not insist for a patch-up. Later, he posted a video on social media, claiming that he was fighting for issues, and not for his personal gain. The Congress high command had on Tuesday rejected his resignation. Congress MLA Fatehjung Singh Bajwa, who had previously sided with former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh during his turf war with Sidhu, also met the Punjab Congress chief along with fellow legislator Balwinder Singh Laddi. Also, MLA Surjit Singh Dhiman, who was miffed over being not being given a cabinet berth, had a marathon meeting with Sidhu. MLAs Inderbir Singh Bolaria and Satkar Kaur along with state Congress working president Sukhwinder Danny also held a spate meeting with the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president. Dhiman, Danny and Bolaria had visited the PPCC chief on Tuesday as well. “Sidhu has decided not to budge under any pressure and fight for the issues flagged by all, including CM Charanjit Singh Channi, during a meeting with the Congress high command. How can they make appointments of people who worked against the promises made by the Congress?” a key aide of the former cricketer questioned. The appointment of APS Deol as advocate general only added fuel to fire as Sidhu was already upset with giving charge of the director general of police (DGP) to IPS Sahota, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-congress-crisis-frantic-mediation-on-as-ministers-mlas-reach-out-to-navjot-sidhu-101632947604775.html
30-09-2021||Chandigarh||Government in Punjab reduced to ‘tamasha’, people feeling helpless: Arvind Kejriwal||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said that government in Punjab had unfortunately been reduced to a ‘tamasha’ and the people of the state were feeling helpless. Kejriwal, who landed at the Chandigarh international airport in the afternoon for his Punjab visit, said, “It is nothing but greed for power and chair. People do not know where to go. I request them to wait for just three months as we will give them a stable government.The AAP chief congratulated Charanjit Singh Channi on his elevation as chief minister and asked him to act against the tainted ministers, MLAs and officers inducted in his cabinet. “I urge him to fulfill all the promises made by his predecessor Captain Amarinder Singh before the 2017 polls. People of Punjab are looking at five things. First, they want removal of tainted ministers and officers with an immediate effect. Second, they are unhappy over inaction in the 2015 sacrilege cases even as everyone knows who was the mastermind behind those incidents. Then, there is the issue of unemployment allowance which the state government has not given in the past four-and-a-half years. Also, the waiver of farm loans must be expedited,” he said. Whether this was achievable, the AAP supremo said, “It’s still four months to go the polls. We had a government for only 49 days in Delhi when we first came to power. In those 49 days, we slashed electricity bills by half and provided water for free. Besides, we finished corruption in Delhi. If we can do these things in 49 days, then CM Channi should be able to do the same in four months.”On the issue of the chief ministerial face in Punjab, Kejriwal said the party will soon make an announcement in this regard and “you will be proud of that person”.Among those present on the occasion were AAP Punjab president Bhagwant Mann, party’s state affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha, MLAs Kultar Singh Sandhwan, Amarjit Singh Sandoa, Baljinder Pal Kaur, Aman Arora and Meet Hayer.Later, Kejriwal left for Ludhiana to meet industrialists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/government-in-punjab-reduced-to-tamasha-people-feeling-helpless-arvind-kejriwal-101632947304981.html

30-09-2021||Chandigarh||Appointments of 2 officers at the centre of Punjab Congress crisis||The appointments of Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota as the director general of police (DGP) and APS Deol as the advocate general (AG) were the final straw leading to the resignation of Navjot Singh Sidhu as the Punjab Congress president. In both the appointments, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi straightway ignored Sidhu’s choices. For the advocate general’s post, Sidhu’s first choice was senior lawyer DS Patwalia, who had defended the former cricketer in a 1988 road rage case. A day after Channi took oath as CM, Sidhu even met Patwalia and promised him the state’s top law officer’s job, it is learnt. But a section of lawyers told Channi that the Patwalia family had close links with the BJP as his elder brother Paramjit Singh Patwalia had served as additional solicitor general in the previous Narendra Modi government.Senior leaders claimed that advocate Anmol Ratan Sidhu emerged as the unanimous choice for the job because of his old associations with the Congress but Channi prevailed and appointed Deol. Sidhu objected to Deol’s appointment as he had represented former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini in the cases of 2015 police firing during protests against the Bargari sacrilege. Deol recently managed to get blanket bail for Saini from the Punjab and Haryana High Court stating that the ex-DGP will not be arrested in any case until elections in Punjab are over. The court had also stayed all investigations against Saini.According to some senior lawyers linked with the Bargari sacrilege cases, just before change in the guard in the Congress, the state government was preparing to challenge the high court orders related to FIRs 11 and 13 registered by the vigilance bureau in which Saini was granted blanket bail. “But now, if the government wants to challenge the blanket bail orders in the apex court, consent has to be given by Deol as AG. Can you expect a lawyer to challenge the same order which he himself secured? What can be more apt case of conflict of interest?” asked a senior lawyer.Deol, on the other hand, has claimed that he has sent back all files related to cases linked with Saini. “My priority now is to serve the interests of the state. As a professional lawyer, we get cases of all sorts of clients,” he told some news channels the day he was appointed as AG.Channi preferred Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota, a 1988-batch IPS officer, for the DGP’s post over 1986-batch IPS officer S Chattopadhyaya, Sidhu’s first choice.The orders to give charge to Chattopadhyaya were about to be issued but Channi put his foot down after getting feedback that his case for the regular appointment for the post may not get approval of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) due to some controversies surrounding him.The Channi camp claims that the CM was apprehensive that Chattopadhya, who was head of the SIT probing drug charges against a senior police official, may use his position to settle personal scores. But the CM was not in mood to let a turf war restart in the police force, they said. Sahota led-SIT had blamed 2 Sikh youths for sacrilegeWhen the sacrilege cases and police action Sikh protesters rocked the state in 2015, Sahota (then ADGP, law and order) was appointed head of the first SIT constituted by the then Akali government to probe the cases.Sahota claimed to have crack the case and even addressed a press conference, claiming that the Bargari sacrilege incident was “a handiwork of some foreign handlers”. The SIT also arrested two brothers, Rupinder and Jaswinder Singh, both Sikhs and residents of Panjgrain village in Faridkot, saying they were in touch with their Australia-based handlers who were funding them. But his theory fell flat soon when the media busted the claims of purported “foreign handlers”. The government released the two brothers on November 2, 2015, and handed over the probe to the CBI. The two brothers had refused to undergo lie-detector test in subsequent probes.“Those who tortured our kids to give clean chits to the Badals are now being given plum posts…,” Sidhu said in a video released on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/appointments-of-2-officers-at-the-centre-of-punjab-congress-crisis-101632946887984.html
30-09-2021||Chandigarh||Close shave for workers as hosiery unit catches fire in Ludhiana||Panic gripped the Wait Ganj area, which is one of the busiest and most congested markets in the city, after fire broke out at a hosiery unit on Wednesday. As thick black smoke engulfed the area, shops surrounding the burning unit, AK Knitwear, started vacating their premises. The workmen present in the unit were able to leave the building in the nick of time. While no casualty was reported, goods and materials amounting to lakhs that had been kept on the ground floor of the four-storey building were gutted. A short-circuit in the compressor or air vent of the air conditioner on the outer side of the building is said to have caused the fire incident, as the hosiery material caught fire due to a spark. Neighbours and workmen tried to douse the flames using fire extinguishers and water buckets, but to no avail. Wait Ganj Vyapar Mandal Association president Arun Kapoor said, “It is fortunate that the fire did not break out at night, otherwise the flames may have also engulfed the neighbouring units.” Firefighters said that the unit was lacking in fire safety arrangements and they found it difficult to enter the unit due to the thick black smoke emanating from the unit. They used a ladder to douse the flames from the outside and then entered the unit. Sub-fire officer (SFO) Atish Rai said that the owner of the unit was near the Sundar Nagar fire station when blaze broke out and approached the fire brigade at around 11:35am. “Two fire tenders were rushed to the spot and the firefighting operation lasted an hour.” Traffic, encroachments slow down fire fighters In the wake of the ongoing winter apparel sale, the firefighters had a tough time reaching the hosiery unit due to traffic jams and narrow openings as shopkeepers had lined their hosiery goods on the roads. “Shopkeepers and their labour immediately cleared the way for the fire tenders, due to which we were able to reach the spot,” a firefighter said. Shopkeepers seek installation of fire hydrants Members of Wait Ganj Vyapar Mandal Association demanded that the administration and municipal corporation install fire hydrants in the old hosiery markets of the city. Kapoor said, “Having fire hydrants in the market, will help douse fires immediately. The same demand had been raised by us after a three-storeyed hosiery unit on Lal Masjid Road in Wait Ganj area went up in flames in November 2019.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/close-shave-for-workers-as-hosiery-unit-catches-fire-in-ludhiana-101632946883837.html

30-09-2021||Chandigarh||Political parties drove a wedge between Jammu, Kashmir: Altaf Bukhari||The Apni Party president, Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari, on Wednesday said political parties were responsible for driving a wedge between the people of Jammu and Kashmir for political gains. However, the Apni Party will continue its fight against such divisive politics for the unity and equality of the two regions, he added. He was speaking at programme where nearly 100 youths and student leaders led by Partpal Singh Jamwal joined the Apni Party. Bukhari said the joining of youths shows that the party has won the trust of the people, especially youth and students in Jammu. “We believe in the equality of both the regions. The issues and aspirations of youths across J&K are the same with regard to employment, development, peace and prosperity.” He said that it was Apni Party’s Jammu leadership which raised the public’s concerns the most and worked to address the issues being faced by traders, transporters, youth and students in Jammu. He said that when other parties failed to address issues of Jammu and Kashmir, they resorted to spreading hatred against Kashmir in Jammu, and vice versa. “This politics of hate will end,” he said and added that ‘Darbar Move’ had provided an opportunity to the people of both the regions to come close to each other and share cultural values. He said, “The Darbar Move not only increased business, but mutual respect too. An attempt has been made to hurt the relations again with the ending of Darbar Move practice.” He said that if the Apni Party comes to power, it will restore the Darbar Move practice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/political-parties-drove-a-wedge-between-jammu-kashmir-altaf-bukhari-101632946643991.html

At a meeting of the road safety council, cops said that at times the three-wheelers are a menace on the roads and are also misused by miscreants. However, as they are unregistered the drivers often escape action. Acting on the cops’ complaint, the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) has started registering the e-rickshaws, which will allow the police to challan e-autos without a number plate or seize them.A traffic cop, who did not wish to be named, said, “The drivers deliberately violate traffic rules as they know that we cannot issue a challan to them.” Joint commissioner of police (JCP, city and traffic) Deepak Pareek said registeration of e-rickshaws had also started in Amritsar. “We have started issuing special codes to autos to identify three-wheelers without proper documents. We will issue special stickers to autos that possess all documents,”he said.Narinder Singh, secretary, Regional Transport authority, said, “We have started registration and the police can now issue challans or impound the autos plying without number plates.” Traffic missionary Rahul Verma said registered electric vehicles are issued a green number plate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/now-unregistered-electric-rickshaws-can-be-challaned-in-ludhiana-101632946284012.html

It is learnt that Sahota was asked to clarify what directions came from the chief minister’s office after a section of the media and Congress leaders from Navjot Sidhu camp targeted him for conducting the “controversial probe”. The Sahota-led SIT had arrested two Sikh youths from Panjgrain of Faridkot to conclude the sacrilege as a handiwork of foreign hands to create communal tension in Punjab. However, the theory had fallen flat with the media busting the police claims the next day. The two arrested youths had to be freed under pressure of the Sikh organisations. After Sahota’s appointment as the acting DGP, a few Sikh bodies even alleged that under pressure from Badals, the probe by Sahota-led SIT spared Ram Rahim and falsely implicated the two youths. However, the police spokesperson clarified that the Sahota-led SIT had functioned only for 20 days (October 14, 2015 to November 2, 2015), after which the case was transferred to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). “Entire investigation was conducted by the CBI not the SIT headed by Sahota,” said the spokesperson, adding no clean chit was given to Ram Rahim or any other person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sahotaled-sit-never-gave-clean-chit-to-ram-rahim-in-sacrilege-case-101632945807627.html

If convicted, the students face up to one-year imprisonment.What had happenedRaj Kumar had gone to vote for the law faculty polls when the incident took place on September 1. After he came out of the auditorium, the students raised slogans against him and interrupted him while he tried to enter into his vehicle. He even tried to sit on the motorcycle with a security guard before he managed to enter his vehicle. The students were on an indefinite protest, demanding the reopening of campus and immediate conduct of polling for the senate’s registered graduate constituency. A day earlier, they had also locked the main entrance of the varsity’s administration block. According to the complaint submitted by PU’s chief of security Vikram Singh, students tried to restrain the V-C when he stepped out of the auditorium and kept banging on his vehicle. ‘We did not hurt V-C’Amandeep, who has been booked, said: “We had been protesting peacefully for 25 days, and did not hurt the V-C in any way. He didn’t even stop to talk to us at the protest site. Instead of fulfilling our demands, the university is trying to terrify students by pressing criminal charges. The authorities could have resolved the matter internally.” Nikhil Narmeta, president, NSUI, said: “The university authorities should not have allowed police interference in internal matters. Pressing criminal charges against students, who were just protesting for their rights, is unjust. The students only wanted to talk to the V-C regarding their demands.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-month-on-four-students-booked-for-heckling-vc-101632945753236.html

30-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC zeroes in on 8 localities not giving segregated garbage||For achieving 100% segregation of garbage at source, the Chandigarh municipal corporation has zeroed in on eight areas across the city where the compliance has been found poor. All these are semi-urban or rural and situated on the city’s periphery: Hallomajra, Bapu Dham Colony, Sanjay Colony (Industrial Area), Indira Colony (Manimajra), Maloya, EWS Colony (Maloya), Mauli Jagran, and Vikas Nagar (Mauli Jagran). The municipal corporation (MC) on Wednesday started an awareness drive at Vikas Nagar and EWS Colony besides Ram Darbar under the theme of Kachra Alag Karo Amrit Divas as part of the Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav. At the other five places, including Hallomajra, Bapu Dham Colony and parts on Manimajra, awareness drives will be conducted in the coming days. “We will extend the awareness drive in other parts to encourage people to segregate waste. This will be continued beyond the Mahotsav,” said MC commissioner Anindita Mitra. Mitra on September 8 had directed the officials concerned to find out that how much segregated waste is being collected currently, and how various areas are performing. The MC had taken over door-to-door garbage collection in December last year, and has deployed around 525 two-bin vehicles to collect segregated waste. Nearly 80% localities have been covered with these vehicles, but the civic body is still receiving mixed waste from most areas. Though no exact figure is available, MC officials have estimated that around 25% households are still giving mixed wet and dry waste. The collection of mixed waste is also affecting the working of two material recovery facilities at the Industrial Area. These facilities have a dedicated space for sorting recoverable dry waste into different categories, including paper, card, recyclable plastic, glass bottles and metal. The leftover dry waste is moved to the compost plant at Dadumajra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-zeroes-in-on-8-localities-not-giving-segregated-garbage-101632945748827.html
30-09-2021||Chandigarh||Ramlila organisers raring to make a comeback in Chandigarh||After a hiatus last year, when most Ramlila organisers called off the performance or went online amid the pandemic, the annual affair is set to return to around 40 venues across Chandigarh next week, with the first scheduled to begin on October 4. “All 46 Ramlila organisers in the city are willing to perform this year. We will follow all Covid-19 guidelines issued by the authorities,” said BP Gour, chief patron of the Chandigarh Kendriya Ramlila Mahasabha. Gour said the Mahasabha has got permissions from the fire department and municipal corporation, while the administration’s nod is expected soon. It is learnt that the MC has given the approval to only 36 organisers so far, while other applications are being processed. As far as the UT administration is concerned, approvals and detailed guidelines are likely before the scheduled beginning of Ramlilas.New scenes to attract peopleWith the pandemic still not over, the Azaad Dramatic Club, Sector 20, plans to showcase new scenes to attract people. It was one of the few Ramlilas that performed live last year with 200 seats, which remained occupied on most days.“The new scenes will focus on the virtue of loyalty. For example, how Laxman’s wife Urmila made sacrifices for his and Lord Rama’s sake, and how Kumbhkaran remained loyal to his brother Ravana till the end,” said Ashok Choudhary, senior vice president of the club.The club will begin the Ramlila on October 4, a day before most other organisers, to incorporate the increased number of scenes. Cash crunch to have impactMeanwhile, the financial impact of successive lockdowns is expected to leave a mark on Ramlilas this year. Many artistes have lost their regular jobs while donations have also been affected. “We will have the simplest of arrangements this year due to financial constraints,” said Jyoti Bhardwaj, a veteran Ramlila artiste from the OCF Sanskritic Manch, Sector 29. However, the enthusiasm has not dipped. ”Out troupe is busy with the rehearsals,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ramlila-organisers-raring-to-make-a-comeback-in-chandigarh-101632945747808.html
30-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Home ministry’s advisory panel to get overhaul||The home ministry’s advisory committee, the apex institution for direct interface between Chandigarh’s elected representatives and the Union government, is set to get an overhaul.UT administrator Banwari Lal Purohit on Wednesday approved the draft of the revamped advisory committee. It will now be submitted with the ministry of home affairs (MHA) for approval.“The committee was lying dormant for a long time. I took up the issue with the MHA. It suggested we should rework the composition of the committee to make it more compact,” said UT adviser Dharam Pal.According to the draft, the major change is the reduction in the number of nominated members. The previous committee constituted in 2016 had 12 members, with eight of them being nominated. “Now, the suggestion is to have the Member of Parliament, mayor and leader of opposition in the MC House as ex officio members besides two to four nominated members,” said Pal, adding that a smaller committee will allow more regular meetings and streamline its working. Currently, it is considered to be too unwieldy, he said. The MHA will also decide who will nominate these members – UT administration or Union government. After the MHA nod, the members will be appointed. At present, the tenure of the nominated members is three years, and they can get extension. Chandigarh is represented by the UT administrator, and in his absence the UT adviser, besides the ex officio and nominated members.No meeting since 2017The last meeting of the panel was held in 2017, the first and last meeting of the committee constituted in November 2016.Earlier, too, the committee’s meetings have been put on the back burner. The meeting in 2017 was held after 12 years. The previous one in 2005 was held after 20 years, said a senior UT official.The committee addresses general questions of policy relating to the administration and all legislative proposals concerning the territory in regard to matters in the state list besides such matters relating to the annual financial statement of the Union so far as it concerns the UT. Also, all development issues concerning the UT can be put forward before the MHA besides other matters deemed fit by the ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhhome-ministry-s-advisory-panel-to-get-overhaul-101632945746287.html

30-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn objects to plea allowing repair works in Kansal||The Chandigarh administration on Wednesday objected to a plea of Kansal Enclave Residents Welfare Association, Mohali, that demands repair and maintenance of basic amenities be allowed in the area.The plea came in view of the Punjab and Haryana high court’s stay on demolition and construction activity in the Sukhna catchment area.UT’s counsel Jaiveer Chandel told the high court (HC) bench of justice Jaswant Singh and justice HS Sidhu that if the plea is allowed, it would affect Sukhna Lake as a major portion of Kansal comes under its “zone of influence”.Urging the court to defer hearing and not pass any interim order, Chandel sought more time for a detailed reply, following which the matter has been adjourned for November 17. Punjab and other parties have also not responded to the plea yet.The residents welfare association, in the plea filed on September 24, said that they are facing difficulties and inconvenience due to the deteriorating condition of roads and other amenities, and should be allowed to carry out repair, maintenance and improvement of basic amenities, such as electricity, sewerage, roads and drainage. The fresh application has been filed in a matter in which suo motu proceedings were initiated by the HC to save the lake in 2009. In March 2020, the court while disposing of this matter had directed Punjab and Haryana to pay ₹100 crore each as fine for allowing constructions and ordered that all structures in the catchment area, as demarcated by the Survey of India in 2004, be demolished. However, later, the court had agreed to re-examine the boundaries while staying demolition and construction activity in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-objects-to-plea-allowing-repair-works-in-kansal-101632945743695.html
30-09-2021||Chandigarh||₹40,000 compensation to student: High court junks Himachal Pradesh University’s appeal||The Himachal Pradesh high court on Wednesday dismissed the appeal filed by Himachal Pradesh University challenging the order to pay ₹40,000 as compensation to a student, who had alleged that irreparable loss was caused to his career due to delay in issuance of the consolidated mark sheet of MA (economics) to him. A division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Ravi Malimath and Justice Jyotsna Rewa Dua, while dismissing the appeal, upheld the decision of the single judge and observed that a larger amount of compensation was liable to be imposed in this matter. Naveen Kumar had filed a writ petition alleging that the HPU was not issuing the consolidated mark sheet for MA (economics) to him despite the fact that he had passed all the papers in 2005. He was shown absent in one of the courses. He made several representations to HPU authorities to settle the result, stating that he was not absent in any of the paper.Later, the university officials verified from the attendance sheet that he was present in the paper, and he was assured that the matter would be settled soon. However, when he applied for the consolidated mark sheet, his application was rejected. He again visited HPU with a proof of his attendance, but the authorities refused to entertain stating that they had no time to look for old records. The petitioner had alleged that in the entire process, he spent thousands of rupees and was subjected to the ill-behaviour of officials. He alleged that those were his career-defining years, but he was deprived of weightage for want of a PG degree and even from appearing in various exams. He had prayed to direct HPU to issue his consolidated mark sheet and pay compensation of ₹ 5 lakh.During the hearing, HPU authorities admitted that the petitioner had appeared in course and scored 19 marks.The single bench had allowed the petition, directing the university to grant at least three chances to the petitioner to pass the course and to pay compensation of ₹40,000 to him. The order was challenged by the HPU by way of appeal.Dismissing the appeal, the court observed that learned single judge has been very magnanimous in ordering such a meagre amount against the appellant. The court also observed that for the error committed, a larger amount of compensation was liable to be imposed. The court observed that it finds no ground to interfere with the impugned order passed by the learned single judge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/40000-compensation-to-student-high-court-junks-himachal-pradesh-university-s-appeal-101632945206384.html
30-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Congress crisis: Sidhu raises appointments; let’s talk, says CM Channi||A day after shooting off his resignation letter, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu kept his party’s government on tenterhooks on Wednesday, putting out a video to raise questions over the appointments of the advocate general, director general of police and “tainted leaders”, even as chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi invited him for a talk. Channi, who is battling his first major political crisis just 10 days after taking over as the chief minister, offered to sit down and iron out differences, if any. “Whoever is party president is head of the family. I had told him (Sidhu) that the party is supreme and the government follows its ideology. I spoke to him over the phone and told him to come, sit and talk to resolve issues,” he said at a press conference here after the cabinet meeting, terming the response as “affirmative”. However, there was no indication when the two leaders would meet. The chief minister had reached out to a sulking Sidhu after he broke his silence by posting a video message on Twitter with the caption, “I will fight for truth till my last breath”. Punjab cabinet ministers Pargat Singh and Amrinder Singh Raja Warring were tasked by Channi to convince Sidhu to withdraw his resignation to end the standoff. Both ministers met the PPCC chief, whose resignation has not been accepted by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, at his Patiala residence in the morning. “There are definitely some issues. We went to talk to him. I am sure these will be sorted out,” Pargat, a close confident of Sidhu, said after meeting him. Two state unit working presidents and half-a-dozen legislators also met him. The cricketer-turned-politician’s abrupt resignation, barely 72 days after he was appointed the state unit chief, pushed the Congress into a fresh crisis in poll-bound Punjab before it could recover from months of turmoil caused by a bitter tussle between Sidhu and his bête noire, then chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, left the party divided. Sidhu, in his four-and-a-half minute video, said he was ready to make any sacrifice but would always stand by his principles. “My first priority is to fight for justice that people have been waiting for,” he said, griping against some senior appointments made by the government in the past week without directly naming anyone. In an apparent reference to the 2015 sacrilege incidents in Faridkot, Sidhu said those who gave clean chits to the Badals six years ago had been given the responsibility of delivering justice. DGP Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota was the head of a special investigation team (SIT) formed in 2015 by the then Akali government to probe the sacrilege incidents. He also apparently questioned the appointment of senior advocate APS Deol as the new advocate general of Punjab. “My soul jitters when I see those who secured blanket bails, they are advocate general. What is the agenda here?” he asked. Deol was a counsel for former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini and had represented him in cases related to police firing on Sikhs protesting against the Bargari sacrilege. The Congress leader said that a system that included “tainted” leaders and officials, was being brought back after being dismantled, adding that he would oppose it. His remark is being viewed as an oblique reference to former minister Rana Gurjit Singh’s return to the state cabinet. Rana’s induction was also opposed by several party MLAs from Doaba region. Sidhu said that he had no personal grudge against anyone, nor had fought personal battles and his fight was always on issues and a pro-Punjab agenda. “I will not misguide the high command or let anyone do so,” he said, adding that he will take a stand and fight. The party circles had been agog with speculations about Sidhu being miffed at not being allowed more say in cabinet expansion and appointments as some of his choices were overlooked. However, Channi struck a conciliatory note on these issues at his press conference, stating that these appointments were based on feedback received from various quarters. “If there is a feeling that someone has to be changed, I have no objection, no ego,” he said. He said that as sought by the party high command, the government would appoint a dedicated team of public prosecutors and lawyers to handle sensitive cases like the desecration incident and the subsequent police firing. He later held a meeting with the DGP and advocate general in the evening. While the Congress high command, which had backed Sidhu to the hilt till now, is showing no urgency, opinion is divided on efforts to placate him with some party ministers, MLAs and other leaders, feeling that this crisis would be “detrimental to interests” of the party. Cabinet minister Gurkirat Singh Kotli said these kinds of situations ahead of the elections hurt. “He is a strong leader and should work to strengthen the party,” he told reporters. Ferozepur City MLA Parminder Singh Pinky also voiced his concern, whereas Amritsar South legislator Inderbir Singh Bolaria felt that when such a senior leader had raised all these issues, the high command should take note and address them. Party leader Anish Sidana termed it as an unfortunate and impulsive decision. “A party can never be run by outsourcing democratic system…egoism has no place. Congress should learn from Punjab episode,” he tweeted. Meanwhile, the party has also started preparing for an eventuality where Sidhu does not take back his resignation. Rajasthan leader Harish Chaudhary, who was deployed as central observer for the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting held on September 18, is learnt to have reached Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-congress-crisis-sidhu-raises-appointments-let-s-talk-says-cm-channi-101632945204849.html

30-09-2021||Bhopal||BJP deputes 42 MLAs, 12 ministers for Madhya Pradesh by-elections on 4 seats||BHOPAL: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has deputed 12 ministers and 42 party lawmakers for by-elections in three assembly seats and a Lok Sabha seat in different regions of the state to win these seats, people familiar with the matter said. Voting is scheduled to take place on October 30, according to an Election Commission announcement on Tuesday.The BJP, which lost the Damoh assembly election in March this year reportedly due to an internal feud, has formed at least 14 committees to deal with internal differences, ticket distribution, identification of local issues and other important issues to win by-elections on assembly seats in Raigaon in Satna district, Jobat in Alirajpur, Prithvipur in Nimar district and the Khandwa Lok Sabha seat.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan held a meeting with the ministers on Wednesday night to discuss issues related to the by-polls.Out of four seats, the Raigaon and Khandwa seats fell vacant after the death of BJP MLA Jugal Kishor Bagri and MP Nandkumar Singh, respectively while Jobat and Prithvipur seats have been vacant after the death of Congress MLAs Kalawati Bhuria and Brijendra Pratap Singh, respectively. “The BJP will not take any risk because it is more of a test of sentiments in different parts of the state,” a senior party leader in Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal said.“The leaders have been told to ensure the implementation of all the central and state government schemes and popularise it. They have also given a task of settling all the internal differences and to send a stern message that they all should support the candidates to be given the party tickets,” the leader.A second BJP leader said the local leadership is particularly focused on winning Jobat, a tribal seat that has stayed with the Congress for years. “The party is making extra efforts to win the trust of trials who are not happy with their inclusion among Hindu population… We have announced many schemes for the tribal population including health camps and door-to-door distribution of ration,” said the second leader cited above said.BJP leaders acknowledge that there may be some resentment over the large number of deaths during the second wave of Covid 19.“The state government’s image was dented after the second wave of Covid 19,” a third BJP leader said.BJP state president VD Sharma, said he was confident of the party’s performance. “The BJP will win all the seats as Congress is facing an existential crisis and there is no third option here in MP… The BJP-led state government is trying to bring good governance in the state by improving the system.”Congress leaders, however, claim that the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was clearly nervous about the outcome.“We are not facing any crisis but the BJP is surely facing one. More than 10 candidates of BJP are fighting for tickets in all four constituencies. They will lose the election due to internal feud and dissatisfaction of voters,” said MP Congress Committee Spokesperson JP Dhanopia. Political analyst Girja Shankar said the by-elections were important ahead of the 2023 state elections but emphasized that an emotional factor will also play a major role. “All the seats are vacant due to deaths of the elected representatives so the ticket to family members of the deceased will help the party in winning the seats,” Shankar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/bjp-deputes-42-mlas-12-ministers-for-madhya-pradesh-by-elections-on-4-seats-101632944964720.html

While addressing a press conference at Shimla, she avoided commenting on the issue that has kicked off a political turmoil. However, she said Sidhu lacked political understanding even after 17 years in the field. “Sidhu is trying to step back from his responsibility which was given to him by the party high command. The Congress changed the leadership on his demand. I don’t understand which fight he is going to fight this way on the social media platforms, while there are other channels open for talks and resolving issues,” she added. She said both KC Venugopal and Harish Rawat were in touch with all leaders and the issue will soon be resolved in Punjab. Meanwhile, slamming the central government over the seizure of drugs at a Gujarat port, Lamba sought a judicial probe into the matter. The Congress leader said that under Modi regime, drug trade was flourishing in the country as well as Himachal.Unemployment is increasing in the state, she said, so jobless people are being made “victims of drugs”. Lamba said the people will give a befitting reply to the BJP in the byelections. She alleged that “double-engine” government has encouraged drugs instead of providing employment. Shimla police alone have registered 187 cases under the NDPS Act since January this year, she added.She said that the Modi government had promised to give employment to two crore youths every year, but instead “is pushing them into drugs so that they are distracted and do not ask for their right”. She also hit out at the central and state governments over the issues of inflation, unemployment and law and order. She termed both the governments a “complete failure”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhus-resignation-is-congress-internal-matter-alka-lamba-101632944363537.html
30-09-2021||Chandigarh||HP bypolls: Congress election committee to meet in October 2||With the election commission setting the ball rolling for the bypolls for three assembly segments and one parliamentary seat in Himachal, political parties across the state have begun preparations. The state election committee of the Congress will meet on October 2 to finalise its strategy for the polls.“We will meet shortly to finalise the candidates for the three assembly and one parliamentary seat,” said HP Congress chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore. The Congress is likely to field former CM Virbhadra Singh’s wife Pratibha Singh from Mandi seat that fell vacant after the death of MP Ramswaroop Sharma. Pratibha was elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time in 2004 from Mandi and again in 2013.Ramswaroop had defeated Pratibha in 2014 elections and won against Congress’ Ashray Sharma in 2017. She is being seen as the strongest candidate from Mandi. Pratibha and her son, Shimla (Rural) MLA, had recently met AICC general secretary organisation KC Venugopal in Delhi. Ashray, grandson of former Union minister Sukhram, too is vying for a ticket. One section of the party had persuaded senior Congress leader and former health minister Kaul Singh Thakur to contest elections, but so far he has shown reluctance. Kullu MLA Sunder Thakur’s name had cropped up too.The Congress’ poll panel comprises Kuldeep Singh Rathore, former state chief and MP Viplove Thakur, Kaul Singh Thakur, Kuldeep Kumar, leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri, former ministers Sudhir Sharma, GS Bali and deputy leader in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma besides Asha Kumari, Dhani Ram Shandhil, Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu, Ram Lal Thakur, Rajesh Dharmani, Harsh Mahajan and Rajneesh Kimta. The panel will deliberate on names for Arki seat that was earlier represented by Virbhadra Singh. The party is likely to make its choice between local leaders Sanjay Awasthi and Rajender Thakur. HP’s Mahila Congress chief Jenab Chandel is also a contender. Awasthi is being backed by a strong section of Congress frontline leaders, including former state party chief Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu.From Jubbal and Kotkhai, former CPS Rohit Thakur is the lone contender so far. Grandson of former CM Ram Lal Thakur, Rohit was first elected in 2003. He was re-elected in 2012 and was later appointed CPS. He lost to former horticulture minister Narendra Bragta in 2017.On the Fatehpur seat, Bhawani Singh Pathania, son of former power minister Sujan Singh Pathania, is the lone contender though some locals had already opposed his candidature. Both Bhawani and Rohit had been campaigning for long now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-bypolls-congress-election-committee-to-meet-in-october-2-101632944183851.html

30-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab-origin man jailed in Singapore for illegally subletting residential unit||SingaporeA 23-year-old Indian national has been jailed for 25 days after pleading guilty to two charges under the Official Secrets Act for illegally subletting a Singapore public housing estate residential unit to multiple tenants and later passing on alerts to the occupants prior to the inspection raids to ensure they don’t get caught, a media report said on Wednesday.A third charge was taken into consideration against Damandeep Singh, who had managed to evade detection this way at least twice before his own tenancy was terminated, The Straits Times reported.In 2017, Singh met Housing and Development Board (HDB) enforcement officer Kalayarasan Karuppaya, 55, while the officer was conducting an inspection on a unit that Singh was living in.They became friends and would occasionally contact each other over the phone. Singh later moved to another unit, which he illegally sublet to others.Some 12 or 13 people ended up living in the unit, against the set rule for the maximum number of occupants in a residential unit, and about 200 Singaporean dollars was collected monthly from each of the illegal subtenants.The HDB, as managers of the housing estate, received complaints from members of the public about suspected overcrowding and noise at the unit.It also received similar information from the police which had raided the unit on complaints from neighbours.But Singh received an alert from his friend Kalayarasan about surprise checks of the unit planned by HDB for May 8, 2019, and September 10, 2019.Singh told the illegal subtenants to quickly move out prior to the inspections, which then found no observable signs of overcrowding or illegal subletting, the report said.But after HDB enforcement officers informed the unit’s owner about the information from police, Singh’s tenancy was terminated and the unit was vacated the same month, September 2019.The offences came to light after the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau received information in January last year about Kalayarasan’s tip-offs to Singh.The HDB officer was also jailed for 25 days last month for offences under the OSA.For each OSA charge of wrongful communication of information, Singh could have been jailed for up to two years and fined 2,000 Singaporean dollars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjaborigin-man-jailed-in-singapore-for-illegally-subletting-residential-unit-101632943944301.html
30-09-2021||Chandigarh||Channi govt starts process to appoint new PSPCL chief||The state government has started the process to appoint a new chairperson-cum-managing director of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL). The department of power, held by the newly appointed chief minister (CM) Charanit Singh Channi who took charge nine days ago, has invited applications for the post. Those with experience of working in power boards and corporations for 25 years, with a two-year stint as chief engineer, are eligible for the position. The CM, as sources revealed, is keen for a change and wants the power department to process his decisions without delay. On Wednesday, he announced to waive off the entire defaulting arrears of domestic electricity bills upto 2 KW load. This will add ₹1,000 to 1,200 crore additional burden on the state exchequer.The government’s hurry to appoint a new chairperson is apparent from the fact that it has preponed the last date for receiving applications by four days. While earlier the deadline was October 18, candidates now have time till October 14 to apply.Confirming the development, a senior official in the department said on the condition of anonymity said that it’s the prerogative of the CM to take a call on the matter. Sources revealed that Channi wants to select a person of his choice as he is keen on implementing some populist measures ahead of the 2022 state polls. The post is currently held by a senior bureaucrat, A Venu Prasad, who was made the head of the corporation last June, for a second stint. Earlier, he was appointed on the post immediately after Capt Amarinder Singh took over as CM in March 2017 and continued for over a year, until June 2018. In the intervening two years, Baldev Singh Sra, a technocrat from within the PSPCL, served on the post. It is expected that the new dispensation under Channi may take a call on cancelling power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed by the previous Akali-BJP government with privately run thermal plants. Cancellation of PPAs was part of the pre-poll promises made by Congress party ahead of the 2017 state polls but it never saw the light of the day. The failure to keep this promise was one of the reasons why a section of the cabinet held a grouse against the previous CM Capt Amarinder Singh. Navjot Singh Sidhu, who resigned from the post of Punjab Congress chief on Tuesday, had also been raising the matter repeatedly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/channi-govt-starts-process-to-appoint-new-pspcl-chief-101632943643411.html
30-09-2021||Chandigarh||Property tax: Ludhiana residents rush to suvidha kendras to avail 10% rebate||Long queues were witnessed at the municipal corporation’s (MC) zonal suvidha kendras on Wednesday, a day before the last day to avail 10% rebate on submission of property tax for the current financial year (2021-22). As per the officials, over 5,100 property tax returns were submitted by residents on Wednesday evening and the civic body recovered over ₹5.3 crores.

MC superintendent Vivek Verma said that there are around 2.20 lakh taxable properties in the city, but only around 88,200 had submitted tax till Wednesday evening. Verma stated that there is confusion among the residents that 10% rebate can be availed till November-end under the one-time settlement policy floated by state government for property tax. However, there is no extension in the rebate period for the current year.Apart from submitting tax returns at suvidha kendras, residents can also pay online at mcludhiana.gov.in, said Verma, while adding that residents should adopt the option for virtual payment rather than rushing to MC offices. The suvidha kendra staff has been restricted from doing any other work to cater to the rush of visitors on Thursday.

30-09-2021||Bangalore||Marijuana, LSD worth ₹1 crore seized, 2 Iranians among 4 held in B’luru: Police||Days after unearthing a synthetic drug manufacturing unit, the Central Crime Branch (CCB) has raided another similar facility. According to police, ₹1 crore worth of hydroponic marijuana and LSD were seized during the raid. Police have also arrested four men, including two Iranian nationals during the raid. “CCB arrested four drug peddlers, including two Iranians, overstaying on a student visa. They procured hybrid cannabis seeds through dark net and grew the plants at home using UV lights. A case has been booked under NDPS and Foreigners Act,” tweeted Sandeep Patil, joint commissioner of police, (crime). Hydroponic marijuana is cannabis that is grown without the use of soil and an artificial lab is used for its production. The investigation of the case revealed that the suspects had rented a villa in Bidadi on the outskirts of the city. During the raid, police have recovered UV lights, LED lamps, vacuum packing containers, and an electrical weighing machine, which was used to cultivate around 130 Hydroponic marijuana plants. “During the interrogation, one of the accused in our custody -- Javad Aldin – said that he used it while he was going through some mental health-related issues. Later he decided to cultivate it himself and imported seeds from Europe using the darknet,” said a CCB official. The police raided the house on Sunday afternoon based on a tip-off. Police were told that a group of people was selling drugs from a car. They tracked the vehicles around 1.30 pm and arrested the occupants, who led the cops to the manufacturing unit. Aldin, according to CCB, had come from Tehran to Bengaluru in 2010. After completing his MBA from college in east Bengaluru, he remained in the city. After using the drug in 2010, he was addicted to it and it was one of the reasons for staying back in India since drug peddling would attract severe punishment in Iran. “Once he began cultivating the drug at home successfully, he began selling it outside. The client lists include some city-based celebrities as well,” said police. To help with sales of the drugs, he recruited Mohammadi Barogh, another Iranian, and two Indians -- Mohammed Mohsin Uz Zaman and Mohsin Khan. Even Barogh came to India on a student visa and overstayed in the country, police added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/marijuana-lsd-worth-1-crore-seized-2-iranians-among-4-held-in-b-luru-police-101632943226071.html

After Dasara, the (Covid) task force will meet again then decide on reopening classes from 1 to 5. Since there are viral infections going on there are some delays,” Nagesh said on Wednesday.The statements come days before further relaxations come into effect from Friday including schools, cinema halls and pubs among other establishments.The TAC had suggested against any hurrying up of reopening of schools for children below class 5 since they were too small to follow Covid protocols like wearing masks and social distancing.People aware of the developments said that the government is willing to follow its phase-wise opening and was willing to suggest that classes be reopened for students between classes 3 to 5.The relaxations will come into effect even as 60 students from a residential school in the outskirts of Bengaluru have tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday with two of them being hospitalised.J Manjunath, deputy commissioner of Bengaluru Urban on Wednesday said that out of 480 students in the school only 60 have tested positive.“We have tested every one of them. We are going to test on the 7th day. The school has been closed till October 20, there is no cause for worry,” Manjunath said on Wednesday.He said that the measures taken so far were “proactive” and this early detection has helped contain the crisis.He said that out of the 60 students, 14 are from Tamil Nadu and 46 of them have come from different parts of the state.“We are keeping a constant watch,” he said, adding that the state government has directed district administrations to do random testing.After a gap of nearly four months, the Karnataka government has decided to reopen physical classes for students in classes 9, 10 and 12 in August, that allowed children to be back in their schools for the first time since the second wave of Covid-19 infections.People aware of the developments said that there was requests from parents and guardians to reopen schools as students in rural areas have been closed for over a year now.Many students from rural areas with no access to internet and other devices have lost out on classes and many of them are dependent on reopening of schools for mid-day meals.In July, S Suresh Kumar, the then primary and secondary education minister had stated that around 9.3 million students out of the total 10.05 million across private and public schools in Karnataka, have been accounted for in terms of access to devices, internet, TV, radio and even email.Of the 9.3 million who have been accounted for, only 5,859,907 have smartphones/tablets and around 3,127,524 without any access to such devices. Further, there are just 5,134,386 students who have access to the internet while 3,779,965 students do not have access to the internet, rendering the exercise of online classes as a redundant practice for these children, mostly from rural and backward regions of the state, Hindustan Times reported on July 2.The restarting of schools has been a contentious one, especially at a time when there appears to be a resurgence of new Covid-19 infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/will-discuss-reopening-of-more-classes-karnataka-government-101632943223709.html

It is disgusting if he has asked for the details for political purposes,” he added.Two head of departments at MDU, who had shared their staff members’ information in the given format, said they fear that their personal information will be misused.“The university authorities have failed to secure our personal information. We have no option but to sharing the details in the given format,” they added.The officials concerned of MDU’s establishment branch confirmed that they have asked the employees to share their details as asked for by Rohtak MP Arvind Sharma.“We received a letter from the Rohtak DC office to provide details of employees, their designation, address and Lok Sabha area,” the officials said.Jannayak Janata Party’s student wing Indian National Student Organisation (INSO) national president Pradeep Deswal said voting is a legal right and the vice-chancellor cannot share employees’ details with anyone in this way.“It is surprising that the MDU V-C has directed the staff to share their information as asked by the local MP,” he added.Rohtak MLA BB Batra, of Congress, said such practices are illegal and unethical.“How can an MP seek personal details of employees of MDU, PGIMS and the two private companies? The V-Cs are not authorised to provide such details. We will fight a legal battle in this case,” the MLA added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rohtak-mp-arvind-sharma-asks-for-mdu-pgims-staff-details-employees-raise-concerns-101632942923423.html
30-09-2021||Pune||PCOS cases rise due to inactivity; women complain of irregular periods||PUNE: The last one year or so has seen an uptick in the number of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) cases, mostly due to factors such as being confined at home, decreased physical activity, higher consumption of junk and restaurant-cooked food, binge-watching television and other screens, and irregular sleep patterns, according to city doctors.Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is a commonly found endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS have higher production of male hormones and become resistant to insulin, leading to weight gain, unwanted hair growth and eventual irregularities in the menstrual cycle. Other prominent symptoms of this condition are acne and dark patches on the skin. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome can invite lifelong complications like hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and infertility. While there is limited awareness of this condition, it can be handled via early detection, medication, weight management, exercise, nutritious food and using assisted reproductive technology for conception.Dr Rajeshwari Pawar, consultant, obstetrics and gynaecology at Motherhood hospital, said, “Due to the lack of mobility, a large number of women experienced irregular menstruation, hormonal disturbance, stress and weight gain which led to an increase in PCOS cases. Women also tend to neglect irregular or heavy menstrual cycles, dismissing them as a normal occurrence and that too led to increased PCOS cases. Women with PCOS who are obese and have diabetes are more susceptible to Covid-19 than those who do not have PCOS. We have seen an almost 30% increase in PCOS cases among women in the age group of 25 to 30 years over the past few months. Girls in their early 20s are also being diagnosed with PCOS due to a sedentary lifestyle during the lockdown.”“The common issues in older women with PCOS are glucose intolerance and higher blood pressure. Women who already have PCOS are also facing difficulties. Those who had managed to control their symptoms before lockdown are experiencing the symptoms again owing to a sedentary lifestyle. Many teenagers too are reporting PCOS symptoms like acne and facial hair,” Dr Pawar said.Dr Bhupinder Singh Duggal, obstetrician and gynaecologist from Noble hospital, also said that there has been a rise in the number of PCOS cases. “We have seen a worrisome trend of increase in the number of PCOS cases during the recent one year period. During lockdown, a lot of junk and restaurant-cooked food was consumed. This could have led to irregular menstrual cycles. According to medical literature, around 10 to 15 per cent of Indian women suffer from PCOS but now, we are seeing an increase in the number of cases,” Dr Duggal said.Dr Karishma Dafle, fertility consultant, Nova IVF Fertility, said that PCOS can also cause female infertility and ovulatory disorder however women with PCOS do manage to get pregnant with assisted reproductive technology. “PCOS prevents the release of eggs on a regular basis and one will not be able to achieve pregnancy. In almost six out of 10 couples seeking fertility treatment, PCOS is the cause of infertility. PCOS also takes a toll on one’s mental and emotional health, including mood swings, stress, and poor body image. Depression, frustration, irritation, stress, and anxiety are common occurrences in women with PCOS. Women with PCOS are often stressed and suffer in silence as they neglect their condition,” Dr Dafle said.Lifestyle management is very important for PCOS patients which includes eating healthy and homemade food and doing regular exercise. “To control PCOS, eat a well-balanced diet, exercise daily, and monitor your blood sugar levels and hypertension. Include fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and pulses in the diet. Avoid processed and junk food which causes weight gain,” Dr Pawar said.Meanwhile, Dr Sunita Tandulwadkar, president of the Poona Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Society, said that the rise in PCOS cases can also be attributed to the fact that while younger women are now more aware of their health, they care less about it. “The lockdown has undoubtedly changed our lifestyles and has forced us to stay inside longer. However it cannot be the only contributing factor for increased PCOS. I have younger women in the age group of 18 to 22 years walking into my clinic and complaining about irregular periods, so awareness has definitely gone up. In this lockdown, I know of many couples who took the opportunity to lose weight and I know of an equal number of couples if not more that put on incredible amounts of weight. Also the fact that more women are now delaying pregnancy and marriage could also be another factor for the rise in PCOS cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pcos-cases-rise-due-to-inactivity-women-complain-of-irregular-periods-101632942868253.html

She said the latest results give credence to the theory that bats are the carriers of the Nipah virus. “The NIV has conveyed to us about the presence of IgG antibody in some. We are expecting more results in coming days,” the minister said. She said different studies conducted by NIV, the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases would continue. She said though the 21-day incubation period was over, the department would observe a double incubation period of 42 days to declare the area Nipah free. The health department was on high alert after the third outbreak of Nipa, first in 2018 in Kozhikode and second in Ernakulam in 2019. It cordoned off the entire area, and samples were collected from all houses. Around 800 samples were checked in two days, and all turned positive on September 8. Like earlier outbreaks, it was localised and contained effectively. After the death of the boy, his parents said he had eaten rambutan fruit before taking ill and authorities have asked people not to eat fruits picked from the ground. But samples of half-eaten fruits did not show any signs of contamination during initial tests. Later authorities have warned people not to disturb the bat habitat in panic. Reeling under high Covid-9 cases, the state contributed more than 60 per cent of the country’s total cases for about four months. The expert said strict protocol in place due to Covid-19, like masking, physical distancing and no overcrowding, helped the state to blunt the impact of the zoonotic disease again. Kozhikode reported Nipah infection for the second time in three years. In 2018, it claimed 17 lives in the district. Two persons also survived the infection. And in 2019, a youth tested positive for the zoonotic disease in Ernakulam, but he was also nursed back to life after a long hospitalization. After the first outbreak in 2018, the state government promised the setting up of a high-end animal testing lab, virology institute, a scientific study on bats (characterology) and a treatment protocol for separate zoonotic diseases. Experts say most of those remained only promises. “Since zoonotic diseases recur frequently in the state, it needed an integrated approach and team of experts from all fields to study it,” said Dr N M Arun, an internal medicine expert. Experts like Arun suggested a proactive strategy to face the increasing threat of recurring zoonotic diseases and not wait for the outbreak to act. The state needs to strengthen its surveillance system backed by enough scientific studies, they say. Zoonotic diseases recur at regular intervals in the state, in the last three years, several cases of Kyasnur forest disease (monkey fever), avian influenza, swine flu and anthrax were reported. Thousands of ducks were culled in Alapuzha two years ago to check the spread of avian influenza. “We need a permanent mechanism for early detection of such diseases and early warning to the people. More research is also needed in the area,” said Dr Prejit Nambiar, a teacher at the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, who is specialised in zoonoses and food safety. He said a close interaction is necessary between medical experts, veterinary professionals, environmental scientists and wildlife professionals to tackle zoonotic diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nipah-antibodies-detectedin-bat-samples-kerala-government-101632942750115.html

It’s time to show him his place,” he said in a direct attack on Jagan and, in a way, setting the tone for the 2024 electoral battle.“You have called us out for war. We are ready for the battle and will fight it to the end. The time has come for you to be driven out,” Kalyan said.The Jana Sena president addressed the general body of his party at its headquarters in Mangalagiri here on Wednesday evening.“I have so far worked as a social activist. I have not behaved like a political leader. But now I will start the politicking. I am fully geared up for the battle,” Kalyan said.Attacking the Jagan government on various issues, Kalyan sought to know where development was in the state.While the state’s income was over ₹1.25 lakh crore per annum, the government was not in a position to pay even the staff salaries on time. Pensions were also inordinately delayed, he alleged.Kalyan pointed out that not a single road has been repaired or laid in the last two years.“That is the financial condition of the state. But when we are questioning this, they (YSRC leaders) are resorting to personal attacks,” Kalyan said.What’s there about my personal life? It’s all black and white. But you are living a colourful dream,” the Jana Sena chief remarked, lashing out at the YSRC leadership.Referring to the various freebie schemes named after the Chief Minister, he questioned whose money was being distributed.“Is it your hard-earned money? It is people’s tax money. It has to be distributed equitably. But the government is doing it in a pick and choose manner,” he said.Kalyan said he would alter his strategies based on (political) need.“I aligned with BJP after it agreed to retain Amaravati as the state capital. It also promised development of parched Rayalaseema and backward north coastal Andhra regions. So we have forged an alliance,” he noted.Talking about his political journey and objectives, the actor-politician stressed that he was in politics to stand by people in trouble.“I may win or lose (elections), that’s okay. I am not a beggar. If you have confidence in me, elect me. Then I will show what development will be,” he said.

It’s not about legal rights. I am a devotee of Balaji, also my brother and sister Judges,” said CJI.“We are all devotees of Balaji and expect that all rituals will be conducted according to the traditions,” CJI Ramana added.The bench said that the apex court may not be able to interfere in the manner, in which puja is conducted or the number of people who conduct it.The Bench was hearing an appeal filed by one Srivari Daadaa challenging the order of Andhra Pradesh High Court, which had dismissed his Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking directions to TTD to rectify the method of performing rituals and ‘seva’ to Lord Sri Venkateshwara Swamy at the Temple.CJI Ramama also interacted with the petitioner in Telugu for a while.The plea of Daadaa, a devotee of Lord Venkateshwara Swamy, alleged irregularities in the conduct of ‘sevas’ and rituals at the Tirupathi Temple.The High Court had dismissed his plea and said that the PIL was not maintainable since the procedure of conducting rituals is the exclusive domain of the Devasthanam and cannot be a matter of adjudication unless it impacts secular or civil rights of others.

Officials from Kharghar and Kalamboli fire brigades later rescued them using iron ladders. According to the police, the visitors who were from Dharavi and Chembur had entered the waterfall by crossing a stream in the morning. However, due to incessant rains that stream got swollen by afternoon making it impossible for them to return to the city. Among the rescued people, seven were minors. The forest department had banned entry to the Pandavkada Waterfall and Kharghar Hills in June in view of the numerous accidents that took place in the past few years. An officer from Kharghar fire station said, “We along with the officials from Kalamboli fire station reached the spot within a few minutes of receiving the call and rescued the people using iron ladders. The rescue operation continued for three hours and no one suffered injuries. The visitors belonged to the 16-27 age group except for a woman who was 48.” Sandipan Shinde, senior inspector of Kharghar police station said, “We allowed them to go home in the evening requesting them not to repeat the same mistake in future.

The large number of cremations at the same place led to increased pollution and a stench around it, Velankar alleged. So much so that locals residing in and around Vaikunth complained of high levels of air pollution and bad odour, he said.There are a total 28 crematoriums across 15 ward office areas including the 11 villages that were recently merged. As per PMC health department statistics over the period from 2015 to 2020, a total 89,593 cremations were carried out at the 28 crematoriums, of which 51,421 cremations (57%) took place at Vaikunth crematorium alone.Velankar said, “Residents around Vaikunth crematorium are experiencing pollution and bad odour. Therefore, the PMC should create awareness among people about performing last rites at other crematoriums as well so as to minimise the burden on Vaikunth.”Shrinivas Kandul, additional chief engineer of the electrical department of PMC, said, “It is true that most people prefer to cremate their relatives at Vaikunth. It is their choice and a sensitive issue at that. The corporation has made available the provision of a crematorium in every part of the city, and people can cremate their near and dear ones anywhere in the city as we have set up 28 crematoriums.”As for controlling the pollution around Vaikunth crematorium, Kandul said that the PMC has already started taking precautionary measures. “The PMC has appointed the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), to check pollution levels around Vaikunth,” he said.Why only Vaikunth?The Vaikunth crematorium is one of the oldest and most well-known crematoriums. It was developed by the PMC on 8 acre land in 1958. It is located in a residential space in Navi peth adjoining the river Mutha. There are three electrical, one gas and 24 payers and four sheds fitted with an air pollution control system. It is located in the heart of the city and is easily accessible by most people.

They are facing trouble even today, even as the second wave peak is gone and new cases in the state are less than 10 per day,” said Prof Kauser Usman, HoD geriatric medicine at the King George’s Medical University.According to the health department data, of the total 2.38 lakh cases in Lucknow, 33% (79,099) were people above 50 years of age. In all 42,649 people between the age of 50 and 60 years and 36,450 above 60 years tested positive for Covid. Since January 01, 2020, 723 people between 50 and 60 years of age and 1378 above 60 years of age died after testing positive for Covid. Lucknow has over 5 lakh elderly population.Apart from age-related issues, elderly, post-covid, are facing increased bouts of depression and joint pain due to inaccessibility to the outside world and in some cases weak lungs. “Sudden loss of a spouse and that too in a situation where the other partner is unable to meet their spouse during their last days (due to covid restrictions) is a great emotional trauma and causes loss of physical strength too,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general association of international doctors.“Many elderly patients come to OPD. Some do not have anyone at home as their children live in other cities. Loneliness is the biggest risk for these elderly,” said Prof Usman.Doctors said that children or even neighbours should ensure that the elderly are not left alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/postcovid-loneliness-depression-pose-a-greater-risk-for-elderly-doctors-101632942323245.html
30-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Puja organisers prep for muted celebrations||Durga Puja, which will be celebrated between October 11 and 15 this year, is likely to be a low-key affair, with most pandal organisers planning to follow the rituals without the associated grandiose such as large idols and cultural programmes, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) met on Wednesday and decided to allow Durga Puja celebrations this year but with several riders. Unlike last year, when no visitors were allowed at pandals, this year, organisers will have to ensure that venues do not have visitors beyond the seating capacity and there can be no stalls of any kind. “The chief secretary is chalking out a formal standard operating procedure (SOP) for festival celebrations,” said a government official who attended the DDMA meeting, asking not to be named.The puja organisers are now awaiting the SOP to get more clarity on specific restrictions and relaxations regarding cultural events, idol immersion, pandals, eateries, stalls, and crowd management both inside and outside venues.“We welcome the decision. We will ensure strict adherence to all regulations. Safety of people is paramount,” said Swapan Ganguly, convener of Kalibari temple in New Delhi’s Mandir Marg, which organises one of the most prominent Durga Puja pandals in the city.Every year, the police and revenue department issue no-objection certificates (NOC) to around 550 Durga Puja pandals in the city. Hindustan Times spoke with several of them on Wednesday and most of them said they are left with too little time now to make grand arrangements.“We plan to have a decent pandal but there will be no idol or cultural programme,” member of the Durga Puja committee at Delhi’s Safdarjung Enclave.Robin Bose, general secretary of the Durga Puja committee in Kashmere Gate, said, “We welcome the decision but the government has taken too long to make it. We hope the NOC and approval process is expedited.”Between the last Durga Puja and the upcoming one, Delhi has witnessed two major waves of the viral disease -- in November 2020 and April 2021. While the first one peaked at a weekly average of around 7,600 new cases a day, the April wave peaked at a weekly average of around 25,000 new cases a day.“We will follow all Covid-19 protocols. However, it is going to be a low-key affair this time with no idol or stalls,” said Narayan Dey, general secretary of the Durga Puja committee at CR Park’s Mela Ground.Till Covid struck in 2020, the five days of Durga Puja are marked by decorated streets, carnivals, pandal hopping, shopping, neighbourhoods festooned with flowers and lamps, and a wide range of cuisines -- offered not only by restaurants, which stretch their working hours during those days, but also makeshift eateries that come up inside and outside venues.“I am happy that some celebration is happening this time. People will socialise but with adequate precautions. But it is quite impossible to think of Durga Puja without food stalls and cultural programmes,” said Shinjini Bose, a resident of Mayur Vihar.Alok Karmakar, a resident of Kalkaji, said, “I am happy that we will get to see Durga Puja this year. However, precautions against the viral disease are also necessary. Hopefully, we will be in a better shape next year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-puja-organisers-prep-for-muted-celebrations-101632942044041.html

Additional sessions judge SR Navander with special public prosecutor Premkumar Agarwal passed the order on Tuesday. The convicted man was identified as Nivrutti Devram Kalbhor (53) of Chinchwad. The girl had complained that the man had repeatedly made sexual advances and when she resisted saying he is her teacher, he had told her that love can blossom between a teacher and his pupil. He was arrested on October 12, 2018 and released from police custody on October 22, 2018 and has not faced any jail term so far. “The accused is hereby convicted vide Section 235 of CrPC for the offence punishable under Section 7 and 8 of the Protection of children from sexual offences (Pocso) Act and is hereby sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for the period of three years and to pay fine of ₹35,000 in default to suffer simple imprisonment for the period of four months,” read a part of the judgement by Judge Navander. He was booked under Sections 7, 8, 11, and 12 of Pocso Act and Sections 354(a) of Indian Penal Code in 2018 based on a complaint by a teenage student at the school in Nigdi, Pimpri-Chinchwad. The girl recorded her statement as a primary witness in the case and will be given the fine amount that the man has to pay - ₹50,000 in total. The conviction was, however, temporarily suspended as Kalbhor’s lawyer asked for time to approach the Bombay High Court in the matter. The court has granted suspension, but Kalbhor will have to pay the fine and submit money for personal bond to the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/school-teacher-in-pune-gets-3-year-jail-for-sexual-harassment-of-student-101632942143182.html

We also received over 100,000 doses from the Bajaj Group on Monday which will further push our drive.”“With a number of people vaccinated against Covid-19 we are seeing that the rate of hospitalisation and deaths is going down, despite the fact that most commercial activities have opened up.” The Covid-19 vaccination drive in Pune began on January 16, 2021. As of now, 42% of the eligible beneficiaries, that is those aged above 18, have been fully vaccinated, and 85.72% have received the first dose.

30-09-2021||Chandigarh||NAS preparations: Education dept faces flak from parents for pressuring kids||The education department is facing criticism for its tactics to prepare students for the National Achievement Survey (NAS), with parents saying their children are being put under extreme pressure.Parents were on Wednesday asked to fill an online form pertaining to how their children are preparing for NAS at home during parent-teacher meetings organised at government schools in the district.Arvind Kumar, whose ward is a student of Class 8, termed it an intrusion into their child’s privacy and blamed schools for putting them under extreme pressure.“Schools are monitoring kids rigorously. Now, we have been asked every detail of our child‘s routine at home through form. We have been asked to answer questions like the time our children wakes up and goes to bed; how much time they study using mobile phones, if they are preparing for NAS or not and how they are preparing. Students are already studying hard for NAS at schools and the education department now wants to monitor them at home. This can affect their physical and mental health,” he said.While many parents didn’t have smartphones, a few were reluctant to fill those forms, as they either didn’t know the online process or had to return to work.In that case, teachers were seen directing the students to fill the form for their parents, which eventually defeated the purpose. After filling the form, the students were asked to submit it and to share the screen shot of the submission with the teacher concerned .A school principal, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Teachers are also getting overburdened now. We get lots of material related to NAS every week and teachers get confused about how to make children study the NAS modules along with the main syllabus. This meeting with parents is aimed towards encouraging them to send their children to school, so that they can prepare for NAS and also to request them to motivate and monitor the child’s preparations at home”, said principal.In order to increase the participation of the students in NAS preparations, district education officer Lakhvir Singh Samra chaired an online video conference with school heads and the principals on Saturday and directed them to motivate the parents to regularly talk with their children about the ongoing preparations at schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/naspreparations-education-dept-faces-flak-from-parents-for-pressuring-kids-101632941784749.html

This does not mean that the existing fleet will get replaced immediately, but whenever any government office starts the process to procure a new car they need to buy an e-car, or even while hiring vehicles the same principle should apply.” Thackeray added, “For various reasons like funds, it is not possible to change it in a single phase, but step by step electric vehicles will increase. I am also appealing to people from Mumbai and Pune to shift this mode of transport.” Addressing some challenges that the electric-vehicle industry faces Thackeray said, “Now electric batteries have improved and citizens can travel upto 300km in one charge. Government is also promoting charging stations and citizens can erect the same at their homes and in housing societies.” The state environment minister underline the threat climate change posed to the city and the state, citing huge losses in agriculture as well as urban infrastructure, with Rs4,500 crore paid out in compensation in last year for the same.

30-09-2021||Lucknow||Yogi: Government working for development sans bias||Lucknow: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath inaugurated and laid the foundation of projects worth ₹484.41 crore in Sitapur on Wednesday. Speaking on the occasion, Yogi said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh was working without discrimination. Sitapur or Rampur, all places as well as people of all communities were benefiting from the schemes launched by the state government, he said. Hitting out at the opposition for neglecting development and working for its own benefits, Adityanath said the BJP government worked for the development of all without any discrimination and did not indulge in appeasement like others. “Those who accused us of discrimination must introspect. Had they worked for the development of all sections of society without any discrimination, the scenario in UP would have been different,” he said.. The chief minister said the BJP government worked in contrast to the previous governments’ ‘political agendas’, which were limited to caste, faith, religion, place, language and family. “People of all classes are getting the benefits of development schemes launched by the BJP government. The state government’s working mantra is development of everyone and appeasement of none. The opposition parties, when in power, worked through the politics of appeasement. There wasn’t development but riots, corruption, anarchy, terrorism, oppression and injustice,” he said. The chief minister handed over the symbolic keys of the houses to the beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. He also distributed certificates and documents to the beneficiaries selected under welfare schemes like Mukhyamantri Bal Seva Yojana, Kanya Sumangala Yojana, Vishwakarma Shram Samman Yojana, Mukhyamantri Yuva Swarozgar Yojana and Ayushman Bharat Yojana. Highlighting the work done in four and a half years, the CM expressed his gratitude to the public for showing faith in the government. He also assured the people that the government would ensure the safety, respect and self-reliance of every citizen. Paying homage to Naimish Dham, the CM highlighted that Sitapur was at number one position among the districts in getting benefits of government’s schemes. In four-and-a-half years, 2.25 lakh families got their ‘Apna Ghar’ and through Ujjwala Yojana, nearly 5 lakh families had been given free LPG connections, he said. Slamming the opposition for neglecting development in Sitapur, the CM said that even after being so close to the state capital, no development was done here. Referring to the problem of floods in the district, he said that earlier when there were floods or outbreak of any disease, the governments used to turn a blind eye to the sufferings of the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-government-working-for-development-sans-bias-101632941303625.html

Subsequently, a closure notice was served and the restaurant owner was warned that the premises will be sealed, if the unit was not shut within 48 hours.In his response on September 27, the owner submitted an affidavit stating, “I have closed down the above said trade immediately and I shall not run the same trade without SDMC trade licence under insanitary condition from health point of view and create nuisance. The eatery has applied for a new health trade licence.”A copy of the affidavit was submitted to the House on Wednesday.Leader of the House, Inderjeet Sehrawat said the restaurant owner has himself closed the establishment after the closure notice was issued. “Denying entry to people for wearing traditional Indian attire is outrageous. Such bans cannot be imposed and ideally an FIR should have been filed. Sari is a dignified attire. Movement of people cannot be stopped based on such whimsical rules,” Sehrawat said.Last week, a woman alleged that she was refused entry to a south Delhi restaurant because she was wearing a saree. She also posted a short video of her argument with the restaurant staff.Dutt demanded that the civic body should issue directions to all the restaurants and hotels that a fine of ₹5 lakh will be levied for discrimination against women wearing traditional Indian attire. Dutt also demanded a probe into how the eatery was running without a valid licence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/south-delhi-restaurant-that-denied-entry-to-woman-shuts-101632940705165.html
30-09-2021||Mumbai||Crops on 1.1 mn hectares in central Maharashtra damaged in torrential rain||The downpour in central Maharashtra and other parts of the state has caused heavy damage to standing crops of Kharif season. The crops on 1.1 million hectares in central Maharashtra have been damaged in the past two days, while the consolidated damage to the crops in this monsoon this year is expected to go up to 2.2 million hectares, according to the state government’s figures. The state government is expected to take a call over the relief to affected farmers in the cabinet meeting next week. The death toll of the heavy rainfall in the last three days stand at 17, while the consolidated figure of loss of lives in the monsoon since June 1 has reached 436. Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said that the spot assessment of the losses suffered by the farmers will begin soon. “As per the preliminary estimates, the losses due to the rainfall in the past two days due to cyclone Gulab is worth Rs8,000 crore. We have directed all collectors to complete the spot assessment at the earliest so that the compensation is distributed at the earliest,” he said. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray took a review of the situation of the heavy rainfall in the state over last three days. CM was apprised that the state received 26mm rain in 24 hours, leading to flooding in parts of the state. Many districts recorded more than 100 mm rainfall in 24 hours. Shirdhon in Latur, Govindpur in Aurangabad and Dhoki Jakachi received 171, 107 and 140mm respectively in 24 hours. “The discharge of the water from various dams led to the flooding in villages near the dam. One team each of NDRF was deployed in Osmanabad, Beed and Aurangbad have rescued more than 100 people in these and other districts in central Maharashtra. 16 villagers stranded in submerged villages were airlifted by the Air Force rescue team, while 20 were rescued in boats.50 people in Latur and 26 in Aurangabad were rescued safely,” statement issued by CM office has stated. CM Thackeray has also asked the district administration to ensure that the students who could not reach the exam centres for the common entrance test (CET) because of the flooding in their respective districts, should be given the opportunity to reappear for the exams. The district authorities have also been asked to ensure that the information about the new dates of exams should be properly disseminated to the students. Meanwhile, higher and technical eduation minister later announced that the CET for the flood affected students will be conducted on October 9 and 10.Wadettiwar has slammed the central government for the inadequate financial assistance for the natural calamities the state faced in the last two years. “We asked for Rs1,065.58 crore for the losses in Nisarg cyclone in the monsoon last year, against which we received Rs268.59 crore. Similarly, against the demand of Rs999.64 crore for the losses in downpour in eastern Vidharbha last year, we were given merely Rs151.53 crore. We received only Rs701 crore for the losses due to the flooding in October last year, against the actual losses of Rs3,821.29 crore. We have sent the memorandums of Rs1,679 crore for the losses in July this year and Rs203 crore for the losses in cyclone Tauktae, but there is no response from the centre to the demand, as yet,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/crops-on-1-1-mn-hectares-in-central-maha-damaged-in-torrential-rain-in-three-days-101632940643235.html
30-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Preparations begin as Ramlila groups greet green light for festivities||With the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday giving the nod to hold Ramlila celebrations, a few organising committees said they were quite ready and happy to hold the Ramlila this year, and compensate for the loss of festivities last year. Others said the celebrations this year, too, will be muted, as the pandemic threat is yet to abate.According to the DDMA, Ramlila organisers will have to ensure that the number of people does not exceed the venue’s total seating capacity, and that no stalls or fairs are set up. They should also ensure 100% mask compliance, and have separate entry/exit points for visitors. These conditions are similar to those laid down for Durga Puja pandals, which were also allowed by the DDMA on Wednesday. A few other restrictions are likely, and the DDMA is expected to notify these in the coming days.Arjun Kumar, secretary, Luv Kush Ramlila Committee, which organises the Ramlila on the Red Fort grounds, said they are fully prepared for the celebrations. “Our tents have reached the ground and we will start work on the light and sound arrangements on Thursday. Artistes from Mumbai will start arriving soon...,” said Kumar.He said the preparations are more this year, as festivities could not take place last year due to Covid-19. “Dance groups will put up special performances and the stage theme will be changed daily,” said Kumar.He said after discussions with officials, it was decided that there will be six-feet space between chairs for the audience, and only 50% of the ground capacity will be allowed. “We will aim for 25-30% occupancy to ensure compliance with Covid-19 protocols,” said Kumar.Also, only vaccinated individuals and artistes will be allowed to enter the premises, the committee said. The committee has tied up with television channels and a few media outlets for live streaming the Ramlila.Dhiraj Dhar Gupta, general secretary, Shri Dharmik Lila Committee, Lal Qila Maidan, among the oldest committees in Delhi, said, “We are planning to hold the Ramlila in a single day at an auditorium and not on the grounds. Our committee has almost decided not to perform Ramlila itself. In a day or two, we will tale a final call,” said Gupta.Harish Rawat, general secretary, Shri Ramlila Samiti, GTB Enclave, said while the committee was ready with preparations, it was waiting for the release of the SOP. “The festivities will be held in a new place as a Covid hospital has come up on the grounds where Ramlila used to be held earlier. Our preparations are done and we plan to call artistes from Moradabad for the Ramlila,” said Rawat.Some organisers said the permission came too late and they did not have sufficient time for the preparations. Suresh Bindal, president of Sri Ramlila Committee Indraprastha Vistar, said, “A grand Ramlila will not take place this year. Had the government given permission 15 days ago, we would have organised the Ramlila at the ground. Instead, we will hold a five-day Ramlila at IPAX Bhawan in IP Extension.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-preparations-begin-as-ramlila-groups-greet-green-light-for-festivities-101632940403245.html
30-09-2021||Delhi||Over 92% DL applications cleared through ‘faceless services’: Delhi govt||The Delhi government’s transport department has managed to clear over 92% of driving licence-related applications through “faceless services” since February this year, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Wednesday.Data shared by the minister showed that between February 19 and September 27, the department received 216,835 applications for vehicle-related services, of which 173,165 (80%) were approved. During the same period, the department also received 208,224 DL applications, of which 193,645 (92%) were cleared.The learner’s DL facility, which was added to the list of faceless services offered on August 7, saw 57,755 applications of which 45,495 (78.77%) received it without stepping out of their homes.“More than a month ago, it was a huge leap of faith that the Delhi government took in the direction of public service delivery. We acknowledge that there are still challenges that a project of such a large scale are throwing at us, but I assure you that we are constantly striving to make this process seamless, and it is heartening to see other states moving towards faceless service delivery,” said Gahlot, who held a review meeting on Wednesday.During the meeting, the minister instructed officers to expedite the process of resolving the technical issues, pendency and grievances related to faceless services. He also asked them to ensure that the user experience of transport services be pleasant so that a benchmark in public service delivery is established in the entire country.To keep track of the faceless system, the transport department has set up three hubs at deputy commissioner’s offices in Dwarka, Sheikh Sarai and Surajmal Vihar. A grievance redressal mechanism has also been set up to address the grievances of the applicants through a central grievance control room at transport headquarters in Civil Lines, in addition to a helpline (1076) and a WhatsApp chatbot (8588820000). People can also visit www.transport.delhi.gov.in for grievances.The transport department has also further extended the validity of documents related to fitness, permit, DL and registration that expired between February 2020 and September 30, 2021, till November 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-92-dl-applications-cleared-through-faceless-services-delhi-govt-101632940344371.html
30-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt has power to implement its new excise policy, says high court||Observing that the state government has the power, jurisdiction and authority to float a new excise policy, the Delhi high court on Wednesday refused to stay the closure of retail vends with L7 licenses, which are valid till September 30.“Prima facie, the respondent (Delhi government) has all the powers and jurisdiction to float a new excise policy under the Delhi Excise Act, 2009 and its rules,” a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh said.The court, while hearing an application by an L7 licence holder — Rattan Singh — asking for a stay on the closure of 260 retail vends with L7 and L10 licenses out of 849 private vends, said “change is inevitable” and the new excise policy is no exception to this rule.The application was part of a petition seeking to extend the license in parity with other categories under the provisions of the Delhi Excise Act. There are a total 35 categories of licenses for liquor traders.“Something is being stopped so that new things are created in a systematic manner as per the policy. Whenever, any new policy comes, there is bound to be changes…It is never the intention of the government that 260 places in malls or commercial places, will be closed but they will be restarted as per new policy.“Temporarily you may feel that you have been closed down but it’s a policy decision. Today you are closed down, but immediately somebody will open. The person may not be important, but the place is..,” the bench remarked during the hearing.Delhi has 849 liquor stores, of which 276 are privately run. The rest are run by the Delhi government. The private vends have to shut shop from October 1 to ensure a smooth transition to the new excise regime, which kicks in from November 17.The state government is trying to pave the way for a range of sweeping reforms to boost the city’s revenue, crack down on the liquor mafia and improve user experience under the new state excise policy.The city has been divided into 32 zones and allotment of licenses is now being done on a zonal basis.Only about 408 liquor vends in Delhi will be operational for 46 days starting Friday, as the city transitions to a new excise regime from November 17.The court noted, “It ought to be kept in mind that change is inevitable. The excise policy is no exception to this rule. New experiments are always being permitted as a matter of a policy. Prima facie we do not want to prejudge the resultant effect of the new policy.”The bench, in an interim order, said that the new mechanism did not violate any of the petitioner’s rights.Senior counsels Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, informed the court that with effect from November 16, even the government vends will shut, and so it is important that the transition to the new policy is “peaceful and harmonious”.Supply shortage forces customers to Noida, GgmHowever, the closure of private liquor vends for 46 days from Friday, however, has led to a severe supply shortage in the city, with shelves in Delhi stores nearly empty, forcing customers to head to neighbouring Noida and Gurugram to procure their stock.Animesh Sinha, a resident of Ashok Vihar Phase 4 in North Delhi, wrapped up his work early at around 5pm on Wednesday so he could go to Madhushala, a private liquor vend in the area, to stock up for the next few weeks. On reaching the shop, he was welcomed by a board stuck on the store’s shutter that read “permanently closed”. “This is heartbreaking. This shop was just walking distance from my house. It has been my go-to place for buying alcohol for about five years now,” he said.The ongoing transition phase has also forced manufacturers to postpone their supply schedules. For instance, American spirits major Brown-Forman, the maker of popular liquor brand Jack Daniel’s, has pushed the Delhi launch of its new Tennessee Apple flavoured whiskey by about three months.“We launched Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Apple in Gurugram last month... But, we will be able to launch the product in the Delhi market only by late November or early December, once the city’s new excise policy comes into effect and new retail stores become operational,” said Siddharth Wadia, Director and general manager, IMENA, Brown-Forman.(With inputs from Sweta Goswami)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-has-power-to-implement-its-new-excise-policy-says-hc-101632939804223.html
30-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi top cop begins probe into Unitech promoters’ violation of prison rules, visits Tihar||Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana has recorded the statements of at least three Tihar jail superintendents, four deputy superintendents and other prison officers in connection with the investigation into allegations that jailed Unitech ex-promoters Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra violated prison rules and ran a “secret underground office” in south Delhi from inside Tihar jail with the help of jail officers, officials aware of the development said.The Supreme Court on August 26 ordered the Delhi Police commissioner to personally look into the role of prison officials in the case. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) which is probing cases against the former Unitech bosses told the apex court about alleged irregularities.On the orders of the court, one of the Chandra brothers has been shifted to the Arthur Road Jail and the other to Taloja jail in Maharashtra.Last week, the jail officials were called to the Delhi Police headquarters and questioned by Asthana.Officials privy to the matter also said that Asthana visited the prison complex a few days ago for a spot visit to jail number 7, where the Chandra brothers were lodged until August 28 morning.To be sure, the officers questioned are yet to be named as an accused in the case. Their statements were recorded as part of the inquiry, officials quoted above said.A prison officer, who asked not to be named, said, “Two weeks ago, a team of officers came to jail number 7 where the Unitech brothers were lodged. The officers took records of the two men’s stay inside the prison. Before the team came to Tihar, the commissioner’s office also wrote to the prison’s director-general seeking details of officers posted in jail number 7. After gathering the relevant documents, the superintendents were called to police headquarters. Each one of them was questioned by the commissioner. After that, he came to inspect jail 7, where they were lodged.”Delhi Police are likely to submit the findings of the inquiry to the Supreme Court on Friday.The Chandra brothers were arrested in April 2017 for duping homebuyers in 74 Unitech projects.The two were also being probed by the ED. In a report to the apex court last month, the ED said the two men used the prison complex to transfer the “proceeds of crime”, and were instructing their people outside to dispose of their properties. The ED said that it also unearthed a secret underground office’ in Delhi, which was being operated by erstwhile Unitech founder Ramesh Chandra, and was visited by his two sons – Sanjay and Ajay – when they were on parole or bail.A second prison officer, who too asked not to be named, said, “The police chief wanted details of how Sanjay and Ajay Chandra got access to cell phones and a desktop in prison. The officials from jail 7 have submitted the court orders on the basis of which the facility was given to them so that they could sell their property and return money to the homebuyers.”Jail officials said that the facility was stopped by the courts in May 2019. Police are checking if the two men provided fake court orders to the prison department post-May 2019, and are also probing if jail officers were negligent in checking the authenticity of the papers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-top-cop-begins-probe-into-unitech-promoters-violation-of-prison-rules-101632939503067.html
30-09-2021||Delhi||DDMA gives nod for Durga Puja, Dussehra celebrations in Delhi, but with curbs||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday decided to allow Ramlila, Dussehra and Durga Puja celebrations this year in public places but with a set of restrictions. However, the authority is yet to issue an order regarding the decisions taken at Wednesday’s meeting.Organisers will have to ensure the number of people in a venue does not exceed the number of seats, DDMA said, even as it disallowed stalls and fairs. Additionally, organisers have also been asked to ensure there is 100% mask compliance, and separate entry and exit points are provided for, apart from a few other restrictions that the authority will soon notify in a standard operating procedure (SOP) document, said three officials aware of the matter.Delhi’s lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Wednesday said that DDMA will consider allowing schools in the city to resume in-person classes for students of classes 6 to 8 after the festive season.Baijal said in a series of tweets: “Chaired the 25th meeting of DDMA to review the COVID19 situation in Delhi... As suggested by the experts, it was decided to consider opening middle school classes 6-8, after the festive season. All the stakeholders were called upon to work in a coordinated manner towards ensuring adequate preparedness for tackling any future challenges.”Currently schools are allowed to conduct in-person sessions for students in Class 9 and above.This year Dussehra will be celebrated on October 15, Diwali on November 4 and Chhath Puja on November 10.Baijal is the chairperson of DDMA, and CM Arvind Kejriwal is its vice-chairperson.“In the wake of the upcoming festive season, Delhi Police and the district administration will ensure Vividh (various) appropriate behaviour enforcement and take care that gatherings during the festive season are strictly in compliance with the laid down SOPs that include no standing crowds, separate entry and exit points, appropriate social distancing for seating, no activities (like fares, stalls and giant wheel etc) that attract crowds in violation of social distancing and onus on organisers for ensuring SOPs are followed,” said a senior official in Raj Niwas who was present in Wednesday’s meeting.The decisions come as the Capital’s Covid-19 caseload is at its lowest levels since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year. Delhi on Wednesday added 41 Covid-19 cases at a positivity rate of 0.06%, and no deaths.The city added an average of 34 cases each day over the past seven days, even as the test positivity rate continued to remain below the 0.10% mark consistently since mid-August. The city has added just five deaths of the infection so far this month.Last year, the DDMA prohibited Durga Puja committees from organising public celebrations, and Ramlila committees were asked to opt for live streaming. Burning of effigies in Dussehra was allowed in a few locations, with restrictions on the size of crowds.Arjun Kumar, general secretary of Luv Kush Ramleela committee, said: “We met government officials several times in the past few week and assured them that we will ensure all safety regulations are followed. We are happy that the government has trusted us. However, we will continue to live stream the Ramleela on social media and we have tied up with cable operators too.”Robin Bose, general secretary of the Durga Puja committee in Kashmere Gate, said: “We will ensure that all regulations are strictly adhered to. Safety of people comes first. We hope that the process of taking permission from the police and sub-divisional magistrate’s office is expedited too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ddma-gives-nod-for-durga-puja-dussehra-celebrations-in-delhi-but-with-curbs-101632938903390.html

Within minutes of Gogi’s entering the court, two gunmen, who were in lawyers’s attire shot Gogi dead. The two gunmen, who are members of Tillu gang, were shot dead by the police team. Until his arrest in March 2020, Gogi, a resident of Alipur in outer Delhi was the most wanted gangster in Delhi. He had at least 19 cases of murder, robbery, extortion.A senior police officer, who asked not to be named, said, “The crime branch team reached Mandoli jail in the evening and questioned Tillu. He is our primary suspect in the case. The information we have is that he had planned the conspiracy of getting people to pose as lawyers and shooting at Gogi inside the court. He was actively in touch with all the gunmen and other accomplices for over a week before the shootout on Friday.”The officer quoted above said police questioned Tillu to find out about the people who were involved in the shooting.“After Tillu there are other prisoners such as Sunil Rathi and Naveen Bali, who too are suspected to have helped Tillu in hiring the gunmen. Rathi is lodged in Baghpat jail. He knew one of the gunmen Rahul Tyagi alias Nitin. They met in Baghpat jail,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rohini-court-shootout-police-question-tillu-tajpuriya-in-mandoli-jail-101632938784265.html
30-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: SDMC rolls back tax hikes for commercial properties||With just months left for the Delhi municipal polls, which are likely to be held early next year, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to reduce the property tax rates for several non-residential and commercial categories.According to the proposal passed by the corporation’s standing committee on Tuesday, the tax rate hikes — these came into effect in July 2020 — will now be rolled back, leading to a reduction of 20-50% in tax for properties such as guest houses, banquet halls, recreational clubs, and telecom towers, among others.According to the revision, the property tax for educational institutions, colleges and schools will now be calculated based on the fee structure of the establishment.The property tax in the city is calculated based on six factors — the total covered area, the unit area values (per square metre (sqm)), age of the property, occupancy, structural factor and use factor.Most of the changes have been made in use factor and occupancy factor, south civic body officials said. The tax rates in these categories were increased on July 27, 2020, through the implementation of the recommendations of the third Municipal Valuation Committee (MVC) report.Col (retd) BK Oberoi, the standing committee chairman, SDMC, said changes will be reflected in eight categories. “The property taxes of schools and educational institutions will now be based on the tuition fee being charged by the institute. For schools charging a fee less than ₹600 per month, the use factor will be 1; for the ₹600-1,200 fee category, use factor will be 2; and for educational institutes charging ₹1,200 or more as monthly fee, the use factor will be 3,” he said.A senior municipal corporation official said the biggest change will be for the properties where telecom towers have been installed as the use-factor for such properties has been brought down from 4 to 2. “For example, if property tax for such a property was ₹1,000, after the application of use factor 4, the owner had to pay ₹4,000. Now as per the use factor 2, the owner need only pay ₹2,000,” the official said, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-sdmc-rolls-back-tax-rate-hikes-for-several-commercial-properties-101632938722933.html

According to the revised plan, the engineered landfill will come up at a cost of ₹53.89 crore.“In one of the review meetings of DEMS (department of environment management services) by the municipal commissioner, it has been decided that the area of deemed forest, which is approximately 7.3 acres and which was included in the initial proposal, will not be considered because it may take time for cutting of trees,” said the proposal cleared by the SDMC standing committee.A senior municipal official overseeing the project stated that the green area has been de-linked from the engineered landfill project site to avoid further delays.“We will keep pursuing the environment ministry to obtain the clearance and necessary permissions for 7.3 acre land,” the official stated.A senior official from DEMS department said that the new engineered landfill will have a life span of 12 years, and it will be made operational in 18 months.An engineered landfill will follow scientific systems for storing waste and have measures to prevent leachate from polluting groundwater.Landfills in the national capital are currently open dumping grounds and does not have specific systems to avoid leachate or follow other scientific methods of waste management.Standing committee chairman Col (retd) BK Oberoi said, “...we will not face solid waste disposal related problems at the landfill.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-sdmc-to-drop-7-acres-of-deemed-forest-land-from-landfill-project-101632937717493.html

30-09-2021||World||Facebook official defends platform’s policies for young users amid criticism over inaction on research||Amid the ongoing criticism about Facebook’s handling of its internal research team’s findings, an executive from the company defended it in front of the US Congress and said that the company is working towards the protection of young users of its platforms, according to several news reports.Antigone Davis, head of global safety in Facebook, said that “safe and age appropriate” experiences for teenage users have been implemented by the company. “We have put in place multiple protections to create safe and age-appropriate experiences for people between the ages of 13 and 17,” the Associated Press (AP) reported quoting a written testimony by Davis to a US Senate Commerce Subcommittee.Further, the company also has disputed a recent news report by the Wall Street Journal which claimed that Facebook has failed to fix the “ill effects” of the platform which its researchers have identified. Also, the report said that Facebook has played down such negative effects of its photo and video sharing platform Instagram on young users. The report also cited a slide from one of Facebook’s internal presentations which said, “We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.”Also read | ‘Instagram Kids’: Facebook pauses project after criticismHowever, Facebook has already responded to the report and has denied it. “It is simply not accurate that this research demonstrates Instagram is “toxic” for teen girls. The research actually demonstrated that many teens we heard from feel that using Instagram helps them when they are struggling with the kinds of hard moments and issues teenagers have always faced,” a statement from Facebook’s head of research Pratiti Raychoudhury said.Meanwhile, Davis told the US Senate that the company conducts such research to proactively identify areas of improvement for the platform. “We conduct this research, to make our platform better, to minimise the bad and maximise the good and to proactively identify where we can improve,” the BBC quoted her as saying.“We want our platforms to be a place for meaningful interactions with friends and family and we cannot achieve that goal if people do not feel safe,” she further said.However, Richard Blumenthal, US Senator from the Democratic Party, said that the company chose the growth of its product over the well-being of its users, the BBC report showed. Also he said that Facebook was not holding itself accountable and questioned how the platform could be trusted.Among the major impacts following the criticism due to the WSJ report, the company had earlier in the week announced that it is pausing its plan to develop a version of Instagram, popularly known as Instagram Kids, for children under the age of 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-official-defends-platform-s-policies-for-young-users-amid-criticism-over-inaction-on-research-101633021238393.html

Anaamullah Samangai, a member of the Cultural Commission of the Information and Culture Ministry, said their efforts are useless, reported Tolo News."Now there is and will be no opportunity for such opportunistic people to deceive the international community from the address of Afghanistan and the people of Afghanistan," said Samangani.The Afghanistan embassy in Switzerland issued a statement claiming that the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is the only legitimate government of Afghanistan elected by the votes of people, reports said. "After the escape of Ashraf Ghani and his rupture with the Afghan politics, his first vice-president (Amrullah Saleh) will be leading the country," the statement said.Based on the historic responsibility of the Afghan government and after consulting with the elders of the country, the government in exile has been announced, the statement said, adding that the three powers of the government namely executive, judicial, and legislative will be activated soon. It also announced its support to the Panjshir resistance front- the anti-Taliban front led by Ahmad Masoud- and has added that all the embassies and consulates of Afghanistan will be functional as normal, ANI reported. The statement has also called on all "friendly" and "partner" countries to maintain relations with the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and to avoid granting legitimacy to the Taliban.Where are Panjshir leaders? Reports said Amrullah Saleh, Ahmed Massoud have been given protection in Dushanbe, Tajikistan's capital. The opposition leaders are using Dushanbe as their base to plan their next steps, reports said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/useless-taliban-say-amrullah-saleh-s-govt-in-exile-won-t-be-able-to-deceive-world-101633020722093.html

Thank you.” For those not familiar with okonomiyaki, it’s a savory pancake filled with cabbage that’s cooked on a griddle, with various extras like meat and fish and topped with sauce. A variation of the dish is a regional specialty in Osaka and is considered a soul food for Hiroshima, Kishida’s constituency. He is by no means a prominent voice among politicians on Twitter, with just around 180,000 followers. That’s a long way behind the 2.4 million followers of Taro Kono, the avid Twitter and Instagram user he beat to the top job. Kishida will have to tread carefully as he learns how to operate social media platforms. An Instagram photo of his wife cooking him dinner during last year’s LDP leadership election, when he lost to outgoing prime minister Yoshihide Suga, was met with a backlash for coming across as sexist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-new-pm-s-okonomiyaki-photo-gives-his-twitter-profile-a-boost-101633017505359.html

It took two BRICS countries, India and South Africa, to argue for a TRIPS waiver for vaccines in the WTO”, he said. Misri was referring to the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).In a landmark move, India and South Africa in October last year had asked the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to allow all countries to choose to neither grant nor enforce patents and other intellectual property related to Covid-19 drugs, vaccines, diagnostics and other technologies for the duration of the pandemic, until global herd immunity is achieved.The proposal has gained momentum and 63 countries have co-sponsored the draft as of May 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brics-bank-an-act-of-great-foresight-says-indian-envoy-to-china-101633014690364.html
30-09-2021||World||US lost the Afghan war, Kabul collapse rooted in Doha accord, say top US generals||Top US generals told lawmakers at a congressional hearing that America lost the Afghanistan war and that it was caused by miscalculations spanning several administrations and the August collapse of the erstwhile government in Kabul could be traced to the 2020 agreement with the Taliban.“It wasn’t lost in the last 20 days or even 20 months. There’s a cumulative effect to a series of strategic decisions that go way back,” chairman of the joint chiefs of staff General Mark Milley told the armed services committee of the House of Representatives, on Wednesday.“Strategically, the war is lost - the enemy is in Kabul,” he went to say, referring to the Taliban taking power in Kabul.General Milley cited several reasons that he said needed to be looked at such as the decision to shift forces from Afghanistan for the war in Iraq and the failure to “effectively deal with Pakistan”, where many of figures sought by US-led coalition forces sound shelter. General Milley had spoken of the Pakistan’s sanctuaries also at an Afghanistan hearing in the US senate, and called for a need to review Islamabad’s behaviour. Secretary of state Antony Blinken had earlier said ties with Pakistan were under review because of its duplicitous role in Afghanistan, where, he added, it had been “hedging its bets”.General Frank McKenzie, the head of the US Central Command that ran the war in Afghanistan, told lawmakers that the rapid collapse of President Ashraf Ghani’s government in Kabul, which had caught the US completely unprepared, could be traced to the agreement that the Trump administration had signed with the Taliban in Doha in February 2020.“The signing of the Doha agreement had a really pernicious effect on the government of Afghanistan and on its military - psychological more than anything else, but we set a date certain for when we were going to leave and when they could expect all assistance to end,” General McKenzie said.The Trump administration had kept the Ashraf Ghani government completely out of the agreement, which had set a timeline for the US and international forces to leave Afghanistan by May 1 of 2021, based on some conditions, which the generals also told the lawmakers, were largely not unfulfilled with one exception that the Taliban will not attack US or coalition forces.Defence secretary Lloyd Austin testified alongside Milley and Mckenzie and generally agreed with the generals’ assessments of the way the Afghanistan war unfolded over 20 days and how it ended. The three officials had earlier told the US senate that they had recommended to the president that the US should retain 2,5000 personnel in Afghanistan, contradicting Biden, who had claimed he did not get that advice.Mckenzie further said that cutting troops to below 2,500 “was the other, sort of, nail in the coffin”. “It has been my position in my judgement, that if we went below an advisory level of 2,500, I believe that the government of Afghanistan would likely collapse and that the military would follow; one might go before the other but I believe that was going to be the inevitable result of drawing down to zero and I’ve expressed that opinion writing for quite a while now,” said the top US general for the Afghanistan war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lost-the-afghan-war-kabul-collapse-rooted-in-doha-accord-say-top-us-generals-101633013670659.html
30-09-2021||World||Taliban shut escape routes as citizens desperately flee Afghanistan||Thousands of Afghans trying to escape the misery at home have flocked to their country's southern border with Pakistan, but their attempts to get across have been stopped by the Taliban.Zakariullah, sitting on a dirt road in the trading town of Spin Boldak only a few hundred metres from Pakistan, says he has been turned back more than half a dozen times, sometimes violently."They say only people from the area with papers," Zakariullah, a 25-year-old farmer and father of three, told AFP on the weekend."We want to cross the border to work there because there are no jobs here."The new Taliban rulers insist Afghans need to stay and rebuild their conflict-ravaged country."They tell people 'It's your country. You should not leave'," said 25-year-old Rahmadin Wardak, who was also trying to flee.On the other side, their Pakistani counterparts in Chaman were also stopping those attempting to cross."Every day, 8,000 to 9,000 people try to cross the border without having the necessary papers, and are turned back," one Taliban border guard, Mullah Maulvi Haqyar, told AFP.Maulvi Noor Mohammad Saeed, a Taliban official in Kandahar province, confirmed the authorities were asking "people and families to not leave the country"."Doing that, you lose respect for your Afghan culture," he told AFP.Sticks and pipesAt the border, only day labourers and traders -- all young men wearing traditional flat pakol hats and sweating under the weight of their goods -- were allowed to cram into a narrow corridor topped with barbed wire that led to the next checkpoint.A second corridor for other travellers lay mostly empty, with a few exceptions including elderly men and women loaded onto wheelbarrows seeking urgent healthcare in Pakistan.But scores of Afghans are eager to leave a country on the verge of economic collapse since the Islamists seized power in mid-August and foreign aid money dried up.Jobs have vanished while farmers are struggling with the impact of a drought.The United Nations has warned a third of the population is facing the threat of famine.Zakariullah, whose farmland was 600 kilometres in Kabul province, said he now hoped to find work in Pakistan. He would then send for his wife and children to join him.But, like many others at the border crossing, the journey to Spin Boldak has stripped away his meagre savings.Mohammed Arif said he left his home in Nangarhar in the east because he had "no money, no food to feed my eight children".Commotion erupted outside the border office as hundreds pleaded with the Taliban to let them through, during a visit by AFP on the weekend.Guards wielding sticks and pipes tried to control the frenzied scene as a crush of people pushed to get across to sell their possessions -- and keep hunger at bay for a few more hours.None of them made it.Critical situationBefore the Covid pandemic and recent upheavals, the border was mostly open, with few restrictions for the tens of thousands who crossed daily.But when the Taliban seized Spin Boldak early on in their dizzying offensive, Pakistan shut the gates and left huge crowds of stranded travellers to amass on both sides.The crossing reopened when the hardline group ousted the US-backed government and assumed power in mid-August.More Afghans arrived, fearing the Taliban would return to their brutal rule in the 1990s."At first, lots of people could cross," said Sami Ul Haq, who monitors the crossing point for the UN refugee agency UNHCR. "Before we had up to 24,000 people coming a day."There were few restrictions at the crossing during the last two weeks of August, but then the Taliban and Pakistanis clamped down.And on Thursday, the Taliban said they were shuttering the gates completely in protest against Pakistan -- which has repeatedly said it would not accept Afghan refugees -- accusing officials of creating hurdles for Afghans with the right papers.The UNHCR has meanwhile not reported huge movements of people towards the borders.With the war over, some Afghan refugees living in Pakistan have even returned.But the agency last month said it was preparing contingency plans for up to 500,000 rushing into neighbouring countries by the end of the year."We need to prepare in case any change inside the country could trigger a massive displacement," Bertrand Blanc, a UNHCR senior emergency officer, told AFP in Islamabad."For the moment, we are in a wait and see situation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-shuts-escape-routes-as-citizens-desperately-flee-afghanistan-101633010799489.html
30-09-2021||World||China grapples with worst power outages in decades||China on Thursday continued to grapple with its worst power outages in decades with several provinces ordering industries to cut down or even shut production and urging millions of residents to use electricity judiciously.A number of provinces and regions including Liaoning and Jilin in northeast China, the trading powerhouse Guangdong in the south and Zhejiang in the east have been in the grip of power shortage for weeks now.Central authorities are scrambling to deliver more coal to power plants to restore supply as three provinces in the northeast Liaoning, Heilongjiang and Jilin, the worst hit and home to nearly 100 million people, face long hours of power cuts.A state media report quoted the China National Coal Association and China Coal Transportation and Distribution Association as pointing out a tightening trend in coal supplies nationwide, and said that the prospect of ensuring ample supplies for the upcoming winter season, when coal demand peaks, is not optimistic. The widespread outages have triggered speculation about disruption of the global supply chain and even a slowdown in the world’s second largest economy, official news agency, Xinhua said in a comment piece on Thursday.China’s state planner on Wednesday ordered railway companies and provincial authorities to rush coal supplies to regions grappling with unprecedented power cuts, which have hit industrial production and forced residents to switch on mobile phones and light candles to go about their daily chores.“In the central province of Hunan, some building façade lighting and billboards are being turned off during peak hours. In the southern trade hub of Guangdong, some factories have been ordered to shut down for up to a week,” news website, Caixin reported.In Shenzhen, the power supply bureau urged the general public to use electricity scientifically, save electricity, and set the air-conditioning temperature above 26°C.Power shortage in industrial hubs in China is not rare but the ongoing crunch has also hit millions of households.The reasons behind the crisis are continuing shortage of coal, rising coal prices and efforts made by local governments to curtail industrial energy use and meet carbon reduction targets.“Actually, structural and cyclical factors explain the power crunch. As insiders have pointed out, power demand surged quickly after the developed coastal areas of China saw strong recovery momentum,” the Xinhua comment piece said on Thursday.Data from the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) showed that in the first six months, total electricity consumption increased 15.83% from the same period a year ago.“In addition, coal-fired power producers suffered losses due to an overwhelming rise in the cost of coal. The prices of thermal coal have hit a record high,” it said.“A key factor behind the rapid growth of electricity consumption in China is the post-pandemic economic recovery,” the Caixin report said.In turn, the crunch is cutting down production, driving industrial production costs and disrupting the global supply in the world’s second largest economy.Many Chinese factories have cut output or have halted production entirely with industry insiders telling state media that the situation could worsen as the winter season draws near.“A textile factory based in East China’s Jiangsu Province received a notice from local authorities about power cuts on September 21. It won’t have power again until October 7 or even later,” the Global Times reported earlier this week.China’s top planning body, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has taken measures to ensure that coal supply to major power plants are guaranteed through long-term contract with coal mines.“The National Energy Administration has sent work teams to Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang and Hunan to arrange for increasing coal and natural gas supply,” the Xinhua report said.China will make the public’s basic power needs the top priority of its power-supply work, ensuring that households stay safe and warm throughout this winter, the NDRC said.“Each railway company should strengthen coal transportation to power houses (utilities) with inventory of less than seven days and launch the emergency supply mechanism in a timely manner,” said the NDRC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-grapples-with-worst-power-outages-in-decades-101633003709449.html
30-09-2021||World||British police officer Wayne Couzens sentenced to whole-life jail term for kidnap, rape, murder||A British police officer who falsely arrested a woman for breaking coronavirus restrictions, then kidnapped, raped and murdered her, was given a rare whole-life jail term on Thursday.Judge Adrian Fulford told Wayne Couzens, 48, his offences were "grotesque", after he snatched Sarah Everard off the streets of south London in March this year.Everard's disappearance sparked one of Britain's most high-profile missing persons investigations and protests calling for better safety for women in public spaces.But there has been widespread horror and revulsion at the involvement of a police officer, who exploited lockdown restrictions and abused his position of trust to kill.Couzens, who served with the elite diplomatic protection unit of London's Metropolitan Police, admitted kidnapping, rape and murder at a hearing in July and was sacked.Sentencing him at the Old Bailey, in central London, Fulford called Couzens' actions "devastating, tragic and wholly brutal" and said his victim was "wholly blameless".Couzens, who will die in jail, becomes the latest of only 60 criminals who will never be considered for release."The misuse of a police officer's role such as occurred in this case in order to kidnap, rape and murder a lone victim is of equal seriousness as a murder for the purpose of advancing a political, religious ideological cause," Fulford said.Everard's family was in court to see her killer jailed. On Wednesday, they gave emotional statements describing the harrowing impact of her death."No punishment that you receive will ever compare to the pain and torture that you have inflicted on us," her father, Jeremy, told Couzens.The high-profile case refocused attention on how the police handle complaints of violence against women and girls in Britain.Questions have been raised about why previous complaints of indecent exposure against Couzens, said to have been a user of sex workers and violent pornography, were not dealt with.The leader of Britain's main opposition Labour party, Keir Starmer, a former chief prosecutor for England and Wales, said legislation needed to be tightened.He also called for a review of how Couzens was able to "slip through the net", despite a series of "warning signs".Starmer's Labour colleague, Harriet Harman, a former women's minister, called for the resignation of Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick."Women must be able to trust the police not fear them. Women's confidence in police will have been shattered," she said in a letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel and the Met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-police-officer-given-whole-life-jail-term-for-kidnap-rape-murder-101633002603116.html
30-09-2021||World||China-based infra bank lends $356mn for Chennai Metro rail system||The Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has approved a $356.67mn loan to India for the expansion of the Chennai Metro rail system as part of efforts to expand green public rail transport options in the country.The project involves the construction of an environment-friendly new corridor in Chennai’s metro network as part of Chennai Metro Rail Phase 2, the AIIB said in a statement on Thursday.China and India are the top two shareholders in the 103-member bank, which was set up in 2016 at Beijing’s initiative, and seen as its answer to an international finance system dominated by western countries.The Chennai project is the latest in the transport sector-related loans from the multilateral banking institute.“It (the project) will span from Lighthouse in the east to Poonamalee Bypass in the west to ensure seamless multimodal transport across Chennai by providing integrated access to suburban rail, bus stations and the city’s main airport,” the AIIB statement said, adding that the project will be implemented by the Chennai Metro Rail Limited.In addition, the project is expected to address traffic bottlenecks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by increasing public urban transport options.“This project is aligned with AIIB’s mandate to support high-quality and sustainable infrastructure. The improvement and integration of the transport sector in Chennai will further promote trade and economic growth,” DJ Pandian, AIIB vice president, investment operations, was quoted as saying in the statement.The project also aims to ensure safer mode of public transport for women in Chennai.“With this project, female passengers would have access to a safer and convenient mode of public transportation with knock-on effects such as increased opportunities to participate in school, work, and social activities,” the AIIB statement said.The residential and commercial establishments along the new corridor will also benefit from enhanced accessibility and connectivity as well as increased economic opportunities, the statement said.In addition to solar panels installed on the roofs of the elevated stations, the project will have dedicated spaces for bicycles and green vehicles, and signage to raise environmental awareness, the AIIB statement said, adding that the project also integrates climate change resilience features to reduce its vulnerability to climate-related events.Since the founding of the bank, New Delhi has emerged as the top borrower with the AIIB having approved 28 projects in India with a total amount of $6.7 billion.Energy and transport sectors in India have received the highest amount of AIIB’s financing.Earlier this year, AIIB president, Jin Liqun said that the AIIB kept lending to India despite domestic pressure during the border dispute between India and China is proof that the institution is not simply a tool for China’s strategic interests.“Bilateral conflicts between member states should not concern a multilateral institution,” he was quoted as saying by the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.“We cannot keep talking about international standards and best practices in normal times, but change when encountering difficulties,” Jin said in his speech.“Once trust is broken, it is very difficult to restore your reputation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinabased-infra-bank-lends-356mn-for-chennai-metro-rail-system-101633003049362.html
30-09-2021||World||China drafts new data security laws, defines 'ordinary' versus 'core' data||China published new draft measures on Thursday aimed at bolstering its new data security law, including definitions of what it considered "core" and "important" data.China implemented the Data Security Law on Sept. 1. which requires all companies in China to classify the data they handle into several categories and governs how such data is stored and transferred to other parties.But lawyers have criticised its ambiguities including its lack of definitions for data.Thursday's draft measures describe in detail three categories of data - ordinary data, important data, and core data.The authorities describe ordinary data as data with a minimal ability to impact society at large, or that will affect a small number of individuals or enterprises.Important data is defined as data that poses a threat to China's national and economic interests or impact the rights of individuals and organizations, and has an "obvious cascading effect" across a range of industries and enterprises.Core data, meanwhile, is defined as data that poses a "serious threat" to China's national and economic interests. Disruption of important data could cause "major damage," leading to "large-scale shutdowns," or "large-scale network and service paralysis."The regulator adds that organizations may "self-assess" the security of ordinary data, but must conduct annual assessments at least once each year.Organizations must also receive approval for cross-border transfer of core data and important data via a special mechanism, the rules state.Data policy has become one of several areas regulators have targeted amid an ongoing crackdown on industry that has unfolded throughout the past year. China's data security law builds on the 2017 cybersecurity law, which marked the first major set of rules governing the storage and transfer of data of Chinese origin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-drafts-new-data-security-laws-defines-ordinary-versus-core-data-101632998325823.html
30-09-2021||World||Former France prez Sarkozy convicted for illegally financing 2012 election bid||Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was found guilty of illegal campaign financing over his failed 2012 re-election bid by a Paris court on Thursday.It was the second guilty verdict this year for Sarkozy, who led France from 2007 to 2012 and retains influence among conservatives despite falling from grace over his legal woes.The court was yet to say what sentence he would receive.Prosecutors were seeking a one-year prison sentence, half of it suspended, for the 66-year old former president. He is in any case unlikely to go to jail immediately as he would be expected to appeal the sentence.His conservative party, the prosecutors said, spent nearly double the 22.5 million euros (currently $19.2 million) allowed under electoral law on extravagant campaign rallies and then hired a friendly public relations agency to hide the cost.Sarkozy has denied wrongdoing. He told the court in June that he had not been involved in the logistics of his campaign for a second term as president nor in how money was spent during the election run-up.But the court said that Sarkozy was made aware of the overspending, that he did not act on it, and that it was not necessary for him to approve each individual spending to be responsible.Sarkozy was found guilty in a separate trial in March of trying to bribe a judge and peddle influence in order to obtain confidential information on a judicial inquiry. He also denied any wrongdoing in that case.The former president was sentenced to three years in jail in that trial - two of which were suspended - but has not actually spent time in prison yet, while his appeal is pending.($1 = 1.1714 euros)(Reporting by Tangi Salaun and Ingrid Melander, Editing by Timothy Heritage)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-france-prez-sarkozy-convicted-for-illegally-financing-2012-election-bid-101632994182847.html
30-09-2021||World||US Congress moves to avert partial government shutdown||Congress is moving to avert one crisis while putting off another with the Senate poised to approve legislation that would fund the federal government into early December.The House is expected to approve the measure following the Senate vote Thursday, preventing a partial government shutdown when the new fiscal year begins Friday.Democrats were forced to remove a suspension of the federal government's borrowing limit from the bill at the insistence of Republicans. If the debt limit isn't raised by Oct. 18, the country would likely face a financial crisis and economic recession, says Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Republicans say Democrats have the votes to raise the debt ceiling on their own, and Republican leader Mitch McConnell is insisting that they do so.But the most immediate priority facing Congress is to keep the government running once the current fiscal year ends at midnight Thursday. The bill's expected approval will buy lawmakers more time to craft the spending bills that will fund federal agencies and the programs they administer.Meanwhile, Democrats are struggling over how to get President Joe Biden's top domestic priorities over the finish line. Those include a bipartisan infrastructure bill that contains $550 billion in new spending for roads, bridges, broadband and other priorities, as well as a $3.5 trillion slate of social, health and environmental programs.“With so many critical issues to address, the last thing the American people need right now is a government shutdown," said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.Schumer said the stopgap spending legislation will also provide aid for those reeling from Hurricane Ida and other natural disasters as well as funding to support Afghanistan evacuees from the 20-year war between the U.S. and the Taliban.Action in the final hours to avoid a partial government shutdown has become almost routine, with lawmakers usually able to fashion a compromise. The funding bill was slowed this time by disagreement over allowing the government to take on more debt so that it could continue to meet its financial obligations. Currently the borrowing cap is set at $28.4 trillion.The U.S. has never defaulted on its debts in the modern era, and historically both parties have voted to raise the limit. Democrats joined the Republican Senate majority in doing so three times during Donald Trump’s presidency. This time Democrats wanted to take care of both priorities in one bill, but Senate Republicans blocked that effort Monday.Raising or suspending the debt limit allows the federal government to pay obligations already incurred. It does not authorize new spending. McConnell has argued that Democrats should pass a debt limit extension with the same budgetary tools they are using to try to pass a $3.5 trillion effort to expand social safety net programs and tackle climate change.“There is no tradition of doing this on a bipartisan basis. Sometimes we have and sometimes we haven’t,” McConnell told reporters about past debt ceiling increases.House Democrats complained about the steps they were being forced to take as they approved a standalone bill late Wednesday that would suspend the debt ceiling until December 2022. That bill now heads to the Senate, where it is almost certain to be blocked by a Republican filibuster.“You are more interested in punishing Democrats than preserving our credit and that is something I’m having a real tough time getting my head around,” House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., told Republicans. “The idea of not paying bills just because we don’t like (Biden’s) policies is the wrong way to go.”But Republicans were undaunted. They argued that Democrats have chosen to ram through their political priorities on their own, and thus are responsible for raising the debt limit on their own.“So long as the Democratic majority continues to insist on spending money hand over fist, Republicans will refuse to help them lift the debt ceiling," said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla.McGovern said Republicans ballooned the debt under Trump and now are washing their hands of the consequences.“Republicans have now rediscovered the issue of the debt," McGovern said. "Where the hell were you the last four years?"The Treasury has taken steps to preserve cash, but once it runs out, it will be forced to rely on incoming revenue to pay its obligations. That would likely mean delays in payments to Social Security recipients, veterans and government workers, including military personnel. The Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank, projects that the federal government would be unable to meet about 40% of payments due in the several weeks that follow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-moves-to-avert-partial-government-shutdown-101632987850488.html

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny agreed with a petition from Spears saying that the arrangement “reflects a toxic environment”.Page Six quoted a source as saying that Britney was in "shock" and "at loss of words" but jumping with joy after the verdict. "She hasn't felt joy like this in 13 years," the report further said quoting the insider.Judge Penny agreed with a petition from Britney and her attorney that James Spears needs to give up his role as conservator. The decision comes months after the Britney Spears pleaded for her father's removal in dramatic court hearings, saying, “I want my life back.”“The current situation is untenable,” the judge said after hearing arguments from both sides.Britney Spears was not present at the hearing and did not participate in any way. Her father connected remotely but did not speak during the proceedings.With no objections to ending the conservatorship, Penny is likely to terminate it at a November 12 hearing, restoring the singer's life and money choices to her after years of increasingly vocal calls to #FreeBritney that she eventually joined.John Zabel, an accountant, has been appointed in James Spears' place and will be the temporary conservator until December 31.James sought the conservatorship in 2008 and had been its primary controller and biggest champion. He reversed course in recent weeks, asking the judge to end the conservatorship immediately, arguing that would render his removal pointless.The conservatorship was established when Britney Spears began to have public mental struggles as hordes of paparazzi aggressively followed her everywhere and she lost custody of her children.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britney-spears-father-suspended-from-conservatorship-singer-burst-into-tears-101632987774440.html
30-09-2021||World||Leading Rohingya activist killed in Bangladesh||One of the most well-known community leaders to have voiced the suffering of Rohingya refugees on the world stage was shot and killed in a refugee camp in southern Bangladesh on Wednesday, a United Nations spokesperson said. Mohibullah was in his late 40s. He was a teacher and an ardent advocate for the welfare of the Rohingya community who fled a military crackdown in Myanmar in 2017. More than 700,000 people were forced to flee to neighboring Bangladesh then.Most of them live together in a town called Cox's Bazar, the world's largest refugee settlement. Instances of violence have become increasingly rampant in the amps, with armed men often jostling for influence, kidnapping critics, and warning women against breaking conservative Islamic norms.Rafiqul Islam, a deputy police superintendent at Cox's Bazar, confirmed the news of the shooting to Reuters news agency as well. However, details about the incident are not fully clear yet.A ‘beacon of hope’Mohibullah established the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights, a group that tirelessly worked to highlight the plight of refugees living in camps.The group made its name by documenting the atrocities that were meted out to the community during the military crackdown. The UN had said that the crackdown of 2017 was carried out with genocidal intent.Mohibullah went from hut to hut to build a tally of killings, rape, and arson that he shared with international investigators. His organization also worked to give Rohingya people a voice of their own.He had told the UN Human Rights Council in 2019 that he wanted the Rohingya to be a part of the decisions that were being taken for them. He had also met former US President Donald Trump at the White House in 2019, where he spoke of the suffering of his community.Given his advocacy, Mohibullah also became the target of other hardliners who threatened to kill him."If I die, I'm fine. I will give my life," he told Reuters news agency in 2019.People mourn his deathA spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said the agency was "deeply saddened" by the killing of the activist."We are continuous contact with law enforcement authorities in charge of maintaining peace and security in the camps," a UNHCR spokesperson said.Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director of Human Rights, said Mohibullah's death not only undermined the struggle of the Rohingya community for greater rights, "but also their efforts to safely return to their homes in Myanmar."She said he was a "vital voice" for the community who had suffered "unimaginable loss and pain when they arrived as refugees in Bangladesh."Aung Kyaw Moe, a Rohingya civil society activist and an adviser to Myanmar's National Unity Government, the parallel civilian government established after February's coup, said Mohibullah knew there was always a threat to doing the work he did. But despite that, knew that "if he is not doing the work he is doing, no one else would."Organizations like the Amnesty International had raised concerns about violence in the camp in 2020, saying that authorities ought to take necessary action to protect refugees or there would be a serious risk of further bloodshed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leading-rohingya-activist-killed-in-bangladesh-101632979271450.html
30-09-2021||World||Overseas spectators banned from attending Beijing winter Olympics in 2022||Overseas fans have been banned from attending the Beijing 2022 winter Olympics while all unvaccinated athletes will be quarantined for 21 days ahead of the games, scheduled to begin on February 4.Tickets for the games will only be sold to mainland residents, which means domestic spectators will be allowed to watch the games following the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which was mostly played out in empty stadiums.All domestic and international Games participants and workforce will be tested daily for Covid-19, the Beijing 2022 Organising Committee told the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in a presentation on Wednesday.The winter multi-sport event, being held in China for the first time, is scheduled to take place from February 4-20 in Beijing and towns in the neighbouring Hebei province.Beijing will be the first capital to hold both the Winter and Summer Olympics, which was held in the Chinese capital in August, 2008.The IOC, while acknowledging the disappointment among international fans unable to attend the games, welcomed the decision to have Chinese spectators after the Tokyo 2020 summer Olympics in July were held with empty stadiums due to Covid-19 precautions.The presentation by China laid down the anti-Covid-19 protocols to be implemented ahead of the games. “All athletes and games participants who are fully vaccinated will enter a closed-loop management system upon arrival. Games participants who are not fully vaccinated will have to serve a 21-day quarantine upon arrival in Beijing,” the Xinhua news agency quoted the organising committee as saying in the presentation.“All vaccines recognised by World Health Organization or related international organisations, or approved officially by countries or regions concerned will be accepted. Athletes who can provide a justified medical exemption will have their cases considered,” the committee said.“All domestic and international Games participants and workforce in the closed-loop management system will be subject to daily testing,” it said.“As for the audience, Beijing 2022 organisers made it clear that tickets will be sold exclusively to spectators residing in China’s mainland who meet the requirements of Covid-19 countermeasures,” the organising committee added.According to the rules, from 23 January until the end of the Paralympics, a closed-loop management system will be implemented to ensure the safe delivery of the Games. “This closed-loop management system will cover all Games-related areas, including arrival and departure, transport, accommodation, catering, competitions, and the Opening and Closing Ceremonies. Within the closed loop, participants will be allowed to move only between Games-related venues for training, competitions, and work. A dedicated Games transport system will be put in place,” the committee said.The 12 competition venues have been completed while other facilities are scheduled to be finished by October.A 34-strong delegation from the Beijing organising committee for the 2022 Games was sent to Tokyo to hear from Japanese counterparts how to stage such an event during a pandemic, a state media report said earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/overseas-spectators-banned-from-attending-beijing-winter-olympics-in-2022-101632979467649.html
30-09-2021||World||International Translation Day: History and significance of September 30||September 30 is celebrated globally as International Translation Day by the International Federation of Translators (FIT) in honour of translation professionals. The said date was chosen because it coincides with the day of the feast of St. Jerome, who translated the Bible, and is considered as the patron saint of translators. Though FIT, since its establishment in 1953, has been observing this day, the first formal celebrations of the global translation day took place only in 1991. However, it was on May 24, 2017, when the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), through resolution 71/288, officially recognised September 30 as the date to celebrate International Translation Day. Total 11 countries were signatories to the draft resolution: Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Paraguay, Qatar, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Vietnam.United Nations describes International Translation Day as an “opportunity to pay tribute to the work of language professionals,” which, according to the world body, plays an important role in “bringing nations together, facilitating dialogue, understanding and cooperation, contributing to development and strengthening world peace and security.” Every year, since 2005, it invites all its employees, accredited permanent missions staff and students from partner universities to participate in the UN St. Jerome Translation contest.The competition rewards best translation works in languages such as Arabian, English, French, Mandarin, Russian, Spanish and German.Multilingualism, the UN says, is one of its "core values." The organisation employs hundreds of language staff at its offices across the globe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-translation-day-history-and-significance-of-september-30-101632976401312.html
30-09-2021||World||World Maritime Day 2021: Tributes pour in for seafarers who kept supply lines running amid Covid-19||World Maritime Day 2021 is being observed across the globe on September 30 in a tribute to the professionalism and sacrifice of the two million seafarers who served the world's merchant navy fleet even amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic situation. During these dire times – shipping played a major role in transporting vital medical supplies, food, and other basic goods that are significant for Covid-19 response and recovery. However, according to the United Nations, the seafarers themselves sacrificed aplenty – being stranded at sea for days as their contracts kept on being extended by many months. The 2021 theme for the ‘World Maritime Day’ respects the sacrifice made by the navy men: ‘Seafarers at the core of shipping's future.’World Maritime Day 2021: ThemeThe theme for the 2021 World Maritime Day is ‘seafarers at the core of shipping’s future.’ According to the United Nations, this year's theme “reflects a clear need to raise awareness of seafarersʹ crucial role in world trade and increase their visibility.” The world has seen how the seafarers have dedicated their valuable time during the Covid-19 period to ensure that the global supply chains keep functioning to deliver vital goods throughout the pandemic. “This could not happen without the professionalism and dedication of the world’s seafarers,” the UN has observed.World Maritime Day 2021 will highlight the work of seafarers at the heart of the maritime industry, while also promote activities that delve into specific topics relevant to the role of the seafarer in safety, maritime security, environmental protection, and seafarersʹ well-being; and the future of seafaring against a backdrop of increased digitalization and automation.World Maritime Day 2021: SignificanceAccording to the United Nations, the international shipping industry consists more than 80 per cent of the aggregate global trade among people and communities across the world. “Shipping is the most efficient and cost-effective method of international transportation for most goods; it provides a dependable, low-cost means of transporting goods globally, facilitating commerce and helping to create prosperity among nations and peoples,” it said.A safe and secure, as well as efficient, shipping industry is the backbone of successful maritime trade for any country and the globe as a whole. It is also capable of containing pollution to a minimum, and is an essential component of any programme for or future sustainable green economic growth in a sustainable manner.The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is looking to put more stress on the promotion of sustainable shipping and maritime development in the coming years. World Maritime Day 2021: HistoryThe need for an international day for the maritime industry came with the establishment of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), a specialised agency for the purpose. In 1948, the United Nations passed a resolution at an international conference in Geneva to establish the IMO for maintaining a comprehensive and regulatory framework for shipping. In 1982, the international maritime organization (IMO) took the name Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO).The main objective of the IMO is to focus on areas such as safety, environmental issues, legal issues, technical cooperation, maritime safety and maritime efficiency. World Maritime Day was celebrated for the first time on March 17, 1978.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-maritime-day-2021-tributes-pour-in-for-seafarers-who-kept-supply-lines-running-amid-covid19-101632975710320.html
30-09-2021||World||China's factory activity is now at its lowest since February last year||Chinese factory activity contracted in September to the lowest level since February 2020, when coronavirus lockdowns crippled the economy, official data showed Thursday, as the country faces waves of power outages and fears over instability in the real estate sector.The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) -- a key gauge of manufacturing activity in the world's second-largest economy -- slipped to 49.6 from 50.1 in August, the National Bureau of Statistics said.Any figure below the 50-point mark represents contraction, while above it indicates growth.It is the first time China's PMI has contracted since February last year when the domestic economy was battered by prolonged factory shutdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Factory suspensions and power blackouts have already affected at least 17 provinces in recent months -- a situation further exacerbated by tight coal supply leading to sky-high prices.The power cuts and local government restrictions on factories to cut energy use have led some major banks to lower their annual GDP forecast for China, with supply chains for international firms such as Apple and Tesla impacted.NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe said the PMI fell below the threshold due to "the relatively low prosperity of energy-intensive industries".The figure was slightly below the forecast of Bloomberg analysts, who expected a small rebound after successful containment of coronavirus outbreaks.While China's economy has largely bounced back from the initial blow of the pandemic, multiple outbreaks in recent months hit domestic tourism and manufacturing as wide swathes of the country were locked down.As a result, China's non-manufacturing PMI -- which measures activity in construction and services -- contracted in August for the first time since the pandemic began, but recovered in September to 53.2 from 47.5 last month.Default fears around Chinese property giant Evergrande -- bogged down in a $300 billion debt quagmire -- has hit consumer confidence, as the government tries to stop financial risk from spilling over into the rest of the property sector.Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said that the weak PMI would serve as an "alarm" for the government."Economic growth in Q4 will likely slow further without a change of government policies, and the pace of slowdown may pick up," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-factory-activity-is-now-at-its-lowest-since-february-last-year-101632973305314.html
30-09-2021||World||Myanmar may spiral into a ‘catastrophe’, UN calls for urgent action||The United Nations chief is urging unified regional and international action to prevent the crisis in Myanmar from becoming a large-scale conflict and multi-faceted “catastrophe” in the heart of Southeast Asia and beyond. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned in a report to the UN General Assembly circulated Wednesday that the opportunity to prevent the army from entrenching its rule could be narrowing and said it is urgent that regional and international countries help put Myanmar back on the path to democratic reform.When Myanmar's army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on February 1, it claimed with scant evidence that the general election her party won last November in a landslide was marred by widespread fraud. The takeover almost immediately sparked widespread street protests that security forces tried to crush. The pushback has left more than 1,100 people dead, according to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet and right groups.The United Nations has supported a five-point plan adopted by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which includes Myanmar, that calls for stopping violence, constructive dialogue, the appointment of an ASEAN special envoy as a mediator and humanitarian aid. It took until early August for ASEAN to pick Brunei's Second Foreign Minister Erywan Yusof as their special envoy, and he is reportedly still negotiating with the military on the terms of a visit.In the report, Guterres welcomed Yusof's appointment, called for “timely and comprehensive implementation of the five-point consensus to facilitate a peaceful solution,” and strongly encouraged ASEAN to work with the UN special envoy.His urgent call for a united international and regional response indicates that with ASEAN's slow movement, Guterres feels it is time for broader international action as well.“The risk of a large-scale armed conflict requires a collective approach to prevent a multi-dimensional catastrophe in the heart of Southeast Asia and beyond,” the secretary-general said. “Grave humanitarian implications, including rapidly deteriorating food security, an increase in mass displacements and a weakened public health system compounded by a new wave of COVID-19 infections require a coordinated approach in complementarity with regional actors.”He said it is imperative to restore Myanmar's constitutional order and uphold the results of the November 2020 election. He suggested neighbouring countries could leverage their influence over the military to have it “respect the will of the people and to act in the greater interest of peace and stability in the country and region.”Guterres said the international and regional effort must be accompanied by the immediate release of Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and other government officials as well as immediate humanitarian access and aid, especially to vulnerable communities, including some 600,000 Rohingya Muslims still in northern Rakhine state and the more than 700,000 who fled a 2017 military crackdown and are now in camps in neighboring Bangladesh.The report, covering the period from mid-August 2020 to mid-August 2021, said that since the military takeover, security forces have engaged in wide-ranging “brutal repression,” especially of those protesting Suu Kyi's ouster, sparked a political crisis with wide implications for the region, and carried out serious human rights violations.“Those expressing opposition to the military and joining democratic movements, as well as their relatives and associates, have been subject to arbitrary killings and detentions, disappearances, night raids, intimidation, and torture,” Guterres said. “There have also been numerous reports of sexual and gender-based violence perpetrated by the security forces.”Between February 1 and late July, he said, “there have been at least 150 instances in which security forces reportedly used lethal force against unarmed protesters.”Guterres said students and education staff have been primary targets of repression, pointing to reports by the Myanmar Teachers' Federation that at least 70 students and five teachers have been killed by security forces, that 775 students and 76 teachers have been detained, and that more than 125,000 teachers and 13,000 school staff in higher education institutions have been suspended or dismissed.The secretary-general said there have also been numerous reports of violence targeting security forces as well as killings of individuals suspected of collaborating with the military.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-may-spiral-into-a-catastrophe-un-calls-for-urgent-action-101632971200720.html
30-09-2021||World||Kim Jong Un's sister gets a post on top North Korean body||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's influential sister has been appointed to the country's top government body, the official KCNA news agency reported Thursday. Kim Yo Jong, a key adviser to her brother, was promoted to a position on the State Affairs Commission, amid a raft of changes approved by the Supreme People's Assembly, the rubber-stamp parliament.No fewer than nine members of the commission were dismissed, including one of its vice-presidents, Pak Pong Ju, and diplomat Choe Son Hui, a rare senior woman in the North's hierarchy who has played a key role in negotiations with the United States.The official Rodong Sinmun newspaper carried portraits of the eight new appointees on Thursday, Kim Yo Jong standing out among them both for her youth and as the only woman.She has often been seen in close proximity to her brother – with whom she went to school in Switzerland -- including at his summits with then-US president Donald Trump and the South's leader Moon Jae-in.Her exact political role has long been the subject of speculation – as has the possibility that she might one day succeed her brother, a transition that would give the socially conservative North its first female leader.She has at times made vitriolic denunciations of Washington or Seoul in statements carried by state media, particularly ahead of the North blowing up a liaison office on its side of the border that the South had built and paid for.Her relatively junior position as a vice department director of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party gave those declarations an element of ambiguity, and in some cases, she specifically said she was speaking in a personal capacity.Her official rank has risen and fallen over time, but her new SAC position is by far the most senior post she has held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-sister-gets-a-post-on-top-north-korean-body-101632969470344.html
30-09-2021||World||China's Covid-19 vaccine sales drop as nations switch to mRNA shots||In the early days of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, Chinese shots saved countless lives. They kick-started inoculation programs across Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, while richer countries hoarded scarce mRNA shots from Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. But many governments that once relied on vaccines from Sinovac Biotech Ltd. or Sinopharm Group Co Ltd. are now turning to options from the US and Europe instead, as concerns mount about Chinese vaccines’ efficacy against the delta strain and the Western stranglehold on mRNA supplies grows looser. That preference may already be showing up in China’s customs data, where exports of human vaccines dropped 21% in August to $1.96 billion from $2.48 billion in July, after rising steadily since Dec. 2020.“Basically people took what they could get” when Covid vaccines first became available, said Nicholas Thomas, an associate professor at the City University of Hong Kong who has edited several books on foreign policy and public health.“But as this has gone on, general populations -- rather than just medical practitioners -- have become more educated about the differences,” he said. “They have realized that not all vaccines are equal in terms of protection.”This shift played out during Thailand’s deadly outbreak earlier this year. As cases surged and Southeast Asia emerged as the new epicenter of the pandemic, the nation desperately tried to purchase vaccines. Only one supplier came through in time: China’s Sinovac.The shots allowed the country of 70 million to begin its inoculation campaign earlier than hoped, but Thailand soon confronted a challenge now faced by lawmakers across the developing world.The efficacy of China’s inactivated vaccines ranges from about 50% to 80% in clinical trials. But they are less potent than mRNA vaccines and questions are mounting about their effectiveness against the highly transmissible delta variant. As a result, the Thai government became the first in the world to offer an AstraZeneca Plc shot to people who had already received a jab or even two of Sinovac. While it is not an mRNA, Thai studies showed the Cambridge, U.K.-based company’s viral vector vaccine is potent as a booster to the Chinese shot, and that Pfizer’s dose was found to be even more effective.But many Thais soon expressed a strong preference for Western shots -- even protesting to demand them -- and the country’s opposition began lambasting the government for its reliance on China. Thailand halted orders of Sinovac and began buying more Western vaccines.“I’m not anti-Sinovac,” said Chaowat Sittisak, a 29-year-old teacher in northern Thailand who got the first dose of Sinovac but ordered a second Moderna shot from a private hospital. “If the world only had one vaccine and it’s Sinovac, I’d get it. But we have so many other choices. And I want whatever is best.”Many governments that once relied on Chinese shots are now ordering or seeking donations of mRNA vaccines instead. The swing away from China is likely to accelerate as U.S. President Joe Biden promises to donate 1.1 billion mRNA shots, Europe pledges hundreds of millions of vaccines and India prepares to once again export AstraZeneca vaccines after curtailing shipments following its deadly second wave. In addition to availability and efficacy, freedom of movement may also be motivating the shift: Recipients of Chinese vaccines can’t travel to some locations, such as Singapore.Vaccine ExportsIn a written reply to Bloomberg, Sinovac said its CoronaVac shot has been effective at preventing hospitalization, intensive care admissions, and deaths throughout the pandemic. A spokesperson said some countries first rolled out Sinovac to the elderly, who are more likely to be hospitalized with Covid-19, while younger populations received different vaccines later, “and this should be factored in the evaluation of CoronaVac’s effectiveness.”Many countries, including Thailand, have “purchased vaccines from multiple suppliers in order to maximize the number of doses available for their population,” the company said.As things stand, the list of places shifting away from Chinese vaccines -- or augmenting them with Western boosters -- includes Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. In China’s own territory of Hong Kong, which has long offered residents a choice between BioNTech and Sinovac, health officials are now testing whether the Chinese shot will perform better when paired with a western booster.While Sinovac allowed Thailand to start its rollout earlier than planned, the 6 million doses arriving in October will be the last shipment. In 2022, at least three-quarters of the government’s orders will also come from Astra and Pfizer.Moves like Thailand’s represent a blow to China’s vaccine diplomacy ambitions. Nevertheless, governments face a tricky balance between wanting to protect the public and maintaining good relations with China. The Thai Health Ministry has been careful to say that while it has no plans to order more Sinovac, it isn’t suggesting the shots aren’t effective.  Chinese firms have exported some 884 million doses of their homegrown vaccines via mostly bilateral deals with places like Brazil and Indonesia. This week Chile started giving Sinovac shots to children as young as six, a strong endorsement of a shot that’s formed the backbone of their rollout. And there are still many parts of the world drastically short of vaccines. Some African nations, for instance, have barely started their inoculation drives after struggling to procure shots. Cote d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Kenya are all rolling out Chinese vaccines, and Beijing is a key supplier to the World Health Organization-backed Covax facility aimed at getting vaccines to the developing world. President Xi Jinping has pledged to export 2 billion doses this year, matching commitments by the Group of Seven nations.Various studies conducted around the world have shown the jabs to be effective at preventing serious illness and death. Yet China’s pharmaceutical firms -- which were initially less forthcoming than western companies in releasing clinical trial data -- have not released similarly conclusive studies that inactivated vaccines are effective against delta.Over the coming year, policymakers may well continue turning away from the older technology of the inactivated Chinese vaccines, says Benjamin Cowling, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong, who published a recent study in the Lancet showing the Pfizer vaccine generated 10 times more antibodies than Sinovac.“If you’ve got some vaccines that are more effective than others, and the cost is roughly the same, then you’re going to get a better bang for the buck if you choose the more effective vaccines,” Cowling said. “But I still think that the supplies are limited, so it may not be as easy as saying, ‘We just want to order the Moderna vaccine,’ or whatever.”‘Better Alternatives’In Thailand, the opposition Move Forward party is now calling on the government to reveal the percentage of people who have only received the Sinovac shots.“The government already knows that studies and research show inactivated virus vaccines are less effective against virus mutations when compared to mRNA-based vaccines,” said Wiroj Lakkhanaadisorn, an opposition lawmaker and a key critic of the government’s vaccine policies. “We should know the vaccination rate that excludes all two-dose Sinovac shots because the immunity may not be enough anymore. Any regions that are ready can then reopen.”Thailand’s health ministry didn’t respond to a request for comment.Chaowat, the teacher, said he felt pressured to take the Sinovac shot because of his job but is hoping to get a Moderna shot in a month or two.“The government is turning away from Sinovac because they have to push through with their reopening plan and they want to reduce vaccine hesitancy among people who don’t want Sinovac,” he said. “They’re turning to better alternatives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-covid-19-vaccine-sales-drop-as-nations-switch-to-mrna-shots-101632967331867.html
30-09-2021||World||Chinese switch to flashlights, generators amid power cuts||China’s state planner on Wednesday ordered railway companies and provincial authorities to rush coal supplies to regions grappling with unprecedented power cuts, which have hit industrial production and forced residents to switch on mobile phones and light candles to go about their daily chores.Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning are the three worst hit provinces in northeast China facing sudden power blackouts, lasting for hours.The crippling power pinch has also spread to several other provinces, local media reported.“In the central province of Hunan, some building facade lighting and billboards are being turned off during peak hours. In the southern trade hub of Guangdong, some factories have been ordered to shut down for up to a week,” news website Caixin reported.Power shortage in industrial hubs in China is not rare but the ongoing crunch has also hit millions of households.“People ate breakfast by flashlight and shopkeepers used portable generators Wednesday as power cuts imposed to meet official conservation goals disrupted manufacturing and daily life,” the Associated Press said in a report from Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning province in northeast China.The power cuts are being attributed to continuing shortage of coal, rising coal prices and efforts made by local governments to curtail industrial energy use and meet carbon reduction targets.“The industrial demand for electricity is increasing fast. The price of coal has soared. And local governments are trying to fulfil their emissions cut quotas,” a state media report said.“A key factor behind the rapid growth of electricity consumption in China is the post-pandemic economic recovery,” the Caixin report said.In turn, the crunch is cutting down production, driving industrial production costs and disrupting the global supply in the world’s second largest economy.Many Chinese factories have cut output or have halted production entirely with industry insiders telling state media that the situation could worsen as the winter season draws near.“A textile factory based in East China’s Jiangsu Province received a notice from local authorities about power cuts on September 21. It won’t have power again until October 7 or even later,” the state-run Global Times reported earlier this week.The Chinese government is stepping in with the National Development Reform Commission (NDRC), the country’s top planner, saying the needs of the people will be prioritised.Also Read: Behind North Korea’s missile tests, Chinese plan to agitate Quad?China will make the public’s basic power needs the top priority of its power-supply network, ensuring that households stay safe and warm throughout this winter, the NDRC said.The commission added that comprehensive measures will be taken to increase the supply and adjust demand.“Each railway company should strengthen coal transportation to power houses (utilities) with an inventory of less than seven days and launch the emergency supply mechanism in a timely manner,” said the NDRC.In a bid to increase power generation and efficiently control the cost amid soaring commodity prices, the NDRC said that it will increase coal and natural gas imports and domestic production, and also promote the signing of medium- to long-term supply contracts for thermal coal.The NDRC added that it would let electricity rates reflect supply and demand, and to increase coal imports in an orderly manner to meet heating and power generation demand.The planning body added that it would increase domestic natural gas production and guide companies to arrange spot imports of liquefied natural gas at an early date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-switch-to-flashlights-generators-amid-power-cuts-101632967646272.html

Trinamool is a movement and that movement has got an appeal because people in Goa are fed up with the BJP. They want a change, so we would like to give them a change,” he added, responding to a question if the party was open to inducting BJP legislators who won on Congress tickets in the 2017 assembly elections.There has been speculation in Goa that several MLAs who switched over to the BJP from the Congress who did not expect to get a party ticket will be open to joining a new party. The Congress has already declared that they are not welcome.The party, he said, would go out across the 40 constituencies in Goa with the help of the Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC) which has started conducting surveys across Goa to gauge the mood and aspirations of the people. Asked why he was relying on the IPAC since he often claimed to be responsible for the past successes of the Congress in the state, Faleiro said,”Elections today is a science and they are experts in it”.On his switch from the Congress to the TMC, Faleiro said he was in touch with IPAC founder. “It was a difficult decision to take, but a decision I had to take in the interest of Goa because this is the only way to go forward,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmcs-faleiro-closes-the-door-on-pre-poll-pacts-in-goa-leaves-one-window-open-101633026391351.html

Based on specific inputs that the terrorist outfit was conducting recruitment, a joint team of police and Joypur battalion of Red Shield division of Spear Corps of the India Army apprehended the seven young men on Wednesday at Namtola in Charaideo district. According to an army release, they were on their way to Myanmar to get training in ULFA-I camps located in the neighbouring country. A pistol and some ammunition were recovered from the youths. “The group included a cadre who had earlier surrendered in 2016 and one who had already tried to join the banned outfit couple of years back…The operation breaks the myth of unilateral ceasefire announced by ULFA-I,” the release said. All the arrested young men have been handed over to Assam Police and they have confessed to having been recruited by ULFA-I handlers, the release said. Since May this year, when the second Bharatiya Janata Party-led government assumed office in Assam, there have been speculations that ULFA-I could join peace talks with the Centre. The outfit, has, however, maintained that the issue of Assam’s sovereignty should be part of talks---a pre-condition, which has been ruled out by the Centre as well as the state government. Citing the Covid-19 pandemic, the outfit declared a unilateral ceasefire in May for three months. It was extended by another three months in August. This year, for the first time since its inception in 1979, ULFA-I didn’t boycott the Independence Day celebrations or called for a ‘bandh’ to mark the occasion. “Our organization is not against talks or belligerent. But it is not possible to deny historic facts or waver from our ideological goals in the name of talks. Indian authorities have maintained that talks with ULFA-I can’t include the question of (Assam’s) sovereignty,” ULFA-I said in a statement released in August. Earlier this month the outfit carried out “structural change” in the organization by creating three new councils with commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah heading the supreme council. No changes were made in the military wing of the outfit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-assam-ulfa-i-continues-recruitment-despite-ceasefire-7-on-way-to-myanmar-held-101633026091602.html
30-09-2021||India||Unprecedented standoff at LAC needed quick response: Naravane||Developments along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh added to challenges faced by the Indian military on the “active and disputed borders” in the western and eastern fronts, army chief, Gen MM Naravane, said on Thursday. The “unprecedented” military standoff with China required an immediate response and large-scale mobilisation of resources at a time when the country was grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic, he said, while addressing the annual session of the PHD Chamber Of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI). Naravane, who spoke on the theme “Resilient India”, outlined the role played by the military in countering the pandemic and the current focus on indigenisation in acquiring advanced hardware and weaponry. He called for doing away with the “L1 system” of awarding defence contracts to the lowest bidder to ensure India gets access to advanced technology. Without naming China, Naravane highlighted the challenges posed by the standoff on the LAC, which began in May last year and resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops during a clash at Galwan Valley, the first such fatalities since 1975. “Developments along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh added to the ongoing legacy challenges on our active and disputed borders on the western and eastern front. The unprecedented developments necessitated large-scale resource mobilisation, orchestration of forces and immediate response, all this in a Covid-infested environment,” he said. This was done as the military reinforced the government’s efforts in tackling the health crisis. “Because of our peculiar environment of contested borders and an ongoing proxy war in the hinterland, the Indian Army is in active operations throughout the year, safeguarding the territorial integrity and sovereignty of our nation,” he said. The pandemic was a “unique and unprecedented” challenge and the air force carried out massive evacuation operations for citizens stranded in countries such as China, Iran and Kuwait while ferrying tonnes of medical supplies. The navy launched Operation Samudra Setu to transport food and medical supplies while evacuating thousands of stranded Indians from neighbouring countries. Rapid response medical teams were deployed to several countries. Under Operation Namaste, the army established a large number of hospitals across the country. Nineteen exclusively Covid-19 hospitals and military hospitals were opened to all, and testing labs of the armed forces accounted for an increased load by working round the clock. The military also set up quarantine facilities at Manesar, Mumbai, Chennai, Bhopal, Hyderabad and other cities. During the second wave of infections, air and naval assets airlifted oxygen cylinders, generators and concentrators, cryogenic containers and medical supplies from countries such as Australia, Germany, the UK, the UAE and Israel. Special military trains were used to send medical resources to hotspots and army technicians repaired dysfunctional oxygen plants in government and private hospitals, Naravane said. Pointing to the mantra “reform or perish”, Naravane said the pandemic led to transformational changes across the world. “Disrupted supply chains, unreasonable price escalation and opportunistic resource denials by some greedy nations have reinforced the vision of Atmanirbharta (self reliance),” he said. “The danger that our long-drawn procurement processes and bureaucratic speed-breakers would prevent us from acquiring cutting edge technology is a real one. Much work has been done in bringing about systemic changes with the aim of ease of doing business...There are still archaic rules and processes that defy logic and are at variance to modern best practices,” he added. Naravane said processes in the defence industrial sector that “are out of sync with contemporary times and our future vision must be ruthlessly shed for modern best-practices”. He added, “The L1 system is one such legacy of the colonial era that has lost its relevance in a system that is pushing for indigenisation. After all, why should merely price dictate our choice, when the money is destined to be pumped back into the domestic economy? It’s time we looked at quality and transited to a T1 system, more in tune with our capability development aspirations.” L1 refers to the lowest price and T1, the best technical specification. As part of efforts to promote domestic industry, the army has awarded contracts worth more than Rs16,000 crore to Indian firms in recent months. At the same time, development and prosperity are closely linked to security, and a safe environment is a must for investments to flow in, he said. The emergency powers under DFPDS-2020 (delegation of financial powers to defence services) invoked in June last year and extended till August resulted in 113 contracts for procuring critical ammunition, armament, vehicles, spares and special mountaineering equipment worth almost ₹9,000 crore. Another 68 contracts for capital procurement worth ₹6,500 crore were inked, and savings of about ₹1,700 crore were made due to diligence and financial prudence of the emergency empowered committee at the service headquarters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unprecedented-standoff-at-lac-needed-quick-response-naravane-101633025132503.html

The report also mentioned other injuries suffered by the 36-year-old, such as those on his eye, limbs and back.The businessman suffered “swelling of 4×5 cm in the middle of forehead, cut and hematoma (blood clot) in the upper eyelid of the right eye” and showed “marks of deep muscles injury on right arm above elbow and on right forearm”, the report, reviewed by HT, said.The revelations came even as Gorakhpur senior superintendent of police Vipin Tada maintained that the businessman died due to a head injury after he slipped amid the chaos that ensued following the raid at a city hotel on Monday.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, meanwhile, met the family of the deceased at Kanpur’s civil lines and assured a fair probe into the incident. “All those found guilty will not be allowed to go unpunished,” he said.Gupta was staying in the hotel with two friends from Gurugram when the incident took place. Family members of the deceased alleged that he was brutally thrashed by the police during the checking. Following nationwide outrage, six cops were suspended and a case of murder (Section 302 of Indian Penal Code) was registered against them. Efforts are now underway to nab the accused cops who went missing after the incident.Additional director general of police (Gorakhpur) Akhil Kumar, who inspected the hotel, said the probe was handed over to the crime branch in Gorakhpur. “The place of the incident has been inspected. The investigation has been handed over to the crime branch, Gorakhpur, and instructions have been given for a speedy probe. The team will be strengthened and more investigators will be involved. Each and every point will be investigated as to how and why the raid occurred and how many policemen were involved,” he said.Asked about the postmortem exam report, he said: “The statement of the doctors who performed the postmortem exam will also be taken (into consideration) to know the details of injuries and to know in what situation the injuries occurred.”Adityanath has promised a government job to the businessman’s wife, Meenakshi Gupta.“The chief minister has accepted all our demands and we are satisfied with the meeting,” Meenakshi said. She added that the chief minister had asked her to submit an application for an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation and also “accepted my plea for a government job as well as financial security for my five-year-old son’s future”.After days of refusal, the family finally cremated the body at 5am on Thursday. The body was taken to Bhairon Ghat and final rites were conducted amid the presence of police and a few close relatives. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, who rushed to the home of the businessman, demanded a CBI probe under the supervision of a sitting high court judge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanpur-businessman-had-injuries-on-skull-limbs-post-mortem-report-101633025073370.html

The VHP said the book should be made compulsory across all levels of education in the country as the induction of the book in the education system will help the nation stop the ‘erosion of values.’“Bhagavad Gita can protect the social, cultural and spiritual values of our country, end divisions in our society and make India much more stronger. We demand the Bhagavad Gita be declared the national book of India,” the VHP said. It also said that a memorandum will be submitted to PM Modi, President Ram Nath Kovind and Union minister for education Dharmendra Pradhan.“It is because of our faulty education system. We demand that the government must make teaching-learning of Shrimad Bhagavad Gita compulsory across all levels of education to stop the erosion of values. It should be made part of the curriculum,” VHP national secretary Acharya Radha Krishna Manodi was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.It also said that government institutions should organise periodic reading of the scripture to instill a strong sense of duty among bureaucrats fortnightly because it claims that there has been a ‘a continuous collapse of ethical values’. Manodi said that teachers from the minority communities should also be brought under the ambit of teaching-learning of Bhagavad Gita.“The study of the Bhagavad Gita should be made compulsory for all those undergoing teachers’ education and training. Education on the Bhagavad Gita should be made compulsory for all the teachers in India including those belonging to Muslim and Christian communities,” he said.Manodi, who heads the Vishva Gita Sansthan of the VHP, further said that all the 18 chapters should be made part of the teachers’ training curriculum.

On Wednesday, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee ordered a complete ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers in the national capital till January 1 next year.Last year, the National Green Tribunal had ordered a ban on firecrackers in Delhi during Diwali.

The timing for the night curfew in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack from October 11 to 20 will be from 8 pm to 5 am.The decision to ban firecrackers in October met with derision on social media with several on Twitter asking if the government would provide any financial support to the firecracker sellers? “What about liquor and crackers during other festivals and functions,” asked one while another remarked: “Stupidity at its best...Not allowing a source of income for many during these tough times…”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-bans-sale-and-use-of-firecrackers-in-october-cites-covid-19-spread-101633024892968.html

"Sidhu's job is to run party affairs and Channi's job is to run the government. There is never any interference. I have been the PCC chief thrice.

The Indian side has only made counter deployments in response to China’s “provocative behaviour and unilateral attempts to alter status quo” on the LAC and to fully protect the country’s security interests, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said. Bagchi was responding to allegations by Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying on Wednesday that the Indian side was pursuing a “forward policy” and had “illegally crossed the LAC to encroach on China’s territory”. “It was the amassing of large number of troops by the Chinese side, their provocative behaviour and unilateral attempts to alter status quo in contravention of all our bilateral agreements that resulted in serious disturbance of peace and tranquillity along the LAC in eastern Ladakh,” he said. “China continues to deploy large number of troops and armaments in the border areas,” he added. India has already made its position clear and rejected statements from the Chinese side which “have no basis in facts”, Bagchi said. “It was in response to Chinese actions that our armed forces had to make appropriate counter deployments in these areas to ensure that India’s security interests are fully protected,” he said. Bagchi recalled external affairs minister S Jaishankar had told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi during their meeting in Dushanbe on the margins of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit earlier this month that the Indian side expects China “will work towards early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols”. During a regular news briefing in Beijing on Wednesday, spokesperson Hua Chunying responded to a question regarding the Indian Army deploying sophisticated artillery on the LAC by blaming New Delhi for the military standoff. “The Indian side has long pursued the ‘forward policy’ and illegally crossed the LAC to encroach on China’s territory, which is the root cause of tension in the China-India border situation,” she said. “China opposes any arms race in the disputed border areas for the purpose of competition over control,” she added.On Friday last, India blamed China’s “provocative behaviour” and unilateral attempts to alter status quo on the LAC for disrupting bilateral ties and rejected Beijing’s contention that the Indian side was responsible for the deadly Galwan Valley clash last year. The brutal clash in Galwan Valley on June 15 last year, which saw troops from both sides fighting each other for several hours with rocks, rods and clubs covered with barbed wire, resulted in the first fatalities on the LAC in 45 years. The Indian side lost 20 soldiers while China has acknowledged four deaths. The two sides withdrew frontline troops from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February and from Gogra in August after several rounds of diplomatic and military talks. India has insisted bilateral ties can be normalised only when disengagement and de-escalation is completed at other friction points on the LAC such as Hot Spring and Depsang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/provocative-india-pins-blame-on-china-for-increased-troops-armaments-on-lac-101633023030974.html

30-09-2021||India||Plan underway by encroachers to alter power equations by 2050, alleges Assam CM||Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday claimed that a blueprint is being implemented by encroachers to alter power equations in the state by 2050 through demographic means. Without naming any particular community, Sarma said that these illegal settlers claim to be affected by disasters and move from one area to another with a specific agenda. The CM’s comments come a week after two civilians were killed and 20 others including 11 policemen were injured during an eviction drive in Darrang district. “I’m not naming any particular community. We shouldn’t say it’s being done by followers of Islam as indigenous Assamese Muslims are not part of this. The collective aim of these people (encroachers) is to completely alter the power equation in Assam by 2050,” Sarma told journalists in Dhemaji. The state’s BJP-led government has started evicting settlers who have encroached government land. Most of those targeted in these drives held at Sonitpur, Hojai and Darrang districts are Bengali speaking Muslims with roots in East Pakistan (present Bangladesh). Sarma said that the encroachers claim to be displaced from their place of origin citing some disaster and move to another place and settle illegally there as part of a plan. “That’s why they use terms like ‘landless’, ‘flood affected’ etc. By claiming to be flood-hit, they move from Barpeta to another place. If you inquire, you will find that several of these so-called displaced people own hundreds of ‘bighas’ of land. But if you ask them about it, they will remain silent,” he said Sarma said that encroachers were able to achieve their goal in Batadroba seat in this election. The assembly, which was represented by BJP’s Angoorlata Deka in 2016, was won by Congress’s Sibamoni Bora with support of the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and other parties in the opposition grand alliance. “This is a blueprint made by them to encroach and control one assembly constituency at a time. As per intelligence input available with me, right now these people want to have Sipajhar, Borsola and Lumding seats in their sight,” the CM alleged. “They want to change the demography of these three seats by the next election, which is in 2026. If we are able to prevent them from achieving that goal, it will be a big deal for us,” added Sarma. Reacting to the claims, opposition All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), a party that has a large base among Bengali speaking Muslims in Assam, said the CM’s statements were sensitive and communal. “These are very communal and sensitive comments. Sarma needs to understand that people who get displaced by floods and other calamities are forced to move and settle in other places out of necessity. By saying that its part of a grand plan, the CM is just following Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s views,” said AIUDF organising secretary Md. Aminul Islam. “Sarma is making these comments now since by-polls to five assembly seats are due next month and he wants to incite voters.

30-09-2021||India||Number Theory: The class divide among Other Backward Classes in India||The demand for a caste census is likely to emerge as a major political issue in the run up to the 2024 elections. After the union government filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court saying a caste census cannot be clubbed with the already delayed 2021 decadal census, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has written letters to 33 leaders of different political parties demanding support for an immediate caste census.The demand for a caste census is not without context. It is linked with a demand for doing away with the Supreme Court imposed 50% limit on reservations. To be sure, this limit has already been breached after the implementation of reservations for economically weaker sections among communities which were hitherto excluded from availing reservations. The demand for doing away with the 50% limit on reservations is mainly coming from Other Backward Class (OBC) leaders who argue that their share in population is far more than the designated 27% quota for OBCs.OBCs, as of now, are entitled to reservations not just on a caste-basis -- unlike the case for Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) population -- but also a class criterion. This makes it imperative that any census to justify the demand for expanding the reservation quota also looks at the economic status of OBCs.Findings of the latest All India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS) are useful in answering this question. AIDIS was conducted in 2019 and is the most comprehensive official source of assets and liabilities of Indian households. It gives data on assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2018. Here are four charts which summarise what AIDIS tells us about the economic status of OBCs in India.How representative is the AIDIS in measuring household wealth?Some National Sample Survey (NSSO) databases tend to undercount the rich in India. Is that the case with AIDIS as well? According to AIDIS, average assets of the top 10% of households in rural and urban areas were ₹81.2 lakh and ₹1.5 crore. The richest household in AIDIS had assets of ₹72.3 crore in rural areas and ₹114.8 crore in urban areas. This suggests that while AIDIS excludes the really super-rich in the country, it does cover a significant section of the rich.What about average assets by social groups?AIDIS allows us to separate households into four broad social groups: SC, ST, OBC and others. A look at average asset holdings of each social group underlines the role of caste in economic inequality. Average asset levels of households that do not belong to SC, ST or OBC groups are significantly higher, not just vis-à-vis the SC-ST population but also OBCs.But all groups display high levels of intra-group inequality in IndiaWhile average asset levels do show a relation with social groups, there are large intra-group economic inequalities as well. This is best seen in the fact that the Gini coefficient for asset distribution in each of the social groups is quite high; 0.62 for SCs, 0.64 for OBCs, 0.67 for STs and 0.69 for others. The Gini coefficient can take values between 0 and 1, where 0 denotes perfect equality and 1 perfect inequality.Another way to describe intra-group inequality within social groups can be to compare the assets owned by the top ten percent compared to bottom 50% within each group. The top 10 percent of OBCs own 5.51 times the total assets owned by the bottom 50% of OBC households. This number is 4.45 for SC households, 5.90 for STs, and 7.97 for those who don’t belong to SC-ST-OBC groups.This also means the OBCs are not underrepresented within the richThe most common rhetoric while arguing for doing away with the 50% limit on reservation to accommodate more OBCs is that they are among the poorest in India. An analysis of AIDIS data shows that this is at best a half-truth. Because OBCs are the single largest social group in India, even a low share among the rich is consistent with as many OBCs in these ranks as other social groups, especially those who do not belong to SC-ST-OBC groups. An HT analysis of unit level data from AIDIS shows that OBCs had the largest share among households in each decile class except the top 10%, where households outside the SC-ST-OBC groups account for almost half the total share. The overall share of OBC and non SC-ST-OBC households in AIDIS is 43.5% and 27.2%. Simply speaking, OBCs dominate the ranks of both the rich and poor.OBCs are the single largest population group but they are far from a homogenous cohort, both socially and economically. The union government recognises 2,479 OBC sub-castes in its list as of 2018, according to the social justice ministry’s website. In 2017 the current government set up the Justice Rohini commission to sub-stratify reservation for OBCs on the grounds that certain sub-castes had gained disproportionately from the policy. Because there is no data on sub-caste population, leave alone socio-economic aspects of OBCs, whether or not the economic inequalities between OBCs are a function of sub-caste is difficult to answer.AIDIS numbers cited above underline the problems with any argument selling reservation as a silver bullet to the socio-economic deprivation of OBCs in India. Reservations only offer an edge in competing for government jobs, which are on a declining trajectory from an already small base in India.Given intra-group inequalities within OBCs, the relatively well-off are more likely to gain from such opportunities. Any efforts to tilt the scales in favour of the underprivileged OBCs is likely to run into resistance from the Mandal era parties, where the dominant OBCs are in leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-class-divide-among-other-backward-classes-in-india-101633018770205.html
30-09-2021||India||HT This Day: October 2, 1953 — New era for Andhras begins||Andhra State-India’s first linguistic State-was inaugurated by Mr Nehru this morning. The inauguration marks the fulfillment of the desire of 20 million Telugu-speaking -people of Madras State to have a State of their own.Mr Nehru declared that the new State had been established lawfully and by constitutional methods to fulfil the long-cherished dream of Andhras. It was now the duty of the people of Andhra Desh to build up their State in the best possible manner. Andhra will have a five-man Cabinet headed by Mr Prakasam. Mr N. Sanjeeva Reddy, leader of the Andhra Congress Legislature Party, will be the Deputy Chief Minister. The other Ministers are Mr K. Koti Reddi, Mr T. Viswanatham and Mr D. Sanjivayya.The Ministry was sworn in at Raj Bhavan today by the Governor, Mr C. M. Trivedi. Earlier, at an impressive ceremony at the Andhra Assembly Chamber, Mr Trivedi was sworn in as Governor by the Chief Justice, Mr Rajamannar. The following communique was issued from Raj Bhavan: The Governor received Mr T. Prakasam and invited him to form a Ministry. Mr Prakasam accepted the invitation and the Governor has appointed him to be Chief Minister. On the advice of Mr Prakasam, the Governor has appointed the following gentlemen to be Ministers: Mr N. Sanjeeva Reddy. Mr Koti Reddi. Mr T. Viswanatham and Mr D. Sanjivayya. It is proposed to appoint two more Ministers in the near future.On the advice of the Chief Minister, the Governor has designated Mr Sanjeeva Reddy as Deputy Chief Minister.The city wore carnival appearance and from early hours people were seen making for Cole’s Memorial playground to see Mr Nehru inaugurate the new State. Over 100,000 people braved the heat to listen to Mr Nehru’s speech. After the swearing in ceremony of Ministers Mr Nehru drove in an open car through the decorated streets where scores of arches bore affectionate greetings to him in Telugu. With him in the car were the Trivedis. They arrived at 8-45 at the playground. Mr Nehru was received by the Chief Minister of Andhra who introduced other Ministers. Dr Radhakrishnan, Vice-President, Dr Katju, Mr V. V. Giri, Mr K. C. Reddy, Union Ministers, Mr Rajagopalachari, Mr Hanumenthayya and Mr B. Ramakrishna Rao. Chief Ministers of Madras, Mysore and Hyderabad, respectively, were seated on the platform from which Mr Nebru addressed the gathering. Mr Prakasam, who was back in power today after an interval of six years, was loudly cheered, as he slowly mounted the rostrum. The historic function began with an invocation song in Telugu by Miss T Suryakumari. The Chief Justice next presented to the vast gathering Mr Trivedi, whom, he said, “the President of India had been pleased to appoint as Governor of Andhra and who was sworn in by me.”Mr Trivedi next read out a message from the President. The Governor announced the personnel of the Cabinet and presented Mr Prakasam, Mr Sanjeeva Reddy and other Ministers to the gathering. Mr Prakasam translated the President’s message in Telugu and then requested the Prime Minister to inaugurate the State.NEHRU’S SPEECH In his inaugural speech Mr Nehru said that the progress of Andhra and of India were inter-twined and the one could not develop without the other.He asked Andhras not to think in terms of their State alone but of the country as a whole. “You should dedicate yourselves to the service of the country and your new State,” he declared. Over 100,000 of people cheered the Prime Minister repeatedly. Mr Nehru spoke in Hindustani which is widely understood in these parts “We are gathered here on an auspicious occasion which marks the birth of the new State of Andhra,” Mr Nehru said. “To you, Andhras, who also belong to India. I have come here to offer my good wishes. NO CONTROVERSY Mr Nehru said that for a long time there had been a controversy over the method of formation of an Andhra State and no decision could be arrived at. But all the while the people of Andhra had been dreaming for a State of their own. Today that dream had become a reality. Therefore, today was an auspicious day and a day of historic significance for the whole of Andhradesh. He recalled the prolonged debate on the Andhra State Bill in Parliament and said that the new State had been formed by law and by constitutional methods. Now that their dream had become a reality, it was the bounden duty of the people of Andhra not to get excited but to build up the new State in the best possible manner.Nehru recounted the glorious heritage of Andhras and their historic role as empire builders. The country had seen the rise and fall of several empires. In Andhradesa, great empires were built up and ruined. Andhra State was today being formed under different conditions and in a new shape and a new way. ‘Do not forget that Andhra State is a part and parcel of the mother country,” he told Andhras. GREAT NEIGHROURS The Prime Minister said there were big territories beyond the borders of Andhra like Madras, Mysore and Orissa. Further north, there were the States of Bengal, Bombay, Bihar, Punjab and Kashmir. All those States were Part and parcel of Bharat and Andhra State was now joining the ranks of her brother and sister States in India. Every citizen, in whichever part of India he lived, was a citizen of the great Republic of India.“I am a Kashmiri, I am at Delhi. Now I have come to Andhra. I have as much right here as any Andhra.” That spirit of oneness should prevail if the country was to prosper, he declared. Andhras should not think that by the formation of the new State they were cutting away from the rest of India, Mr Nehru said. On the other hand, they should think they were coming closer and closer to the people in other States. They should get together and make the country big. Every act of theirs should go to make the country strong and united.Outside the country, whether m America or in England, the people, of India were known only as the, citizens of the Indian Republic and ‘ not as Andhras or Tamils. Therefore, Mr Nehru said, it was the primary duty of everyone to safeguard the prestige and preserve the noble traditions of the country. BROADER OUTLOOKHe asked the people to forget narrow communal and caste differences also. If these differences were perpetuated, they would lead to disruption of the country. High or low, rich or poor, they were all citizens of India and they were all equals and they should not encourage sectarianism.Mr Nehru compared India to a big mansion of which each State was a room. There were many rooms in the mansion occupied by Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Parsis. All of them had to live together and be friendly with one another if the country was to prosper, all States should co-operate with one another and march forward. The Prime Minister said he was happy that all controversy over the formation of the State had ended. He wanted Andhras to forget old quarrels. No doubt it was a sorry thing to break up a big and prosperous State like Madras. Sometime it had, however, to be I Andhra and Tamil Nad would like and work together as the common citizens of Bharat.Mr Nehru wanted the Andhras to open a new chapter in their history and concentrate their attention on eradication of poverty. Their new State was like a newborn babe and the people had to carry it like a babe. He appealed to the people of Andhra, men and women, to join in a common endeavor to make their State prosperous by hard work.Mr Nehru commended the bhoodan and shramdan movement of Acharya Vinoba Bhave. Though zamindarls and Jagirdaris had been abolished, much yet remained to be done in the matter of land reform. By moving from place to place, Acharya Vinoba had collected lakhs of acres for distribution to the landless poor. If people in Andhra and elsewhere helped the movement to greater success, the economic structure of the country could be easily and peacefully I changed. The Prime Minister referred to the observance of Gandhi Jayanti tomorrow and appealed to the, people to follow Gandhiji’s principles. The vast gathering responded to Mr Nehru’s call to shout Jai Hind.The Vice-President, Dr Radhakrishnan, in a brief speech in Telugu said that after 40 years of struggle the efforts of Telugus had borne fruit. Swaraj, he declared, should mean to them love of others and service to one’s own fellowmen and not love of power. He deprecated communal differences in Andhra and exhorted the Telugu people to make their State a model one. Mr M. Satyanarayans of the Dakshina Bharat Hindusthani Prachar Sabha translated Mr Nebru’s speech into Telugu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-october-2-1953-new-era-for-andhras-begins-101633018231388.html
30-09-2021||India||HT This Day: October 1, 2010 — Disputed site is Ram birthplace: HC||The Allahabad High Court (HC) took the first step on Thursday (September 30) towards the resolution of the 60-year-old Babri Masjid- Ram Janmabhoomi ownership dispute — by including all the warring parties in the process.The HC gave its stamp of judicial approval to the Hindu belief that Lord Ram was indeed born there. The court also ruled by a majority verdict that the disputed 120 feet by 90 feet plot land be divided into three equal parts among three petitioners — Sunni Wakf Board, Nirmohi Akhara and the party representing Ram Lalla.This also means that the court’s three-way split of the plot to the petitioners — even after dismissing their cases — has kept the window open for further talks.That the judgment is inclusive has been reflected in the reactions of political opponents. There was political acceptance of the verdict by the mainstream parties. Muslim leaders, however, made it clear the next stop was the Supreme Court even as they called it a “step forward”. Congress spokesman Janardhan Dwivedi said: “The court has given the verdict. We should all welcome it.”Justice D.V. Sharma, member of the three-judge Lucknow bench of the high court, ruled in a separate judgment that the disputed site was indeed the birthplace of Lord Ram and the mosque was built by Mughal emperor Babar against the tenets of Islam. “Thus, it cannot have the character of a mosque,” he said in the order.The court said the area under the central dome of the three-domed structure, where LordRam’s idol existed [and is presently kept in a makeshift temple at the same place], belonged to Ram Lala Virajman (the Ram deity).Justices S.U. Khan and Sudhir Agarwal also ruled status quo be maintained at the disputed place for three months.The Sunni Waqf Board and the Hindu Mahasabha indicated they were “partly disappointed” as their cases had been dismissed, but also added that the verdict was a step forward.The victory dance of the lawyers representing the Hindu camp began cheering for theirside even before the judgment came.“We have won it,” declared Ranjana Agnihotri, counsel for one of the defendants, SwamiSwaroopanand Saraswati, Shankaracharya of Dwarka. Reactions from the Muslim side, especially the Wakf Board, were mildly negative. But though the board announced it would go to the apex court, it mentioned categorically that it was open to talks.The Congress and the Hindu right — the RSS, the BJP and the VHP — welcomed the judgment.RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said it’s not a victory or loss for any party but made it clear theverdict paved the way for building the promised Ram Temple.BJP leader L.K. Advani also said, “The verdict is a significant step towards building of agrand temple.”Nritya Gopal Das, president of Ramjanmbhoomi Nyas, went a step further: “We will go into the appeal that if the court has accepted it as the Ram Janmabhoomi, the entire land should be given for the temple.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-october-1-2010-disputed-site-is-ram-birthplace-hc-101633017875465.html

There is fine print||Patiala: As former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh declared that he is on his way out of the Congress, his wife and Congress MP Preneet Kaur made it clear that she is going to stay put and not follow her husband out of the party “as of now”.“I will stay in the Congress and will stick to my position (as MP). I have no intention of quitting,”said Kaur, a Lok Sabha MP from Patiala constituency. Amarinder Singh’s Patiala Urban seat which he represents in the Punjab assembly is one of the nine seats that fall under the parliamentary constituency represented by Kaur. It is widely acknowledged that Preneet Kaur used to have the last word on matters related to the nine assembly segments while Amarinder Singh was chief minister. Seven of the nine seats are with the Congress.Preneet Kaur justified Amarinder Singh’s decision, underlining that some Congress leaders humiliated him and set a wrong precedent.“He is the senior-most leader of the Congress in the country. He brought the party back to power in Punjab when it was losing one after another state. He was humiliated and thus decided to leave the party. It is wrong to maltreat a leader who brought historic victory for the party.” The veteran Congress leader met Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday, sparking speculation that he was in exit mode and could either float his own party or join the rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).On Thursday, Amarinder Singh confirmed that he wasn’t going to stick around in the Congress.“I will not join BJP (but) I will not stay in the Congress party,” the 79-year-old leader said, adding that he was still thinking through his options in the interest of Punjab as security of the state was the predominant priority for him.“I will not be treated in this humiliating manner...I will not take such insults,” he said, adding that his principles and beliefs do not allow him to stay in the Congress any longer.Asked if it would be awkward for her to continue in the party after her husband’s leaves, Preneet Kaur said,” “It is awkward because some leaders mishandled the situation”.She, however, declined to speak on her future plans.“I won’t comment about future plans, but as of now, every worker is upset about whatever is going on in the party in Punjab. I will stick in the party (Congress) as of now”, she said.Some Congress MLAs from Patiala district, mostly seen as loyalists of Preneet and Amarinder Singh, have decided not to leave the party and join Amarinder Singh.“I will remain in the party”, said an MLA close to Amarinder Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-quit-cong-says-amarinder-singh-s-wife-preneet-kaur-there-is-fine-print-101633015470444.html
30-09-2021||India||Unprecedented standoff with China at LAC needed huge mobilisation amid Covid-19: Gen Naravane||Developments along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh added to challenges faced by the Indian military on the “active and disputed borders” in the western and eastern fronts, the army chief, Gen MM Naravane, said on Thursday. The “unprecedented” military standoff with China required an immediate response and large-scale mobilisation of resources at a time when the country was grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic, he said while addressing the annual session of the PHD Chamber Of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI). Naravane, who spoke on the theme “Resilient India”, outlined the role played by the military in countering the pandemic and the current focus on indigenisation in acquiring advanced hardware and weaponry. He called for doing away with the “L1 system” of awarding defence contracts to the lowest bidder to ensure India gets access to advanced technology. Without naming China, Naravane highlighted the challenges posed by the standoff on the LAC, which began in May last year and resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops during a clash at Galwan Valley, the first such fatalities since 1975. “Developments along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh added to the ongoing legacy challenges on our active and disputed borders on the western and eastern front. The unprecedented developments necessitated large-scale resource mobilisation, orchestration of forces and immediate response, all this in a Covid-19 infested environment,” he said. This was done as the military reinforced the government’s efforts in tackling the health crisis. “Because of our peculiar environment of contested borders and an ongoing proxy war in the hinterland, the Indian Army is in active operations throughout the year, safeguarding the territorial integrity and sovereignty of our nation,” he said. The pandemic was a “unique and unprecedented” challenge and the air force carried out massive evacuation operations for citizens stranded in countries such as China, Iran and Kuwait while ferrying tonnes of medical supplies. The navy launched Operation Samudra Setu to transport food and medical supplies while evacuating thousands of stranded Indians from neighbouring countries. Rapid response medical teams were deployed to several countries. Under Operation Namaste, the army established a large number of hospitals across the country. Nineteen exclusively Covid-19 hospitals and military hospitals were opened to all, and testing labs of the armed forces accounted for an increased load by working round the clock. The military also set up quarantine facilities at Manesar, Mumbai, Chennai, Bhopal, Hyderabad and other cities. During the second wave of infections, air and naval assets airlifted oxygen cylinders, generators and concentrators, cryogenic containers and medical supplies from countries such as Australia, Germany, the UK, the UAE and Israel. Military special trains were used to send medical resources to hotspots and army technicians repaired dysfunctional oxygen plants in government and private hospitals, Naravane said. Pointing to the mantra “reform or perish”, Naravane said the pandemic led to transformational changes across the world. “Disrupted supply chains, unreasonable price escalation and opportunistic resource denials by some greedy nations have reinforced the vision of Atma Nirbharta,” he said. “The danger that our long-drawn procurement processes and bureaucratic speed-breakers would prevent us from acquiring cutting edge technology is a real one. Much work has been done in bringing about systemic changes with the aim of ease of doing business...There are still archaic rules and processes that defy logic and are at variance to modern best practices,” he added. Naravane said processes in the defence industrial sector that “are out of sync with contemporary times and our future vision must be ruthlessly shed for modern best-practices”. He added, “The L1 system is one such legacy of the colonial era that has lost its relevance in a system that is pushing for indigenisation. After all, why should merely price dictate our choice, when the money is destined to be pumped back into the domestic economy? It’s time we looked at quality and transited to a T1 system, more in tune with our capability development aspirations.” As part of efforts to promote domestic industry, the army has awarded contracts worth more than Rs16,000 crore to Indian firms in recent months. At the same time, development and prosperity are closely linked to security, and a safe environment is a must for investments to flow in, he said. The emergency powers under DFPDS-2020 invoked in June last year and extended till August resulted in 113 contracts for procuring critical ammunition, armament, vehicles, spares and special mountaineering equipment worth almost ₹9,000 crore. Another 68 contracts for capital procurement worth ₹6,500 crore were inked, and savings of about ₹1,700 crore were made due to diligence and financial prudence of the emergency empowered committee at the service headquarters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unprecedented-standoff-with-china-at-lac-needed-huge-mobilisation-amid-covid-19-gen-naravane-101633013730290.html
30-09-2021||India||Amid Congress vs Congress following Punjab crisis, party says working committee meet soon||Congress president Sonia Gandhi indicated that the working committee meeting will take place soon, party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told news agency PTI on Thursday at a time when the rumblings of dissent inside the party are growing louder in the aftermath of the Punjab crisis."Before leaving for Shimla, Congress president Sonia Gandhi had already indicated that a CWC meeting shall be called very soon. Accordingly, the CWC meeting shall be held in the coming days," Surjewala told PTI.How did it start?G-23 is not new. But the Punjab crisis which saw the resignation of veteran Congress leader Amarinder Singh has given voice to the G-23 leaders as Kapil Sibal on Wednesday posed some serious questions in front of the government. He said the party needs to introspect and many people whom the high command used to think of as loyalists are leaving the party. He said G-23 is not ‘Ji Huzoor 23’ and hence the group of rebel leaders will continue raising questions, though ironically these rebel leaders are not the ones who are deserting the party. Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad wrote to Sonia Gandhi requesting a meeting. Hitting back at Sibal, Surjewala had said, "Every Congressman and woman must also seriously introspect whether by their words and actions they are attempting to weaken the Congress in the times of crisis."3 people running Congress, 1 with no designation: Natwar Singh's swipe at RahulG-23 is, however, the grouping of the 23 senior Congress leaders who wrote a letter to the party in 2020 asking for sweeping changes in the party. Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor, Kapil Sibal, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Milind Deora, Renuka Chaudhary, Bhupinder Singh Hooda were some of the prominent signatories of the letter.The comments drew sharp reaction from a section of Congress leaders who agitated in front of Sibal's house with placards reading ‘Get well soon, Kapil Sibal’. Shashi Tharoor supports Kapil Sibal, says he fought many legal battles for CongressAfter the Kapil Sibal incident, Anand Sharma, Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor, P Chidambaram tweeted condemning the vandalism outside Sibal's house.Old generation versus new generationFormer Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh who announced on Thursday that he will be severing his ties with the Congress said the party has been sidelining the old generation leaders while they are the actual thinkers. The new generation leaders are best to implement the plans, Amarinder Singh said.Rahul Gandhi under attackSonia Gandhi is the interim party president while Rahul Gandhi's role has brought him under the direct attack of the senior Congress leaders. Without naming anyone, Kapil Sibal on Wednesday said the party has no president and hence he does not know who takes the decision in the party. On Thursday, senior Congress leader Natwar Singh said three people are running the Congress and among them, one has no designation. He named Rahul Gandhi and said he calls the shots in the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-congress-vs-congress-following-punjab-crisis-party-says-working-committee-meet-soon-101633012094415.html

Here's why it is significantOn Tuesday, Sidhu resigned from the post of the president of Punjab Congress saying that he won't be able to compromise on Punjab's future. In a video, he also said that politics for him is taking a stand for the people, for Punjab, not for his own benefit. The resignation apparently took the Congress leadership by surprise as Sidhu did not discuss the issue with any senior Congress leader.While the resignation was not accepted, Charanjit Singh Channi on Wednesday said he personally called Sidhu for a meeting. Downplaying the crisis at a time when his Cabinet, which has only a few months to work before the election, has just been formed, Channi said, "Party is supreme. The government takes note of the need of the party."Channi also said he was not rigid over the appointments and if Sidhu has any objections then it can be discussed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-sidhu-to-continue-in-his-post-what-happened-at-sidhu-channi-meeting-101633008091873.html

He succeeds Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria following his retirement.In his first address to the air force after taking charge, the new Chief of Air Staff `expressed “absolute faith and confidence in their ability to accomplish all assigned tasks with resolute dedication while maintaining IAF’s operational capability at an all-time high.”“Protection of our nation’s sovereignty and integrity is to be ensured at any cost”, Air Chief Marshal Chaudhari said, according to a defence ministry statement.An experienced pilot, Chaudhari has logged more than 3,800 hours of flying on a variety of fighter planes such as MiG-21, MiG-29 and Sukhoi-30. He also flew air defence missions during the 1999 Kargil war with Pakistan.The IAF chief was commissioned into the air force’s fighter stream in December 1982. Before taking charge of his current appointment as vice chief, Chaudhari was the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the operationally critical Western Air Command (WAC). He commanded WAC at a time when the IAF was inducting its new Rafale fighter jets at Ambala, and operationalising them at the earliest was a top priority amid the border row with China in the Ladakh sector.Chaudhari takes over the top job at a critical time -- the armed forces are working out the details of the theaterisation model to best utilise the military’s resources, and he will also oversee several key projects to sharpen the IAF’s combat potential.In his address on Thursday, the new chief said, ``The enhancement of operational capability through integration of newly inducted platforms, weapons and equipment with existing assets and dovetailing the same in concepts of operations will remain a priority area.’’ The defence ministry statement said he also urged air force personnel to “always uphold the ethos and credo of the ‘Air Warrior’, and strive to be an asset to the IAF in any role tasked for”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protect-nation-s-integrity-at-any-cost-says-new-iaf-chief-air-marshal-chaudhari-101633008389839.html

ICMR chief weighs in||Healthcare workers in India were among the first to make it to the government’s priority list for Covid-19 vaccination when the drive to immunise the country against the disease was launched earlier this year. As of Thursday, 99% of the healthcare workers in India have been administered at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and 85% of them have been fully vaccinated, according to the Union health ministry’s data.Director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Balram Bhargava said that discussions about booster doses were “not pertinent", when asked about administering boosters to healthcare workers during a regular press briefing by the health ministry on Thursday.Also read | 25% of India’s eligible population fully vaccinated against Covid-19, says health minister MandaviyaBhargava, however, said that the vaccination drive should focus on fully vaccinating the adult population against the disease. “I think, currently I would say that the talk of booster (doses) is not pertinent and I said this last time also. The call of the hour is to give the two-dose vaccination, which we call as full vaccination, covering the entire adult population. That has to be the goal, that is the agenda and that has to be continued,” he said.Briefing further on why discussions on booster doses were not pertinent at the moment, the ICMR chief said some studies have shown that most of the antibodies against the disease persist for upto a year.“We have had some studies in India, including Bengaluru, where they have looked at the antibodies and they have found that antibodies are persisting for much longer. More than 95% of the antibodies persist for upto a year. Therefore the concept of booster dose is not pertinent at the moment,” he said.When asked about the vaccination coverage among healthcare workers, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said that the ministry has pointed out to some states about the issue. “We have also taken this up with the states. There are certain specific states where the second dose coverage is on the lower side and we have drawn their attention,” he said.He also mentioned that a facility in the Co-WIN system has been provided using which a list of those who have missed the second dose of the vaccine could be generated. “So states have got those lists and they are looking at these people and trying to ensure that the second dose is given to these people,” he further said.The US, the UK, France, Germany and some other nations have already announced their plans to provide a booster dose for their citizens while the World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed its concerns about global distribution of vaccines.Recently, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also called for a moratorium on providing booster doses at least till the end of this year. However, the countries that have announced the booster doses have opted to proceed with their programmes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-healthcare-workers-receive-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-in-india-icmr-chief-weighs-in-101633007408928.html
30-09-2021||India||In a first, Himanta Biswa Sarma cabinet meets outside Guwahati at Dhemaji||Guwahati: The Assam cabinet on Thursday met at Dhemaji, nearly 450 km east from the state capital Dispur. This is the first time the government headed by Himanta Biswa Sarma is holding a cabinet meeting outside Guwahati. In 2016, the then government headed by Sarbananda Sonowal has organised a cabinet meeting in Majuli. Addressing journalists after the meeting, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the tradition would continue. The next cabinet meeting will be held at Bongaigaon in November followed by another at Halflong in December. “This is not just a one-day thing. We reached here a day ahead of the meeting and covered one district. We spent Thursday at Dhemaji and while going back on Friday we will visit another district where they would inspect different projects and interact with different sections of the people,” said the CM. Sarma informed that as per a meeting with employees of the two closed paper mills of Hindustan Paper Mills, the state government would provide them with a ₹570 crore relief package. The cabinet approved the decision and agreed to spend another ₹130 crore to clear all pending dues of the mills with government agencies. “The employees will get a relief package of ₹570 crore. The rest of the amount will go in clearing other dues. In all ₹700 crore would be given to the liquidator. Once that is done, the 4700 ‘bighas’ of land of the two mills will belong to the state government, which in turn will be converted to industrial estates,” Sarma said. The CM announced that the cabinet approved a sum of ₹1800 crore as waiving off of microfinance loans of nearly 1.1 million women borrowers. The state government has earlier signed MoUs with microfinance companies to waive off these loans. The cabinet also made several announcements for Dhemaji district including ₹50 crore to make the deputy commissioner’s office an integrated unit comprising other departments and another ₹50 crore to set up a sports complex,” he said. The holding of the cabinet meeting with much fanfare had invited criticism from some quarters including from one ruling BJP MLA, but Sarma said that it was needed since Assam no longer wants to project the image of a poor state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-assam-cabinet-meets-outside-guwahati-at-dhemaji-101633005989604.html

Every year, Delhi grapples with severe smog around October and November due to stubble burning, vehicular pollution and biomass burning, among other factors. Setting forth the agenda for Delhi’s winter action plan this year, Rai said that the contribution of citizens towards pollution control is as important as the steps taken by the government.Earlier today, the environment minister held a meeting with resident welfare associations (RWA), NGOs and eco clubs in Delhi and took suggestions to improve the pollution control measures being taken by the Delhi government. Senior officials from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee and the environment department also took part in the meeting."We wanted to collect the feedback from these organisations on our efforts and seek their suggestions. Most of the people said that the 'Red light on Gaadi off' campaign should be continued," he told reporters.Rai said that a lot of the suggestions were in favour of promoting carpooling in RWAs. “Residents can plan their work and reduce the number of vehicle trips accordingly, which will help bring down vehicular pollution,” he said. The minister highlighted that the Delhi government will also ensure that security guards and workers in night shift are provided heaters to prevent biomass burning.The environment minister also launched a suggestions forum for the 'Green War Room' launched last year. Any person in Delhi can give suggestions to the government on pollution control measures on the email id -- greenwarroom@gmail.com, he said. The Green War Room monitors and coordinates anti-pollution efforts and updates the "Green Delhi" application to effectively address complaints related to pollution causing activities.The Delhi government will also set up a team of officers to have talks with neighbouring states to jointly fight pollution.“The government is working on a two-line plan of action -- one is to prevent causing pollution and the other to control pollution. For the first one, it is important to create awareness at grassroot levels among citizens,” he said.“We are raising sensitivity among people so that they take it (the problem of pollution in Delhi) as their responsibility... as a collective duty,” he added.Notably, the Delhi government has imposed a complete ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers in the city till January 1, 2022. It has issued detailed guidelines for construction and demolition sites to control dust pollution.Delhi's 'Winter Action Plan' for 2021 will be ready soon, officials told PTI. It will focus on 10 points, including stubble burning, pollution hotspots, working of smog tower and vehicular and dust pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-pollution-gopal-rai-urges-citizens-to-promote-carpooling-ahead-of-winters-101633004293611.html

"As a democratic party, we need to listen to what he has to say, disagree if you must but not in this way. Our priority is to strengthen ourselves to take on the BJP!" Tharoor tweeted.The Punjab crisis has brought the Congress versus Congress clash to the fore after Captain Amarinder Singh resigned from the post of the chief minister of Punjab months ahead of the state election owing to his ongoing clash with Navjot Singh Sidhu. After Amarinder Singh was replaced by Charanjit Singh Channi, Sidhu resigned from the post of the state party unit chief citing differences with Channi. Though the resignation has not been accepted by the high command and Sidhu is likely to continue in his post, the upheaval has given voice to several Congress leaders who are upset with the way the party is functioning.'Shocked, disgusted': Anand Sharma slams 'hooliganism' outside Sibal's houseThat is shameful. We all know @KapilSibal as a true Congressman who has fought multiple cases in court for @INCIndia. As a democratic party we need to listen to what he has to say,disagree if you must but not in this way. Our priority is to strengthen ourselves to take on theBJP! https://t.co/XmtdHapachG-23 leader Kapil Sibal on Wednesday said it is ironic that people considered close to the high command are leaving the party while G-23 leaders who had written to Sonia Gandhi seeking election to the post of the party president will stick to the party and will fight for reforms. Sibal said the party has no president and so he does not know who takes a decision. He also said G-23 is no Ji Huzoor 23 and hence he will continue raising questions.The comments evoked a sharp response from a section of Congress leaders. While Youth Congress leaders protested outside Sibal's house, damaging a car."Those who are trying to defend the command performance last night, this is what happened at Kapil Sibal's house. They damaged the car. Stood on top so it caved in. Threw tomatoes both outside and inside the house. If this is not hooliganism then what else is it?" Congress leader Manish Tewari tweeted.Tharoor termed the act of hooliganism as 'shameful'.Congress leader Natwar Singh on Thursday directly trained the gun at Rahul Gandhi and said three people take decisions in the Congress and one of them has no official designation. "They have decided to remove Amarinder Singh! He is such a veteran politician," Natwar Singh said expressing resentment over the leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shashi-tharoor-supports-kapil-sibal-says-he-fought-many-legal-battles-for-congress-101633004866080.html

Before becoming Vice Chief of the IAF, he was serving as commander-in-chief of the IAF's Western Air Command (WAC) that looks after the security of India air space in the sensitive Ladakh sector as well as various other parts of north India. An alumnus of the National Defence Academy, Air Chief Marshal Chaudhari was commissioned into the fighter stream of the IAF on December 29, 1982. In a distinguished career spanning nearly 38 years, the officer has flown a wide variety of fighter and trainer aircraft in the inventory of IAF. He has a flying experience of more than 3,800 hours, including operational flying on MiG-21, MiG-23 MF, MiG 29 and Su-30 MKI fighter jets. Air Chief Marshal Chaudhari held numerous important positions. He was the commanding officer of a frontline fighter squadron and has also commanded a frontline fighter base. Apart from various operational issues, Air Chief Marshal Chaudhari will have to also address matters related to the ambitious theaterisation model of the armed forces. The theatre commands are being planned to integrate the capabilities of the three services and to ensure optimal utilisation of their resources. The theatre commands are being set up under a larger mandate of ensuring synergy among the three service chiefs to deal with future security challenges. Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat has been focusing on bringing convergence among the three services and restructuring military commands to effectively deal with future security challenges. There has been a growing perception that the Indian Air Force has some reservations about the theaterisation programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-chief-marshal-vivek-ram-chaudhari-takes-charge-as-new-chief-of-indian-air-force-101633004303538.html

The appeal came a day after senior party leader Kapil Sibal raised questions over the functioning of the party and former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh's surprise meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah.Khera asserted that the Congress gives enough freedom to its leaders to express their views but, he added, internal matters should not be discussed publicly for the sake of "discipline". He suggested that they should instead be raised on a proper platform."Crores of Congress workers are in pain due to such acts. Senior party leaders should discuss such matters on a proper platform, not in public. There is a difference between BJP and Congress. While there is no ban on free speech in our party, our leaders need to put their opinion on a proper platform," news agency PTI quoted Khera as saying during an interaction with the media in Ahmedabad."Suppose you have a family dispute, would you prefer to solve it internally or go to your neighbour's terrace and speak about it? There should be discipline, which is necessary to run a family, an organisation and a country," he added.Kapil Sibal yesterday raised questions on the party's high command in the wake of the events unfolding in Punjab, saying that the party workers did not know who was taking decisions in the absence of a full-time president.On a question regarding Amarinder Singh's surprise meeting with Amit Shah days after he resigned as the Punjab CM, Khera said the party felt hurt by his doing."Internal issues should be discussed internally. What was the need to meet when you can talk over the phone. Congress workers, who are fighting against the BJP government and its billionaire friends, are pained to see our own people doing this. I am just sharing the anguish of all those ground level workers with you," the news agency further quoted Khera as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-make-congress-internal-matters-public-pawan-khera-s-appeal-to-party-leaders-101633002361547.html

The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) gave its nod to the vaccine earlier on August 20.Developed in partnership with the department of biotechnology, ZyCoV-D is a first-of-its-kind DNA vaccine that produces the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 to elicit an immune response. It is an intradermal vaccine that has to be applied using a ‘needle-free injector’, which the manufacturer says will help in reducing side effects.Earlier this month, Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said that ZyCoV-D could be made available under the national vaccination programme as early as October.  “We are looking forward to receiving recommendations of the NTAGI on the beneficiary or target group to which the vaccine has to be given. The work is in progress and you will hear more about this in the times to come,” Paul said last week.Zydus Cadila is now looking to begin clinical trials of an mRNA coronavirus vaccine even though a formal announcement is yet to be made.India is presently administering Covishield manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, apart from Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Russia’s Sputnik V vaccines for immunisation against the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-cadila-covid-19-jab-soon-to-be-part-of-india-s-vaccination-programme-govt-101633001557663.html

30-09-2021||India||Monsoon likely to begin withdrawal from some parts of NW India from Oct 6: IMD||Monsoon is likely to begin withdrawal from some parts of northwest India from October 6, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). The normal date for the commencement of monsoon withdrawal is September 17. Last year, the monsoon started withdrawing from western parts of northwest India on September 28.Widespread and heavy rain continues in different parts of the country. In aggregate, monsoon rain has amounted to 99% of the long period average as of Wednesday, making it a “normal” monsoon year.“With the westward movement of the depression over northeast Arabian Sea away from Indian coast, Numerical Weather Prediction Model’s consensus indicates the establishment of westerly and north-westerly winds at lower and middle tropospheric levels over northwest India and development of lower-level anti-cyclonic circulation over the region from October 5,” IMD said in a statement on Thursday. Under its influence, drastic reduction in moisture and absence of rainfall over extreme north-western parts of India is very likely. Thus, conditions are very likely to be favourable for the commencement of withdrawal of south-west monsoon from some parts of northwest India from around October 6.Also Read: 59 of 121 rainy days saw deficit, September wettest month: Data The depression over the northeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Kutch separately moved nearly westwards about 60 km west-northwest of Dwarka (Gujarat). It is very likely to move west-north-westwards and intensify into a deep depression over northeast Arabian Sea off north Gujarat coast during the next 12 hours. Then, it is very likely to move further west-north-westwards and intensify into cyclonic storm Shaheen during the subsequent 24 hours. Thereafter, it is likely to continue to move west-north-westwards close to Pakistan, moving away from the Indian coast, IMD said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-withdrawal-to-begin-from-october-6-101632998549238.html

Here's why it is significant||Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu who is at the centre of the political crisis in Punjab reached Punjab Bhavan on Thursday for his meeting with chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. Punjab sports minister Pargat Singh also arrived to attend the meeting. The crucial meeting comes two days after Navjot Singh Sidhu resigned from the post of the state party president, opposing the appointments made by Charanjit Channi. The meeting was organised at the behest of Charanjit Singh Channi who called Navjot Sidhu personally for a meeting to settle things across the table.The meeting assumes significance as it will be Charanjit Singh's first test as the chief minister to settle the issue with Navjot Sidhu.Just before the meeting, Navjot Singh Sidhu tweeted about the appointment of IPS Sahota. "DGP IPS Sahota was head of SIT investigating Beadbi case under Badal Govt, he wrongfully indicted two Sikh youth for sacrilege and gave clean chit to Badals. In 2018, I along with INC Ministers, then PCC Pres and present Home Minister assured them of our support in fight for Justice," Navjot Sidhu tweeted indicating that he was not in a mood to take a step back.'Have no ego': Punjab CM Charanjit Channi says party is supreme, invites Navjot Sidhu for talksCharanjit Singh Channi said on Wednesday that he was not rigid about the appointments. He said he had no ego and whatever might have upset Sidhu can be discussed. The indication is the appointments can be reversed. He also termed Sidhu as the head of the family and said that wherever objection he has can be discussed. Channi also steered clear from making any controversial statement when reporters told that Sidhu's move was to threaten the Channi government. Channi said there is no threat to the government and the situation is not beyond redressal. Punjab will go to the elections in a few months. The removal of Captain Amarinder Singh following his ongoing disagreement with Navjot Singh Sidhu could not bring a solution to the crisis the Congress is facing in Punjab, as it has again come to Sidhu versus chief minister in the border state.   The Congress might go for Navjot Sidhu as the chief minister face for the upcoming assembly election and Charanjit Singh Channi was supposed to be in charge of the government for a few months. However, Channi can come off with flying colours if he can deftly handle the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-sidhu-charanjit-channi-meeting-here-s-why-it-is-significant-101632998065979.html

Therefore, I hereby resign as the President of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee," Sidhu wrote in his letter.Sidhu was appointed the chief of Punjab Congress on July 23 following a feud with Captain Amarinder Singh, who resigned as the chief minister of Punjab on September 18.Hours after Sidhu quit, cabinet minister Razia Sultana, Congress state general secretary Yoginder Dhingra and treasurer Gulzar Inder Singh Chahal followed suit in solidarity with him.Even though Sidhu did not explain about the "compromise" part mentioned in his letter to Sonia Gandhi, party insiders said the former cricketer-turned-politician was disappointed that he wasn't named the chief minister after captain Amarinder Singh stepped down.

According to us, the persons involved in illegal sand mining are out to hoodwink the authorities. Unfortunately, we find that in many cases even the authorities appear to be too eager to be hoodwinked,” the high court bench of justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar, said. The court said that the police authorities, in particular, are most lax when it comes to preventing illegal and unauthorized sand mining. “The director general of police (DGP) must issue strict instructions to the concerned police stations to render all possible cooperation to the authorities taking steps to prevent illegal sand mining. The DGP should also issue strict instructions to all the concerned police stations to attend to the complaints about illegal sand mining, promptly,” the court said.It added that there were instances of cops simply refusing to come to the illegal mining sites and directed the DGP to take action against such police officials who indulge in dereliction of duties. The high court said two sites were ‘hotspots’ of sand mining and directed the authorities to install CCTVs there within 15 days as well as place police personnel round the clock. Also Read: Ahead of Goa polls, Shiv Sena calls BJP real ‘beef party’, will field candidates on 22 seats Goa’s estuarine rivers are hotspots for sand mining as sand from upstream is deposited in areas where the fresh water meets the sea, leading to siltation and the natural formation of sand banks, which are then dredged by the sand miners. However, the miners have been dredging in other areas as well, causing the banks of rivers to collapse, resulting in loss of agricultural land and destruction of crops. In the case of one of the hotspots under a river bridge, the dredging is posing a threat to the foundation of the bridge itself, the high court observed. The court also said that seized canoes are to be “kept at a secured location, away from the river banks.” “These canoes have no good reason to remain parked on the government property. The government also has no good reason to permit such canoes to be parked on its property, particularly when these properties appear to be hot-spots for illegal sand mining,” the HC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/action-ordered-against-cops-not-curbing-illegal-sand-mining-in-goa-101632993331667.html
30-09-2021||India||Amarinder Singh says he will leave Congress but won't join BJP||Former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday said he won't be staying with the Congress, but dismissed speculations of joining the BJP, a day after he met Union home minister Amit Shah at Shah's residence in New Delhi. The former Punjab chief minister was speaking to a television channel as he said, "So far, I am in the Congress but I will not remain in the Congress. I will not be treated in this manner." Later, his office issued a statement regarding this. Amarinder Singh's media advisor Raveen Thukral also tweeted the interview clippings on his social media handle. On the question of floating a new party, Amarinder Singh said time will tell what will happen. "So you are neither in Congress nor in BJP?" Amarinder Singh was asked. "I have not resigned from the Congress yet but I will resign. I am not one of those who decide on a split second. One has to think of various pros and cons before making a decision. But I can tell you I am not going to stay with the Congress. I am not going to join BJP also," Amarinder Singh said.This is the first time that Amarinder Singh talked about leaving the party. His resignation from the post of Punjab chief minister with a few months left for the election was bitter as he said how insulted and humiliated he felt by the treatment of the party high command. However, he never specifically spoke of leaving the party, though he had said he would oppose Navjot Sidhu as the chief minister by fielding a strong candidate against him. Amid speculations of Amarinder Singh's next political move, the Captain met Union home minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday. Later, Amarinder Singh said that he urged Amit Shah to repeal the three contentious farm laws.On Thursday, Amarinder Singh met national security advisor Ajit Doval possibly to discuss the security issues of Punjab, the bordering state. Earlier, Amarinder Singh had said Navjot Singh Sidhu is a threat to India's national security because of his closeness with Pakistan army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.Amarinder Singh's association with the Congress goes a long way as he was brought into the party by the late Rajiv Gandhi. He was first elected to the Lok Sabha in 1980 and resigned from the Congress as a protest during Operation Blue Star. He had formed a splinter group breaking away from the Akali Dal and his outfit merged with the Congress in 1998. After resigning from the chief minister's post, Amarinder Singh often talked about his connection with the Congress and said Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi are like his children and they are being misled regarding Punjab. In the interview with NDTV, Amarinder Singh again slammed Navjot Singh Sidhu and said he is an entertainer while the job of the Punjab Congress chief is a serious one.  The Captain, however, is confident about new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. "Channi can do a good job but that fellow (Sidhu) needs to allow him to do his work," Amarinder Singh told NDTV.Amarinder Singh on CongressA day after senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal questioned the Congress leadership over the present crisis of the party, Amarinder Singh said senior Congressmen are thinkers, critical to the future of the party.  The younger leadership should be promoted to implement the plans, which the senior leaders are best equipped to formulate, Amarinder Singh said. "Unfortunately, the seniors were being completely sidelined which is not good for the party," he said condemning the attack on Kapil Sibal’s house by Congress workers hours after he said G-23 is not 'Ji Huzoor 23'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-says-he-will-leave-congress-but-won-t-join-bjp-report-101632991635522.html

Five Karnataka lawmakers were earlier suspended when as they declared themselves as associate BJP members in 2010.As per the Tenth Schedule, included in the Constitution in 1985 through the 52nd amendment: “An elected member of a House who has been elected as such otherwise than as a candidate set up by any political party shall be disqualified for being a member of the House if he joins any political party after such election.”Also Read: ‘Out of gutter, into the drain’: Vijayvargiya on Kanhaiya Kumar joining Congress Mevani and Congress also avoided having the former as an associate member.

Like Mevani, Banerjee just pledged support for TMC.On September 28, Gandhi presented Mevani a copy of the Congress’s constitution.

But how can the highways be blocked and this is happening perpetually. Where does this end?” the apex court said.A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh was hearing a petition for removal of the road blockades along the borders of Delhi.Stating that it was the executive's duty to implement the law laid down by the court, the SC allowed the Centre to file a formal application to make some farmer unions party to the plea seeking opening of road blockade along the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border at UP Gate. The matter will be heard next Monday when the application is filed.Supreme Court says redressal can be through judicial forum, agitation or parliamentary debates & asks how can highways be blocked & this can't be a perpetual problem, while hearing a plea for removing the road blockades by farmers due to protest pic.twitter.com/tKzzRg9BcMA Noida resident, Monicca Agrawaal, had filed the petition seeking the withdrawal of the roadblock stating it took two hours to reach Delhi from the area, a stretch that could be covered in 20 minutes before the stir began.The bench asked additional solicitor general KM Nataraj what was the government doing in the matter.Nataraj said a meeting had been convened with the protesting farmers and details of the same were mentioned in the affidavit.The bench said, “We may lay down a law but how to implement the law is your business. The court cannot implement it. It is the executive who has to implement it”.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta agreed that it was the duty of the executive to implement the law.The bench said, “When we lay down the law, you will say it is encroachment and we trespassed into the domain of the executive. This has ramifications but there are also grievances which need to be addressed. This cannot be a perpetual problem”.Mehta said a three-member committee was formed to address the grievances of the farmers, but the representatives of the aggrieved agri community refused to join in the discussions.Mehta said the court should allow the petitioner to make the farmers union party to the petition, so that later they would not be able to say that they were not made parties in the matter.The bench told Mehta that it was he who had to move an application for making farmers representative party as the petitioner, a private individual, may not know who their leaders were.“If you feel that someone is to be made party, you will have to make a request. You move a formal application giving details about the steps taken to resolve their grievances and how the impleadment of representatives of farmers will help in the resolution of the dispute”, the bench said, while listing the plea for hearing on October 4. Mehta said an application would be filed by Friday.On August 23, the top court had said that the Centre and Delhi's neighbouring states should find a solution to road blockades on the national capital's borders due to farmers' protest.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-sc-asks-how-can-highways-be-blocked-perpetually-101632988518182.html

The body was taken to Bhairon Ghat in Kanpur at 4 am and cremated in heavy police presence by a few relatives.Earlier in the morning, Gupta’s wife Meenakshi Gupta said she didn’t want any politics over her husbands death. “I need justice and help me get that,” she said in a tweet.The cremation was a big challenge ahead of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s visit to Kanpur and neighbouring Unnao. The CM is likely to meet the Gupta family at the DAV school ground where he was likely to address a public meeting in preparation for the assembly polls next year.Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav met the family and assured them of all help. The Congress general secretary, Priyanka Gandhi, too, had spoken to the family over the phone.On Wednesday, a case of murder was registered against six policemen allegedly involved in the realtor’s death.Also Read: UP CM Adityanath orders FIRs against policemen in Gorakhpur raid case36-year-old Manish Gupta died on Monday during a police raid in a Gorakhpur hotel where he was staying with his two friends from Gurugram.

Six policemen, suspected to be involved, went missing after the incident and were booked on CM Yogi Adityanath’s instruction.Gorakhpur superintendent of police (SSP) Vipin Tada said: “Prima facie in this case, we had suspended six policemen. Now, on the basis of a complaint by the deceased’s family, we have filed a case against the six cops.”Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav slammed the law and order in the state.“The state of jungle law is such under this government that police are soft on criminals and behave barbarously with common people,” Priyanka tweeted on Wednesday. In a series of tweets, Mayawati said the incident exposed the BJP government’s claims about law and order. Akhilesh Yadav said the incident was an outcome of the “police encounter culture” that the BJP government gave birth to. He demanded that all the accused are tried for murder.

Besides star Daniel Craig himself, Zimmer’s score has perhaps the greatest impact in the moving final moments of No Time to Die, the actor’s fifth and final film as Commander James Bond; a melodrama masquerading as a muscular action picture.

Sidhu resigned as the chief of the Congress party's Punjab unit, miffed over some appointments in the Channi cabinet. The chief minister had said that differences over these issues can be resolved through talks.Also Read: Punjab Congress in turmoil, ripples felt in Delhi"Chief Minister has invited me for talks … will reciprocate by reaching Punjab Bhawan, Chandigarh at 3:00 PM today, he is welcome for any discussions!" Sidhu said on Twitter.Chief Minister has invited me for talks … will reciprocate by reaching Punjab Bhawan, Chandigarh at 3:00 PM today, he is welcome for any discussions !He had expressed his anguished in a video message on Wednesday by raising questions over the appointments of the director general of police and the state's advocate general. Sidhu said that his objective had always been to improve the lives of people and “to make a difference”.“My fight is for the issues and an agenda of Punjab,” he said in an over four-minute video clip shared on his Twitter handle.In an apparent reference to the 2015 sacrilege incidents in Faridkot, Sidhu said those who gave clean chits to the Badals six years ago had been given the responsibility of delivering justice. DGP Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota was the head of a special investigation team (SIT) formed in 2015 by the then Akali government to probe the sacrilege incidents. He also apparently questioned the appointment of senior advocate APS Deol as the new advocate general of Punjab. “My soul jitters when I see those who secured blanket bails, they are advocate general.

The party is supreme and the government accepts the party's ideology and follows that.

Sidhu resigned barely 72 days after he was appointed the chief of Punjab's Congress unit, pushing the party into a fresh crisis in poll-bound Punjab before it could recover from months of turmoil caused by a bitter tussle between Sidhu and his bête noire, then chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, left the party divided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-singh-sidhu-to-meet-channi-at-3pm-day-after-punjab-cm-said-let-s-talk-101632983340681.html

Among his offers were free health benefits at public hospitals across the state, treatment at which he promised would be on par with private healthcare. He also said that similar to Delhi, all medicines, tests, treatments, and operations would be free of cost if his party came to power in the state. Kejriwal, however, did not name a chief ministerial candidate for Punjab but promised that an announcement will be made in this regard in due time. He also didn't confirm if former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh would be joining the AAP, calling the theory “hypothetical”.Also Read | Power in 2022: Arvind Kejriwal in Punjab to address problems of industrialists#KejriwalDiDujiGuarantee1️⃣FREE & QUALITY Healthcare for ALL2️⃣All Medicines, Tests, Operations to be FREE3️⃣Health-card for All4️⃣16000 Pind/Mohalla Clinics5️⃣New World-class Govt Hospitals to be built, old ones to be revamped6️⃣Free treatment of all Road Accident Victims pic.twitter.com/Kw87YIT4h6Addressing a press conference in Punjab's Ludhiana, Kejriwal said that except for the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in Chandigarh, all other government-run health centres and institutions in the state are in a “pitiable condition” forcing the common people to look for options at private hospitals. “These private hospitals, in turn, loot the public; meanwhile the government has a serious shortage of staff and infrastructure in its healthcare facilities,” he said.AAP president Arvind Kejriwal announced six guarantees related to healthcare for Punjab residents based on the Delhi model, if the party wins power in the next assembly elections:1.

30-09-2021||India||Diesel rates bounced back to record ₹89.87 a litre on Thursday||Diesel prices bounced back to the record price of ₹89.87 per litre in Delhi on Thursday after state-run fuel retailers raised its rate by 30 paise a litre, which is the fifth hike in seven days, resulting in the fuel rate surging by ₹1.25 a litre.The recent price hikes also saw petrol becoming costlier by 45 paise a litre after its rate was raised by 25 paise on Thursday, which is the second hike in three days. Petrol is now sold at ₹101.64 a litre in Delhi.While fuel rates of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in Delhi are benchmarks for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes and local levies.Domestic rates of petrol and diesel continue to soar even as international crude oil prices retreated marginally from $80 a barrel mark it had achieved during Tuesday. Benchmark Brent crude on Thursday opened at $78.46 a barrel, down by 0.23%.An executive working in a public sector oil company said on condition of anonymity that fuel retailers calibrated raising domestic rates of petrol and diesel even as international oil prices saw a northward movement from mid-September and it breached the $80 a barrel mark. “Companies are recovering past dues as the full impact of international oil price hike was not immediately passed on to the customer,” he said.State-run oil refiners are cautiously watching the international oil price movement, which is volatile and expected to move up due to rising demand and continued supply squeeze by the oil cartel -- the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia (together known as OPEC+).Also Read: Reduce taxes, give relief to common man: Gehlot to Centre on fuel price hike Domestic petrol prices saw first upward movement from Tuesday after July 17, when it hit an all-time high of ₹101.84 per litre. However, the recent diesel price rally started a bit early from Friday after it was last hiked on July 15 to the record ₹89.87 a litre.Prices are also moving up because the rupee is depreciating against the dollar, which makes imports costlier, the executives said. India imports more than 80% crude oil it processes and pays in dollar. Customers should not expect any instant relief as fuel prices may not soften immediately, he said.Before the recent rally that started from Friday, oil companies had reduced petrol and diesel rates in small doses by 65 paise per litre (petrol) and ₹1.25 (diesel) between mid-August and early September to pass the benefit of global oil price softening, which had plunged to $68.23 per barrel on August 18.According to International Energy Agency (IEA) and OPEC, global demand is expected to outpace supply due to which international oil prices will likely remain firm in the near to mid-term. A simultaneous rally in natural gas is also likely to drive demand for alternate fuels, including crude oil, the executive said.Global demand for crude oil has been increasing consistently with the easing of pandemic restrictions and improving vaccination rates, he said. “Crude Oil prices have reached to near three-year high as global output disruptions have forced energy companies to draw more crude oil out of their stockpiles. Accordingly, US crude oil inventory levels are also nearing a three-year low,” he added.“On the supply side, OPEC+ alliance has been slow in easing output restrictions, contributing to the tightened supply in the market. Additionally, hurricanes Ida and Nicholas have impacted crude oil production in the US Gulf of Mexico region, when they hit in late August and September respectively,” he said.International oil rates, which are often volatile, directly influence pump prices of petrol and diesel in India. Heavy loads of central and state taxes are also responsible for astronomically high rates of the auto fuels.Through 2020, as global crude prices plunged (below $20 a barrel in April last year), the Central government raised excise duty on fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit as their revenues were hit on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, the central and state levies on petrol and diesel are over 50% of their retail prices. According to official data, the petroleum sector contributed ₹371,726 crore Central excise revenue in 2020-21, and ₹202,937 crore state levies or value-added tax (VAT). In Delhi, Central levies account for over 32.5% of petrol’s price, and state taxes (VAT) 23.07%. On diesel, the Central excise is over 35.8% while VAT is more than 14.6%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/diesel-rates-bounced-back-to-record-rs-89-87-a-litre-on-thursday-101632983187982.html

30-09-2021||India||Turmoil in Punjab Congress, ripples felt in Delhi: 10 points||The Congress is facing the heat in Punjab, and the spillover effect is being felt in Delhi. Senior leaders of the party are publicly voicing differences with the leadership, prompting protests by others in the same party.Also Read: Frantic mediations on to end political crisis in PunjabNavjot Singh Sidhu has already shown his defiance, resigning as the president of the party's state unit. Further aggravating the troubles for the Congress, former chief minister Amarinder Singh met Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi, fuelling speculation about a change in camp, though he has officially denied any such move.Here are the latest developments on the political crisis in Punjab:• Taking a swipe at the Congress over Punjab turmoil, Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra on Wednesday said the party has become a vehicle without a driver. Speaking to news agency ANI, the Union minister slammed Sidhu calling him "unstable" and "extremely ambitious".• Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who is coming to Delhi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, attacked Rahul Gandhi, alleging he is sinking the Congress party. "Amarinder was removed because of Sidhu, now Sidhu has run away as well. We don't have to do anything as long as Rahul Gandhi is there," said Chouhan.• Meanwhile, Punjab transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring on Wednesday ensured that all the issues within the party will be resolved soon. Hinting that the party intends to retain Sidhu as the state Congress chief, the minister said, "We are like a family. If Sidhu Ji has said something in anger, then it does not matter. He is our party president and his resignation has not been accepted yet."• Reacting to the developments in Punjab, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal demanded an immediate meeting of the party's highest decision-making body the working committee and wondered who in the party was taking decisions in the absence of a full-time president.• Sibal, a member of the 'Group of 23' which last year had written to Congress President Sonia Gandhi, said at a press conference that the grouping is "not a Jee Huzur 23" and will continue to put forth the views and will continue to repeat the demands.• He came under attacks from several quarters with some Congress workers also protesting outside his house in New Delhi. Carrying 'Get Well Soon Kapil Sibal' placards, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) workers said they were "hurt" by his remarks.• Sensing an opportunity ahead of assembly elections in the state, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said that only his party can give a good and honest government to the state. Kejriwal is on a two-day visit to Punjab.• The Congress hit out at Amit Shah for meeting Amarinder Singh, with party leader Randeep Surjewala saying the home minister's residence has become the "new centre of anti-Dalit politics". Surjewala further said that the arrogance of those sitting in power has been hurt ever since a Dalit (Charanjit Singh Channi) has been made the chief minister of Punjab.• Dissension in the Congress' Punjab unit erupted in May but the leadership hoped the appointment of Sidhu as party unit chief and the removal of his arch-rival Singh as chief minister would tamp down tensions.• But Sidhu’s resignation barely 72 days after being appointed took the party by surprise, and embarrassed Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who together orchestrated Sidhu’s appointment and Singh’s exit as part of an effort to end factionalism and improve the party’s chances in next year’s state elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-congress-in-turmoil-ripples-felt-in-delhi-10-points-101632969922775.html

Elections to Samserganj and Jangipur assembly seats in Bengal’s Murshidabad are also being held today after they were deferred in April following the death of two candidates. Counting of votes will be done on October 3. The by-poll became necessary after the Trinamool Congress (TMC) sitting lawmaker from Bhabanipur, Sovandeb Chatterjee resigned so that Banerjee could contest from the seat and retain her berth. Even though the Trinamool Congress swept the assembly polls and returned to power for the third consecutive term after winning 213 seats out of the 292 contested in April this year, Banerjee lost from Nandigram to Bharatiya Janata Party’s Suvendu Adhikari, her protégé-turned-adversary. She, however, took oath as the state’s chief minister on May 5. As per law, the TMC leader needs to get elected to the state assembly by November 5 in order to continue in her post.“Around 35 companies of Central forces have been deployed in Bhabanipur. This apart, 38 police pickets have been set up. One Central police observer has been deployed. There are 287 booths in the constituency,” said an Election Commission of India official.

However, Banerjee still became the chief minister, conditional upon the fact that she will have to win her way back to the state assembly within a six-month grace period.Later, West Bengal agriculture minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay vacated his Bhabanipur seat, necessitating the bypolls to let the party supremo contest from her home turf. Indeed, Mamata Banerjee is reportedly at ease in Bhabanipur, a constituency she had won both in the 2016 and the 2011 elections. Bypolls to begin in 3 assembly segments in Bengal, 1 in OdishaBypolls are to begin on Thursday in three assembly segments of West Bengal – Bhabanipur, Samserganj, and Jangipur; as well as one other constituency in Odisha – Pipili. All eyes are on the Bhabanipur bypolls, which will decide Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee's fate as the chief minister of West Bengal at the end of her six-month grace period where she functioned in office despite losing the assembly polls herself earlier this year.

Japalpure had initially registered a complaint with the local charity commissioner and chief minister’s secretariat. The local charity commissioner said right wing organisation was not a registered body and hence, was unable to initiate any action. “Since the RSS has no bank account as it is not a registered organisation, how did it manage to generate such a huge amount ...during the pandemic?” he said in his complaint registered with the agencies here on Tuesday.Senior RSS functionary Arvind Kukde said the organisation would respond whenever it receives any summons. “Our organisation believes in the law of the land,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activist-writes-to-ed-i-t-dept-for-probe-into-rss-funding-101632950331783.html
30-09-2021||India||Taliban reach out to India over resumption of flights, scholarships||The Taliban setup in Kabul has been reaching out to the Indian side to explore the continuation of contacts in different fields, ranging from resumption of commercial flights to scholarships for Afghan students, people familiar with matter said on Wednesday.These contacts have come at a time when the Indian government has indicated it is in no hurry to recognise the interim cabinet created by the Taliban, which is dominated by hardliners and members of the UN-designated Haqqani Network. The people cited above said on condition of anonymity that there had been no formal response to any of the Taliban proposals.The Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority, which is now controlled by the so-called “Islamic Emirate” of the Taliban, sent a formal communication to India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on September 7 regarding the resumption of commercial flights between the two countries from Kabul airport.The letter, addressed to DGCA chief Arun Kumar and signed by “acting minister” Hameedullah Akhunzada, contends that the Kabul airport was “damaged and [made] dysfunctional” by American troops before their withdrawal last month. The airport had been made operational again with aid from Qatar and a NOTAM or “notice to airmen” in this regard had been issued on September 6, the letter adds.In recent days, Taliban officials such as acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi have reached out to the Indian side through intermediaries to take up issues such as travel by Afghan students who have secured scholarships offered by the Indian government, the people cited above said.Muttaqi was reportedly keen that Afghan students holding Indian scholarships, including those awarded for the 2021 academic session, should be allowed to travel to the country.The people said the Indian side is in no hurry to take a call on recognising the Taliban setup or to respond to the messages from the Taliban, especially at a time when no other country has established official relations with the dispensation in Kabul.State-run Air India stopped flights to Kabul on August 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-reach-out-to-india-over-resumption-of-flights-scholarships-101632949551802.html
30-09-2021||India||Traumatised by two-finger test after rape, says IAF officer||A 28-year-old woman Indian Air Force (IAF) officer who accused her colleague of rape has levelled serious allegations against IAF of subjecting her to an illegal two-finger test to confirm rape, of adopting a hostile attitude towards her during the inquiry, and of tampering with the evidence.According to the first information report (FIR) filed by the Tamil Nadu Police on September 20, seen by HT on Wednesday, the woman officer said she was raped on campus at the Air Force Administrative College in Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore district. She also said that the college authorities told her that if she could endure the pain of an ankle injury (which she had suffered hours before the alleged crime), she could also deal with the pain of seeing her rapist on campus.IAF declined to comment on the allegations. “We don’t want to offer a comment at this stage since the matter is sub-judice,” said a spokesperson not wishing to be named.After the local police arrested the accused, a 29-year-old Flight Lieutenant, his lawyer and IAF independently argued at the additional Mahila court in Coimbatore on Monday that the civil police have no jurisdiction in the case.They asked for the accused’s custody to be transferred to IAF for it to investigate and hold court-martial proceedings. The court, however, extended his judicial custody to September 30, and said it would decide on the jurisdiction of the case that day.Experts said that the details in the complaint were shocking.“The defence services should understand that they are not immune to sexual assaults being committed within the services, and they have to be prepared to handle them efficaciously,” said Vidya Reddy, who works on prevention of sexual assault and child sexual abuse.According to the FIR, the survivor had injured her right leg while playing basketball during training on September 9. She took a painkiller, and that evening joined her colleagues at the officers’ mess bar, where the accused offered to pay for her second drink. The officer said she vomited and went to bed, and two friends (one male and the other female) took care of her and latched the room from outside before leaving.As she was sleeping, the accused allegedly came in, tried to wake her up, and tried to kiss her. She kept pushing him away but was unsuccessful due to her ankle injury.The next thing she remembered, the FIR said, was a female friend asking her if the man was in the room with her consent.The next day, according to the FIR, she confronted the accused, who expressed regret at having invaded her privacy. But her female friend showed her semen stains on the bed.On September 11, she was told to meet two faculty members, who gave her two options — either file a complaint, or give a written statement that everything was consensual. She was directed to go to the Air Force Hospital.Her friends had accompanied her, and the doctors wanted to watch the confession video, they asked the victim about her sexual history and physically examined her private parts.“Only later did I find out that the two-finger test is not supposed to be done for a rape exam. This action made me nauseous enough to relive the trauma of being raped,” the FIR read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/traumatised-by-two-finger-test-after-rape-says-iaf-officer-101632949156495.html
30-09-2021||India||Pak terrorist caught in Kashmir reveals anti-India propaganda||A Pakistani terrorist, affiliated to the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), captured during an encounter in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri sector, said the neighbouring country’s intelligence agency, ISI, and his handlers in the terrorist outfit have been presenting a wrong picture about Kashmir and Indian army.The 18-year-old terrorist from Okara district in Pakistan’s Punjab province, Ali Babar Patra, asked his handlers in the neighbouring country to take him back to his mother. “I request Pakistan Army, ISI and Lashkar to make arrangements to take me back the way they sent me to Kashmir,” Patra said at a press conference, addressed by Major General Virendra Vats, General Officer Commanding (GOC), 19 infantry division, on Wednesday.Patra was captured by the Indian Army during an encounter in the Uri sector on September 27. Another Pakistani terrorist, identified as Atiq ur Rehman alias Qari Anas, a resident of Attock in Pakistan’s Punjab province, was killed in the encounter, the army said on Tuesday.On Wednesday, Patra also said that the Pakistan Army, the ISI and the LeT were spreading lies about the situation in Kashmir.“We were told that the Indian Army is carrying out a bloodbath, but everything is peaceful here. I want to tell my mother that the Indian Army has taken good care of me,” he said.Patra said he was lured into joining the LeT due to poverty after losing his father at an early age in 2014.“I had undergone three weeks of preliminary training at Garhi Habibullah Camp (KPK) in 2019 and then fresh training this year. I was working in cloth factory in Sailkot, where I met Anas who was working with Lashkar and ISI. He (Anas) gave me ₹20,000 for my mother’s treatment and had promised an additional amount of ₹30,000 on my safe return from Pattan near Baramulla.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-terrorist-caught-in-kashmir-reveals-anti-india-propaganda-101632948950018.html
30-09-2021||India||Ghulam Nabi Azad seeks CWC meet amid ‘mass exodus’||Congressmen who in 2019 wrote to interim party president Sonia Gandhi seeking a change in how the party functions have again spoken out following the crisis in the party in Punjab and the exit of a senior leader from its Goa unit.One of the leaders of the so-called G-23 (group of 23), Ghulam Nabi Azad wrote to interim president Sonia Gandhi seeking a Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting to discuss the Punjab and Goa situation as well as the “mass exodus” in the organization.Another senior member of G-23, Kapil Sibal, demanded “open dialogue” and introspection, questioning the lack of clarity in the decision-making process. He emphasised that the grouping was made not made up yes men: “We are G23 but not ‘ji huzoor (yes, lordship) 23’.” “We don’t have a president. So, who’s taking the decisions? We all know and yet we don’t know. We want a CWC meeting for a dialogue to take place,” he said.And still another, Manish Tewari, said the Punjab situation was “mishandled” and the state required “stability”. On Tuesday, Navjot Singh Siddhu, who was backed by both Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as the Punjab Congress Committee chief, resigned barely two months into the job, miffed at not having his way with senior administrative appointments made by the new chief minister, and also the composition of the cabinet. Sidhu and the Gandhis were behind the resignation of the state’s former chief minister and senior Congress leader Captain Amarinder Singh.According to party functionaries familiar with the matter, Azad wrote to Sonia Gandhi on behalf of G 23 asking for a CWC meeting in the light of “developments in Punjab and Goa” that are “disappointing” . He suggested that the CWC be called to also look into the issue of mass exodus from the party.A senior Congress leader said on condition of anonymity that a CWC meeting will be called soon and all issues would be discussed threadbare.Sibal announced that the G-23 leaders do not plan to exit the party. “People close to them have left them. But those who are not considered close, are with them,” he said pointedly, referring to the exits of Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sushmita Dev and Jitin Prasada. Scindia and Dev were considered close to Rahul Gandhi, but were pushed to leave the party. They are now Rajya Sabha MPs of the BJP and TMC respectively; Scindia is also the union minister for civil aviation.Tewari joined the critical chorus on Twitter. “I would be dishonest if I say that the situation was not completely mishandled. Suffice to say, whatever Capt Amarinder had said has come true. What Punjab needed at this time needed stability &unfortunately those who were in charge of state did not have a clue.”Sibal pledged loyalty to the party and said he “condemns” those who left Congress. “But we also need to ask ourselves -- we might have faults,” he added.Congress workers protested Sibal’s comments outside his house later evening and his party colleague Ajay Maken criticised him in comments to news agency ANI, saying it was Sonia Gandhi who had made him (Sibal) a minister (when the UPA was in power). “Want to tell Mr Sibal and others that they should not degrade the organisation that gave them their identity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghulam-nabi-azad-seeks-cwc-meet-amid-mass-exodus-101632943444246.html
30-09-2021||India||Huge investments on ops against Maoists continue in Karnataka||The Karnataka government continues to spend over ₹7 crore a year and deploy 500 policemen to the Anti-Naxal Force (ANF), despite just five known Maoists in the state, who, according to the intelligence department, moved to Kerala.Questions are now being raised by officers within the department as the state continues to make large investments in the force, even though there hasn’t been a single major encounter between the Maoists and forces. Karnataka is also not in the home ministry’s list of Maoist-affected states.The two latest deaths associated with the ANF are of a constable dying in friendly fire and a civilian killed by the ANF in a case of mistaken identity.Even though there is an opinion within the department to reduce the allocation to the force, it continues to remain a white elephant in the state police, say officials of the intelligence department. Since 2010, the government inducted 1,127 officers of the rank of ASI and above while it hired 1,540 head constables and constables. However, of these, the ANF has now relieved 2,263 staff, leaving the unit with 578 members. “There are only five suspected Maoists currently operating in the state -- Vikas Gowda, BG Krishnamurthy, Mundagaru Latha, Vanajakshi, and Angadi Pradeep. We have been tracking their movement for years now, and we are certain that all of them have moved to Kerala, specifically to the Wayanad district. One of the reasons is that the terrain of Karnataka jungles is not conducive for staying,” said a senior intelligence department official. Despite this, there are no plans on the cards to dismantle or reduce the strength of the department, Karnataka police DG and IGP Praveen Sood said.Sood said that even though the number of Maoists is low, the force remains an important part. “I don’t agree with the argument that ANF is a white elephant. Yes, we have a handful of the Maoists in the state. But it is important to understand that the job of these units is not to hunt the Maoists but to deny them territory,” said Sood. Explaining his rationale, the police chief said that even though there are not many Maoists in operating the forests of Karnataka, it is important to police presence through patrolling it maintained. “We are aware that our neighbours have Maoist problem and parts of Kerala make a red corridor that connects these states. So we have to conduct area denial operations to ensure, Maoists are not allowed to operate in these areas. We need large manpower to cover these large areas,” said Sood. ST Ramesh, former Karnataka DG and IGP, said that while the state government could look to reallocate some resources, dismantling a unit like ANF is not practical. “If you ask me, I would say more focus should be on core policing. That is maintaining law and order and crime prevention. Now duties such as anti-Maoist operations are not a priority in a state like Karnataka. But neglecting these duties wouldn’t be wise,” he said. The officer added that the state was a hotbed for Maoist activities in the past. “One of the reasons why there is a lull now is the police action over the years. But I also believe that more than just having units like ANF, an effort should be made to strengthen policing and police stations in these regions to give more confidence to people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/huge-investments-on-ops-against-maoists-continue-in-karnataka-101632943283481.html
30-09-2021||India||Punjab caught in dirty fight for power: Arvind Kejriwal||Aam Aadmi Party national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said that the way things were unfolding on Punjab’s political landscape was really unfortunate and it was nothing but “fight for power”.“A dirty fight for power is going on...People of Punjab are feeling helpless. They do not know where to go. I request them to wait for just three months as we will give them a stable government,” Kejriwal said as he arrived in the poll-bound state.The AAP chief congratulated Charanjit Singh Channi on his elevation as chief minister and asked him to “remove” the tainted ministers, MLAs and officers inducted in his cabinet.“I urge him to fulfil all the promises made by his predecessor Captain Amarinder Singh before the 2017 polls. People of Punjab are looking at five things. First, they want removal of tainted ministers and officers with an immediate effect. Second, they are unhappy over inaction in the 2015 sacrilege cases... Then, there is the issue of unemployment allowance which the state government has not given in the past four-and-a-half years. Also, the waiver of farm loans must be expedited,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-caught-in-dirty-fight-for-power-arvind-kejriwal-101632942867185.html
30-09-2021||India||No law can take away court’s power to punish for contempt: Supreme Court||Even Parliament can’t take away the power of the Supreme Court to punish for contempt, the top court ruled on Wednesday, stressing that the authority is bestowed by the Constitution itself, and therefore no law can be enacted to mitigate or nullify it.“The power to punish for contempt is a constitutional power vested in this court which cannot be abridged or taken away even by legislative enactment,” said the bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh as it drew a distinction between Articles 142 and 129.Article 142 (2) states that “subject to the provisions of any law made in this behalf by Parliament” the Supreme Court shall have all and every power to make any order on punishment of any contempt of itself. However, Article 129 lays down that the Supreme Court shall be a court of record, and shall have all the powers of such a court, including the power to punish for contempt.“The comparison of the two provisions show that whereas the founding fathers felt that the powers under clause (2) of Article 142 could be subject to any law made by the Parliament, there is no such restriction as far as Article 129 is concerned... this is a constitutional power which cannot be taken away or in any manner abridged by statute,” the bench underscored.Parliament framed the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, laying down procedure and punishment.The Act divides contempt into civil and criminal contempt. Civil contempt refers to the wilful disobedience of an order of any court whereas criminal contempt includes any act or publication which: scandalises the court, prejudices any judicial proceeding or interferes with the administration of justice in any other manner.The SC judgment on Wednesday, however, maintained that its power to punish for contempt of itself is not dependent on statutory enactment but that it draws this power from the Constitution itself.The judgment came as the court held Rajiv Dahiya, managing director of Rajasthan-based NGO Suraz India Trust, guilty of contempt of court. Proceedings were initiated against Dahiya after he failed to deposit the penalty of ₹25 lakh imposed on him in May 2017 for filing about a dozen frivolous petitions, and writing letters and filing leadings levelling accusations against the sitting and retired judges of the court. Dahiya even wrote to the President seeking sanction to prosecute the judges.The court gave Dahiya several opportunities to deposit the fine and tender an unconditional apology, but he didn’t budge.Holding his conduct to be contemptuous, the bench said: “There is no absolute licence, when appearing in person, to indulge in making aspersions as a tendency to scandalise the court in relation to judicial matters. Motivated and calculated attempts to bring down the image of the judiciary in the estimation of the public and impair the administration of justice must bester themselves to uphold their dignity and the majesty of law.”It emphasised that the rationale behind the contempt jurisdiction is to maintain the dignity of the institution of judicial forums.“It is not a vindictive exercise nor are inappropriate statements by themselves capable of lowering the dignity of a judge. These are often ignored but where despite all latitude a perennial litigant seeks to justify his existence by throwing mud at all and sundry, the court has to step in,” said the court.Commenting on Dahiya’s demenaour, the bench said his attempt is to have his way or he will throw mud at all and sundry so that judges may finally back off to ward off more mud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-law-can-take-away-court-s-power-to-punish-for-contempt-supreme-court-101632942747473.html
30-09-2021||India||Captain Amarinder Singh meets Amit Shah, says discussed farmers’ stir||Former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh called on Union home minister Amit Shah at his residence in Delhi on Wednesday, stoking speculation that the 79-year-old could be joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or seeking its support ahead of next year’s assembly polls in the state.The two met for a little less than an hour but BJP functionaries remained tight-lipped about the meeting even as the Congress condemned the event.Singh tweeted that the meeting discussed the ongoing farmers’ stir against three central laws.“Met Union home minister Amit Shah ji in Delhi. Discussed the prolonged farmers agitation against farm laws & urged him to resolve the crisis urgently with repeal of the laws & guarantee MSP, besides supporting Punjab in crop diversification. #NoFarmersNoFood.”The meeting came a day after the former chief minister’s aides had denied reports about the meeting and said Singh was in Delhi on a personal visit and to vacate Kapurthala House for the new chief minister.On Tuesday, Singh’s rival Navjot Singh Sidhu dramatically resigned as the Congress state unit chief, plunging the party into a crisis months before state elections.Singh stepped down as CM last week after a months-long tussle with Sidhu for control of the party.He later blamed the party’s central leadership for “humiliating” him.A BJP functionary said that a section of the party was keen on the former CM joining the party fold.“As a Jat Sikh face, a long-standing CM, they feel he has clout with the electorate and can be useful in helping work out a truce between the government and the farmers who are unrelenting from their position of seeking a role back of the farm laws,” added the functionary, requesting anonymity.On whether a role was envisaged for the former CM to negotiate with farmers on behalf of the government, the functionary said, “Nothing has been finalised.”However, other leaders who spoke to HT on condition of anonymity said the “age factor” of the 79-year-old leader will be a key consideration.After the meeting, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged that Amit Shah’s residence had become the centre of anti-Dalit politics, referring to the recent appointment of Punjab’s first Dalit chief minister, Charanjit Singh Channi.In a series of tweets in Hindi, he said, “The arrogance of the those sitting in power has been hurt. Because if a Dalit is made the chief minister, then they ask who is making the decisions in the Congress... The centre of anti-Dalit politics is nowhere else but Amit Shah’s residence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/capt-amarinder-meets-amit-shah-says-discussed-farmers-stir-101632942388942.html
30-09-2021||India||Constitutional court can quash criminal proceedings even in non-compoundable offences: Supreme Court||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that a constitutional court has the power to quash criminal proceedings after parties arrive at a compromise even in cases that cannot be settled ordinarily under the law. A bench, headed by chief justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, underscored the power of the Supreme Court under Article 142 (authority to issue orders to do complete justice) and the power of a high court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) (inherent powers of a high court to pass orders to secure the ends of justice). The bench, which also included Justice Surya Kant, held that the power of the constitutional courts in quashing criminal cases cannot be constricted by Section 320 of the CrPC that defines which offences can be settled through compromise and which cannot. Section 320 CrPC enlists less serious offences such as simple assault, theft, trespass, mischief, cheating and defamation that can be compounded (settled) after the complainant enters into a compromise with the accused, to the satisfaction of the court. The top court’s judgment on Wednesday clarifies that the power of the Supreme Court or a high court cannot be limited to the offences enumerated under Section 320 CrPC and that the constitutional courts, owing to their “extraordinary power”, can drop charges even in non-compoundable offences to secure complete justice. “In doing so, due regard must be given to the overarching objective of sentencing in the criminal justice system, which is grounded on the sub­lime philosophy of maintenance of peace of the collective and that the rationale of placing an individual behind bars is aimed at his reformation,” the bench held as it laid down the common legal propositions in two separate criminal cases. The court added that criminal proceedings involving non-heinous offences or where the offences are predominantly private in nature can be annulled irrespective of the fact that trial has already been concluded or appeal stands dismissed against conviction. “Handing out punishment is not the sole form of delivering justice. Societal method of applying laws evenly is always subject to lawful exceptions,” the bench noted, striking a word of caution that whenever a compromise is arrived at after conviction of an accused, courts remain circumspect and should take into account conduct of the accused, before and after the incident. The judgment, authored by justice Kant on behalf of the bench, also said that such powers of wide amplitude ought to be exercised carefully also bearing in mind nature and effect of the offence on the society; seriousness of the injury; voluntary nature of compromise between the accused and the victim and such other relevant considerations. At the same time, the court added, it would send a wrong signal to the society if courts quash cases involving grave offences of moral turpitude; or that may have a harmful effect on the social and moral fabric of the society; or those concerning public policy. In light of the ruling, the court set aside conviction of accused in both the criminal cases before it and dropped charges like grievous hurt and attempted murder after taking note of the compromise between the accused and the complainants. It noted that the accused and the complainants in the two cases are residents of the same village or work in close vicinity, and hence, the quashing of criminal proceedings will only advance peace, harmony and fellowship. Further, it noted that offences involved in the appeals can be categorised as purely personal or having overtones of criminal proceedings of private nature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/constitutional-court-can-quash-criminal-proceedings-even-in-non-compoundable-offences-supreme-court-101632942144437.html

A lot of thought at the moment is on how to introduce it (the Zydus vaccine) in the system,” said a senior government official who asked not to be named.ZyCoV-D, the Zydus vaccine, is likely to be introduced as part of the vaccine programme soon, although an announcement on vaccinating children is awaited. Till Wednesday night, India has vaccinated 236 million people fully, with another 409 million receiving one dose of the vaccine. With 68.7% of the eligible population having received at least one dose, it is likely the demand for first doses will start tapering off. In many western countries, the ceiling is around 80% of the eligible population.“However, whenever it happens that the booster dose is recommended by experts of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation and National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NTAGI/NEGVAC), there is a possibility that it will happen in a phased manner... and those at high risk will be put on the priority list,” the official added.A Covid-19 booster shot is an additional dose of vaccine given so that the protection provided by the original dosage does not fade. The US has approved a booster dose for health workers and others at high risk. Booster shots are controversial because of vaccine inequity — people in many parts of Africa are yet to receive even one dose of the vaccine — and because there’s no clear evidence in their favour.“It does seem too soon to be giving booster shots. We have data from other countries that have different vaccines and infection rates,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of country’s top vaccinologist from Christian Medical College, Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-of-adults-a-priority-covid-booster-dose-talks-on-officials-101632941725385.html

Now, on the basis of a complaint by the deceased’s family, we have filed a case against six policemen.”Thirty-six-year-old Manish Gupta, a resident of Kanpur, on Monday died under mysterious circumstances during a police raid at a city hotel where he was staying with two friends from Gurugram.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said “a jungle rule” was prevailing in the state. “The state of jungle law is such under this government that police are soft on criminals and behave barbarously with common people,” Priyanka tweeted.Meanwhile, family members in Kanpur have refused to hold any cremation till the accused were arrested.

30-09-2021||India||SC frowns at Raj court order that barred cops from arresting during Covid wave||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday faulted the Rajasthan high court’s single judge’s order in May this year that directed the police not to arrest persons charged with offences punishable with less than three years imprisonment, ruling that such directions amounted to “putting fetters on the investigating agency” and faced the risk of violating constitutional rights of citizens.The top court had earlier on May 25 stayed the controversial order by a single bench of the high court. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court went on to decide the question of whether the high court was right in passing such an order. It did not set aside the high court order but made it clear where it stood.Interestingly, the Rajasthan high court had approached the top court challenging the order passed by the single judge bench of justice Pankaj Bhandari on May 17. The high court even challenged the March 31, 2020 order by the same judge, in which, he directed the high court registry not to list bails, appeals, applications for suspension of sentence in appeals and revisions in the category of “extreme urgent matters”.Dealing with the two appeals, a bench of justices L Nageswar Rao and Aniruddha Bose said, “The directions of the high court cannot be sustained as it amounts to putting fetters on the powers of investigating agency” and this has the potential of “violating constitutional rights of individuals”.In the May 17 order, justice Pankaj Bhandari directed the Rajasthan Director General of Police (DGP) to issue instructions to all officers not to make arrests for offences punishable up to three years. The judge was of the view that its order was in the larger public interest as the police were already involved in enforcing strict lockdown across the state.The order also directed the high court registry not to list anticipatory bail applications where maximum punishment was up to three years and the offence could be tried by First Class Magistrate. This part of the order was made operational till the reopening of the high court after summer vacation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-frowns-at-raj-court-order-that-barred-cops-from-arresting-during-covid-wave-101632941663289.html

The minister said after the death of the boy a team from the National Institute of Virology (NIV) had taken samples of many species of bats from the area and the samples indicated the presence of antibodies against the virus in two varieties. She said the latest results have given credence to the theory that bats are the main carriers of the Nipah virus. The health department was on high alert after the third outbreak of Nipah, the first being in 2018 in Kozhikode and the second in Ernakulam in 2019. It cordoned off the entire area and samples were collected from all houses. Around 800 samples were checked in two days and all turned positive. Like earlier outbreaks, it was localised and contained effectively. “The NIV has conveyed to us about the presence of IgG antibody in some. We are expecting more results in the coming days,” the minister said. She said different studies conducted by NIV, the Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases will continue. She said though the 21-day incubation period was over the department will observe a double incubation period of 42 days to declare the area Nipah free. After the death of the boy, his parents said he had eaten rambutan fruit before taking ill and authorities have asked people not to eat fruits picked from the ground. But samples of half-eaten fruits did not show any signs of contamination during initial tests. Later authorities warned people not to disturb bat habitat in panic. Reeling under the high number of Covid-19 cases, the state contributed more than 60 per cent of the country’s total cases for about four months. Amid Covid-19, the Nipah outbreak had really jolted the state. Experts said the strict protocol in place due to Covid-19, like masking, physical distancing and no overcrowding, helped the state to blunt the impact of the zoonotic disease. Kozhikode reported the Nipah infection for the second time in three years-- in 2018 it claimed 17 lives in the district. Two persons also survived the infection. And in 2019 a youth tested positive for the zoonotic disease in Ernakulam but he was also nursed back to life after long hospitalization. After the first outbreak in 2018, many promises like setting up of a high-end animal testing lab, virology institute, a scientific study on bats (chiropterology) and a treatment protocol for separate zoonotic diseases were made. Experts say most of these remained only promises. “Since zoonotic diseases recur frequently in the state it needed an integrated approach and team of experts from all fields to study it,” said Dr N M Arun, an internal medicine expert. Experts like him want a proactive strategy to face the increasing threat of recurring zoonotic diseases and not wait for the outbreak to act. The state needs to strengthen its surveillance system backed by enough scientific studies, they say. It is a fact that zoonotic diseases have recurred at regular intervals in the state in the last three years. Many cases of Kyasnur forest disease (monkey fever), avian influenza, swine flu and anthrax were reported. Thousands of ducks were culled in Alappuzha two years ago to check the spread of avian influenza. “We need a permanent mechanism for early detection of such diseases and early warning to the people. More research is also needed in the area,” said Dr Prejit Nambiar, a teacher at the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, who specialises in zoonosis and food safety. He said a close interaction is necessary between medical experts, veterinary professionals, environmental scientists and wildlife professionals to tackle zoonotic diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antibodies-against-nipah-found-in-bat-samples-from-north-kerala-says-veena-george-101632940706445.html
30-09-2021||India||Initial proof a must for probe against public servants: Govt||Over three years after Section 17A was inserted to the Prevention of Corruption Act through a legislative amendment, making it mandatory for agencies to seek prior permission before initiating corruption probes against public servants, the Centre has come up with a new standard operating procedure (SOP) on how the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and state anti-corruption bodies should handle such investigations.The SOP, sent to the agency and states on September 3, says that anti-graft probe officers must first verify whether a prima facie (at first sight) offence is made out against a public servant and only then make a request for a formal probe – a condition that some former and serving CBI officers suggested was prohibitive.To be sure, verifying a prima facie offence is a prerequisite where the alleged offence is related to any recommendation or decision by a public servant in discharge of their official functions or duties; and not when the person is caught red-handed accepting a bribe.According to the new SOP, which was reviewed by HT, when police officers receive information against a public servant alleging offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, they must verify whether it “prima facie reveals actual commission of an offence under the Act”. It also specifies which rank of officers are authorised to seek prior approval for a probe. For example, when public servants in question are ministers, chief ministers, members of Parliament, judges of the Supreme Court and high courts, chairpersons of public sector units (PSUs), and public sector banks (PSBs), only an officer of the rank of Director General of Police (DGP) or equivalent (director in the case of CBI), can seek the approval.Section 17A was brought in by the government through an amendment in July 2018 to bring additional layer of due diligence after several bureaucrats complained that they were not able to take bona fide decisions due to the fear of probe agencies. It makes it mandatory for a police officer to seek previous approval for conducting any “enquiry” or “inquiry” or “investigation” into any corruption-related offence.The SOP now further explains what needs to be done before such any prosecution permission is sought. The SOP provide the stage-wise processing of information by a police officer, laying down of single-window procedure to specify receipt of the proposal and check-list for submitting proposals under the section.The police or CBI officer dealing with a complaint/information against a public servant will have to provide the name, current place of posting and rank of the public servant, specific act(s) of commission or omission attributable to him/her, specific recommendation(s) or decision taken by him/her which needs to be probed and deriving of an undue advantage for self or any other person to fulfil the ingredients of offences.The SOP adds that “deriving of an undue advantage by the public servant for self or for others is a key ingredient for establishing an offence against him and in absence of fulfilment of this condition any act of omission or commission amounts to an administrative misdemeanour only”.When contacted, some CBI officers said on condition of anonymity that the SOP was an unrealistic layer to already stringent procedures. “The problem is, how can we establish prima facie crime in advance? It can only be done once the investigation begins,” said a senior CBI officer.A second officer said: “CBI has already been handicapped as it has to approach the administrative authorities/ministries twice – first while seeking a probe and then at the time of mandatory prior sanction to file a charge sheet (under section 197 of Criminal Procedure Code). Section 17A has also taken away the surprise element and caused delays in anti-corruption probes with ministries/departments approached for every enquiry or investigation.”The agency has pointed out some of these concerns to the government in the last three years, said a senior IPS officer in CBI.Some officers, however, said that since Section 17A is new, it will evolve in time through judgments by the Supreme Court and the high courts.“A law is always subject to various interpretations and that’s what seems to have happened here as well. Somebody in Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), while issuing this SOP, has interpreted section 17A his/her way. While one might see it as the right approach to a probe against a public servant, another might see as a hindrance. It will be seen in next few months how the SOP will actually affect work,” said a third officer.The department of personnel and training did not respond to HT’s queries seeking comments.Former CBI joint director NS Wasan said there the clarity in how to proceed on such cases was required. “The law itself says that the probe cannot be conducted without prior approval in the alleged offence. A lot of cases in the past have been registered without any commission of crime, causing embarrassment for CBI so having clear guidelines will streamline the process,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/initial-proof-a-must-for-probe-against-public-servants-govt-101632940703816.html

It will provide one cooked nutritional meal to students.“We are committed to doing everything possible to fight the menace of malnutrition. Today’s Cabinet decision on PM-POSHAN is a crucial one, benefitting the youth of India,” the Prime Minister said in a tweet.About 118 million students enrolled in classes 1-8 across 1.1 million schools will benefit under the scheme, the government said.In addition, around 2.4 million students in pre-primary sections or Balvatikas – started in several government schools last year with an aim to include children younger than six years in formal education – will also be covered under the scheme.While announcing the development, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said: “To improve nutritional status, encourage education and learning, increase enrolments in schools and promote overall growth of children, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the PM-POshan SHAkti Nirman scheme for the next five years with a collective outlay of ₹1,30,794 crore.”

All the stakeholders were called upon to work in a coordinated manner towards ensuring adequate preparedness for tackling any future challenges,” Baijal, who chaired the meeting, said in a tweet.He did not mention a month, but a person who attended the meeting said the decision was likely to be taken after Diwali. While Dussehra will be celebrated on October 15, Diwali is on November 4, and Chhat Puja on November 10.“After detailed discussion with experts, the need to strictly follow and enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB) was emphasised upon especially in wake of the upcoming festive season to prevent any resurgence of infection. It was suggested that community engagement and support to this effect should be ensured by way of an integrated campaign particularly in the vernacular languages,” the Lieutenant Governor added.Baijal is the chairperson of DDMA, and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is its vice chairperson. Wednesday’s meeting was attended by Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, revenue minister Kailash Gahlot, chief secretary Vijay Dev, and a group of experts that included Dr VK Paul of the NITI Aayog, Dr Balram Bhargava of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Dr Randeep Guleria of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), and Dr SK Singh of National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).Schools in Delhi were shut last March when Covid-19 cases first started rising in the country. Classes resumed for a brief period in January and February this year, but were suspended in April as a brutal second wave (fourth for Capital) of Covid-19 stretched the health care infrastructure to its limits.Since July, the number of new cases in the Capital has remained consistently below 100. The test positivity rate hovers between 0.04-0.07% on most days, and much of the city has opened. At least 11 states have opened, or announced they will soon, in-person classes for students of all grades.At present, India’s vaccination drive only covers adults, with just one vaccine – Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D -- getting an approval for administration in children above 12 years of age. Once the vaccination drive opens for children, likely in October, those with comorbidities will be given priority, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) said last month.DDMA also decided to allow gatherings, including Ramleela celebrations, during the upcoming festival season with strict compliance to Covid-19 norms, a person aware of the matter said. The Delhi Police and district authorities will ensure proper seating arrangement at events by adhering to social distancing norms, separate entry and exit points at venues and no overcrowding at gatherings.Several schools say they have been receiving queries from parents on the reopening of junior classes as the closure of schools due to the pandemic led to learning and emotional deficits.The National Progressive Schools Conference, which comprises top schools in Delhi, said it was preparing to resume in-person learning for classes 6 to 8. “We will implement the same blended learning model for these classes and students will not be called to the school on all days. Learning will continue with a combination of online and in-person classes. Schools can start with classes 6 to 8 first and then call the junior students based on the prevailing Covid-19 situation…,” Malini Narayanan, the chairperson of the group, said.“We understand that the possible spread of Covid-19 during the festive season is a genuine concern, but the decision should be reconsidered after Dussehra. It is time when we all stakeholders need to realise academic gaps and take proactive decisions accordingly,” Bharat Arora, general secretary of Action Committee for Unaided Private Schools, a group of over 450 private schools in the city, said.Old Delhi resident Nazia Habib, whose children study in Class 7 and the kindergarten, said: “Since tuitions have begun, students have been able to catch up a little on studies even with online learning. But the Covid-19 fear is still there. Every day, we read reports from across the world of reinfection. Most parents I know would not be keen on sending their children to school without vaccination.”Class 7 student Rishima Dube, 12, a resident of Ayurvigyan Nagar, said she looked forward to attending in-person classes if Covid-19 cases reduced by November.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said: “The government should focus on vaccinating all teaching and non-teaching staff and start schools at the earliest. Cities and states across the world are doing that now. Schools are necessary for the well-being of children. As far as festivals are concerned, people should not let their guard down just because it is allowed. They should wear masks and avoid crowded places. The viral disease is still spreading in several states. Governments and people should not take risk.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schools-may-reopen-for-classes-6-8-after-festivals-101632940462521.html

A snubbed former chief minister meeting a top political rival. And, senior leaders publicly voicing differences with the leadership, prompting protests by others in the same party.The Congress’s troubles in Punjab spilled over to Delhi on Wednesday as former chief minister Amarinder Singh met Union home minister Amit Shah and leaders upped their pitch for organisational changes, a day after state unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu’s abrupt resignation plunged the party into crisis.Singh, who had denied talk of him visiting Shah a day ago, drove to the home minister’s residence around 6pm for a meeting that lasted less than an hour.
30-09-2021||India||HC verdict on ‘skin-to-skin contact’ lacked sensitivity, AG tells Supreme Court||A controversial verdict by the Bombay high court that required skin-to-skin contact between an accused and a child to establish sexual assault under the Pocso Act showed lack of sensitivity to the fact that children are the most vulnerable to sexual crimes because they are unable to defend themselves, attorney general (AG) KK Venugopal told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.Venugopal, while making submissions on his petition challenging the January 19 Bombay high court decision, said: “The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012 is a special law to protect children against sexual offences as they are more vulnerable. The judge lacked the sensitivity to appreciate that Pocso Act is meant to prevent sexual offences against children who are unable to defend themselves.”Stating that the judgment under challenge created an extraordinary situation leading to a wrong precedent, the top law officer said: “The judge has misinterpreted Section 7 of Pocso (dealing with sexual assault) by implying skin-to-skin contact as an essential ingredient to make out an offence. It will have a devastating effect on pending cases before subordinate courts.” Section 7 defines as sexual assault any physical contact “with sexual intent” on the “vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child” or making the child touch these body parts “without penetration”. The offence carries a minimum punishment of three years extending up to five years.The high court had acquitted a man for groping a 12-year-old through while she was clothed, ruling that he be let off under the stringent Pocso Act because there was no “skin-to-skin” contact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-verdict-on-skin-to-skin-contact-lacked-sensitivity-ag-tells-supreme-court-101632940343191.html
30-09-2021||India||Supreme Court to review Centre’s plea on use of green firecrackers this Diwali||The Supreme Court will on October 6 go into an affidavit filed by the environment ministry last October on the use of so-called green and improved fireworks -- hearing a case that could well decide whether this Diwali will see fireworks.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati, representing the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) informed the court that a lot of research and development has gone into this field following the court’s October 2018 judgment. She urged the court to consider the various proposals and formulations on green/improved crackers that the ministry has come up with in its affidavit filed before the court in October 2020.The court’s October 23, 2018 judgment banned the sale and production of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR and regulated the use of firecrackers across the country. Barium-based firecrackers were specifically banned.The bench questioned the anxiety of the ministry in this matter. “We fail to understand the anxiety of the MoEFCC when the (fireworks) manufacturers and TANFAMA are already before us.”TANFAMA is an association representing 180 fireworks manufacturers, represented under the common banner Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturers Association. Tamil Nadu is the hub of the fireworks trade in India.Senior advocate ANS Nadkarni, appearing for TANFAMA, said that the Centre is not being anxious but responding compliance of October 2018 order.The court told ASG Bhati, “We directed you to come up with green crackers. Even if we permit its use, we are certain that the crackers sold under the name will contain barium. You do not understand the problem. Only those persons will understand who suffer from asthma, respiratory problems and ... children.” Bhati replied, “The Centre is not being anxious. If the court wants a total ban on firecrackers, we do not want to join issues on that.” The bench said: “We are not sitting with a closed mind. If a via media can be found, we also want to see celebrations. We want to take a balanced view.”It agreed to go into all those aspects raised by Centre.On Wednesday, the court put six leading firecracker manufacturers in the country on notice for brazenly manufacturing and selling firecrackers containing barium and barium salts, expressly banned by the top court in October 2018. The ban of barium salts was proposed by the government because, on ignition, these release poisonous gas leading to respiratory problems.The violations by manufacturers were highlighted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in a report submitted in a sealed cover to the court in April this year.“The report by CBI is very serious in nature. Considering the report of CBI pursuant to our order, prima facie it appears that they (manufacturers) have violated this court’s earlier orders on use of barium or barium salts as well as our orders with regard to labelling of firecrackers,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-review-centre-s-plea-on-use-of-green-firecrackers-this-diwali-101632939744729.html
30-09-2021||India||59 of 121 rainy days saw deficit, September wettest month: Data||According to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) gridded rainfall dataset, India received 870 mm of rainfall up to 8:30 am on September 29 in this year’s June-September monsoon season. This is about 2.32% more than the average of 850.2 mm rainfall for this interval in the 1961-2010 period, which is called the Long Period Average (LPA). These figures differ slightly from those published in IMD’s bulletin because the gridded dataset is based on interpolation of rainfall from multiple stations that have operated consistently over the years while IMD’s bulletin also takes into account newer stations. However, the broad trends do not differ much.According to the gridded dataset, the cumulative figures hide the intermittent dry and wet spells seen this monsoon season. Fifty nine of 121 days of monsoon so far have seen a deficit compared to the LPA and 62 a surplus. There have also been more extreme intensity rainfall events than usual this year, to the extent that this monsoon season has seen the 30th highest extreme rainfall since 1901.
30-09-2021||India||‘Normal’ monsoon officially ends today with rains at 99% of LPA||The monsoon season will officially come to an end on September 30, even as widespread and heavy rain continue over different parts of the country. In aggregate, it has been a good year, with monsoon rain amounting to 99% of the long period average (LPA) as on Wednesday (with a day to go), making it a “normal” monsoon year, according to India Meteorological Department.Rainfall between 94% to 106% of LPA is considered normal by IMD. The LPA is considered for the period of 1961 to 2010 and is 88 cm. But it has not been a normal monsoon in terms of the pattern and distribution of rainfall. The most active monsoon month this year, in terms of rainfall, was September -- a month when the monsoon usually starts withdrawing. The numbers speak for themselves: there was 9.6% excess rain in June; 6.8% deficiency in July; 24% deficiency in August; and 31.7% excess rain in September.The monsoon usually starts its withdrawal from northwest India on September 17. This year, several parts of the country are recording intense rain spells even towards the end of the month due to formations of cyclonic circulations, a deep depression and cyclones.The first deep depression of the season was formed on September 13. Another depression formed over east-central Bay of Bengal on September 25 which later intensified into Cyclone Gulab and crossed the north Andhra Pradesh - south Odisha coasts on Sunday evening. A remnant of Gulab is likely to reach the Arabian Sea on Thursday and further intensify into cyclone Shaheen by Friday, according to IMD’s forecast.No depressions were formed between June and August, a period that usually sees five to six; the depressions bring extensive rainfall to central and west India.As on Wednesday, there was a 1% deficiency in monsoon rain since June 1 with 11% excess over South Peninsula; 3% excess over central India; 4% deficiency over northwest India; and 12% deficiency over east and northeast India. There was an 8% deficiency at the end of August which was recovered almost entirely in September.The reason for rainy September was active weather conditions in the West Pacific and a favourable Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), supporting convective activity and cloud formation over the Bay of Bengal. MJO is an eastward moving disturbance of clouds, rainfall, winds, and pressure that traverses the planet in the tropics and returns to its initial starting point in 30 to 60 days, on average, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.“The West Pacific was very active and remnants from there were moving towards Bay of Bengal leading to formation of depressions, a number of cyclonic circulations and one cyclone, Gulab which brought widespread and heavy rain to east, central and west India. A trough was also passing from Bay of Bengal to the Pacific where cyclonic circulations and tropical storms are forming one after the other which has started disintegrating now. MJO will also move into an unfavourable location leading to gradual reduction in convective activity,” explained Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD. But intense spells of rain will likely to continue over India’s west and east coast for another two, three days.IMD’s extended range forecast shows reduction of rainfall activity from October 7. The monsoon is likely to begin its withdrawal from October 2-3, said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet Weather.DS Pai, scientist and head of climate research and services at IMD Pune said that though the monsoon hasn’t withdrawn, the rain recorded after September 30 will be counted as part of the post-monsoon season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-ends-with-normal-rain-at-99-of-lpa-101632938968659.html
30-09-2021||India||Rising fuel prices and the prospects of economic recovery||India is a week away from the effective start of its festive season, which will likely see a much-needed consumer spending boom. But the country’s economy faces a serious threat -- inflation, especially via the fuel route. A rising trend in international crude prices is only one part of the fuel inflation story as taxes are a big reason behind the current levels of fuel prices. While the situation is already very difficult, any further increase in international crude prices will only make it more precarious. Here are five charts which explain this.Petrol-diesel prices are disproportionately high compared to crude pricesWhile Brent crude prices reached the $80 per barrel after three years, they have been higher in the past. But petrol-diesel prices were not as high back then. For example, Brent crude price was above $100 between February 2011 and September 2014. But petrol-diesel prices were significantly lower than what they are today. The reason why prices are higher at the moment is the increase in tax component of fuel prices after the Covid-19 pandemic. A comparison of price build-up of petrol-diesel brings this out clearly. The tax component of fuel prices was ₹37.83 and ₹28.06 per litre on 14 March 2020, before the Covid-19 pandemic hit. This is now ₹56.26 and ₹44.77 for petrol and diesel.This has led to a sharp rise in fuel inflation and inflation expectationsThe fuel component of both retail and wholesale inflation has been rising rapidly in the past few months. A rise in fuel prices also feeds into the prices of other commodities via a cascading effect. Businesses that are unable to pass on these costs will have to take a hit to their profits. Smaller businesses are more vulnerable to this pressure than larger ones, as was pointed out a research note dated August 2, by Pranjul Bhandari from HSBC Securities. This means a squeeze on their earnings.The bulk of the tax component of petrol-diesel prices is on account of Union government taxes. The Union government has maintained that it does not plan to bring down taxes on petrol-diesel immediately. This has fed into expectations that prices may not come down anytime soon.This, when read with the fact that retail inflation has stayed closer to RBI’s upper tolerance limit of 6% since June (although it hit a three-month low of 5.3% in August), and inflation expectations of households have been rising consistently in RBI’s latest survey (July 2021), underlines the threat of hardening inflation expectations feeding into an already volatile inflation scenario.Oil is not the only imminent inflation threat on the horizonCrude oil is not the only tailwind to inflation in the world at the moment. “Consumers are most likely to feel the pinch in the supermarket, where inclement weather in one of the biggest crop growers (Brazil) is also contributing to higher prices”, a September 29 Bloomberg column by Mark Gilbert said. “Annual inflation is running at 5.3% in the US and 3.2% in the UK . and is forecast to have reached 3.3% in the euro zone. In all three regions, prices are rising at a pace way faster than the 2% central banks are supposed to target”, he added. Bloomberg’s News Trends function, which can tally the occurrence of keywords from more than 1,500 sources, shows monthly usage of the term Stagflation (low growth high inflation) is at a record high, Gilbert said in the column.And commodity prices are surging.The Bloomberg Commodity Index, which tracks prices of energy, grains, industrial metals, precious metals, livestock and sugar, coffee and cotton, crossed 100 on September 27 for the first time since March 2015.The problem for India this time is that while global inflation is arising from high demand in advanced economies, high inflation will generate headwinds for demand and future growth in countries such as India.Festive demand could sidetrack policy focus from the problem at handThanks to its entrenched inequalities, the Indian economy is facing two kinds of inflationary problems at the moment. There is a small section of the economy (still large in absolute numbers) which is seeing the same supply crisis present in the advanced countries for commodities such as cars, high-end electronic gadgets etc. due to factors such as microchip shortages. With demand booming during the festive season, the supply crunch is likely to give the impression that the inflation problem is transient. The situation is likely to be very different for the non-rich, whose incomes and purchasing power has perhaps still not recovered from the pandemic’s shock. Indicators such as the RBI’s Consumer Confidence Survey capture this grim reality. If inflation does not come down, inflation expectations of this group will harden at higher levels.If economic policy makers are swayed by the economic story of the top 10% in the country, and ignore the economic reality of the majority, the situation might be even more dire by the time it is acknowledged. While the larger project of boosting poor people’s incomes will take a concerted policy effort, putting an end to the negative fiscal stimulus via high levels of taxes on petrol and diesel can be the first concrete step in this direction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rising-fuel-prices-and-the-prospects-of-economic-recovery-101632934041876.html
30-09-2021||India||‘RSS-linked outfits not against MNCs’: Swadeshi Jagran Manch||Weeks after it targeted Infosys for helping “naxalites, leftists and tuke-tukde gang”, Panchajanya, a magazine influenced by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), in its latest edition described Amazon as “East India Company 2.0”. Ashwani Mahajan, national co-convener of Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), an offshoot of RSS that seeks indigenuous production, says in an interview to HT that the right wing organisation is not against multinational companies, but there are several concerns over its operations in the country. Edited excerpts:There seems to be a trend of RSS-affiliated outfits targeting multinational companies...It is a misconception that we are against multinational companies or India’s wealth creators. All we want is that they operate within the ambit of the law. Criticising any company that has circumvented the laws is not a witch-hunt or targeting. We have had discussions with Amazon as well. They are welcome to do business in India but they have to do so within the ambit of the law.What are your concerns on how Amazon functions?They have to behave like a platform, and they cannot give discounts… also, they do not have the right to keep inventory. The process of deep discounts which Amazon has been giving needs to end because eventually, by giving heavy discounts, they are eating into the market of small traders and what are essentially mom-and-pop stores.SJM has raised concerns over the e-commerce policy on multiple occasions. What do you expect from the government?The government came out with e-commerce rules for consumer protection. We told the government there is no substitute for a comprehensive and all-encompassing e-commerce policy that not only caters to consumers but also small-time workers, vendors and service providers.You have also raised concerns over flipping of some Indian start-ups and called it a potential security threat...Some of our start-ups are no longer Indian as they have flipped away. This flipping can have implications on the national economic interests. It leads to immense economic and national loss as an Indian company becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of a foreign corporation despite a 90% plus value creation from India, resulting in loss of all future tax on capital gains, public listing and operational profits, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-are-not-against-india-s-wealth-creators-or-mncs-ashwani-mahajan-101632901460074.html
30-09-2021||India||‘Alternative Nobel’ for Indian organisation||Delhi-based environmental organisation Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment (LIFE) has received the 2021 Right Livelihood Award for its “grassroots approach of empowering vulnerable communities to protect their livelihoods and claim their right to a clean environment.” The award is known as Sweden’s alternative Nobel Prize.Other awardees include Cameroonian women rights activist Marthe Wandou, Russian environmental activist Vladimir Slivyak, and Canadian Indigenous rights defender Freda Huson.The Right Livelihood Award honours and supports people solving global problems. It comes with a cash prize of 1 million Swedish crowns ($115,000) and long-term support to highlight and expand Laureates’ work.The jury of Stockholm-based Right Livelihood, which chose the awardees, said LIFE was receiving the Award “for innovative legal work empowering communities to protect their resources in the pursuit of environmental democracy in India.”In a statement on Wednesday, Right Livelihood said despite a robust environmental protection law framework, access to justice for those intending to protect India’s remaining forests and biodiversity is often limited. “To fill this gap, LIFE was founded by lawyers Ritwick Dutta and Rahul Choudhary in 2005. Since then, LIFE has fought against some of India’s most significant environmental threats, including helping local communities stop the construction of a large-scale bauxite mine in the eastern state of Odisha and halt a hydro-power project in the state of Arunachal Pradesh.”Dutta said they are thrilled to receive the Award. “This is our first international prize, and it means a lot to us and to all the local groups across India that we are supporting. The award will help us increase the impact of our work, empowering more people to protect nature and livelihoods.”He added their aim now is to ensure that decisions concerning the environment take into account the impact of the climate crisis. “Despite clear evidence that India’s ecosystem is undergoing rapid changes due to changing climate, we are yet to take any concrete action to deal with the same. Climate change does not figure anywhere in the environmental decision-making process.”Ole von Uexkull, the executive director of Right Livelihood who established the award, said LIFE’s lawyers have fought both governmental and corporate interests that threaten peoples’ survival and rights. “They empower citizens’ groups to claim their right to a clean environment, on which their livelihoods depend.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-environmental-law-org-wins-right-livelihood-award-101632899120394.html
30-09-2021||Today's||The Congress leadership made a mistake with Sidhu. The party is paying the price||It looked a perfect match in the lead-up to the 2017 assembly elections — the well-regarded Captain Amarinder Singh as the chief ministerial face, the much-liked Navjot Sidhu as his successor under training. But the partnership didn’t reach fruition, the understudy bunking the mentor’s tutorials midway through graduation. Rather than getting himself groomed, Sidhu chose to be a dropout. Having quit as a minister in 2019, he remained an outlier till the curtains were drawn on the Captain’s rule.Arguably, Singh’s fall was on Sidhu’s call.Why then the continuing resort to the politics of resignation, of coercion and arm-twisting? The answer lies perhaps in the cricketer-turned-politico’s variously dissected persona — insubordinate, obstinate and high strung to the extent of being disruptive. Given to marching to his own drumbeat, he is unwilling or is unable to stay in single file behind another person, be it Singh or his successor as chief minister (CM), Charanjit Singh Channi.The hangover of his brush with the entertainment industry is manifest in the way Sidhu walks or talks. No surprise that he went for a theatrical abdication of responsibility rather than being the Congress’s sheet-anchor as its freshly-minted state president. His treatment of Channi over eminently resolvable differences was an encore of his many confrontations with the ousted CM, who is now flirting with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Singh has since clarified that while he will leave the Congress, he won’t join the BJP. Desperate to be the Congress’s “high command” in Punjab, Sidhu ironically has brought upon himself the fate the Captain willed for him. He has irretrievably hurt his image and that of the party by failing to appreciate that the incumbent CM, unlike his predecessor who was rendered vulnerable by age and anti-incumbency, is the toast of the country as Punjab’s first Scheduled Caste leader to hold the post.Temperamentally understated, Channi has a way with people. In venturing to make an example of him, Sidhu cut his nose to spite his face. The altruistic, puritanical veneer he sports barely hides his vaulting ambition. This is despite the fact that he has raised certain legitimate issues, especially on bureaucratic appointments. Sidhu claims these can undercut the Congress’s 2017 promise to bring to book the Akali Dal leadership in cases of sacrilege under the Parkash Singh Badal regime.On the face of it, these placements, as also the induction of a minister who had come clean in a judicial probe into graft, were negotiable behind closed doors. But Sidhu, the showman, chose rebellion over discussion, loath as he is to the prospects of Channi growing out his shadow.What should worry the habituated rebel in Sidhu is his growing alienation from even the members of the faction he led to fight Singh. Having first scuttled the prospects of Sukhjinder Randhawa becoming CM, he also has problems with him getting the home portfolio as deputy CM. His turf war in Amritsar with OP Soni, the other deputy CM, is too well known to be underscored. So flawed has been the central leadership’s search for the new Punjab CM that the party has more aspirants for the office today than it once had in Madhya Pradesh. Besides Sidhu, there is former state party chief Sunil Jakhar and Randhawa, who got the maximum votes in the legislature party meet.It will be a classic dog’s breakfast if the Congress fails to quickly put its house in order. The party’s only hope in the upcoming polls is the disrepair that afflicts its rivals. The Aam Aadmi Party is struggling for quality human resources; the Akali Dal stares at a crisis of credibility. As for the BJP, its base has shrunk in the face of the farmers’ agitation.The conundrum could worsen, however, if Singh can cut a substantial deal with the saffron party on the three farm laws. Short of that, he may be a mere mantlepiece in the close or distant proximity of the saffron party; a veritable Punjab edition of Karnataka’s SM Krishna who walked into the sunset on switching sides at a ripe old age. Be that as it may, the Sidhu pantomime in the Congress must stop. Or else its initiative of giving the state its first Dalit CM will come a cropper.vinodsharma@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-congress-leadership-made-a-mistake-with-sidhu-the-party-is-paying-the-price-101633017690716.html
30-09-2021||Today's||From 1984 to 2020, Delhi’s response||In February 2020, northeast Delhi saw the Capital’s deadliest riots in decades. The riots killed 53 and injured hundreds. In the aftermath, some residents erected barricades or gates outside their lanes. Others left their homes for relief camps in Delhi, or even returned to their ancestral villages across India.The following week, I was in west Delhi interviewing Sikhs who had survived the city’s last cataclysmic wave of communal violence in 1984. The survivors I interviewed also described a vast range of different strategies they had adopted to try and survive. Some hid in darkened flats for days, or cut their hair and beards. Some wielded kirpans to defend their lanes or colonies, while others left Delhi for good.During political violence around the world —including decades of communal riots in India— people respond to chaos and danger in many different ways. For everyone who participates in violence, there is someone who has barricaded themselves in a closet. For every family that seeks refuge in another neighbourhood or state, another family tries to adapt to the danger and stay put. In many instances, there are hardly any noticeable differences between the people who choose radically different strategies when they confront danger.Take an example from 1984: Two women in Southwest Delhi faced nearly identical mob violence on the same day, but responded in very different ways. One woman from Palam, saw her father taken from their home and set on fire (probably with phosphorous powder). Another woman, only 3km away in Sagarpur, witnessed a mob take her father, brother, husband, and son from their home and beat them to death. The woman from Palam immediately left and resettled in Punjab. The woman from Sagarpur remained — she continues to live in Delhi.How do we make sense of these choices? In my research, I study the experiences of Indian Sikhs who survived violence in Delhi in 1984 in order to understand their decisions. I draw lessons from their stories to understand the forces that shape people’s responses to violence across different religious groups, different types of violence, and different countries.Even people who are very similar to each other often perceive and interpret a violent situation in different ways. Different perceptions and interpretations, in turn, motivate people to respond differently to threats of violence. Two particular interpretations (or appraisals) are important for understanding people’s behaviour — a person’s appraisal of how much control they have over the outcome of violence, and their appraisal of how predictable the evolution of violent threats will be in the near future.People who assess control and predictability differently tend toward different behaviours to keep themselves safe. People who feel uncertain about the future and believe they have no agency to mitigate threats to their safety (no control) tend to flee from violence. People who feel that they have control, but aren’t confident in their ability to predict the future try to fight back against threats. People who feel the future is more predictable and understandable either try to minimise their exposure to threat by “hiding” or try to engage constructively with the sources of danger, depending on how in control they feel. These interpretations guided the choices of many survivors of the 1984 violence in Delhi. Across interviews with survivors in Delhi as well as many survivors who migrated to northern California, and across an archive of over 500 oral histories of the violence, I find that people’s assessments of control and predictability are strongly connected to the strategies they end up selecting.People facing violence use their assessments of control and predictability to help them make sense of chaos. But in the haze of conflict, not everyone makes sense of chaos in the same way. The women from Palam and Sagarpur, for example, saw their situations differently. The woman from Sagarpur believed she understood how the mobs worked. Before her father died, he described a theory of the violence — mobs were targeting those who were visibly Sikh (mostly men), and were especially brutal toward people who tried to fight back. This set of “rules” made the violence more predictable — though no less traumatic — for the woman from Sagarpur. Her perception of predictability led her to stay put in Delhi, where she still lives. The woman from Palam felt no such sense of predictability. Members of her family were basically tricked — her father was killed by people who had promised him safety. As soon as possible, the woman from Palam left the neighbourhood, and Delhi all together. Even these two similar-seeming women, facing nearly identical violence on the same day, interpreted their circumstances differently, and followed those interpretations to decide what they needed to do to survive.Riots in February 2020 never spilled across the Yamuna, but rumours and fear spread as far west as neighbourhoods such as Dwarka, Janakpuri, and Tilak Nagar. In interviews, people described the scenes of 1984 returning to their minds when they heard rumours that the 2020 riots were coming to west Delhi. Some prepared to correct the “mistakes” they made in 1984 like not having access to weapons. Some cancelled weekend plans and kept their children home, fearful of having a son or daughter stranded across the city during a riot. Others talked about fleeing — what relative could take them in if the violence started? As in 1984, everyone saw something slightly different in the facts they could gather and made different plans accordingly. Violence evokes contrasting responses from even similar people, and every riot changes lives in more ways than one.

Charting his road to power, Kishida positioned himself on the right side of the kingmakers. But that is only half the battle.
30-09-2021||Editorials||Why the BJP is smiling today||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is keenly watching the churn in India’s oppositional politics. On the one hand, it can see the implosion in the Congress. The battle within India’s Grand Old Party between those who are increasingly exasperated with what they see as a bleak future under the current leadership and those who believe that the future of the party rests in the Gandhi siblings taking full control of the party has intensified, symbolised by Captain Amarinder Singh’s announcement that he would quit the party. As both Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi assert authority and alienate established leaders, this battle will only intensify. On the other hand, the BJP can see the Trinamool Congress and Aam Aadmi Party’s attempts to establish a national footprint at the cost of the Congress.The BJP has little to do with this — except that since it is the common target, how the dynamics in the Congress and between the Congress and the TMC and AAP evolve will shape the landscape for 2024. And it is in this context that the ruling party can see that its trump card — the leadership and appeal of Narendra Modi — will only stay intact. There is a range of structural explanations for the BJP’s dominance — from the rise of Hindutva to the party’s robust organisational machine, from the government’s welfare schemes to the interplay of urbanisation, caste and technology leading to a change in voting patterns. But at the core, the BJP’s voters — and even those voters who are disillusioned with the BJP — ask a simple question. If not Narendra Modi, then who?In terms of principles, this is not the right question to ask in a parliamentary democracy. But both the 2014 and 2019 elections have shown that India is witnessing a presidential model in polls. As the Opposition battles it out internally, for the BJP, reinforcing and amplifying the question of the alternative has become much easier. Rahul Gandhi can be dismissed for mismanaging Punjab; Mamata Banerjee’s rise allows the BJP to play on urban India’s sense of her as a maverick; it also allows it to play up its messaging on her as a pro-Muslim leader. But beyond the specifics, the Opposition’s churn allows the BJP to portray Mr Modi as a stable hand at the wheel, even as all others are mired in the race to get inside the car.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/why-the-bjp-is-smiling-today-101633017877038.html
