Passengers rushed from counter to counter to locate available buses for their destination as over most public buses remained off the road.Private transporters made hay of the strike, with passengers having no option but to board their buses.According to officials, the regular staff operated some buses to Amritsar, Jalandhar and Bathinda. But no service was available for Delhi, Manali, and Jammu, while those to Chandigarh and Ferozepur were also affected.. “A total of 108 buses of Punjab Roadways and PUNBUS ply daily from Ludhiana depot and cover around 35,000km area, but on Monday, only 36 were operational. These could cover only around 10,000km, causing losses worth around ₹8 lakh,” said Tarsem Singh, in-charge, Ludhiana bus stand.Sharing details of PRTC buses, another official said around 100 PRTC buses ferried passengers from Ludhiana bus stand daily, but only 30 could ply on Monday due to the strike, leading to losses worth over ₹6 lakh.Harrowing timeJatinder Kumar, 40, of Sri Muktsar Sahib had to travel to Chandigarh for his 10-year-old daughter’s treatment at a government hospital, but was left stranded at the Ludhiana bus stand for hours.“I have already waited for several hours for a PRTC bus for Chandigarh. Now I am buying tickets for a private bus, as it is important for me to reach the hospital in time. While the PRTC ticket would have cost around ₹100, I now have to pay ₹280 for my journey,” said Kumar.Rashpal Singh, 28, expressed frustration as he couldn’t find a bus back to his hometown in Malerkotla. “It is not easy for me to wait for long due to my physical disability. Since private buses are full and also overcharging, I don’t wish to travel in crowded vehicles,” he said.Female passengers, who have been exempted from paid travel in public buses by the state government, complained of overcharging by private buses.Arti, 39, of Ferozepur, couldn’t find a PRTC bus to her hometown and eventually had to pay full fare for the ticket of her eight-year-old daughter to board a private bus. “I have waited for over three hours for a roadways bus to Ferozepur, but finally have to go for a private bus. Usually there is no fare for women in public buses, but I am being asked to pay even for my daughter,” she said.Seema, 35, of Jalalabad and Jasmeet Kaur, 27, of Malerkotla voiced the same concerns.Meanwhile, Parveen Kumar, general secretary, PUNBUS Contractual Union, Ludhiana, said the strike will continue till the government initiated the process for their regularisation. “The chief minister had promised regularisation of contractual employees ahead of the 2017 Assembly elections, but the claims fell flat. We can’t feed our kids with a mere salary of ₹10,000,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/contractual-staff-pull-buses-off-road-in-ludhiana-passengers-left-high-and-dry-101630952932860.html
06-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra logs 3,626 single-day Covid-19 cases, lowest since Feb 15||Maharashtra recorded 3,626 Covid-19 cases on Monday, the state’s lowest daily count since February 15, according to a report by PTI. With Monday’s cases, the tally in Maharashtra reached 6.48 million. The state’s case positivity rate stood at 2.49%. Maharashtra has 47,695 active cases.Maharashtra tested 145,457 samples between Sunday and Monday compared to 193,193 between Saturday and Sunday, signalling a possible reason behind the lesser number of cases reported on Monday.The total number of deaths rose to 137,811 with 37 deaths. This is the lowest casualty since March 8. The case fatality rate in the state stood at 2.12% while the recovery rate rose 97.09% with 5,988 recoveries.Nandurbar, Akola, Amaravati, Yavatmal, Wardha, Bhandara and Gondia districts, and Jalgaon, Dhule, and Amravati municipal corporations did not report any new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours, health department officials told news agency PTI. The officials also added that among districts Ahmednagar lodged the highest number of cases with 805 new infections, followed by Pune at 416.Among Maharashtra’s eight regions, Pune region reported 1,267 new cases which is the highest in the last 24 hours. Nashik region reported 953 new cases while Mumbai region reported 728 fresh Covid-19 cases.Financial capital Mumbai reported 383 cases and five related deaths in the previous 24 hours. It reported 5 deaths. It was for the fifth straight day that Mumbai recorded less than 400 cases. The marginal drop can be attributed to a smaller number of tests done across the state.Earlier in the day, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray urged political parties to cancel all gatherings, rallies and religious events in the state. “Public health is very important. Festivals can be celebrated in future. The situation can worsen if the cases of COVID increase. One must give priority to the health of the people so that we can avoid the third wave,” Thackeray was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Thackeray also issued instructions to officials to be ready in case a third-wave like situation arises. He also warned citizens and said that situations should not arise which could lead to imposition of Covid-19 restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-logs-3-626-single-day-covid-19-cases-lowest-since-feb-15-101630951976331.html
06-09-2021||Bangalore||NIA files chargesheet against 13 for human trafficking from Bangladesh||The National Investigation Agency on Monday filed a charge sheet against thirteen Bangladeshi nationals for their involvement in trafficking women and children from the neighbouring country after illegally crossing over to India, an official said. The chargesheet has been filed before a Special Court in Bengaluru. Rafik, Sobuj Shaik, Mohammed Rafikdul Islam Ridoy, Rakibul Islam, Mohammed Babu Molla, Mohammed Alami Hossein, Mohammed Dalim, Hossain Azim, Mohammed Jamal, Enamul Haque Shuzan, Mohammed Ruhul Amin, Riday Islam, and Mohammed Milon Biswas — all Bangladeshi nationals — have been charged with sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Foreigners Act, and the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, the NIA official said.The case was registered in June in Bengaluru city against the accused based on a raid conducted by the police at a rented house where seven women and one child of Bangladeshi nationality were rescued from the custody of four human traffickers, an NIA official said.The NIA took over the case and found that the charge-sheeted accused had illegally crossed over to India from Bangladesh, the official of the premier investigation agency said. They were luring women from Bangladesh and trafficking them to India with the promise of jobs, the NIA official said.The women were then confined in rented accommodations and subjected to sexual exploitation, the official said. The accused had also forged identity cards and used these forged documents as genuine to obtain Indian identity cards such as Aadhaar Card, PAN Card among others for themselves and their victims, the NIA official said as reported by news agency PTI. The official added that further investigation in this case continues.Meanwhile, the state government has directed the police to maintain a strict vigil on illegal immigrants and the overstayed foreign nationals, against any act of anti-social and anti-national activities, said Karnataka home minister, Araga Jnanendra.Addressing a press conference, after taking part at a one day state-level senior Police Officers Conference in Bengaluru, the minister said, “A direction had been issued to the police to maintain a separate register on the foreign nationals in their respective police stations and maintain a strict vigil on their activities”.Stating that the conviction rate against the criminals is not on a satisfactory note, the minister said that “directions had been issued to introspect on the issue and take all measures to improve the situation on the matter”.“The criminal elements can be put under check if the conviction rate goes up,” the minister said.Informing that the state government has decided to strengthen the coastal protection force, the minister said that “efforts should be taken to coordinate with the Naval authorities to ensure a foolproof coastal security cover against any anti-national elements”. The state government has also decided to submit a proposal to set up a unit of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) either in Bengaluru or Mangaluru to keep a check on anti-national elements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/nia-files-chargesheet-against-13-for-human-trafficking-from-bangladesh-101630952633137.html
06-09-2021||Chandigarh||56-year-old Ludhiana woman found murdered, nephew booked||A 27-year-old man is on the run after allegedly murdering his aunt to usurp her property, police said on Monday.The victim, Gurcharan Kaur, 56, who worked at an anganwari centre, was found dead under mysterious circumstances at her house in Gondwal village, Raikot, on Sunday.Her nephew, Shiv Kumar, alias Lali, of Pohir village, Dehlon, who used to live with her is missing, leading police to suspect his involvement in her murder.As there were no injury marks on the body, police surmised she may have died by poisoning or strangulation. The body has been sent to the civil hospital to establish the exact cause of death.Meanwhile, Shiv has been booked for murder on the complaint of Amandeep Kaur of Kalsa village, a cousin of the victim’s deceased husband. Amandeep told the police that her cousin and sister-in-law had no children, and the latter had been living alone since his death.Six months ago, she had her nephew Shiv move in with her. Since then, he had been harassing her for naming a local gurdwara as the inheritor of her house in her will.Around 25 days ago, he forcibly made her change her will to name him as the heir of the property and also got engaged to a woman that Gurcharan did not approve of.Amandeep said on Sunday she received information that Gurcharan was found dead in her house, with her nephew missing. She claimed that Shiv had fled after murdering her sister-in-law.“A manhunt has been launched to arrest the accused. The cause of death will be ascertained after autopsy,” said sub-inspector Ajaib Singh, station house officer (SHO), Raikot City, police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/56yearold-ludhiana-woman-found-murdered-nephew-booked-101630952447235.html
06-09-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Sero survey to identify Covid-19 antibodies will start on Sep 8||The third round of serological survey to detect Covid-19 antibodies, which was originally scheduled to be held in June, will be conducted from September 8 to 10, officials of the health department said.It will be a statewide study to check the prevalence of antibodies in children aged 6 to 17, officials said.The survey will cover 3,000 people, including 1,200 children, in the district. Overall, 36,520 people from 22 districts of the state will take part in the survey, in which children are being included for the first time.Chief medical officer of Gurugram, Dr Virender Yadav, said that children have been included over apprehensions that they might be affected the most in the event of a third wave of infections, as inoculation has not started for them.“It is a cross-sectional study with stratified multistage testing. Since those aged below 18 years are not covered under the vaccination programme, the survey will help in analysing the trend for the third wave of Covid-19 as it is being predicted that children will be affected,” said Yadav.In Gurugram, the survey will be done in at least 75 clusters, including 45 rural and 30 urban pockets. The areas shortlisted for the survey are Jharsa, Islampur and Shivaji Nagar, among other urban pockets, and Daulatabad, Wazirabad, Budhera and Manesar rural pockets.According to Yadav, 25 clusters will be covered in a day. Blood samples will be collected from 1,800 people above the age of 18 years, 900 from those aged 10 to 17 years and 300 from children aged six to nine years.At least 40 samples will be collected from each cluster, which will be divided into four quadrants and 10 houses selected from each. Nearly three millilitres of blood will be taken from six adults, three aged 10 to 17 years, and a child aged six to nine years, along with verbal and written consent.Officials said that 40% of the total samples will be collected from urban areas, while the rest will be from rural areas. For each cluster, a three-member team, comprising a doctor, an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), and a lab technician, has been constituted.Yadav said that all the samples will be taken to the district lab in Panchkula for testing. About 12 supervisors have been assigned for the supervision. In the last two sero surveys held in 2020, samples were tested in Gurugram.During the first round of serological survey in Gurugram, the seropositivity rate of the urban areas was 18.5%, while in the second round it increased to 25.9%. Likewise, in rural areas, it increased from 5.7% in the first round to 10.1% in the second round. In both surveys, over 800 people were tested for the antibodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-sero-survey-to-identify-covid-19-antibodies-will-start-on-sep-8-101630951851772.html
06-09-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Mayor recommends terminating services of a MCG consultant, transfer of engineer||Mayor Madhu Azad recommended that the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) terminate its contract with one of its consultants for non-performance and called for the transfer of a superintending engineer (SE) for not obeying orders and alleged misbehaviour, a release issued by the civic body on Monday stated. Azad issued these directions while reviewing the work being done by the consultants working with the MCG. The MCG has 11 consultants deputed across various departments such as the legal wing, vigilance branch, Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), grievance management, IT, and environment wing.According to MCG officials, Azad found work of a consultant working in the civic body’s SBM non-satisfactory. The resignation submitted by another official deputed in the same branch was also accepted.According to MCG officials, Azad had directed the SE in question to visit Ward 22 last week. However, he didn’t obey her direction. When she brought up the matter with him during the meeting, he allegedly left following an argument with her. Following this, the mayor sent a recommendation to MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja to relieve the SE of his duties and transfer him out of the MCG, while also submitting a report to the Haryana government on the matter. “Those who do not work properly have no place in the MCG and will be shown the way out of the corporation with immediate effect. All consultants have been directed to discharge their duties keeping in mind the public interest and the interest of the corporation. From now onwards, the work of all the consultants would be reviewed by me every three months,” said Azad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-mayor-recommends-terminating-services-of-a-mcg-consultant-transfer-of-engineer-101630951850182.html
06-09-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19 preparations: Gurugram health dept told to submit details of medical oxygen audit||The Gurugram health department was directed to submit the medical oxygen audit report of over 97 hospitals in the district within a week to the state during a district-level review meeting held by the additional chief secretary of the health department.Officials said that the move is aimed at strengthening the healthcare facilities ahead of a possible third wave of Covid-19 infections. The audit report will provide details on oxygen supply and consumption, the status of Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen generating plants in hospitals and the total number of oxygen-supported beds.On Monday, in a district-level review meeting with the health officials of Gurugram, Nuh and Rewari at Apparel House in Sector 44, Rajeev Arora, the additional chief secretary of the health department, directed officials to cover all hospitals registered on the Covid portal in the oxygen audit. This includes nursing homes and hospitals which have fewer than 50 beds.Earlier this month, the district health department directed only 43 big hospitals of the city, which have a minimum bed capacity of 50, to constitute oxygen audit committees and submit details with the department.“Now all 97 hospitals registered on Covid portal, which treated patients of coronavirus infections, will have to submit details of their oxygen capacity, cylinders available with them, installation of PSA plants and overall consumption data. Within next 10 days, the audit report of over 97 hospitals will be collated and submitted to the state health department,” Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said.According to Yadav, there are at least 11 operational oxygen plants in government hospitals and 10 in big private hospitals at present, while around 20 plants are being installed in private hospitals.During the second wave of Covid-19 infections in Gurugram in April and May, private hospitals of the city grappled with a lack of liquid oxygen supply due to a sharp rise in coronavirus cases. Refilling cylinders became an impossible task due to the short supply of oxygen, as the demand increased from around 25 metric tonnes (MT) a day to almost 48 MT in a short span.Currently, the daily requirement of oxygen across the district is 10-12 MT, as per a rough estimate made by the health department.Arora said, “Heavy stress on the healthcare infrastructure during the second wave of Covid-19 in April and May is an indicator as to how we can prepare ahead for the third wave. Private hospitals, medical colleges, and the health department have improved health services after the second wave. We have already directed hospitals to reserve 20% of oxygen and intensive care unit (ICU) beds for infants and children and submit their report within a week.”Based on the details submitted by 76 hospitals, the district has 686 paediatric beds supported with oxygen supply, at least 172 paediatric ICU beds with ventilators, and 391 paediatric ICU beds without ventilators. For adults, over 3,837 beds have been reserved, of which 2,817 are equipped with oxygen support, 759 are ICU beds and 261 are equipped with ventilators.Besides, the health department will have to prepare a report based on the consumption and demand of remdesivir injection and medical equipment during the second wave. Arora said that the report will help in arranging the required medicine stock based on the consumption pattern.‘Complete first dose vaccination in the state’Arora said that the state has decided to complete 100% first dose Covid-19 vaccination by September-end. Stating that vaccination in Gurugram has exceeded the overall target and reached 119% due to the migratory population, he directed the district health department to ensure residents of Gurugram are not left out.Since the second dose inoculation of many healthcare workers in private hospitals is not yet complete, authorities have been told to ensure 100% coverage and submit their final report with the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-preparations-gurugram-health-dept-told-to-submit-details-of-medical-oxygen-audit-101630951848709.html
06-09-2021||Gurugram||Biodiversity plan to focus on conservation for 10 years with available resources||The Haryana State Biodiversity Board has started preparations for a biodiversity strategy and action plan to focus on preserving the biodiversity of the state for the next 10 years with available resources.This plan will provide guidance on reducing negative impacts on biodiversity and focus on biodiversity restoration and maintenance with landscape-based interventions, officials said on Monday. The board has set a target of March 2022 for developing the plan.The plan is being developed with the help of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), which has been involved in biodiversity conservation by implementing biodiversity-related policies and programmes for the Central government. After dividing the state into four divisions, experts from WII will be studying aspects like plant species, wildlife and crops found in different parts of the state and analyse the pressures on biodiversity.The board conducted a workshop concerning this project in July, after which a regional workshop was conducted by experts from WII in Ambala last week. Similar workshops will be conducted in Gurugram, Rohtak and Hisar this month.“To develop a strategy and action plan, we are first taking stock of the flora and fauna, current status and trends in biodiversity in the state. Further, existing threats or pressures to biodiversity and ecosystems are being identified. These inputs will be used to formulate a guideline for not just forest and wildlife departments, but all departments, such as fisheries, agriculture, land revenue, with the aim of maintaining the current biodiversity even 10 years from now, with available resources,” Vineet Kumar Garg, the chairman of Haryana State Biodiversity Board, said.The authority is also coordinating with individuals and non-governmental organisations that have been working for the protection of biodiversity in the state.According to the targets of the National Biodiversity Action Plan (NBAP), an effective, participatory and updated biodiversity action plan must be made operational at different levels of governance. In this context, various states and union territories are required to prepare their own state biodiversity action plans in alignment with the NBAP.MD Sinha, the principal secretary of the state tourism department, who earlier served as the conservator of forests for Gurugram, said that the importance of conservation of habitat was discussed in the workshop held in July.“In an agriculture-dominated state like Haryana, forest cover has decreased drastically due to intensive agricultural practices and ever-increasing human population and urbanisation. For six districts of south Haryana, essentially, it is only the Aravallis which constitute actual forest cover. If we take that out, only 0.5% of the geographical area of these districts will remain as block forests,” said Sinha.He said urban landscape management, focussing on urban biodiversity, is the need of the hour for Indian cities and this must be kept in mind while preparing the state biodiversity and strategic action plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/biodiversity-plan-to-focus-on-conservation-for-10-years-with-available-resources-101630951847334.html
06-09-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Debris processing mobile units of MCG unused since 2019||Two mobile units procured by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) for processing construction and demolition (C&D) waste have been lying unused since 2019, three months after they were pressed into service. With debris waste continuing to pile up in the city, officials of the MCG said they are now planning on moving one of the units to Baliawas village, next to the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road.The two units had been set up, at a cost of around ₹12.52 crore, at the auto market in Basai to clear large piles of C&D waste accumulated there. However, within three months of starting operations, work was halted as the MCG’s contractor had not obtained environmental impact assessment (EIA) clearance from the ministry of environment, forest, and climate change (MoEF&CC).Last week, during a review meeting of major MCG projects, officials submitted an update in the matter stating that work is halted due to pending EIA clearance.“Action is being taken against the contractor for starting work without EIA. However, we are proceeding ahead, and planning on using at least one of the machines along Gurgaon-Faridabad Road to clear large piles of C&D waste scattered there. We have identified a site in Baliawas for it. The feasibility, environmental impact, and other such key issues are being looked into,” Sunder Sheoran, executive engineer, Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), MCG, said.The C&D waste mobile crushing and screening units were inaugurated by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in March 2019 and are capable of processing 400 tonnes of waste per day.The then MCG commissioner Yashpal Yadav had stated that the purpose of the two units was to clear legacy waste (C&D waste lying scattered across the city for a long duration) while the Basai C&D plant would process fresh C&D waste.According to MCG officials, the rationale behind placing a mobile unit along Gurgaon-Faridabad Road was to address the production of C&D waste along developing areas of Golf Course Extension Road, while the unit at Basai auto market will be accessible to areas along Dwarka Expressway and residential areas near Manesar border.According to the MCG’s estimate, the city generates around 850 tonnes of C&D waste daily, most of which is scattered on roadsides and vacant plots.“C&D waste is one of the primary reasons behind high levels of air pollution in the city. Besides causing respiratory-related issues, they also choke drains and contribute to waterlogging during the monsoon season. Unless the MCG starts acting on C&D waste on priority, the Basai plant too will meet the similar fate as the Bandhwari plant,” said Vaishali Rana, a city-based environmentalist, adding that she had filed a Right to Information (RTI) petition about the two mobile units in 2019, but failed to get a reply from the MCG.The absence of the mobile units has also impacted production at the Basai C&D waste plant. Due to lack of space for storing raw as well as processed waste, the Basai plant has been functioning at a capacity of 300 tonnes per day despite being equipped to handle 1,800 tonnes per day.Such is the space constraint at the plant that last month, the MCG asked Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) to lease its five-acre plot opposite the plant for storing processed and legacy C&D waste. The move came after a five-member committee, formed to explore ways to increase production of the Basai plant, recommended finding space for storing waste.“From last week, we have started storing processed and legacy waste at GMDA’s site. This will help clear up space at the Basai plant and increase its production capacity,” said Sheoran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-debris-processing-mobile-units-of-mcg-unused-since-2019-101630951846156.html
06-09-2021||Other||Team of 40 Indian scientists claim major find using uGMRT||PUNE A team of 40 scientists from different institutions across the country, under the banner of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA), claim to have clear evidence of unexpected changes in a milli-second radio pulsar, using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). Millisecond pulsars are exotic objects in the sky, used to detect ultra-low frequency gravitational waves. As per InPTA, the millisecond pulsars have extreme stable behaviour. This discovery has attracted the attention of astronomers across the globe, because millisecond pulsars are not expected to show such behaviour. Pulsars (PULSAting Radio Stars) are ultra-dense dead stars that act as celestial lighthouses with a radio flash once every rotation of the star. This flashing radio signal, or pulse, has unmatched stability in periods and shapes. The stable shape of their pulses is regarded as their fingerprints and is crucial to extract their clock-like pulse ticks very precisely. Measuring these time ticks for a collection of pulsars is necessary for the detection of nano-Hertz gravitational waves (nHz) in the near future. “Pulsars are bright at lower frequencies and best observed at lower radio frequencies. The uGMRT, located 80 km from Pune, is one of the largest radio telescopes in the world capable of observing at these frequencies. Thus, even minute changes in the pulse shapes can be seen with the uGMRT,” said Bhal Chandra Joshi, a scientist from the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) Pune. “The Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) has been regularly monitoring a set of pulsars using the uGMRT for the eventual detection of (nHz) nanohertz gravitational waves. The InPTA is a collaboration of Indian and Japanese astronomers from several institutes. Earlier this year, the InPTA became a part of the International pulsar timing array (IPTA) consortium, which is an international collaboration that aims to detect the elusive nanohertz gravitational waves. Further uGMRT observations are likely to help in unravelling the mysteries behind this unexpected, but interesting event, and eventually help in detection of nanohertz gravitational waves,” he added. Among the set of pulsars being observed, PSR J1713+0747 is one of the most reliable clocks of them all. Ongoing observations between April and May 2021 and thereafter, revealed strong evidence of a fingerprint change in this star disturbing its rhythm and clock behaviour. The InPTA team continued to observe this pulsar to track the changes. With the low radio frequency observations that only the uGMRT can provide, the team established that the change in this event was much larger than ever observed in any other pulsar clock used in PTA experiments. As these experiments require exquisite timing observations, such a change needs to be accounted for to make reliable detection of nanohertz gravitational waves possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/team-of-40-indian-scientists-claim-major-find-using-ugmrt-101630951725179.html

A child started making masks, another started teaching yoga. A 12th pass girl, Kajal has created her own accounting company and is giving jobs to 20 people, she has a turnover of ₹15 lakhs. An important component of this curriculum is the Seed Money Project,” he told news agency ANI.Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s education minister, said that the project was started in a school in Khichdipur. He noted that a total of 41 children of the school commenced seed money investment by forming nine groups and all of them are “running in profit.”“This is important because, in our country, the solution to unemployment is found politically,” he was quoted as saying.When the initiative began in 2019, the students of the Khichdipur school were given ₹1,000 each as ‘seed money’ under the pilot project. On Monday, Sisodia announced that the amount has been increased to ₹2,000 each and that it will be implemented in all government schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-govt-in-delhi-to-give-rs-2-000-seed-money-to-over-3-lakh-school-students-101630951251045.html

The UP government had initiated proceedings to take over the land of Mohammad Ali Jauhar University for failing to adhere to conditions on which the trust was granted the land in 2005 for the construction of an educational institution.MP, Mohammad Azam Khan is the president of the trust while his wife, Dr Tazeen Fatima, is the secretary and son, Abdullah Azam Khan, is an active member of the Trust.The court said that as per the report of the SDM concerned, a mosque was constructed on the land which was only for educational purposes, and thus, in violation of permission granted by the state government.Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal dismissed the petition filed by Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar Trust seeking the quashing of the March 16, 2020 report submitted by the SDM with regard to constructions on the land. The trust also sought to quash the additional district magistrate (administration) Rampur’s order, dated January 16, 2021, for vesting of the land in the state.On the argument of the defence counsel that the mosque was built for staff of the university, the court observed, “The argument that the campus had residential premises for teaching as well as non-teaching staff, and so a mosque was constructed for them, cannot be accepted as it goes against the permission granted by the state.”The court said that no interference was required in the order passed by the ADM (administration) Rampur to initiate proceedings under Section 104/105 of the UP Revenue Code, 2006 for vesting of University’s land in UP Govt ie taking over the land given to the Trust.The court said, “It is a case where a large part of land has been purchased as well as certain part of the land belonging to tenure holders and Gaon Sabha has been encroached upon by a former cabinet minister of state for establishing an educational institution pursuant to an Act which has come up in the year 2005. The finding has not been assailed by placing documentary proof that the plots in question were purchased by the Trust and does not belong to Gaon Sabha or the tenure holders, who have initiated proceedings under Section 134 of the Code.”“From the order impugned, I find that the revenue authority, after considering not only the report dated 16.3.2020 but also the reply of the petitioner, as well as the representation of the State, had in depth recorded finding as to the violation of law and condition by the Trust in setting up the educational institution. The order impugned has rightly been passed in the proceedings under Section 104/105 of Code and the land except 12.50 acres vest in the State Government.”In 2005, the state government enacted the Mohammad Ali Jauhar University Act, paving the way for the creation of the university.Thereafter, the state government granted permission to Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar Trust to acquire 400 acres of land against the ceiling of 12.5 acres (5.0586 hectares) for the establishment of the university while imposing certain conditions one of which was that the land will be used only for educational purposes.As per law, if such restriction/ condition is violated, the permission granted by the state government stands withdrawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/allahabad-hc-dismisses-plea-challenging-taking-back-land-of-jauhar-varsity-101630951606519.html

06-09-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad administers over 2.1 million doses so far, ranks second in UP||Ghaziabad on Monday achieved its target of administering 62,100 vaccine doses against Covid-19 and replaced Gautam Budh Nagar as the district with the second-highest number of doses administered in Uttar Pradesh since the vaccination drive began on January 16.According to Co-WIN portal at 9pm, Ghaziabad on Monday administered 69,028 doses taking its total to 2,160,921, while Gautam Budh Nagar administered 25,952 taking its total to 2,151,276. Lucknow remained at the top of the list with 2,940,252 doses. Uttar Pradesh administered 3.1 million doses on the day taking its total to over 8 million.District officials said that the numbers would continue to be updated through the night, but it was unlikely that Ghaziabad would lose its spot.Monday was the first mega vaccination drive of the month. August had three such drives and Ghaziabad consistently surpassed its target by several thousands, even topping the state list. “For the mega drive, the state government gave us a target of 62,100 doses and we had a stock of 80,000. We surpassed that with the help of 161 Covid vaccination centres (CVCs),” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid vaccination. “Of late, our vaccination coverage has increased as our daily allocation of vaccines from the state government was increased from 16,000 to 23,000. During the mega drives which have taken place so far, we achieved targets and also did more vaccination. If we get sufficient stock of vaccine, the district has potential to administer about 50,000 doses daily even during non-mega drive days.”During the first mega drive on August 3, the district administered 79,822 doses, while it administered 42,444 and 67,040 doses during the second and third drives on August 16 and 27, respectively.The figures of the Cowin portal on Monday also stated that the overall coverage include 4,80,667 second doses which is about 22.24% of overall 21,60,921 vaccination doses till 8pm on Monday. “The coverage of vaccination is increasing, and focus should also be to increase the coverage of second dose. As, it is only after both the doses, a beneficiary gets required protection from infection. Such drives should be held regularly now to increase coverage ahead of any eventuality of a third Covid wave,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). Of the overall doses, the district has so far administered 1303870 doses in 18-45 age group. Of the overall doses, about 43.6% doses were administered to women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-administers-over-2-1-million-doses-so-far-ranks-second-in-up-101630951545836.html

People reached the main gate of the GDA’s headquarters in tractors, trolleys and other vehicles and raised slogans against the authority and demanded a hiked compensation for their land acquired by the GDA in 2007.“About 200-250 farmers from the six affected villages -- Sadarpur, Minapur, Nagla Par, Duhai and Morta -- have been demanding a hiked land compensation for the past several years, but the authority did not pay any heed to their demand. Each farmer had got ₹1,100 per square metre compensation for his/her land in the past, but now they need the land compensation according to the new land Act,” said Rajbir Singh, a farmer leader and state vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU).“We protested for nearly three hours. Some GDA officials also arrived for talks, but the vice chairperson was not available. So, we decided to hold talks again next Monday,” Singh added.The housing scheme is spread over an area of more than 1,250 acre across several villages and the land will be used for the development of 20,000 housing units. In 2004, farmers having 281-acre land had challenged the GDA’s land acquisition process, in which the emergency clause was invoked.The aggrieved farmers moved the high court in 2008 but failed to get any relief. They later moved the Supreme Court through a petition. The apex court, in its judgment in November 2017, directed that a revised compensation needs to be paid according to the provisions of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation & Resettlement Act, 2013, to the petitioner farmers.The GDA also arranged ₹1,200 crore, including loan from banks, for the hiked compensation. Officials said that they have acquired the entire land for the scheme but have physical possession of only about 50% land.“The hiked land compensation as directed by the apex court was meant only for the petitioner farmers. Farmers, who protested on Monday were given prevailing rates, but they are now demanding a hiked compensation. They have been called for talks next week, and after the assurance of a dialogue they vacated the protest area,” said Ashish Shivpuri, chief architect and town planner, GDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-farmers-protest-at-gda-headquarters-demand-hiked-land-compensation-101630951545275.html
06-09-2021||Noida||IIT-Delhi to assess Noida’s pollution sources||The Noida regional office of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has approached IIT-Delhi to assess the sources of air pollution, a first for the city, in a bid to deploy effective control measures before October when the air quality starts deteriorating in the National Capital Region.Despite the city figuring among the most polluted in the country in several surveys, there is yet to be a survey to assess the source of emissions and the kind of aerosols so produced. Noida, like other cities in the NCR, suffers severe levels of air pollution from October through February, due to several artificial and meteorological factors.Officials from UPPCB said they will soon start field inspections and check hot spots [where pollution levels are generally high] for better remedial actions. IIT-Delhi is the knowledge partner and institute of repute (IOR) for Noida and Ghaziabad. In March, the cities and IIT-Delhi signed a memorandum of agreement to this effect wherein the institute will help them with technical support, identifying sources and methods to tackle air pollution.UPPCB Noida regional officer Praveen Kumar said the board will soon sign a contract with the IIT to conduct the survey. “The conditions of the contract are being formalised for the study that will measure emissions, inventory development and source apportionment for Noida. After that we will be in a position to assess the actual sources so that we can take remedial actions accordingly. We will also keep an eye on the violations related to the construction and demolition waste,” said Kumar.According to the IIT Delhi, centre for atmospheric sciences, associate professor Sagnik Dey, while there could be many sources of emissions in both Noida and Ghaziabad, a big chunk of pollution comes from Delhi.“Both Noida and Ghaziabad are on downwind of Delhi, so emissions from there end up in the two cities, just like Delhi receives emissions from Haryana and Punjab. There would certainly be other sources of pollution as well in Noida, which would be almost similar as those in Delhi. So far, we have very little knowledge about Noida in terms of sources, so this study would be a first. In fact, no other NCR city, other than Delhi, has had such a survey done,” said Dey .The study Dey is referring to is one that was done by IIT Kanpur in 2015, which found that in winter vehicles contributed nearly 25% of the PM2.5 (particulate matter of size 2.5 microns or less that can enter bloodstream and penetrate organs leading to higher risk of cancer and other diseases) and biomass burning contributed 26%. Noida is among 132 cities in the country selected for the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) — a long-term and time-bound national level strategy to tackle air pollution across the country in a comprehensive manner. It has targets to achieve 20% to 30% reduction in particulate matter concentration by 2024 with 2017 as the base year. According to a 2020 report by IQAir, a US and Swiss-based air quality solution company, which has assessed a total of 98 countries and over 600 cities, Noida and Greater Noida were the fifth and ninth most polluted cities, respectively, based on the annual average concentration of PM2.5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/iitdelhi-to-assess-noida-s-pollution-sources-101630951128244.html

During the meeting, the Noida authority’s chief architect gave a detailed presentation on the controversial project, officials said, adding that the authority’s chief executive officer Ritu Maheshwari was also present in the meeting. The four-member SIT, headed by UP industrial development commissioner (IDC) Sanjeev Mittal, gave special emphasis on sequence of notices to Supertech for this project. “The SIT sought details of all notices issued to the Supertech Group from 2004 to 2012, when the building map was revised for the last time. We have provided all details of notices, approval and revisions of map, and approval of floor area ratio, among others,” said a Noida authority official not authorised to speak to the media. According to the officials, only two members of the SIT -- Mittal and ADG (police) Rajeev Sabharwal -- reached the Noida authority office around 12pm on Monday, while the other two members -- additional chief secretary (revenue) Manoj Singh and UP’s chief town and rural planner Anup Kumar -- will come to Noida on Tuesday. The SIT was formed by the state government on September 2, two days after the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of Apex and Ceyane towers in the Emerald Court project in Noida’s Sector 93A over grave violation of building norms. The court said the violation was a result of “nefarious complicity” between the Noida authority and the real estate developer. The government has given a week’s time to the team to submit the report. Meanwhile, Supertech Group managing director Mohit Arora, in a video message, appealed to his investors that they do not need to worry about future of their respective projects. “There are rumours of different kinds about Supertech’s all projects after the Supreme Court’s order on Emerald twin towers. We would like to inform that ongoing proceedings in connection to the Emerald Court will not affect delivery of other projects. We respect honourable court order and will use legal options available. We are developing 60 million square feet area in all projects and will deliver as per schedule. Emerald only involves 600,000 sq ft area, so it will not affect interest of investors in other projects,” said Arora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/emerald-court-case-sit-seeks-details-from-noida-officials-101630951125049.html

06-09-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow gives its best shot with over 1 lakh jabs in a day||LUCKNOW Lucknow on Monday became the first district in UP to inoculate over 1 lakh people in a single day since vaccination began on January 16 this year. The state capital exceeded its target of 86,400 doses for the day by administering 1,03,143 doses, which was the highest in the division and state, according to a press statement by the district administration. Prior to this, Lucknow’s highest single-day vaccination was 92,274 doses on August 27, followed by Sitapur (89,080 doses).“By 9pm, 1,03,143 doses had been administered in Lucknow. No other district has achieved this figure in a single day,” said Dr MK Singh, in-charge vaccination in Lucknow. “At least 250 doses of the vaccine were available at each booth,” said Dr Manoj Agrawal, chief medical officer, Lucknow. A large number of beneficiaries began reaching vaccination centres in the city around 9am and long queues were seen at vaccination centres at workplaces that facilitated walk-in vaccination facility. As many as 195 vaccination centres with 461 booths were set up in Lucknow. A total of 104 centres were workplace vaccination centres where walk-in registration facility was available. “Over 21.32 lakh first doses and over 8.07 lakh second doses have been administered in the state capital. This means, over 22% Lucknowites are fully vaccinated (both the doses). Total vaccination in Lucknow reached 2940252 doses,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors.Several organisations also organised vaccination camps. The Indian Industries Association, AMA Herbal Group, and Anantsheel Foundation collectively organised a free Covid vaccination camp on Talkatora Road.

He also said that the court also put a stay on the two other cases in which Adhikari has been named. While one pertains to post-poll violence in Nandigram, another is a snatching case at Panskura. “In two other cases, the court has said that investigators can question him at a place of Adhikari’s choice but would not be able to take any coercive action. In future too if any fresh cases are lodged, coercive actions can’t be taken against Adhikari without the court’s permission,” Bhattacharya added. Earlier in the day, Adhikari was summoned by the CID for questioning in connection with the death case of his bodyguard. Adhikari, however, sent an email to the investigating agency saying that he has some political engagements due to which he would be unable to appear for questioning. In July, the CID initiated a fresh probe into the death of Adhikari’s security guard who reportedly died by suicide in 2018, officials said. The victim’s wife had lodged a complaint demanding a fresh probe.“We have to see the high court’s order first, to comment on it. But what I came to know is that in some of the cases the court has kept the option open wherein Adhikari may be questioned by the police. He wanted to avoid any kind of investigation. The court didn’t allow it,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson. Meanwhile, Trinamool Congress’ national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, who happens to be the nephew of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, appeared before the Enforcement Directorate on Monday in connection with the alleged multi-crore coal smuggling scam.Earlier, the central agency had summoned Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira Banerjee for questioning in the same case. Rujira Banerjee, however, had expressed her inability to appear before the agency in New Delhi citing the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. She had instead requested ED officials to visit her residence in Kolkata. On November 27, 2020, the CBI’s Kolkata Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) registered a case of corruption and criminal breach of trust with regard to illegal mining and pilferage of coal from Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL). The ED took up the investigation based on the FIR registered by the CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/suvendu-adhikari-skips-cid-summon-gets-interim-relief-from-calcutta-hc-101630948069052.html
06-09-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand assembly: BJP creates ruckus over ‘Namaz room’||The second day of the Monsoon session of the Jharkhand assembly was almost washed away on Monday with the opposition BJP legislators disrupting House proceedings, demanding withdrawal of an office order allocating a dedicated room in the Assembly complex for Muslims to offer prayers. The BJP went on to describe the aforesaid Secretariat’s notification of allocating a “Namaaz Kaksh”, made official on September 2, as “Muslim appeasement”. The party legislators, wearing saffron stoles, also organised religious song event, or ‘Kirtan’, on the steps of the Assembly with musical instruments before the start of the day’s proceedings. Taking their protest inside the House when it convened around 11.15am, the BJP legislators disrupted proceedings and entered the well, demanding the Speaker to take up their adjournment motions on two issues--withdrawal of prayer room notification and the recently cleared employment policy by the Hemant Soren government. As Speaker Rabindranath Mahto continued with the list of day’s business, taking up short notice questions, the BJP legislators started raising slogans and chants of “Jai Shri Ram” and “Har Har Mahadev”. Though the Speaker assured the BJP that he would take up adjournment motion later in the day, the party members continued with their demand, with at least two legislators--Bhanu Pratap Shahi and Randhir Singh--going as far as scaling the reporters’ chairs. As the din continued, the Speaker adjourned the House within 15 minutes till 12.45 noon. After the House resumed, the BJP legislators continued with their protest as the Speaker turned down all adjournment motions. It led to another round of adjournment till lunch. The BJP intensified their protest post lunch, as the Speaker initiated a discussion on inflation. Both the BJP and it’s ally, AJSU Party, protested the discussion, saying that a Business Advisory Committee meeting decided that both inflation and unemployment would be taken up for discussion. However, the parties alleged, that the government has deliberately dropped unemployment from the motion of discussion. As the BJP continued with its protest inside the well, the Speaker adjourned the proceedings till Tuesday. Hitting back at the main Opposition party while speaking to media persons outside the House, chief minister (CM) Hemant Soren said the BJP was raking up the prayer room notification, as they have no credible issue to raise. “A conduct such as this in the House has been one of the major obstacles in the development of the state. Today, we were prepared to debate and answer all issues on matters during the CM Question Hour, but it did not happen,” Soren said. Replying to a specific question that if he agreed with his Cabinet colleague Mithilesh Thakur’s suggestion of changing the nomenclature of the dedicated room to “prayer room”, that can be used by people of all faiths, the CM said, “If you have faith and God in your heart, there would not be any problem. But, if you have demons in your heart, everyone would seem like an enemy.” Meanwhile, other treasury bench members defended the notification, saying it was “nothing new” and there has been a precedence of it in the state Assembly as well as in other states.“I spoke to Inder Singh Namdhari (first Speaker of the Jharkhand assembly) and he clearly recalled that a room was dedicated for the purpose even when BJP was in power at the time. The BJP is unnecessarily making an issue. If they are so serious about it, why don’t they make a similar demand to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, as a similar room exists at the Bihar assembly as well,” said finance minister Rameshwar Oraon. BJP’s chief whip Biranchi Narayan challenged the state government to show any such notification from the past. “It’s an open challenge that the government produce any notification to that effect from the past. They are clearly opting for Muslim appeasement, and we will not allow the House to function until the notification is withdrawn,” he said. Mandar legislator Bandhu Tirkey, a former minister and currently one of the four working presidents of the Jharkhand Congress, suggested there was nothing new in the notification, and the government could form a committee to look into old records. First chief minister of the state and currently BJP legislature party leader Babulal Marandi underlined that even if there had been such a precedence in the past, it was wrong and the new notification should be withdrawn. “This is a temple of democracy and only Babasaheb Ambedkar should be worshipped here,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-assembly-bjp-creates-ruckus-over-namaz-room-101630947945285.html

He did not take names nor did he elaborate. He appealed to the Congress leadership and the party cadre to act unitedly to take the government’s achievements to people on the ground, so that the party could perform well in the next assembly elections.“An increase in pension from ₹750 to ₹1,500 is a major decision. We need to take such decisions to each household so that electorate could be more aware of these achievements,” he said.The Congress high command has also directed the state leadership to take Captain Amarinder Singh government’s achievements to the people. “Due to lack of coordination in the party, we are unable to do so.

Nearly 57 lakh people have been hit by the current spells of floods, which are not over yet. All the concerned departments have been asked to stay alert to meet any eventuality,” said the CM, adding that he had visited many flood-affected areas over the past few weeks. To a query regarding his assurance to look into the scope of lessening the burden of inflation due to heavy taxes on petroleum products, Kumar urged the people to stay prepared for some hard times. “The country is passing through a tough time due to the pandemic. The centre as well as the state government is spending a huge amount to tide over the crisis. The state government has spent more than ₹10,000 crore on Covid management,” he said. In an apparent justification of the government’s reluctance to step in and curb inflation, Kumar said that the government’s top priority was to eradicate the pandemic and at the same time carrying on with its development agenda. “People must stay away from raking up the issue of price rise owing to the difficult times the country is grappling with. Everything would be normal once the Covid thing is gone,” said the CM. Regarding the state’s plea for conducting the caste-based census, Kumar said that he had nothing more to comment on it, as the Centre was required to take a call on once they (leaders from Bihar) had discussed the issue with the PM. “It will benefit all sections of the society and in no way fan hatred in the society,” added Kumar. Earlier at Janata Darbar, a girl from Samastipur had accused a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) of sexually exploiting her and said she resorted to raising the issue before the chief minister after the attempts to lodge a case against the policemen was aborted by the department’s officials. A widow from Valmikinagar in West Champaran alleged that the police were not taking action against local Janata Dal (United) MLA Rinku Singh, on whose behest her husband was killed in February this year..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/wrd-exploring-ways-to-interlink-small-rivers-in-bihar-says-cm-101630946564920.html

The counting of votes was held on Monday. MES, whose candidates contested as independents since the outfit is not recognised as a political party by election commission (EC) along with other parties had previously controlled the civic body. This is its second successive loss after a poor showing in the recently held Lok Sabha bypolls and has put question marks on its support base which it claims wants to go with Maharashtra. The Congress party’s plans wrest control of the civic body by roping in the MES and independent candidates failed, as it eventually accounted for just nine seats, with Independents also winning the same number of seats. The AIMIM sprang a surprise, winning one of the six seats it contested This was the first time at the local level that Marathi speaking voters from Belgavi chose a national party, ignoring the MES, which enjoyed support of these voters for over three decades. Earlier, on most occasions, the MES supported by local groups controlled the civic body. However, this was for the first time major political parties fielded candidates in the elections to the corporation Political observers feel after this election outcome, the politics over Kannada-Marathi language speaking population which hitherto had played out at a local level, may lose its sharpness. Reacting to the BJP’s win and MES loss during the polls, Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut said, “The BJP ruled Karnataka government and took several steps to ensure defeat of MES, which is also a defeat of the Marathi population. The outcome is unfortunate for us.” The 13 members who won from the BJP are Marathi speaking, said the party leaders. The more than six-decade-old dispute being fought by Maharashtra and Karnataka with he former laying its claim on border areas, including Belgavi, Karwar and Nipani, reached the Supreme Court in 2004 and is stuck there. The dispute between the two states goes back to 1954 when Belgaum and other border areas went to Karnataka during reorganisation of the states on a linguistic basis. Belgaum being the Marathi dominant area, later continued its struggle for its merger with Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/belgavi-civic-polls-mes-suffers-defeat-bjp-takes-control-of-civic-body-101630945064029.html

Mangat Rai Bansal, who was convicted and awarded 7 years imprisonment on charges of cheating and criminal conspiracy in October 2013, can now contest the Punjab assembly polls in 2022. “Though no final order has been passed by the hon’ble High Court qua Hemant Gopal, additional district and sessions judge, who is continuing under suspension for the last about 4 years yet prima facie, his indictment as per the enquiry report is apparent on record, therefore, this application is allowed, the impugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence shall remain stayed during the pendency of the appeal and will have no adverse effect on the civil rights of the petitioner,” justice Arvind Sangwan said in the judgment released on Monday. The bribery case against the judge pertained to allegations by one of the accused in a paddy embezzlement case that Singla, a law officer with the Punjab government, ‘struck a deal’ on behalf of Gopal. The accused, Mangat Rai Bansal, had circulated a compact disc showing Singla collecting ₹40 lakh as bribe from another accused in the case, Parminder Singh, allegedly on the behalf of the judge. The date of this ‘collection’ was stated to be April 17, 2013. The CBI court presided over by Gopal convicted 22 accused including Bansal and three FCI officials. But two accused Bachni Devi and Parminder Singh, who allegedly paid the bribe, were acquitted. The conviction order was passed in October 2013 in the 1999 case of embezzlement of ₹1.8 crore for which CBI had registered an FIR in 1999. The trial court judgment was subsequently challenged in the high court and is admitted for hearing. In August this year, Mangat Rai Bansal had filed a fresh plea seeking stay on conviction in view of the fact that the presiding officer who convicted him has been indicted in the departmental proceedings. He had argued that in 2017, he was denied ticket in view of conviction and now as assembly elections are slated for February 2022, conviction be stayed, so that he can contest assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/paddy-embezzlement-case-high-court-stays-conviction-of-former-mla-mangat-rai-bansal-101630944706140.html

National carrier, Air India, will fly to the Italian capital under its Vande Bharat mission, with London and Birmingham already connected to the world famous holy city. According to schedule that Air India has released, the flight AI123 will take off from Amritsar every Wednesday at 3.55pm, with arrival in Rome the same day at 8.20pm local time. The return flight AI122 will depart from Rome the next day, Thursday, at 7pm and reach Amritsar on Friday morning at 5.35am. The bookings will remain open till October 28, which is the end of summer season in airline industry. Air India will operate its Boeing 787 Dreamliner on this route.Sameep Singh Gumtala, global convener, FlyAmritsar Initiative, said, “The resumption of this flight has resulted with Italy relaxing restrictions on passengers arriving from India. This is a big relief for thousands of Punjabis, who got stranded due Italy’s decision to ban direct flights April 2021.”He added, “Those stranded had no other option, except to pay very high fares to travel via other countries, on regular or chartered flights, and complete quarantine requirements during the transit. This direct flight will now reduce cost, while also reducing travel time to seven-eight hours,” said Gumtala.Yogesh Kamra, member of the Airport Advisory Committee (AAC), said, “Amritsar is India’s only airport, directly connected to two airports in the UK. With the resumption of Rome flight, it will be the only airport in India, after Delhi, to be connected to three cities in Europe.”“Now, exporting perishable cargo needs to be a priority with the Punjab government and our farmers. The diaspora in the UK, Italy and other countries have a year-round demand for vegetables from the hinterland and this demand should benefit our local farmers. Air India and the district administration should set up a facility to source, sort and pack in-demand perishable vegetables and processed food,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amritsarrome-direct-flight-resumes-from-september-8-101630944645840.html

On Sunday, this age group accounted for 16.27 per cent of total cases of infections in the state while the figure stood at 17.32 per cent on Saturday.However, the daily positivity ratio stood at 0.93 per cent.Director of health services, Dr Bijoy Mohapatra, said there should not be any panic as the number of children who need hospitalisation is less than 1 per cent. “About 0.8 per cent of the infected children are in general beds of Covid hospital while 0.3 per cent are in ICU. No one is on ventilator yet,” said Dr Mohapatra.He said one also needs to analyse the infection rate among children below 18 years before pressing the panic button. “We are doing more testing for children below 18 years and have started a vigorous contact tracing of the children who came in contact with the infected ones. We are in the process of curating the total number of samples tested for those below 18 years and those who tested positive. Once we calculate the infection rate, that would give us a better idea of the spread of infection,” he said.Health officials, however, said there should not be any room for complacency regarding children as they have not been inoculated.Mohapatra said the ongoing serological surveillance on Covid-19 in Odisha will focus on those below 18 years as the rate of infection among children and adolescents.Though all previous serological surveys in Odisha were done among adults, the high rate of infection among those below 18 years was the reason for the current survey that is being carried out in 12 districts by the ICMR’s Regional Medical Research Centre in Bhubaneswar.ICMR officials said the seropositivity rate would generate evidence on the exposure of children and adolescents to the virus and help the government decide on the opening of schools. So far, schools in Odisha have been opened for students of Class 9, 10, 11 and 12 since July, but it is not compulsory for students to attend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/for-first-time-in-about-a-month-20-of-odisha-s-covid-cases-are-below-18-years-101630944644592.html

It was on August 12 that the high court had granted protection from arrest and directed the former DGP to join the probe within seven days. He was arrayed as an accused in an FIR registered on August 2, by the vigilance bureau under the Prevention of Corruption Act and criminal conspiracy. Other accused include Surinderjit Singh Jaspal, who owned a Sector-20 house in Chandigarh. The agency alleged Saini acquired the house in a fraudulent deal with fake documents and questionable financial transactions. Vigilance had submitted that instead of co-operating as directed on August 12, he is throwing tantrums.

Multiple health experts and education experts have pointed out the ill-effects of kids staying out of school for over two years and have recommended that schools reopen given that the school staff be fully vaccinated to ensure less risk for students as there is no approved vaccine yet for kids. Pune district has fully vaccinated almost 100% of the government school staff who got it under the frontline workers category earlier. However, more than 50% of private school staff is yet to be fully vaccinated. As per the district report, Pune district has more than 28,000 teaching and non-teaching staff in government schools of which 24,000 have got both the vaccines. However, of the 27,000 staff from private schools, only 11,000 have got both the jabs. Earlier, the rural administration had conducted special drives for school staff to ensure that they are fully vaccinated sooner. During a virtual programme, state paediatric task force head Dr Suhas Prabhu said, “Reopening of schools was crucial for the children psychologically although parents are still apprehensive about sending their kids to schools. Classrooms should be ventilated properly, crowding at buses, during lunch hours and at playgrounds must also be avoided and classrooms and toilets must be regularly and thoroughly sanitised. Schools must be equipped with pulse oximeters, thermometers and sanitisers to check kids daily.” As per the district health office, Pune district has totally 44,532 teachers and 11,657 non-teaching staff in both private and government schools of which 77.57% have got the first shot of the vaccine and 35,624 have been fully vaccinated which is 63% of the estimated population. As of now, no vaccine has been approved for kids and so the population aged below 18 continues to remain a vulnerable population. As of now, Covavax is undergoing safety trials for anti-Covid vaccine for kids aged 12-18 which would further go down to kids aged two years. PMC education officer Meenakshi Raut said, “We have 265 schools under the civic body and all of them have been vaccinated. We are fully prepared to reopen schools if the state government issues an order stating that. Our schools are equipped with pulse oximeter, sanitisers and other necessary materials to ensure that kids remain safe in schools as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/as-state-govt-mulls-to-reopen-schools-50-private-school-staff-in-pune-yet-to-be-fully-vaccinated-101630943743780.html

On the Muzaffarnagar Kisan rally, Majithia said “the farming community has given a clear signal to the central leadership in Delhi that it should be ready to face a people’s movement if it does not listen to the voice of the farmers”. He appealed to political parties in Punjab to also rise to the occasion and not use the flag of the kisan movement for their petty political ends. “This will only result in spoiling the atmosphere in the state and give an opportunity to the BJP-led central government to impose President’s Rule in Punjab,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/their-greed-for-power-knows-no-bounds-majithia-on-rebel-ministers-101630940866520.html

06-09-2021||Lucknow||Sedition case against ex-UP governor over remarks on Yogi government||Former Uttar Pradesh governor Aziz Qureshi has been booked for sedition over his alleged derogatory remarks against the state government, the police said on Monday. The FIR was lodged following a complaint by local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Akash Kumar Saxena at the Civil Lines police station in Rampur district on Sunday.Qureshi said his statement had been misquoted to harm him politically. The former governor visited the residence of senior Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Azam Khan on Saturday evening. Qureshi met Azam’s wife Tazeen Fatima, who is also the Rampur MLA. Azam Khan is currently in jail in several cases lodged against him after 2017 when the BJP came to power in UP.In his complaint, Saxena alleged that after visiting Khan’s house and meeting his wife, Qureshi made derogatory statements against the state government.Saxena alleged that Qureshi said, “The fight between Azam Khan and the state government is like the fight between man and shaitaan (devil).”Saxena also alleged that Qureshi had termed the government a “blood-sucking demon”.“The statement can create tension between two communities and create unrest in society,” Saxena said in his complaint.The BJP leader also handed over to police a pen drive containing Qureshi’s alleged statement which was aired by various news channels.Qureshi was booked under sections 153A (promoting enmity between two groups on grounds of religion, race), 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration), 124A (sedition), and 505(1)(B) (intent to cause fear or alarm to the public), a senior police officer said.“The FIR against Aziz Qureshi was lodged on the complaint of one Akash Saxena. Qureshi has been booked under sedition on the basis of the complaint made to the police. A team of the local police station is investigating the matter. We are also collecting video evidence of the incident for probe,” said additional superintendent of police (Rampur) Sansar Singh.Qureshi, 81, a senior Congress leader, had served as the governor of Mizoram from 2014 to 2015. He also had charge of Uttar Pradesh for some time in June 2014.On his part, the former governor said to the news agency ANI, “It is my right to oppose the policies of the government and I will fight for it till my last breath in a democratic way. My statement is being completely distorted to harm me politically and to mislead the public. I had said that there have not been as many atrocities in earlier days as today. I have not made any remarks against anyone.”“I did not make a statement against the government. I consider the government as my government. I consider the Prime Minister as the Prime Minister of the whole country. I consider the home minister, defence minister of the entire country. I consider the chief minister as the leader of the whole state. I have never lacked in his respect nor will do. We have a democratic right to oppose them, their policies and it is our democratic right,” Qureshi said.Clarifying the use of the word “shaitan” during his meeting with Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan’s wife, he said the word is used for a child too who bullies other kids.The former governor further raised questions against the charges of sedition against him, “Show me one word where I have talked about communalism or spreading communal hatred. A man who needs a wheelchair for his support, will he spread hatred?”Meanwhile, the Samajwadi Party (SP) came in support of the former governor. "Use of words by Mr Aziz Qureshi may not be in good taste but how on earth does his statement constitute the offence of sedition? Since when did CM Yogi become a state? Criticism of the government is not sedition, UP police need to keep in mind this basic fact. Indian Supreme Court has also expressed concerns about the misuse of the law. It has asked the Central government why is it not repealing a colonial-era law that was used against our freedom fighters. Rampant misuse of this law shows the anti-democratic character of the present UP government," said Abdul Hafiz Gandhi, SP spokesperson.(WITH AGENCY INPUTS)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sedition-case-against-ex-up-governor-over-remarks-on-yogi-government-101630939905855.html

Apart from the elderly person, the animal attacked a motorcyclist as well. The hyena was later found dead as it was suffering from some infection. It may have attacked people out of irritation due to the infection,” said Jayaram Gowda, deputy conservator of forests, Junnar division. Several forested patches in Khed tehsil are home to a number of hyenas, officials said. The elderly person attacked by the animal was hospitalised and is being monitored, said forest officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hyena-attacks-2-in-khed-tehsil-of-pune-district-animal-later-found-dead-101630939603981.html
06-09-2021||Pune||Ex-BJP corporator challenges party’s road widening decision||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to “wait and watch” after the Bombay high court directed the state government to determine former Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) corporator Ujjwal Keskar’s application within 10 weeks. Keskar has demanded that the PMC’s decision on the proposed widening of city roads from the existing six metre to nine metre be disposed of, which is interesting given that road widening is on the BJP’s own ambitious agenda.PMC legal advisor, advocate Nisha Chavan, said, “The Bombay high court has given directives to the state government to conduct hearing and take a decision on Keskar’s application within 10 weeks.”While the PMC completed the suggestions and objections process, it was delayed due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, former BJP corporator and office bearer Keskar took objection to the proposed road widening and approached urban development minister Eknath Shinde and urban development department officials claiming that the PMC’s decision is against the law and should be disposed of. Neither Shinde nor the department officials paid any heed apart from the fact that BJP MLA Chandrakant Patil and standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne were very aggressive about implementing the road widening decision. The party suffered a major setback however when Keskar subsequently filed a public interest litigation (PIL) against the state government in the Bombay high court.Keskar said, “The PMC decision proposing the widening of city roads from six to nine metre is unlawful and not useful for common people. It has been taken for developers and builders. So, I have demanded that the corporation’s decision be nullified. We first approached urban development minister Shinde and the urban development department but they did not consider the application. Finally, we filed a PIL against the state government. The court conducted the hearing last week and has issued an order to the state government.”Sudhar Kadam, executive engineer of the building permission and development department, said, “Due to the second wave of Covid-19, there were strict restrictions on meetings and people too were reluctant to visit the PMC office for hearing. So, we stopped hearing for some time. After easing of restrictions, we conducted the remaining hearing and completed it last month. Now, after the Bombay high court order, we will take legal opinion and prepare a final report which will be presented to the standing committee.”The PMC had appealed to citizens living in those areas where road widening was proposed to register their suggestions and objections. The PMC had proposed that a total 335 roads – 255 in the old city and 80 in the suburban areas – be widened. The civic body received both positive and negative responses from about 1,800 citizens. While a majority of the bungalow societies objected to the road widening, the PMC found that there were nearly no objections with respect to the widening of around 135 roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/exbjp-corporator-challenges-party-s-road-widening-decision-101630939483221.html

Last week, Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT), probing the 2015 Kotkapura firing case, had summoned Saini and Sharma to record their ‘voice samples’ at the CFSL laboratory. Besides, the SIT had also summoned suspended inspector general of police Paramraj Singh Umranangal, who also failed to appear. However, Umranangal was not asked to give voice samples. In June, the SIT had sought permission to conduct lie-detector tests on Saini, Umranangal and Sharma in connection with 2015 Kotkapura firing case. While Saini and Sharma had refused to undergo the lie-detector test, Umranangal agreed to undergo the test, subject to the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court. The SIT is waiting for the CSFL to give a date for the lie-detector test on Umranangal. After Saini and Sharma refused to undergo lie-detector, the SIT sought their voice samples for layered voice analysis (LVA) used for helping detect stress and other emotions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-kotkapura-firing-former-dgp-sumedh-saini-skips-date-for-filing-voice-samples-101630938163707.html

The former rebel was killed on August 13 in police action in his house.According to people familiar with the development, the weapon was seized by a police officer.

People cited above have informed that a thorough evidence-gathering exercise is being executed by East Khasi Hills police with the participation of other districts as well.Meanwhile, the enquiry into the incident is underway and is likely to finish within the stipulated time. A secretariat official aware of the matter expressed optimism that the process will complete well within three months from the date of notification.“Those tasked with the job of gathering evidence etc. are doing their job diligently and everything will be furnished before the Commission,” the official said while underscoring, “Very soon the truth will be unfolded. To be acceptable to any court, the investigation must be carried out in a structured way that abides by all legal rules and the appropriate processes of evidence collection.”The judicial commission was promptly constituted by the state government following public uproar over the controversial killing, leading to a curfew and a clampdown on data services in Shillong. The commission has been asked to ascertain the circumstances leading to the former rebel leader’s death and other terms of references.Notified on August 20, the government appointed a One-man Commission of Inquiry consisting of Justice (Retd) T. Vaiphei, former Chief Justice of the High Court of Tripura and chairperson, Meghalaya Human Rights Commission to inquire into the incident.The terms of reference are simple but specific; to hold an inquiry into the circumstances leading to the police action resulting in the death of the rebel leader and to submit a “fact-finding report as to the culpability or otherwise of the police action resulting in the death” of Thangkhiew.

Responding to leader of opposition (LoP) Harpal Singh Cheema’s “unfounded and baseless” allegations of spurt in crimes in the state, the chief minister said instead of picking up unverified data from here and there, Cheema could have approached the DGP to get the facts. “Cheema has once again proved that the AAP’s ideology is based on lies and fabrications, with all the leaders of Arvind Kejriwal’s party having become masters of deceit,” said the chief minister, adding that contrary to Cheema’s claims, only 38 cases of `kidnapping for ransom’ have been reported in the state since his government took over in March 2017. “Even those 38 (not 7,138 as claimed by Cheema) cases (0.5% of the total cases registered) relating to ‘kidnapping for ransom’ registered since March 2017 were solved, with release of the victim and arrest of the culprits in each of them,” said the chief minister. As the home minister of the state, Amarinder said, he would not mind giving a few quick tips to the LoP to save him similar embarrassment over his total ignorance in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/harpal-cheema-s-claim-on-punjab-crime-figures-unfounded-capt-amarinder-101630936243416.html

Officials said that the guidelines will be issued soon. They also added that the guidelines will include offline and online examination for students for consistent evaluation for the ongoing academic year. This year, the Maharashtra government cancelled Class 10 and Class 12 examinations in line with the similar step taken by the central and international education boards. However, unlike other boards that have issued guidelines for internal assessment, the state education department is yet to release the guidelines. With no guidelines in sight, principals and teachers fear that lack of uniformity in evaluation during the academic year may reflect during the final evaluation in case examinations are cancelled next year as well due to the pandemic. Harishchandra Gaikwad, president, Pune district principals’ association, said that guidelines are must to keep assessment of students consistent. “This year, students expected to appear in examinations and prepared for it. However, at the last minute, the exam was cancelled due to rising cases of Covid. Since there is no exam, many students are neglecting their studies and it can affect their learning process. If guidelines are given, students can seriously attempt the given assignments while teachers can also encourage students to remain serious towards their studies even if the classes are conducted online,” said Gaikwad. Students from Class 1 to Class 8 are assessed on the basis of continuous comprehensive evaluation (CCE) under the Right to Education (RTE). Under CCE, these students are evaluated on their performance throughout the year. However, the question of evaluation of students from Class 9 to Class 12 remains. Vikas Garad, deputy director of SCERT, said that the guidelines will be issued soon. “Till Class 8, students are to be assessed by the CCE. For Class 9 to Class 12, guidelines will be issued soon. This will help in keeping the result uniform for the students. Principals and teachers will have to take assignments and tests at class level for internal assessment in online as well as offline modes,“ said Garad. He said comprehensive directives will be issued soon where problems like dropout students, network issues in rural areas will be addressed in detail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/class-9-12-teachers-students-await-scert-internal-assessment-guidelines-101630935282848.html

All India Congress Committee will take the final call,” Chowdhury said.Congress had earlier announced that as a “courtesy” the party would not be fielding any candidate opposite Banerjee, which Chowdhury insisted was his “personal opinion” that needs to be rethought now that poll dates have been declared. “I had opined that as a gesture of courtesy Congress should not field anyone against the incumbent chief minister. It was my personal view then,” the Congress leader said.Also Read: Bhabanipur by-polls announced. Why is it crucial for Mamata Banerjee? 10 pointsThe Election Commission announced on September 4 that the bypolls for Bhowanipore, Samserganj and Jangipur constituencies will be held on September 30 and counting of the votes will be held on October 3.

The Tripura helpline follows a similar kind of campaign under the banner of ‘Didi Ke Bolo’ launched by West Bengal chief minister and supremo of Trinamool Congress Mamata Banerjee ahead of assembly polls in Bengal.The dedicated helpline service would help people share any kind of grievances and the same would be forwarded to the concerned government departments for redressal. If the caller is satisfied with their step, the call will be completed, else, the same will be again forwarded to the respective department, said chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb after launching the Helpline Number from IT Bhawan at Indranagar area in Agartala. “Initially the helpline was started in Dhalai district in August. Today, the helpline was started across the state from 8 am to 8 pm. It will become 24x7 service in the coming days. I expect cooperation from all,” Deb said at the launch. “This is a digital platform through which people can share their problems that will reach the CM. Besides, the state will listen to and implement any logical advice shared by people through this helpline,” he said. A team has been constituted from the Information Technology department to monitor the process, he added. After coming to power for the first time in 2018, Deb started Janatar Darbar (public’s court) both at Civil Secretariat and his official residence to listen to the problems of the people. After the launch, the CM talked to two people, one from Ranirbazar and the other from Indranagar. “My officials will not ask the callers’ political identity or anything like that. This culture of helping pro-power people only prevailed earlier. Now, I want to bring an end to this culture. Politics should be confined to poll time only and for the rest of the time leaders should be dedicated to people’s welfare,” Deb told the media persons. He also talked about different digital schemes, including Jan Dhan Account Yojana, Start-Up Tripura, Mukhyamantri Yuva Yojak Yojana, e-PDS, among others, that have been launched during the BJP-IPFT government reign so far. He added that they have increased the number of Common Service Centers from 394 in 2015-16 to 1,204 to take governance to people’s doorstep. Reacting to the newly-launched CM Helpline, Trinamool Congress termed it a political gimmick before the assembly polls. “The BJP first started their missed call helpline as part of their 2018 assembly poll campaign. They have always launched different kinds of helplines every day since 2018, unfortunately, none of it was fruitful. We doubt how far this CM helpline will work. Let’s see its implementation,” said TMC leader Subal Bhowmik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tripura-launches-cm-helpline-to-address-people-s-grievances-101630934384681.html

The initiative is part of the district administration’s exercise to curb vector-borne diseases. The administration released a dedicated helpline number – 0522-4523000 to ensure all possible help to patients, similar to what the ICCCC did during the peak of Covid cases. The ICCCC would ensure hospitalisation of the patient, depending upon his/her condition while patient could also avail ambulance service by calling 108.“As we all know that cases of dengue or other vector-borne diseases are on the rise, we have made all possible arrangements to tackle the situation.

The DM said certain protocols had been introduced for people as per which if patient suffering from fever can call on the ICCCC helpline number. “On receiving the call, the executive at the ICCCC would ask for some vital info from the patient like mobile number and address. The trained executive would contact the nearest community health centre to get the dengue test done at the earliest,” the DM said. The administration would also ensure anti-larvae fogging and sanitisation in the area of the dengue patient. The ICCCC would cater to those who need blood or platelets by connecting them with the team of doctors and hospitals in order to meet the requirement, said the DM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid-command-centre-to-assist-dengue-patients-101630933843576.html
06-09-2021||Chandigarh||Ayurveda vs allopathy, making a case for empathy||Flagbearers of both the streams of medicine, ayurveda and allopathy, are often at loggerheads. Claims and counterclaims are made; blames and accusations are exchanged only to assert the supremacy of one stream over the other. The common man, like an undecided voter, is sitting on the fence, trying to make up his mind before taking sides. The main cause for his confusion is that he is equally dependent on ancient and modern science. From getting up in the morning and drinking a glass of lemon water with honey to taking tulsi (basil leaves) and adrak (ginger) tea to drinking kadha (a herbal concoction of commonly used spices) to taking isabgol husk, turmeric milk and chyawanprash at night, the common man follows the traditional wisdom of the scriptures with faith and reverence. Whereas, when it comes to falling prey to an illness, he takes a giant leap of faith and doesn’t think twice before consulting a doctor, well versed in the modern system of medicine. He follows the advice of the doctor verbatim and doesn’t mind going the extra mile to avail the services of the best and the latest in the field of medicine. The common man knows better than the flagbearers to make the most of both the systems. At the time of Independence, the life expectancy of an Indian was only 31 years. Ancient medicine was there but antibiotics had yet to emerge on the horizon and save mankind from the fury of frequent epidemics. With the advent of broad-spectrum antibiotics, anti-malarials and antiviral drugs and remarkable advances made in the field of cardiology, surgery and oncology, we can look forward to living up to the autumns of our lives healthily and comfortably. There should be no controversy between the ancient and modern systems of medicine. Peaceful coexistence of both the ‘pathies’ is the need of the hour. A light-hearted WhatsApp message, sent by my friend, well illustrates the importance of both the systems of medicines in our lives. It averred that ancient science takes care of us like a mother who nourishes us to live a long and healthy life by following the principles of traditional wisdom, while the modern system is like our spouse whom we can’t afford to offend even for a day. As the war of words between the flagbearers of the two ‘pathies’ rages on, I’m reminded of the words of US Republican leader Bill Bullard, “The highest form of knowledge is empathy.” And my fellow clinicians would definitely agree that this ‘pathy’ never fails. rajivsharma.rs201067@gmail.com The writer is an Amritsar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ayurveda-vs-allopathy-making-a-case-for-empathy-101630933723390.html

The Jal Sansthan had earlier conducted an extensive survey of seven zones of the city which had reported to have repeated problems of potable water supply. The survey found that the seven zones needed new water pipelines and the total length of which would be 77.2 km, said officials.General manager (GM), Jal Sansthan, Harishchand Balmiki said these localities include Kareli, Atala, Alahapur, Daraganj, Alopibagh, Malviya Nagar, Dariyabad, Sadiyapur, Lukerganj, Mumfordganj, Transport Nagar, Katra, Kanhaipur, Rajroopur and areas of Naini and Phaphamau. “We will not only replace the damaged or dilapidated pipelines but will also lay water pipelines in the areas which are devoid of the same at present,” said the official. Earlier, GM had sent a proposal to the Prayagraj Municipal Corporation that has now been approved. The project would cost around ₹15 crore and the work would start this week itself. As per the details, zone 1 (Khuldabad) would be getting 22.07 km of water pipelines, zone 2 (Muttiganj) 11.66km, zone 3 (Katra) will get 14.53km of water pipelines while zone 4 (Allahapur) will be getting 13.69km of pipelines.

The Centre, as well as the state government, is spending a huge amount to tide over the crisis. The state government has spent more than ₹10,000 crore on Covid management,” he argued. Talking to media persons after the customary Janata Darbar—a routine event where people can meet the CM and raise their grievances against the system—Kumar said that the state has been incurring heavy losses owing to the recurring floods. The CM said that the water resources department (WRD) was carrying out studies about the scope of interlinking of small rivers to minimise the scale of devastation due to recurring floods. “The WRD is exploring the scope and discussing ways to interlink small rivers. Nearly 57 lakh people have been hit by the current spells of floods, which is not over yet. All the concerned departments have been asked to stay alert to meet any eventuality,” said the CM, adding that he had visited many flood-affected areas over the past few weeks. In an apparent justification of the government’s reluctance to step in and curb inflation, Kumar said that the government’s top priority was to eradicate the pandemic and at the same time carrying on with its development agenda. “People must stay away from raking up the issue of price rise owing to the difficult times the country is grappling with. Everything would be normal once the Covid thing is gone,” said the CM. Regarding the state’s plea for conducting the caste-based census, Kumar said that he had nothing more to say on it, as the Centre was required to take a call on it once they (leaders from Bihar) had discussed the issue with the PM. “It will benefit all sections of the society and in no way fan hatred,” added Kumar. Earlier at Janata Darbar, a girl from Samastipur had accused a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) of sexually exploiting her and said she resorted to raising the issue before the chief minister after her attempts to lodge a case against the cop aborted by the department’s officials. A widow from Valmikinagar in West Champaran alleged that the police were not taking action against local Janata Dal (United) MLA Rinku Singh, on whose behest her husband was killed in February this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/price-rise-would-come-under-check-once-covid-issue-is-over-bihar-cm-101630930065668.html
06-09-2021||Other||Lakshadweep turns to seaweed farming||Large-scale farming of indigenous seaweeds has been launched in Lakshadweep under the guidance of premier marine research body Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) headquartered in Kochi.After fisheries, coconut farming and tourism, the Lakshadweep administration has prioritised seaweed farming as the major engine of development. Seaweed is consumed in many countries, especially in East Asia. It is also used in food additives, medicine, fertiliser and cosmetic goods and to combat beach erosion. The initiative is in line with a study conducted by the CMFRI which found immense potential for quality seaweeds in serene and pollution-free lagoons for high-end utilisation like pharmaceuticals, food and nutraceuticals, said CMFRI in a statement. It is planning a production of about 30,000 tonnes worth ₹7.5 million in a year. In line with the new plan, a farming demonstration of seaweeds was launched in nine inhabited islands. The CMFRI said the indigenous red algae, Gracilaria edulis and Acanthophora spicifera, are some of the species being planned in nearly 2500 bamboo rafts which will benefit 100 families belonging to about ten women self-help groups “Traditionally known for its unique tuna fish, beautiful corals, reef fish and other creatures, soon the islands are likely to be known as the seaweed farming hub of the country,” said Dr K Mohammed Koya, a senior scientist with the CMFRI. Recent studies by the CMFRI revealed a big growth of indigenous seaweed species in various lagoons of Lakshadweep with nearly 60-fold growth in 45 days for species like Gracilaria edulis. Following this, the island administration joined hands with the CMFRI for multi-locational trial farming and capacity building of stakeholders. Experimental farming was conducted in the islands of Kiltan, Chetlah Kadmath, Agatti and Kavaratti during 2020-21 with good results, said CMFRI. “Our studies revealed that the island has a potential of producing nearly 30,000 tons of dry seaweed per year worth ₹7.5 million by farming only 1% (200 ha) of its 21,290 ha of lagoon area (inhabited islands only),” said Dr Koya. To provide a sound scientific basis for sustainable seaweed farming, the CMFRI and the Lakshadweep Krishi Vigyan Kendra began further studies for assessing the carrying capacity of the lagoons, spatial mapping of suitable farming sites, standardising farming methods for year-round farming in deeper areas and ensuring quality seeding materials, said the CMFRI. The serene islands were in news for all wrong reasons recently as a section of residents protested three draft regulations brought in by new administrator Praful Khoda Patel, saying they will affect the unique culture and tradition of the island. They opposed the move to make the island a tourist destination besides the ban on cattle slaughter, the two-child norm for local body members, liquor licence, goonda law and other new rules. But BJP leaders from the island said some vested interests were stoking the fire and provoking local people to stall developmental projects on the island.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lakshadweep-turns-to-seaweed-farming-101630927182800.html

He flagged the sudden spike Kerala is witnessing after Onam celebrations ended and warned Maharashtra might face a similar fate "Kerala is seeing a spike of 30,000 cases daily. This is a danger signal and if we don't take it seriously, Maharashtra will have to pay a heavy price," he said on Monday.Maharashtra’s daily tally of cases has been stable for quite some time now but capital city of Mumbai has been witnessing a sudden surge, the city reported 495 cases on Sunday, the highest since July 15.The state is gearing up for Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations which is set to start later this week and Thackeray has cautioned citizens to avoid crowds and abide by proper Covid-19 preventative norms as cases rose after celebrations concluded last year. "There was a surge in Covid-19 cases after festivals last year. I request all to avoid crowding. Wearing a face mask is important even after vaccination," he said on Sunday during an interaction with doctors.Thackeray urged political parties to prioritize the well-being of citizens as festivals can be celebrated later when the pandemic is under control. “We can celebrate festivals later. Let us prioritise the lives and health of our citizens. The situation can go out of hand in view of the spike in daily cases," Thackeray said in a statement. "Who would like to impose restrictions on festivals and religious programmes? But people's lives are important," he added.Also Read:Maharashtra lists 7 ‘districts of concern’, Mumbai also faces Covid spike"We have to avoid crowding...have patience. We should not be required to close the places which have been opened up now," he said, adding, "people should know that the enemy is yet not completely defeated...the thick tail is still there."Thackeray also warned political parties for demanding temples be reopened across the state. "Do not agitate for reopening of temples but do it against Covid-19," he said on Sunday without naming any particular political outfit.His remarks came after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) protested against the closure of temples in the state. In October of last year Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari had written a letter to Thackeray criticising the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s decision to keep temples closed as the state was reeling under the coronavirus pandemic.“I wonder if you are receiving any divine premonition to keep postponing the reopening of the places of worship time and again or have you suddenly turned ‘secular’ yourselves, the term you hated?” Koshyari had written.Thackeray hit back at the governor for his comments in a letter. “Do you mean that opening up religious places is Hindutva, and not opening them means being secular? Secularism is a crucial base of the oath you took as Governor. Do you not believe it?” the chief minister had written.Thackeray also gave a roadmap for relaxing Covid-19 norms in the state, asserting that restrictions will be eased on the basis of oxygen availability, he requested individuals to abide by proper norms, noting that citizens can help prevent or invite a 'third wave' of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/keralas-spike-a-dangerous-signal-maha-cm-urges-citizens-and-political-parties-to-avoid-crowding-during-festivals-101630923247119.html
06-09-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal emerges champion in fight against Covid-19: Modi||Himachal Pradesh has emerged as a champion in the fight against Covid-19, the worst pandemic in a century, by vaccinating 100% of the eligible population with at least the first dose, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday. He was virtually addressing the people of the state after interacting with frontline coronavirus warriors and beneficiaries of the vaccination drive. Also read: Afghanistan, terrorism, Indo-Pacific, climate change on Modi’s US trip agendaCongratulating people of the state, the Prime Minister said that Himachal Pradesh became the first state in the country to have achieved the feat. Not only this, but the state has also vaccinated one-third of its population with the second dose of the vaccine, he said. Himachal’s success has not only boosted the self-confidence of the country but also highlighted the importance of self-reliance, he said. India administering 1.25 crore doses daily Modi said India was creating records by administering 1.25 crore doses daily, which was much higher than the entire population of some countries. “The success of India’s vaccination drive is the result of the hard work and courage of its people and a reflection of “sabka prayas (collective effort)” that I spoke about from Lal Qila on the 75th anniversary of India’s Independence,” said Modi. After Himachal, Sikkim and Dadra & Nagar Haveli also achieved the mark and many states were nearing the target. “Now we have to make efforts to ensure that those who have taken the first dose also get the second jab. This pill of self-confidence is the root of Himachal’s fast vaccination. Himachal trusted its own capabilities and its health workers and scientists of India,” said the Prime Minister. Lauding the spirit of the state’s health workers, ASHA, angawad, teachers and other people involved in the combat against Covid-19, Modi appreciated the contribution of women to the vaccination campaign. He interacted with frontline workers, including Dr Rahul, who hails from Gujarat and is posted in remote Dodra Kwar, Dayal Singh from Thungag of Mandi, health worker Nirma Devi, who carried out the vaccination campaign in Malana. Besides, he talked to Karmo Devi, who created record by vaccinating 22,000 people and worked despite a fractured foot and beneficiary Nirmala Devi, 84. Reaching out to remote areas He said Himachal braved tough terrains and lack of logistics to carry out the vaccination drive. He said in rural Himachal, faith in deities is an integral part of life. Citing the example of the remote village of Malana, Modi said health workers took “Dev Samaj” in confidence before carrying out the vaccination. The same strategy worked in the remotest parts whether it was Shimla’s Dodra Kwar, Kangra’s Bara and Chotta Bhangal or Bharmour and Pangi in Chamba. “This shows how faith, education and science can change life,” he said. Protecting forests, solution for landslides The Prime Minister said that the Centre has relaxed rules related to the use of drone technology and this would benefit the state in protecting and conserving its forest resources. “To find a scientific solution to the problem of landslides, we need to promote research related to an early warning system and also devise a construction technology suitable for the hills,” he said. He also spoke about Himachal’s success in the Jal Jeevan Mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-emerges-champion-in-fight-against-covid-19-modi-101630917462951.html

The bridge was under construction for the last 2 years since its partial dismantling in 2019 and is considered vital for free flow of vehicular traffic in Dombivli. “The bridge is ready and it will be set open to vehicular traffic on Tuesday after the inauguration ceremony,” said an officer of Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), requesting anonymity. The bridge was shut on September 15, 2019 for vehicular traffic after it was declared unsafe by the Central Railway (CR). In April 2020, the slab of the bridge was dismantled and the railways undertook the work of repairing the girders and laying a new slab. A senior KDMC official said the reopening of the bridge will lead to easing of 70% traffic. She also insisted that the repair work was done in “record” time.“The actual work on the bridge began in April 2020 and we managed to finish it within a record time of 16 months. Initially, it took time to begin the work due to required permissions and tendering process,” said Sapna Koli, city engineer, KDMC.Rs12 crore was spent on its construction with the Central Railways and KDMC each sharing 50% of the total cost. “The opening of the bridge will be a major relief to the commuters. The work went on for over two year, people had to use narrow lanes to commute, leading to congestion,” said Ajay Desai, 36, a commuter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dombivli-railway-over-bridge-in-thane-to-reopen-for-commuters-on-tuesday-101630917461705.html

The reaction in the form of an editorial in the Marathi daily comes a day after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders from Mumbai demanded an unconditional apology from Akhtar. Akhtar, also a former member of Parliament, made the comparison during an interaction with a news channel (NDTV) last Friday. “Just like the Taliban want an Islamic State, there are those who want a Hindu Rashtra. These people are of the same mindset -- be it Muslim, Christian, Jews or Hindus,” he said. “Of course, the Taliban is barbaric, and their actions are reprehensible, but those supporting the RSS, VHP and Bajrang Dal are all the same,” he added.Also Read | Maharashtra aims to vaccinate 20mn in September to ‘prevent or delay’ 3rd waveThe Sena mouthpiece said though Akhtar has been speaking openly about fundamentalism and fanaticism, we do not agree with the comparison between RSS and Taliban. “Countries like Pakistan and China where democracy doesn’t exist are backing the Taliban in Afghanistan because human rights and democracy have no place in these countries. But India is a democratic country and respects an individual’s freedom. India is tremendously tolerant in every way... so it is erroneous to compare RSS with the Taliban,” it said. It added, “Iran had Khomeini rule and now Afghanistan has the Taliban rule. Linking Hindutva to these two rules is disrespectful towards Hindu culture.”The editorial added that Hindutva is a “culture” for organisations such as the RSS and VHP. “RSS and VHP want that the rights of the Hindus should not be suppressed. Moreover, they have never imposed any restrictions on women’s rights. The situation in Afghanistan, however, is gut-wrenching. People fled from their country out of fear, and women’s rights are being suppressed,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/likening-rss-to-taliban-disrespectful-to-hindu-culture-sena-to-javed-akhtar-101630912961366.html

06-09-2021||Patna||CM launches work on Patna’s 1st double-decker flyover on Ashok Rajpath||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has laid the foundation stone of a 2.20km double-decker flyover from Kargil Chowk to NIT more on the congested Ashok Rajpath with a view to give a seamless vehicular access to the upcoming Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), the biggest in the country in terms of bed capacity. A sum of ₹422 crore is likely to be spent on the first double-decker flyover which would take three years to complete. Addressing the gathering on the occasion, CM Kumar said on Saturday that road infrastructure across the state has undergone a sea change since he took over at the chief minister in 2005. “Road travel to one locality to another was a nightmare. But there has been development of a string of flyovers and network of wide roads over the years,” said Kumar. Also Read | Mithila’s cultural symbols on special postal covers unveiled in DarbhangaReferring to salient features of the double-decker flyover, to be built by Gurugram-based Gawar Construction Limited, the CM said it would have two access points, connecting to the PMCH, and its terminal point would be linked with under construction four-lane Ganga Pathway that connects Digha with the upcoming six-lane bridge near Patna City. “PMCH is being developed as a state-of-the-art hospital with 5,400-bed capacity. Those willing to go to Patna city can take Ganga Pathway rout after the flyover to avoid traffic congestions on Ashok Rajpath,” said Kumar. Upon its completion, the Kargin Chowk-NIT more section of flyover would be the second double deck flyover in Bihar after the one under construction at Chapra. Deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad that Kumar was carrying on with the vision of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, whose vision for development of the golden quadrilateral and other road projects would be remembered as major step forward in terms of communication infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cm-launches-work-on-patna-s-1st-double-decker-flyover-on-ashok-rajpath-101630909960933.html

Two brothers belonging to the rival family were arrested. The families of Sandeep Chandoliya’s and Vicky’s have a longstanding enmity over raising pigs.

Pakistan and China, which are not democracies, are backing the Taliban in Afghanistan because human rights do not have any place in these two countries. However, we are a democratic nation where an individual’s freedom is respected. Hence, it is erroneous to compare the RSS with the Taliban. India is tremendously tolerant in every way,” a Sena editorial in Saamana said.Hindutva is a “culture” for organisations such as the RSS and VHP, the editorial said. It added, “RSS and VHP want that the rights of the Hindus should not be suppressed. Moreover, they have never imposed any restrictions on women’s rights. The situation in Afghanistan, however, is gut-wrenching. People fled from their country out of fear, and women’s rights are being suppressed.”The paper described Akhtar as someone who is known for his “outspoken” statements and has also attacked extremist views of the Muslim society. “However, comparing the Sangh with the Taliban is not acceptable. Most people in our country are secular and will not accept the Taliban’s ideology. India is proudly secular despite Hindus being the majority community,” it said.Speaking to NDTV last Friday, Akhtar had compared the RSS and VHP to the Taliban. “Just like the Taliban desire an Islamic State, there are those here who want a Hindu Rashtra. They have the same mindset, be it Muslims, Christians, Hindus or Jews. What the Taliban is doing is barbaric, of course, but those supporting the RSS, VHP and Bajrang Dal are the same. However, India will never become a Talibani country because majority of the people in our country are extremely tolerant and decent,” the former parliamentarian had remarked. Akhtar’s remarks didn’t go down well with several people, including Ram Kadam of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the ideological mentor of which is the RSS. Kadam, a BJP MLA, has warned Akhtar’s films will not be allowed to release in Maharashtra till he issues an apology. A Mumbai-based lawyer, too, has filed a police complaint against the lyricist.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/comparing-rss-with-taliban-is-disrespectful-to-hindu-culture-shiv-sena-on-javed-akhtar-101630903428824.html

06-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi likely to get some rain on Monday: IMD||Delhi is likely to get some rain on Monday as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast drizzle for the day with partly cloudy skies over the national capital.The minimum temperature in the city on Monday is likely to be 27 degrees Celsius while the maximum temperature is predicted to reach 35 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature was 33.9 degrees Celsius on Sunday and the minimum temperature was 25.8 degrees Celsius.With IMD forecasting another intense rain spell over Delhi and adjoining areas between September 6 and 10, this could be one of the wettest monsoons for the city in at least over the past decade, IMD scientists and weather experts said. Compared to the normal monsoon rain of 552.6mm, Delhi has already recorded 988.4mm rain so far, a 79% surplus.Independent weather experts too said monsoon has behaved a bit oddly this season. From dry spells to intense rain, it has been oscillating from one extreme to another.“The dry spells were mainly because both the frequency and intensity of low-pressure systems that form over the Bay of Bengal, which bring rainfall to different parts of the country, were too low. The systems that formed in between brought the heavy spells. September, however, is going to be good in terms of more spells of rain not just in Delhi, but the whole of northern plains and central India,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, Skymet, a private forecaster.Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality was in the moderate category on Monday morning. Data from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed that the hourly air quality index (AQI) at 7 am stood at 115. On Sunday, the average 24-hour AQI was 88, which is in the satisfactory category.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe, as per CBCB..On Sunday, the Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar) said, “Delhi’s AQI is in the satisfactory category due to dry condition leading to dust re-suspension with low ventilation and is forecasted to remain in the satisfactory category for the next three days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-likely-to-get-some-rain-on-mondayimd-101630897779941.html

It is expected to handle waste from Gurugram and Faridabad.But the basics are ignored. The Solid Waste Management Rules require segregation, composting and recycling. Neither Faridabad nor Gurugram follows this.If done in a decentralized way, only about 20% of the waste would leave the wards. Of this, dust and similar components comprise 15%, unsuitable for burning.Should the rest 10%, including multi-layer packaging, not be either recycled via investments in new technologies or landfilled till they are substituted?We know from the Capital’s experience at the Okhla WTE plant, that it’s very hard to monitor pollution.Pollutants, including the deadly Dioxin, are tested once in four months. The results arrive several weeks later. In the interim, it’s business as usual. Nothing changes if it is fined.This and the proposed Gurugram plant can harm us all, even if we live elsewhere: pollution travels.

Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Gupta flagged off the yatra which will culminate in Palwal on September 13, after passing through all 22 districts of the state. The yatra is being organised in solidarity with farmers protesting against the three farm laws passed by the Union government.After paying tributes at the statue of peasant leader Chhotu Ram, Gupta began the yatra from Rohtak. The Rajya Sabha MP said the yatra will cover Bhiwani and Charkhi Dadri on Sunday itself.“On September 6, it will cover Jhajjar, Sonepat and Panipat and, on September 7, it will be in Karnal, Yamunanagar and Panchkula. Ambala, Kurukshetra and Kaithal will host it on September 8, a day before Jind and Hisar. On September 10, the yatra will pass through Fatehabad and Sirsa and, two days later, Faridabad, Gurguram and Rewari. On the final day, it will go to Mahendragarh and Mewat before reaching Palwal,” he told reporters.Slamming the Haryana government, Gupta said the state government has rewarded IAS officer Ayush Sinha for his remarks on farmers by transferring him instead of terminating him.“The BJP government has backed the IAS officer for giving instructions to break the heads of farmers who were protesting in Karnal last month. Instead of solving the farmers’ grievances, the BJP government has been resorting to canecharge.

The state government’s decision to continue applying brakes on holding physical classes in universities comes even as schools in Haryana were reopened for primary classes 4-5 last week. Middle, high and senior secondary classes in the state were opened in mid-July. Earlier, the state government had advised the vice-chancellors (V-Cs) of universities in the state to plan reopening of universities from the next academic session and share the programme with the departments concerned. While extending the lockdown--Mahamari Alert-Surakshit Haryana--till September 20, the government directed the V-Cs to continue conducting classes online till October 15. “The decision to allow students to attend classes physically in residential universities will be taken on October 15 after assessing the prevalent Covid situation,” chief secretary Vijai Vardhan said in an order.

The universities were also directed to share the vaccination progress with the department of higher education, technical education and medical education and research as the case may be. The university/colleges will remain open for students for doubt clearing, practical classes in laboratories, practical examinations and offline examination. The government has also allowed hostels (in colleges and universities) to open for students appearing in examinations. Meanwhile, relaxations like opening of restaurants, bars, malls, clubhouses and shops permitted earlier will continue. The government has allowed the cinema halls, restaurants and bars (including in hotels and in malls), gyms and spas, club houses, restaurants, bars and golf courses to open with 50% seating capacity. In indoor spaces, gathering of up to 50% of the hall capacity is allowed with a ceiling of maximum 100 persons while in open spaces, up to 200 persons can assemble subject to strict Covid norms.

06-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The bamboo screen seller||The neighbourhood is very posh, very quiet. Only occasional bird sounds waft through the hushed air. The residences on either side of the lane project a confidence as secured as a castle with moat.Then Puranchand steps in.“Chickwale, chickwale,” his shrill, raspy voice drowns out a bird’s twittering. The grey-haired man looks around, and repeats his call.In his 60s, Puranchand sells chicks, the slatted bamboo screens that so subtly sieve the daylight streaming inside the house through doors and windows. A few of the street vendor’s chicks are rolled up on his shoulder, and others are stacked in his bag. Puranchand walks the whole day long in central Delhi localities. One day he might be in Defence Colony. The next day it could be Bhogal. This afternoon he is in Hazrat Nizamuddin East, some distance away from filmmaker Mira Nair’s apartment.“I used to sell cane chairs and mooras when I was young,” he says, recalling how easily he would pedal a heavy cart loaded with furniture for long hours daily. But as he grew old, and his body became frail—he says—he gave up the cart and started hawking the chicks. That was about eight years ago. Living in distant Paharganj, he commutes to this part of the city by bus. “I have a DTC (Delhi Transport Corporation) pass.” Puranchand doesn’t need to work out of compulsion, he points out. He lives with his two sons, both of them have jobs, and they repeatedly urge him to retire and enjoy life at home.“But what will I do within the house,” he asks. “For how long can one stare at the wall or watch TV?” He pauses to recollect his thoughts. “The moment you stop being active, you start to catch all kinds of illnesses.” Besides, his working life has helped fill his years with so much variety, he feels. “I started as a book-binder… worked in that line for 16 years.” There were hardships along the way but he confronted them, he says. For instance, “my mother died when I was eight.”Puranchand now looks around and, again loudly proclaims in his street-hawker-voice: “Chickwale, chickwale.”No window opens. He walks ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-bamboo-screen-seller-101630872690768.html

In some cases, the regulatory requirements have been reduced to a form and submission of a copy of the Aadhaar document, said a senior state government official.“The Delhi government has streamlined 478 services since April and eased the process for obtaining documents as part of its policy aimed at ensuring hassle-free access to various government services,” said a senior government official.The services streamlined so far involve 30 government departments (including revenue, education, food and civil supplies, transport and health), the three municipal corporations and the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC).“It has been possible because the compliances were handled by the city government irrespective of the department of agency handling the delivery of the service,” said the senior government official.A second government official said, “The state identified 596 government-to-business and government-to-citizen services for simplification, rationalisation and digitisation — largely through doing away with compliances. The aim is to reduce the time and cost burden on individuals availing government services. Work on simplification of more service compliances is underway”Residents welcomed the move and said the minimised paperwork had made application processes easier.“I got my learners’ driving licence done last month by filling up just one online form and submitting a digital copy of my Aadhaar card. I didn’t need to submit any separate address proof, passport-size photo, etc. In 2019, I tried to apply for the learner’s licence but the process required around four to five documents and filling up a lengthier form...Thankfully, it is much easier now,” said Ishita Verma, a resident of Pashim Vihar.Government records said of the 478 services, in which compliances have been reduced, 75 are connected to NDMC, 160 are related to the three municipal corporations, 30 to the transport department, 17 of the Delhi Jal Board, 10 of the revenue department and the rest spread among other departments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/documentation-reduced-for-478-public-services-in-delhi-101630872082408.html

As per the appointment orders issued on Sunday, Ramachandran was posted as principal secretary, transport, in addition to additional director general of police, crime against women. The home minister had objected to the proposal of appointing an IPS officer on a cadre post designated for IAS officers, citing IAS cadre rules which required the state government to take prior approval of the Central government under rule 9 (2)(c). The home minister had also said that the IPS officer should not be relieved from the police department and posted to a cadre post of IAS officers till the department of personnel and training (DoPT) of central government grants approval in this regard. ‘CM does not agree with the home minister’Ordering the appointment of IPS officer, chief principal secretary to the CM, DS Dhesi wrote that the CM does not agree with the home minister. Dhesi also wrote that prior approval of the Central government will be taken if it is proposed to continue the IPS officer who is a non-cadre officer beyond a period of three months. Chief secretary Vijai Vardhan too had raised objections on appointments of non-cadre officers to the cadre posts of the IAS. Vardhan had communicated that if the appointment of nine non-cadre officers (IPS, IFS and IRS) to the cadre posts of IAS has to continue, then the state government should seek mandatory approval of the central government or replace them with IAS officers. The central government had also sought the comments of the Haryana government on the issue after the state government had appointed nine Indian Police Service (IPS), Indian Forests Service (IFS) and Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officers to the cadre posts of IAS. Rule 9(2)(c) of the IAS Cadre Rules state that if a select list is not in force and it is proposed to appoint a non-select list officer, the state government shall forthwith make a proposal to that effect to the central government together with the reasons thereof and the appointment shall be made only with the prior approval of the central government. The rules also state that a cadre post in a state shall not be filled by a person who is not a cadre officer except if there is no suitable cadre officer available for filling the vacancy. Also, if it is proposed to continue the person who is not a cadre officer beyond a period of three months, the state government shall obtain the prior approval of the central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/khattar-overrules-vij-to-appoint-ips-officer-as-transport-secretary-101630871918167.html
06-09-2021||Chandigarh||HP govt faces flak as free langar service at IGMC ‘forcibly’ shut||The BJP government is drawing flak from the public and Opposition for shutting down the langar being run by Shimla-based philanthropist Sarbjeet Singh Bobby’s charity organisation, Almighty Blessings, at the Cancer Hospital. On Saturday evening, the philanthropist, who goes by the name of Vella Bobby, said the police had forcefully vacated the langar hall and had thrown utensils and food on the road. The langar has been running without a break since October 25, 2014, and has provided free food to around 3,000 people daily, including patients who come to the Cancer Hospital for treatment and their attendants, he wrote. Bobby, who has just had a kidney transplant, said he will not be able to stage a protest as he was still recovering. “I surrender... Vella Bobby is no more Vella,” he wrote. Meanwhile, IGMC senior medical superintendent Dr Janak Raj said the hospital did not have a problem with charity work, any organisation, or a person. “However, this cannot be done by encroaching on hospital property. We had been receiving complaints against the concerned organisation,” he said. Dr Raj said when they visited spot on Saturday it was found that the electricity and water connection at the langar hall were illegal. “Patients have the first right on hospital property and the IGMC administration is committed to provide best of services to them. No hospital anywhere has an arrangement for running charity on its premises. Everything has been done in accordance with law,” he said. Deputy medical superintendent Dr Rahul Gupta said the langar was being run adjacent to the radiology department where a cobalt machine had been installed. “In 2016, a LPG cylinder had caught fire at the langar hall, had it led to a radiation leak, it would have resulted in casualties,” he said. Dr Gupta said the charity group was asked to vacate the premises several times but they did not pay heed. Shimla superintendent of police Monika Bhutungru rubbished the charge of use of police force. “The langar hall was vacated by IGMC authorities and the police force was deployed there for maintaining law and order,” he said. Different Opposition parties have come in support of Bobby. CPI (M) leader and former Shimla mayor Sanjay Chauhan said, “The way they vacated the langar premises through use of force was very unfortunate. If the langar was illegal, how was it running for so long in the hospital complex?” he asked. Congress legislator Vikramaditya Singh also organised a protest at The Ridge against the IGMC administration and police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-govt-faces-flak-as-free-langar-service-at-igmc-forcibly-shut-101630871799511.html

The accused Abhishek Malik had allegedly shot dead his property dealer father Pradeep Malik, mother Babli Devi and maternal grandmother Roshni Devi at their house in Vijay Nagar in Rohtak, while his 17-year-old sister succumbed to bullet wounds at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences two days later. He was arrested on September 1.Interacting with mediapersons, Rohtak deputy superintendent of police (DSP, headquarters) Gorakh Pal said the accused had confessed to killing his family members. “His family was opposed to his same-sex relationship. He was planning to flee abroad after getting money from his family. His parents had called his maternal grandmother to convince him against undergoing the gender-change surgery.”The DSP further said, “The accused had been planning to eliminate his parents for the last 20 days. We have recovered the illegal pistol and mobile phones used during the murders. The accused claimed that the pistol was brought by his father from his friend, which is illegal. We have also recovered some jewellery that he had stolen after killing his family members. His plan was to make it look like a robbery,” the DSP added.The DSP said the accused first shot at his sister, then maternal grandmother, mother and father.“After the crime, Malik threw the pistol into a canal and then went to a hotel near Delhi bypass to meet his friend. They drove on the Delhi road before stopping for lunch but he did not eat anything. After dropping his friend, Malik called his maternal uncle, saying that his parents were not picking up his calls and he was worried for them. Then he went home, called his neighbours and rushed his sister to PGIMS, where she died two days later,” said the cop.The accused Malik had done a cabin-crew course from Delhi, where he came in contact with his male friend. He later enrolled in a B.Com course through distance learning mode. The DSP headquarters said, “We will produce the accused in court on Monday. So far, we haven’t found anything to point to the involvement of his male friend in the crime. But we aren’t giving the friend a clean chit yet.”Accused’s social media follower count goes upThe accused’s Instagram follower count has gone up from 700 on September 1 to 3,259, at the time of filing of the report on Sunday. Another account named after him saw the follower-count crossing from 17,000 on September 4 to 18,000 on September 5. In one of the pictures posed on the account, the 20-year-old youth was seen carrying a pistol while his father, who was seen seated next to him, looked on. A senior police official, who is part of the investigation, said they aren’t aware of the rise in follower count.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rohtak-youth-killed-his-family-as-they-refused-money-for-gender-reassignment-surgery-cops-101630871498153.html
06-09-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal logs 96 fresh Covid cases||Himachal Pradesh recorded 96 fresh coronavirus infections on Sunday, taking the state’s tally to 2,14,504, while the death toll mounted to 3,595 after two patients succumbed to the contagion. Of the new cases, 22 were reported in Kangra and Mandi, 14 in Solan, 12 in Shimla, 11 in Bilaspur, five each in Hamirpur and Kullu, four in Chamba and one in Una.Active cases came down to 1,633, while recoveries reached 2,09,258. Kangra is the worst-hit district since the virus outbreak last year with 47,865 cases, followed by Mandi and Shimla districts with 3,00,48, and 26,733 cases, respectively. 12K women in SHGs helped HP govt combat Covid: Kanwar With the demand for face masks rising due to the coronavirus pandemic, 12,000 women self-help groups across Himachal Pradesh have helped with the containment efforts by stitching masks. Around 400 members of 38 SHGs affiliated to the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) were involved in making breathable fabric masks, which also helped them earn some money. Training on making medicated and sanitized face masks to SHG women members was provided through virtual mode by rural development department officials under National NRLM, said rural development minister Virender Kanwar. He said the government also roped in Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI) to provide training to SHG members to meet the growing demand of face masks during first phase of lockdown in March 2020 when sudden surge in demand escalated prices and created big gaps in demand and supply. The SHG started working on a war footing for sewing 3-layer surgical non-woven cloth masks as recommended by the Health Department which helped stabilizing prices and meet the demand. “Around 12000 women of the 1500 SHGs associated with NRLM have produced around 40 lakh low-cost masks till August 2021,” said Kanwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-logs-96-fresh-covid-cases-101630871378296.html
06-09-2021||Lucknow||BJP launches intellectual meets across UP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) launched its prabuddh varg sammelans (intellectual meets) across Uttar Pradesh on Sunday.At one such meeting in Varanasi, chief minister Yogi Adityanath appealed to Kashi’s scholars to find an alternative to impart education to a large number of students, who lack gadgets like tablets and computers, if the Covid-19 pandemic stretches for long.At another meet in Ayodhya, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh targeted the Congress for coining the word “Hindu terror” and the SP for allowing firing on kar sevaks in Ayodhya in 1990. The intellectual meets launched on Sunday from various places across the state would continue till September 20.Making the appeal about students’ education in Varanasi, Adityanath said: “I visit flood-affected areas daily. During my visit to a flood-affected area, I met a student and asked him in which class he studied. The student informed that he attended school up to fourth standard and stopped going to school thereafter as the school was closed (due to Covid-19). He doesn’t go to school anymore.” “We can impart education to the children belonging to well-off families equipped with digital devices. But a large number of children belong to the financially weaker section. These children lack mobile phones, tabs or laptops. For these children, I want to appeal all the teachers to find an alternative to provide education to children, if the pandemic lasts long. Think, if the guru-shishya parampara (tradition) may be an alternative or teachers may visit students’ villages and teach them,” he said. Stating that schools cannot be closed for long time, he said despite that there must be preparedness to deal with any situation. He also said that before 2017, people used to say that there was goonda raj and corruption in UP and no one could free it from these problems. But his government had changed the perception about UP, the chief minister said.Now people in other states believe that UP’s law and order is the best in the country, he added. Without mentioning any opposition leader, Yogi said, “The people who used to avoid visiting the temples in Kashi, Mathura and Ayodhya, now they are competing to visit the temples.”Yogi said that after independence in 1947, UP’s per capita income was equivalent to nation per capita income. But by 2016, it decreased to one third. Several steps have been taken and in days to come, the per capita income of UP will increase, he said. In Ayodhya, Swatantra Dev Singh said, “... the Samajwadi Party leadership had okayed firing on karsevaks in Ayodhya in 1990. That firing was actually on the nationalistic and cultural ideology of the nation.” Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya was in Kanpur for the ‘prabuddh varg sammelan’ while UP BJP in-charge Radha Mohan Singh was in Prayagraj. UP co-general secretary (in-charge) Karamvir was in Saharanpur, BJP’s national vice president Rekha Verma was in Chitrakoot, national general secretary Arun Singh was in Mathura. Other leaders present for the event at various places across the state included national secretary Vinod Sonker (Agra). Several union ministers including Sanjeev Balyan (Ghaziabad), VK Singh (Meerut), Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti (Jhansi), Bhanu Pratap Verma (Moradabad), Kaushal Kishore (Noida), BL Verma (Bareilly), Pankaj Choudhary (Gorakhpur), Ajay Mishra (Shahjahanpur) also addressed these meetings. BJP leader Subrat Pathak, who is in-charge of these intellectual meets, said they would be held in all 403 assembly constituencies of the state.The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) too has similarly named its Brahmin outreach campaigns across the state as ‘prabuddh varg sammelans and BJP leaders admit that in their meetings too, Brahmin community leaders would participate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-launches-intellectual-meets-across-up-101630871258317.html

The protesters sat on the dharna after they came to know of the meeting that was to be presided over by saffron party’s OBC wing chief Rajinder Bitta. The meeting, however, was held somewhere else in the town, said BJP district president Randeep Singh Deol. The move comes in the wake of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s call to focus only on BJP and not heckle leaders of other political parties. Farmer union’s district president Amrik Singh said the BJP leaders were holding secret meetings amid the ongoing agitation against the three controversial agriculture laws. “We will not allow the BJP leaders to organise meetings in any part of the district at any time,” he added.The protesting farmers said the BJP leaders’ attempts to hold such meetings will only disturb peace in the state.“It is our democratic right to hold meetings. We successfully held the meeting and discussed various issues,” Deol said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-stage-protest-against-bjp-meeting-in-sangrur-101630871139514.html
06-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab thermal power plants running out of coal||Thermal power plants in Punjab are staring at a severe shortage of coal as most of them are left with fuel reserves that will last only for a few days or for more than a week. With this, the state has also missed out on an opportunity to generate revenues by selling electricity to the national grid where power prices are rising by the day. The stock dwindled due to heavy floods in the eastern states that supply coal to the thermal plants in Punjab, say officials. As per details, the situation at the 540 megawatt (MW) Goindwal Sahib plant run by GVK Industries is most alarming as the fuel reserve there is for only 3 days. The government-run 920 MW Guru Hargobind thermal plant at Lehra Mohabbat, in Bathinda and the 840 MW plant in Ropar have stock left for only 4 and 8 days. Also, the situation at Vedanta’s 1,980 MW plant at Talwandi Sabo and L&T-run 1,400 MW power plant at Nabha is no better as the two are left with coal reserve for 9 and 11 days, respectively.As per the power purchase agreement (PPA), the power generation companies — both government and private — have to maintain a stock for at least 28 days. But the minimum prescribed amount of stock is never maintained due to laxity of the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL). A corporation official said, “Due to shortage of coal, we have already shut the PSPCL-run power plant to conserve coal. We have asked the private companies to increase their coal stock, according to the PPA.” “Earlier, we used to sell power to the grid in September and October when electricity prices remain high. We are missing out on the chance to make profits as both the government and private plants have inadequate coal reserves. At times, the power prices soar past ₹10 per unit and it is a good opportunity for us to generate revenues. It is a failure on part of the corporation management to anticipate the situation and stock coal as per the set guidelines. The PSPCL made nearly ₹300 crore profit by selling power in the past years,” the official added.PSPCL chairman-managing director (CMD) A Venu Prasad admitted that the situation at the GVK-run plant was alarming. “But we are managing by exploring all possible means. The situation is likely to improve by the next week as we are hopeful of arrival of more supplies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-thermal-power-plants-running-out-of-coal-101630871137967.html

06-09-2021||Chandigarh||PU researchers devise tech to purify air & water through green waste||Researchers at Panjab University’s Centre for Nano Science and Nano Technology have devised a technique to purify air and water through food waste and crop remains. The waste management project was handed to Dr Bharat Bajaj, who is UGC assistant professor at the centre, by the department of science and technology (DST), Chandigarh. Dr Bajaj and his team have developed a technique to extract cellulose from food waste that can then be used to deal with water and air pollution. The final report of the project has been submitted recently to DST.Dr Bajaj, who was engaged with various research institutes of South Korea for 10 years, worked on this project along with Dr Pragati Gahlout from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi and Dr Dhiraj Sud from Sant Longowal Institute of Engineering and Technology. He said the municipal corporation had been segregating wastes, but it was still difficult to manage and utilise these properly. Also, burning of crop remains in Punjab and Haryana is also a big concern as it pollutes the air, not only in Chandigarh, but also affects its quality in the national capital region (NCR), he added. “Our team came up with an idea of extracting cellulose from green waste and making membranes out of it. We managed to do so from food waste and rice straw,” he said. “We have developed a more eco-friendly and single-step technology to extract cellulose from waste. The extracted cellulose was coated with copper oxide and other nanomaterials and converted into a film form. The cellulose membranes showed significant performance in water purification within 10 to 15 minutes. These films could also be used for air purification along with water decontamination,” he added.This technology is cheaper as compared to others as it only includes cost for cellulose extraction, he said. Cellulose extraction takes three hours and membrane processing completes in eight to 12 hours. Dr Bajaj said, “If we want our farmers and industries to build and use such devices, then technology should be simple. This technology could facilitate our farmers and industries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-researchers-devise-tech-to-purify-air-water-through-green-waste-101630870298046.html

06-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Vegetable prices fall as supply stabilises||With the improvement in supply, vegetables prices have also started to drop at city’s apni mandis.As per officials of the Punjab Mandi Board, the new harvest of vegetables such as tomatoes and green chillies has started, which is why the prices have begun to drop. “Earlier, tomatoes and green chillies were brought to the city from Himachal Pradesh and other areas. With the price of fuel factored in and due to low supply, the prices had increased,” said Satbir Singh, supervisor with Punjab Mandi Board.Rate of tomatoes which had started increasing last month has fallen down from ₹40/kg to ₹25/kg. Green chillies have become cheaper as these are being sold at ₹50/kg as compared to previous ₹70/kg. The rate of onions which are coming from Indore is between ₹30- ₹40/kg, while price of red onions from Rajasthan stayed consistent at ₹25/kg. There also hasn’t been enough rain in the region in the past few weeks that has also helped local farmers, said the supervisor, who added that heavy rainfall ends up spoiling many vegetables which also didn’t happen this time. It is expected in the coming days that the price of vegetables will fall down further as more leafy vegetables such as cabbage will start arriving at the mandis, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-vegetable-prices-fall-as-supply-stabilises-101630869459220.html

These teachers are also demanding the withdrawal of de-linking of UGC pay scales. All the constituents of PFUCTO would participate in the chain fast at the same venue on rotational basis till all demands are met by the Punjab government, they said. PUTA in a statement said, “Punjab government’s decision to de-link the UGC pay scales is another assault on the young teachers that will eventually marginalise teachers of Punjab from the national mainstream.” Various student bodies are already on indefinite strike at PU for the past three weeks, demanding immediate conduct of polling for the senate’s graduate constituency and reopening of the campus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ugc-pay-scales-teachers-sit-on-chain-hunger-strike-at-pu-101630869458041.html

06-09-2021||Chandigarh||Protesters bring Shatabdi to halt near Zirakpur||Kalka-New Delhi Shatabdi was stopped in Baltana near Zirakpur on Sunday morning by protesters who had been demanding a railway under bridge for the past five years to ease traffic congestion. Zirakpur station house officer (SHO) Onkar Singh Brar said the track was cleared within 10 minutes, after which the protesters moved alongside the railway line. The protest was led by local Congress leader Pratap Singh Rana on the track near Harmilap Nagar in Baltana at crossing number 123. “For the past five years, residents of 36 colonies here have been demanding a railway under bridge to ease traffic congestion. Neither the Railways not the local administration has so far acted on the pleas owing to disagreements between them. Every time a train crosses from here, the junction remains closed for 15 minutes, causing traffic bottlenecks and delays, especially in the mornings.”Meanwhile, Zirakpur police said that they are investigating the matter and no case has been registered yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/protesters-bring-shatabdi-to-halt-near-zirakpur-101630869217957.html
06-09-2021||Chandigarh||PGIMER: No appointment slots for a week at most OPDs||In just four days after the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) resumed the online appointment facility for its out-patient departments (OPDs), slots in most of the departments have been booked for this week. Walk-in consultations continue to remain suspended. Patients can also get an appointment after tele-consultation, but only if the doctor thinks it is required.Till at least September 13, no appointment slot is available at the general surgery; dermatology, venereology and leprology; ophthalmology (eye); orthopaedics, otolaryngology —head and neck surgery, and urology departments. At the internal medicine department, which sees the highest footfall, all slots have been booked for the entire month. However, patients can book a slot to consult doctors at gynaecology, obstetrics, oral health sciences (dental), paediatric surgery and plastic surgery departments this week. Online appointments and walk-in consultations were suspended in March last year after the Covid pandemic broke out. Since then, the institute had been providing OPD services through tele-consultation. From June 21 this year, physical consultations were resumed, but only after prior appointment through tele-consultation. On September 1, the online appointment facility was also resumed, but with a cap of 30 patients per department per day. Patients can book slots for only the next 30 dates.‘Cap of 30 patients too low’Before the contagion, over 10,000 patients visited OPDs at the PGIMER daily. But now, only 2,000- 2,500 are being called per day.“On September 3, I tried getting OPD appointment at the orthopaedics department, but could get dates only after September 10. The patients are not able to get immediate dates for consultation and tele-consultation is of no help”, said Varinder Kaur, a resident of Punjab.Rajvinder Singh, a patient from Chandigarh, said: “I wanted to consult doctors at the general medicine department, but no slot is available for booking. Now, I am trying hard to book an appointment through tele-consultation but the phones do not connect easily. The authorities should increase the cap of 30 as it is too low.”“We have put a cap on the number of patients to avoid crowding, as it can further spread Covid-19 infection and invite the third wave,” said PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram. “We know hundreds of patients try to call doctors for tele-consultation at a time and only a few are able to connect, but we have no other option than to open OPDs in a phased manner.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pgimer-no-appointment-slots-for-a-week-at-most-opds-101630869158061.html
06-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Tertiary-treated water supply project set for revamp||With water conservation on its mind, the Chandigarh municipal corporation has started the process to revamp the recycled (tertiary-treated) water supply system across the city.The project aims to increase supply from 6 MGD (million gallon per day) to 20 MGD, which is the current demand in the city. “More than 14 MGD of drinking water supply currently being used for horticulture and other similar purposes can be saved through an upgraded tertiary-treated (TT) water system. Increased use of this recycled water can conserve groundwater and canal water and save on pumping energy,” said NP Sharma, MC chief engineer and chief general manager of Chandigarh Smart City Limited.TT water is the sewage water that has undergone a cleaning process to make it suitable for watering lawns and parks as well as irrigating fields. It involves chemical treatment and sedimentation process that improves the quality of the wastewater.Under the Water Bylaws 2015, the MC had made TT water connection mandatory for all houses with an area of 1 kanal and above.However, it was way back in 1990 when the civic body had started laying pipelines for supplying the recycled water, initially in Sectors 1-12 and 16. At present, almost 80% of the city has been covered in terms of pipelines, but only around 2,000 of the 7,000 eligible houses are being provided TT water. Residents have, for long, complained of erratic supply and foul smell in the water.Biggest expansion in peripheral areasAccording to initial plans prepared by the MC engineering department, the proposed revamp project is likely to cost around ₹80 crore.It envisages modernisation of the entire TT water supply system. “The existing network requires an upgrade. Government institutes, particularly schools, and some southern sectors that have been left out so far will also be covered,” said an MC official privy to the development.The biggest expansion will take place in peripheral areas. “Providing TT water for agriculture and related activities is one of the major objectives of the project. All villages will get the supply. It will reduce the dependence on groundwater to a large extent,” said the official.For improving the quantity and quality of TT water, five sewage treatment plants (STPs) – Diggian, Dhanas, 3BRD, Raipur Kalan and Raipur Khurd – are being upgraded at a cost of ₹530 crore. “Expected to be upgraded by 2022, the STPs will provide 54 MGD of TT water. The contamination level will also go down as the STPs will have the latest technology,” said the official.Meanwhile, in a bid to improve the water quality, a supervisory control and data acquisition centre has been created, which will become fully operational by the end of this week. “The existing pipelines have been equipped with sensors, which will monitor the water pressure and quality with live feed,” said NP Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhtertiarytreated-water-supply-project-set-for-revamp-101630868558426.html

06-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: CHB to spend ₹643 crore on IT Park housing scheme||The Self-Financing General Housing Scheme coming up at the IT Park will cost the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) around ₹643 crore. The CHB has prepared a proposal regarding the expenditure, which will be placed for approval before the CHB board of directors during its meeting on September 8. Only after the approval, the housing board will start further work on the project. The CHB has applied for environment clearance, while the design of the scheme has also been sent to the Plan Approval Committee.The general housing scheme is planned at Plots No. 1 and 2 of IT Park. Spread over 16.6 acres, it comprises 728 dwelling units of different categories: 28 four-bedroom, 448 three-bedroom and 252 two-bedroom flats.“While working out the tentative cost earlier, the land cost of ₹70,424 per square yard was taken as per the collector rate on September 2017. Now, collector rates have been revised. As on April 23, 2021, the rate is ₹1.42 lakh per square yard for vacant land. It is ₹14,034 per square foot for ground-floor apartment, ₹12,474 for the first floor and ₹11,695 for the second floor,” said a CHB official privy to the development. A four-bedroom flat is likely to cost nearly ₹2.75 crore, three-bedroom flat ₹1.9 crore and two-bedroom flat ₹1.3 crore. Only after the board approves the cost estimates for the project, the CHB will finalise the rates of flats. A presentation about the scheme was given to UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on July 21, 2020, and was approved in principle.The UT administration has given the CHB exemption from constructing houses for economically weaker sections (EWS) in this pocket, subject to the condition that its constructs EWS houses equal to 15% of the dwelling units at a separate location. These EWS flats are proposed to be constructed at Sector 54, for which land has already been allotted, but encumbrance free physical possession of land is yet to be handed over to the CHB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-chb-to-spend-643-crore-on-it-park-housing-scheme-101630867537883.html
06-09-2021||Delhi||Arms smuggler held, 15 pistols seized, say Delhi Police||The special cell of the Delhi Police has arrested a 39-year-old man who allegedly procured illegal arms and ammunition from Madhya Pradesh and supplied them to criminals in Delhi, the National Capital Region, other parts of Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. He was nabbed near Modi Mill in South Delhi on Friday, the police said, adding that they seized 15 semi-automatic pistols and 30 cartridges from him.The arrested man, identified as Ishab, has been booked under Section 25(8) of the Arms (amendment) Act, 2019, which provides for a 10-year minimum sentence that can be extended till life, said deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah.This is the second seizure of illegal firearms and ammunition in Delhi by the special cell between September 1 and September 3. In the first operation, 58-year-old Ram Krishan Singh alias Master, a habitual trafficker and supplier of illegal firearms and ammunition from Bihar, was arrested with 200 cartridges with five pistols that he had brought to the city to deliver them to criminals of Delhi-NCR. Singh was previously arrested in 2018 with 407 cartridges that were meant to be supplied to Maoists in Gadchiroli in Maharashtra, the police said.In the latest operation, Ishab was arrested after the special cell team received information that he would be delivering a consignment of arms and ammunition to his contact in Delhi on September 3. Ishab’s interrogation revealed that he had received the supply of the seized pistols and bullets from a supplier in Khargone in Madhya Pradesh.“Ishab told us that he purchased one pistol between ₹10,000 and ₹12,000 and sold it for ₹20,000 to his counterparts or criminals in Delhi-NCR, Haryana and western UP. He has been into the illegal trade for the past three years and has supplied over 500 pistols in Delhi-NCR alone,” added Kushwah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/arms-smuggler-held-15-pistols-seized-say-delhi-police-101630867417933.html
06-09-2021||Mumbai||No end to struggle for Covid widows in Maharashtra||Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, more than 15,000 women in Maharashtra have lost their husbands. Most deceased patients were primary earning members of their family, thereby exposing hundreds of families to financial constraints and forcing widows to knock on doors for help or raise money through crowdsourcing. Even children from some of these families are struggling to continue with studies due to monetary crisis at home. Social activists said this situation has once again revealed the gender disparity in the work culture in Indian society.On April 18 this year, Nagpur resident Sunil Kundale, 43, succumbed to Covid-19, leaving behind his wife Deepali and two children —one-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son. Kundale worked as a manager in a local coaching centre. In the first week of April, he contracted Covid-19 and most of his savings were spent on hospital treatment which has now left the family penniless. Later, Dr Amit Thadhani, a surgeon in Mumbai, helped the family financially for their education. Deepali who has no work experience is now hunting for a job amid the ongoing pandemic. “I have never worked before, so I don’t have work experience which is essential to get a job in this market. As most of the businesses are still in loss due to the pandemic, I am unable to get a job in small companies. I have just a few thousands left in my bank account to feed my family,” said Deepali. “We were living happily, but never did I know that this pandemic will turn our lives upside down,” she added.In another instance, Sunita Mahate, 35, a resident of Beed, lost her husband Vishal to Covid in May. Within a few days, her father-in-law also succumbed to the infection. Now, the responsibility to take care of two children and an aged mother-in-law has fallen on her.“My husband used to work in a factory in Nashik. However, last year due to the pandemic, the factory closed down and my husband became jobless. Then he started working with my father-in-law as a farmer here (Beed). This helped us to sustain through the first wave. But now as both of the breadwinners have died, I don’t know how to support my family,” Sunita said while sobbing.The family has a debt of ₹32,000 from a local money lender who is pressuring her for the money. “I have a little gold which my father had given me during our marriage. I will have to sell it to pay the debt. I may also have to sell the farmland to feed my family, but I don’t know what I will do later,” she added. Dr Zabird Hussain Usmani, Unani doctor from Cheeta Camp, Trombay, succumbed to Covid-19 on May 26, 2020. The 51-year-old doctor used to run a clinic in his locality and also worked with the government ambulance service — 108 — in the morning as an emergency doctor to attend to Covid-19 patients. He is survived by two children and a wife who is a homemaker.After his death, the family went to their hometown in Uttar Pradesh as they didn’t have any money to sustain. To support the family financially, the eldest son Aadil, 18, decided to quit studies and start working to earn money for the family. But thankfully, in May, after almost a year of his father’s death, the state government paid the medical insurance amount of ₹50 lakh to the family.“My mother is illiterate, so she wouldn’t have gotten a decent job to support us. So, I had decided to leave my studies to start working. I have a younger sister to support. After my father, they are my responsibility. But now, the compensation amount would help us to survive,” said Aadil.In the past 18 months of the pandemic, it has been observed that men develop more health complications due to infection from Sars-CoV-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19 — than women. As of September 2, 3,857,202 men contracted the disease in the state compared to 2,626,373 women. The epidemiological findings reported across different parts of the world indicated higher morbidity and mortality in men than women.As per the initial report available with the state woman and child development (WCD), as many as 15,124 women have lost their husbands in the pandemic. Another data provided by the department shows that in total 13,540 fathers lost their lives while 1,763 mothers succumbed to the infection in the state. Both the cumulative figures will rise further as the district-wise accumulation of the data is still under process. Medical experts cited several factors behind the gender gap such as higher expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 — receptors for coronavirus — in men than women, immunological differences and X chromosome. “Lifestyle differences also play a contributing factor, like higher levels of smoking and drinking among men compared to women. Also, it has been observed that women follow better preventive measures such as frequent handwashing, wearing of face masks, and stay-at-home orders. Though further studies are required to establish these possibilities,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital.Gender inequality in employmentMeanwhile, women’s rights activists raised the need to make women financially independent. As per the World Bank, 65% of women in India are literate as compared to 80% of men. India has among the lowest female labour force participation rates in the world with less than a third of women – 15 years or older –working or actively looking for a job.Dr AL Sharada, director of non-profit organisation Population First, agreed. “Hefty medical bills really exhaust families of their savings. Many of the families from middle- and lower-income backgrounds don’t even have medical insurance. In such a situation, it drains off their incomes. There is no economic security net for women who are completely dependent on their husbands. Women need to be financially independent even after their marriages,” she said. Aspire For Her (AFH), a social start-up, launched #NotAlone in May to support women from across the nation impacted by the loss of their spouses or parents due to Covid-19. In response to an email, AFH said, “If women had been financially independent, then they would have been far more equipped to support themselves and their families. It would have definitely helped financially, but maybe the women also would not have felt so insecure.”A spokesperson from AFH said women who have approached them for help come from diverse educational backgrounds like graduates and postgraduates. Many of these women have management, pharma and law degrees. There are a few who are qualified as teachers. “We are conscious that each woman who has signed up with #NotAlone has reposed faith in us, even though she probably feels betrayed by everyone else, including her loved ones who left her behind. When we started out on this journey, we knew that we could not let her down,” said Reema Sen, co-founder of AFH and lead of #NotAlone.Dr Sharada also highlighted that often homemakers are not well informed about their husband’s investments or savings. Many widows need hand holding as they were not involved in their husband’s business management. “Financial independence also needs to include financial literacy. We have had cases where even working women are facing trouble in getting access to their husband’s assets because their names were not included in bank accounts, insurance nomination forms or there was no will,” read the response sent by the AFH.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-end-to-struggle-for-covid-widows-in-maharashtra-101630867301037.html

His friend Rafajat was accompanying him in a Maruti Suzuki Ertiga. As they reached the national highway near Sherpur, three men on a motorcycle intercepted them, claiming their car had hit them.A quarrel ensued and the trio tried to snatch the driver’s car key and the ₹60,000 kept in the vehicle. As the complainant and his friend resisted, the accused attacked them with an iron rod, vandalised their car, and fled with their mobile phone and cash.“We have lodged an FIR under Section 379-B (snatching) of the Indian Penal Code against the unidentified accused. Police are trying to identify them with the help of nearby CCTV cameras,” said ASI Rajesh Kumar, who is investigating the case for Moti Nagar police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/trio-on-bike-snatches-ludhiana-man-s-60-000-mobile-phone-101630867298211.html
06-09-2021||Mumbai||Newer clinical signs of Covid: Hearing problems, dry mouth||Difficulty in hearing, dry mouth and reduced saliva secretion, long-lasting headaches are some of the newer symptoms of Covid-19 infection. Doctors are also seeing patients coming in with gastrointestinal problems, pink eye, conjunctivitis, rashes and skin irritation. “Gastrointestinal symptoms have been closely associated with the Delta variant of the virus,” said Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force member Dr Rahul Pandit, while making a presentation at a conference chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday. “In many cases, patients suffering from diarrhoea did not suspect that they had Covid-19 and by the time they were diagnosed with the infection, they spread it to the entire family,” he said, adding that extremely dry mouth and stubborn headaches are also some of the symptoms that may go ignored. He added that doctors have to be vigilant about such newer presentations in addition to the classic Covid-19 symptoms such as cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, fatigue, loss of smell, loss of taste among others. Experts at the conference said the profile of fever in Covid-19 patients differs widely. While some patients present with only one episode of fever, others may have recurring episodes with gaps. Dr Suhas Prabhu, member of the state’s paediatric task force, said children have been less impacted during both waves. “However, the fear that they may be disproportionately impacted in the third wave arises from the fact that they are unvaccinated. If schools are opened, their exposure will increase,” he said, adding that schools must avoid contact sports, not let children share lunch boxes and emphasise on distancing. “Parents should not send their children to school if they have even minor symptoms or are feeling unwell,” said Prabhu. Medical experts stressed on use of masks to prevent infection. Task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said wearing masks is the biggest weapon that we have against Covid-19. Pandit also echoed the same thoughts. “We must stay vigilant and not take Covid lightly in order to fight the virus,” he said, adding that the public should wear masks all the time, and have at least two to three fresh masks on them. “If the mask becomes wet due to humidity, it will not serve the purpose.

The police also seized from the man an SUV he bought for ₹21 lakh, of which ₹19.5 lakh was financed.The arrested man, Shakeel Alam, duped a multinational financial services company of nearly ₹15.40 lakh using four of the company’s credit cards that he got using fake identification documents. The company filed a complaint at the Saket police station and a cheating and forgery case was registered on August 25, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur, adding that Alam was arrested on Saturday.“Alam spent huge amounts over a very short period using the credit cards and submitted forged cheques to pay the bills. When the cheques bounced, the company tried to contact him on the residential addressed he had mentioned while applying for the credit cards. However, he could not be found on those addresses. Since Alam used fake IDs, his real identity was also not known,” said Thakur.Thakur said Alam, a resident of south Delhi’s Khanpur, studied till Class 10 and worked as a mason, fitting tiles and building false ceilings for the past three years. He set up two private firms to get work contracts and opened seven bank accounts in the name of his family members and those working with him, passing them off as employees in his firms. “Alam collected IDs, such as driving licences and passports, through the internet and used them to apply for credit cards after filling online applications. He took houses on rent in posh colonies in Lajpat Nagar and Malviya Nagar for a short period and used the addresses to get the cards issued there. Alam vacated the addresses after the credit cards were delivered,” said Thakur.To hide the money trail, he got cash after swiping at petrol pumps, Apart from obtaining credit cards, Alam also used the forged IDs to open bank accounts and used cheques to pay the bills. To improve his credit worthiness, Alam used to pass off his relatives and friends as employees of his fictitious firms, and reported that they had high salaries. He then made fake accounts using their IDs and shifted money between these accounts to keep up the credit scores for these fake employees. He then secured more loans using their credit numbers. “He recently purchased an SUV worth ₹21 lakh. Of the total, ₹19.5 lakh was financed by a bank because of his good credit score,” added Thakur.Police said investigations are on to find out if anybody else was involved in the fraud, and his bank accounts are being examined to ascertain the number of financial institutions he targeted and how much he duped them of.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-arrest-mason-for-credit-card-fraud-seize-his-suv-101630867117851.html

06-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai among 5 Maharashtra districts with most active Covid-19 cases||Highlighting the rise in Covid-19 patients in Maharashtra’s “districts of concern” over the past 10 days, state authorities have expressed fear of a third wave to begin from these areas in western Maharashtra. Active cases in Mumbai, too, are on the rise. Of the state’s 52,025 active patients, 37,897 (72.84%) are from five districts — Pune, Thane, Satara, Ahmednagar and Mumbai.During the Majha Doctor (My Doctor) conference of family doctors on Sunday, the public health department’s additional chief secretary, Dr Pradeep Vyas, made a presentation before the medical fraternity, comprising members of the state-appointed task force. Chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the conference organised by the state government was meant for a discussion with family doctors, ahead of a potential third wave. The presentation stated that the 10 days have not seen any drop in cases, while the number of active cases during this period has slightly increased. After clocking the weekly positivity rate below 5% in all the districts for the past few weeks, Pune and Ahmednagar have crossed the mark this week at a positivity rate of 6.58% and 5.08% respectively. Mumbai has, after three weeks, joined the top-5 group of districts, in terms of active patients.. 90.61% active patients are from ten districts, remaining five being Sangli, Solapur, Ratangiri, Kolhapur and Sindhudurg. The state authorities have termed Pune, Ahmednagar, Satara, Solapur, Sangli, Rantagiri and Sindhudurg as districts of concern. “The growth rate and weekly positivity rate in these districts are too high. Pune has clocked the highest — 6.58% positivity rate — while it’s more than 5% in Ahmednagar. With the Ganesh festival, beginning from Friday, celebrated on a large extent in these districts, there are chances of the third wave initiating or the cases in second wave increasing from these districts. The district administrations need to take utmost care in these districts,” said Dr Vyas. Of the 44, 437 patients reported in the past 10 days, 68% or 30,313 patients are from five – Pune (22%), Ahmednagar (17%), Satara (11%), Solapur and Mumbai (9% each), while remaining (32%) patients are from 30 districts. After reporting consistently fewer cases below the 400 mark for 38 days, from July 25 to August 31, Mumbai has been reporting over 400 cases daily for the past five days. 495 new cases were reported on Sunday. He, however, said that the second wave in 17 of the remaining districts seems to have subsided. Seven of them have less than 10 active patients, while in 11 the number of active patients ranges between 11 and 100. Most of these districts are in Vidarbha and Marathwada. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said government’s priority is to avert the third wave or even if it struck the state, the endeavour would be to reduce its intensity. “We have increased the number of beds, but the question is whether we would be able to supply the oxygen required for the patients. Almost 80,000 patients during the peak of the second wave required oxygen. Our attempt will to ensure that the requirement of the oxygen does not go beyond our local generation of 1,400 metric tonnes per day. We have been presently producing 1,400 MT a day, of which 350 MT is used for Covid and non-Covid patients daily. There is a brief rise in the daily caseload in last few days, but our endeavour is to bring it down to zero,” he said. Dr Mehul Mehta, who is a senior fellow at Harvard Global Health Institute, said that masks and vaccinations were effective tools to keep the infection at the bay. He said that the southern part of the United States has been witnessing high number of cases because of low vaccination and resistance from the citizens for the Covid appropriate behaviour. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state appointed task force, said that the state government is aggressively implementing vaccination drive in Dharavi, as there was possibility of the antibodies among people there to have reduced. “During first wave, our Dharavi model was appreciated across the globe and despite the delta plus variant during the second wave, daily caseload there could not cross 20 on any given day. But the antibodies among people there is expected to have gone down in Dharavi because of which vaccination drive in Asia’s largest slum is being aggressively implemented. Masking and vaccination are two effective tools to avert the third wave or reduce its intensity. The people who have already been infected and have been fully vaccinated get their antibodies increased by double,” he said. Dr Joshi said that there was no need to worry about C 1.2 variant found in South Africa as it has been seen in just seven countries and the number of cases of the variant is not more than 100.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-among-5-maharashtra-districts-with-most-active-covid-19-cases-101630867002521.html
06-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi health dept orders appointment of anti-discrimination officers for HIV||The Delhi health department has asked its offices to designate a representative to deal with complaints of discrimination against those with HIV/AIDS in accordance with a central law that came into force three years ago. Under this law, all offices — government and private — with more than 100 employees (20 in case it is a health care establishment) must designate such an officer. However, not only has there been a delay in Delhi in appointing complaints officers within government offices, the state is yet to appoint an ombudsman — a person with quasi-judicial powers to take action against organisations discriminating against people with the viral infection. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Act, passed in 2018, prohibits discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS and punishes the propagation of hatred or physical violence against them with up to two years in prison and a ₹1 lakh fine. “The government already provides treatment, While handing out the awards on the occasion of Teachers’ Day, Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, credited teachers for the success of students and government schools and encouraged them to apply for global training programmes to people with HIV/AIDS, as mandated by the Act. The complaints mechanism is one part of the Act and its implementation has begun,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department. According to the official, an ombudsman is yet to be appointed because the government needs to decide if a person will be picked specifically for the role or if an existing officer will be given additional charge.“At present, we receive about one or two complaints in a quarter. This does not justify the need for having a separate office and a dedicated person as ombudsman; the government is debating whether it may be given as an additional charge,” the official quoted above said. Organisations working with HIV/AIDS patients said an ombudsman has been appointed in just a few states, including Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana.“Barring these few states, the formation of the complaints mechanism is still in the pipeline, with some orders having been issued... Even after the mechanism is created, it will take some time for people to connect with it. We have to create awareness in the community,” said Daxa Patel, president, National Coalition for People Living with HIV in India (NCPI+) saidShe added, “Currently, we refer people to the state legal services, national legal services, lawyers collectives, and some lawyers who have been working in the field. But they have to either go to the police or court. The formation of the mechanism will give people confidence that their complaints will be heard, without going to the court, and in a timely manner.” Activists, however, say that without a proper complaints mechanism in place the government may not know the actual extent of the problem. “The appointment of complaints officer in the government sector is a very small portion of implementation of the act. The Act states that any organisation, whether government or private, should have a complaints officer from within the staff. The onus is now on the government to ensure that these officers are appointed within private organisation as well,” said Raman Chawla, a lawyer and activist who works with HIV/AIDS patients. He added, “And, a complaints officer does not have much power; they are just there to create pressure internally on the organisation to not discriminate against people with HIV. It is much more important to appoint an ombudsman as they can pass orders. It has to be a separate person with a properly funded office; not someone with additional responsibilities. Without a proper complaints mechanism in place, there is no way to tell how many cases of discrimination are there. The only recourse for people with HIV without the mechanism is to go to court; and most do not have the resource to do so,” said Chawla. Hari Shankar, member of the executive board of Delhi Network of Positive People, said, “The reality is that on ground people do not even know about the Act, except for the activists. There are no complaints officers or state-level ombudsman. There was a meeting of Delhi government officials with the stakeholders after the bill was passed back in 2018, comments were sought. But since then nothing has happened.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-health-dept-orders-appointment-of-anti-discrimination-officers-for-hiv-positive-in-all-offices-101630866939293.html
06-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh airport to launch cargo facility on November 1||Six years after getting the international tag, the Chandigarh airport will finally offer the cargo facility from November 1. Air cargo or air freight allows speedy transportation of commercial goods through an air carrier. At present, the Chandigarh International Airport Limited (CHAIL) only provides a common screening facility for domestic cargo, while the airlines — Air India, Indigo, Vistara and GoAir — are handling the goods on their own. Being constructed at a cost of ₹11.5 crore, the air cargo complex is spread over 14,127 square metres. With five cargo sheds being built, it will handle both domestic and international cargo, including perishable goods.It was on September 11, 2015, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated the international airport. In February this year, the Punjab government finally announced the air cargo facility. Presenting the budget, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal had said that the facility will give boost to the industry and provide better access to international and domestic markets.Ajay Bhardwaj, chief executive officer, CHAIL, said: “Around 85% of the construction is done, and we are hopeful of completing the work by mid-October, and begin the facility from November 1. Some clearances are also awaited, and we are hopeful of get them from the authorities concerned in a couple of weeks.”The complex has four cargo sheds constructed through Galvalume pre-painted self-supported roofing and one pre-fabricated shed for perishable cargo. It is equipped with the latest equipment — cold room, reefer van, fork lifts, scissors lift, pallets, user-friendly weighing scale and trolleys — and high-security apparatus — closed-circuit television camera, X-ray machines, door frame metal detectors and explosive trace detection system.Yogesh Sagar, president, Mohali Industries Association, said: “It was the need of the hour. At present, we have to send our consignments by road to the Delhi airport, where they are lined up for 24 to 48 hours before being loaded on to the aircraft, which takes a week’s time. Now, the cargo facility here will save our time. It will also promote ease of business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-airport-to-launch-cargo-facility-on-november-1-101630866762616.html
06-09-2021||Delhi||90 prosecuted for drink driving as Delhi police resume breathalyser tests||At least 90 people were prosecuted for drink driving in Delhi on Saturday night, when the Delhi Traffic Police resumed breathalyser tests. The practise was stopped in March 2020 in order to prevent the spread of Covid-19 as multiple people touched the devices used to measure the amount of alcohol in a driver’s breath. According to senior traffic police officers, the drive began around 7pm on Saturday and concluded by 9pm. Nearly 20 traffic police teams were out on streets across the city to check drink driving. The vehicles of several drunk drivers were impounded and many others were issued court tickets, the police said. However, they did not share the exact number of violators and vehicles impounded.“Now that bars and restaurants in the city have resumed business, incidents of drink driving will certainly increase and it may lead to a surge in road accidents, particularly during the night. To catch drunk drivers, we have resumed our prosecution drive through breathalyser tests as well,” said special commissioner of police (traffic) Muktesh Chander.After suspending the use of breathalysers, the traffic personnel were spotting visibly drunk drivers and getting blood tests done on them to check the amount of alcohol in their body, and prosecute them for the offence. A total of 300 challans were issued to drunk drivers after their medical examination confirmed excess alcohol in their blood, said a second senior traffic police officer who asked not to be named. According to police records, about 30,000 challans were issued in 2019 for drink driving. After the Covid-19 pandemic broke out and lockdowns were imposed in 2020, only 3,000 challans were issued.To check drink driving and prevent road accidents, special teams have been deployed at identified spots where liquor is served till late night and parties are organised, the traffic police said.Special commissioner Chander said they were ensuring that the prosecuting teams were following Covid-appropriate behaviour, such as wearing masks, using sanitisers and maintaining appropriate social distancing, on duty.“Breathalysers are sanitised after every use. We are using disposable pipes. For each test, a new pipe is used,” he added.Driving under the influence of alcohol is punishable by a court challan. In case of first offence, a person is liable to pay a fine of ₹10,000 or face imprisonment up to six months or both. For second and subsequent offences, a fine of ₹15,000 or imprisonment up to two years or both are applicable.Police are authorised to digitally seize the driving licence or registration certificate of the offender in such cases. If the person is from another state and has a booklet or a simple paper driving licence, then it is seized physically. Unless accompanied by a sober person with a valid driving license, the police are also authorised to seize the vehicle of the drunk person. Breathalysers use the amount of alcohol in exhaled breath to calculate the amount of alcohol in a person’s blood, also known as blood alcohol concentration (BAC). In India, motorists are not allowed to drive if the alcohol content is found to be over 30 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/90-in-delhi-prosecuted-for-drink-driving-as-traffic-police-resume-breathalyser-tests-101630866761363.html

Just as his training for the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics along with coach Gaurav Khanna was picking up pace in Lucknow towards the end of 2019, Yathiraj was summoned to Noida months later when Covid-19 began to grip the country in March. As the call of duty beckoned for Noida’s district magistrate, badminton had to take a back seat.But, his commitment towards giving his best in Tokyo did not. Yathiraj tirelessly performed his administrative role amid the pandemic as the DM of Gautam Budh Nagar through the day, before taking some time out at night for his badminton. The 38-year-old found a few sparring partners in Noida, assessing his progress over video calls with Khanna every alternate day. The time spent on the court honing his skills having dropped significantly, Yathiraj’s primary focus was to ensure that his fitness levels didn’t. Despite a shift in priorities for a major part of last year, Yathiraj ticked his goal of winning a medal at the delayed Paralympics. The shuttler with an impairment in his ankle, who took up the sport professionally only five years ago, bagged the silver in the men’s singles SL4 category after losing a gripping battle with world No. 1 Frenchman Lucas Mazur 21-15, 17-21, 15-21 in the final on Sunday.In an interview with HT after the final match, the 2007 batch IAS officer of Uttar Pradesh cadre talked about his father’s role in pushing him to follow his passion as a kid in Shimoga, Karnataka, and why he believed he has broken an age-old myth in the country. Excerpts:Having been through so much in the last year-and-a-half, how satisfying is this silver medal?It’s very satisfying. This medal gives me extreme happiness and also extreme disappointment. The final against Lucas was very close, and I almost had the gold medal in my bag. That feeling will always remain with me. But you can always look in hindsight and say ‘ki kaash aisa hota (only if it would’ve happened this way)’. But destiny has been very kind to have brought me so far. When you pursue your passion and desire, there is always one more step, and probably a gold medal would have been that one more step. But there’s no other tournament where I could have won a medal for the country and felt prouder. This is the pinnacle of sporting achievement, and I’m very grateful to have reached there.You ran the world No. 1 really close. What made the difference in the end?Two-three little things. In the second part of the second set, I made a few unforced errors which should have been avoided. Secondly, on one side of the court, the drift was very strong. All the players were finding it difficult to adjust to it even after playing so many matches. So on a few shots, I misjudged how much the shuttle will travel. Otherwise, I was playing extremely well. He (Mazur) appeared to be more tired, so I was confident of pulling it off. But in the end, he was probably the better player on the day.When you look back at your journey as a kid with a physical impairment and the different fields that you have excelled in, did you imagine becoming a Paralympic medallist one day as well?Never. When I was a child, I never expected that I’ll be able to do something big in life. I only watched others doing it on TV. It was my father who instilled a lot of confidence early in my childhood to push forward with whatever I had the passion for, be it academics or sports. In my badminton career, I always took it one step at a time. ‘Aur kehte hai na’ (and as they say), if you really want something, then destiny conspires you achieve it.The first IAS officer in the country to win an Olympic or Paralympic medal… must sound good, isn’t it?Not just IAS, I’m probably the first bureaucrat of any kind and service. People usually get into government jobs after winning Olympic medals; I did it the other way round. So at least my medal will break the social myth that one cannot be good in sports and studies at the same time. It’s a myth that really needed to be broken.But how much did you find it difficult to balance both?It’s not very difficult. Everyone can do more than one thing in life. It’s just about how much focus you have in your job and what else you want to pursue. So if you pursue something for three hours a day with a lot of passion, you can excel in it. People can do multiple things in a day, provided you focus on time management properly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/people-get-govt-jobs-after-winning-olympic-medals-i-did-it-the-other-way-round-says-noida-dm-after-clinching-silver-101630866638197.html
06-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi Govt to fund teachers taking admission to top universities: Dy CM||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday announced that the Delhi government will provide funding to teachers, who secure admission in the top 100 global universities, at a function held in Thyagaraj stadium to recognize teachers who have made a contribution to the education system. While handing out the awards on the occasion of Teachers’ Day, Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, credited teachers for the success of students and government schools and encouraged them to apply for global training programmes. He said the Delhi government will incur all the expenses of teachers aiming to study abroad. “All the best universities in the world are known for their own tailored courses. We believe that if our teachers apply for such courses, they can get selected on the basis of their abilities. That’s why the Delhi Government has decided on this Teachers’ Day that our teachers will be able to apply for prestigious courses... in the world’s 100 top-ranked universities. If selected, the government will bear the full cost of their programme,” said Sisodia adding that the teachers would be given leave for pursuing such courses. “We will ensure that our teachers get world-class exposure and in turn, they impart world-class education to our students,” said the deputy chief minister. From arranging smartphones for students to running vaccination centres, a total of 122 teachers were recognized by the government this year, a majority of whom are from Delhi government schools. Besides government school teachers, 14 sports teachers, two librarians, 13 corporation school teachers and 15 private school teachers were also felicitated. A number of changes were introduced to the selection process this year. The number of awards was increased to 122 from 103 last year to recognise the work of more teachers. For the first time, the government also gave two awards under a new category. The inaugural Face of DoE (directorate of education) award for notable work was given to music teacher Rajkumar from Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya (RPVV) in Dwarka Sector-19 and mathematics lecturer Suman Arora from RPVV, A-6 Paschim Vihar. Rajkumar has initiated various activities to promote Indian classical music among students and continues to hold various laurels for playing sitar. Arora was awarded for the creation of support material for students of Class 12. Under her guidance, 23 students got selected in IIT-JEE Mains, while five students cleared the JEE- Advanced exams. Bharti Kalra and Sarita Rani Bharadwaj were felicitated for their exemplary work in education. Kalra arranged for 321 smartphones for children to help them attend online classes. During the pandemic, Bhardwaj went out of her way to reach out to the students who could not be contacted on phone for online classes. She took help from the community to find students and provided worksheets to those who did not have smartphones. Appreciating the efforts of teachers, Sisodia said the Delhi government schools were being praised across the country and beyond. “Our education system has been badly affected due to the pandemic. After the closure of the schools, no one had any idea how to proceed with the teaching-learning process. But the teachers and principals of our schools showed incredible grit and determination in responding to this situation amid difficulties,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-fund-teachers-taking-admission-to-top-universities-dy-cm-101630866397702.html
06-09-2021||Delhi||Conman's wife held in multi-crore fraud case||The Delhi Police on Sunday said they have arrested actress Leena Maria Paul on the alleged charges of helping her husband, Sukesh Chandrashekhar -- an alleged conman, and an accused in 21 cases including the Election Commission bribery case -- pull off a multi-crore cheating and extortion racket that was being run from inside the Tihar Jail prison complex.Paul was arrested by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) on Sunday, a day after a Delhi court sent Chandrashekhar to the agency’s custody in connection with the cheating and extortion case. The Delhi Police recently invoked stringent provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against Chandrashekhar and others. Paul is the ninth person to be arrested in the case that was registered on the complaint of Aditi Singh, wife of jailed businessman Shivinder Mohan Singh, former promoter of Religare Enterprises.Shivinder Singh was arrested in October 2019 in a fraud case pertaining to alleged misappropriation of funds at Religare Finvest Ltd (RFL). His brother Malvinder Singh was also arrested in the case. Chandrashekhar and his associates allegedly duped Malvinder’s spouse as well of several crores of rupees in the name of helping her husband get bail in the case. It was not immediately confirmed if a separate case was registered in the EOW on the complaint of Malvinder’s wife.“We had asked Paul to join the investigation at our EOW office. She arrived on Sunday. We arrested her after the questioning. She will be produced before the concerned court on Monday. Her police custody will be sought for interrogating her further in the case and confronting her with her husband and other arrested persons,” said a senior EOW officer, who asked not to be named.According to the officer, like Chandrashekhar, his wife has also been booked under the MCOCA, since Aditi identified a woman’s voice during the telephonic conversations in which Chandrashekhar posed as an official from ministry of law and offered to bail her husband out. Paul was earlier interrogated on several occasions by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) that is also looking into the cheating matter.A model-turned-Malayalam actress, Paul featured in Bollywood movie Madras Café that was released in 2013, the year she was arrested in a bank fraud case. She has also worked in Tamil and Malayalam movies. She was arrested by the Mumbai Police in 2015 along with Chandrashekhar and at least four others for allegedly duping several investors through money circulation schemes.Police said Chandrashekar, who planned the cheating and extortion racket from jail, was earlier arrested in 2017 by Delhi police for duping an AIADMK leader by taking ₹2 crore on the pretext of helping the party retain its two leaves symbol by bribing Election Commission officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/conman-sukesh-chandrashekhar-s-wife-arrested-for-aiding-him-101630866279139.html
06-09-2021||Delhi||From cargo to classrooms: Containers triggering ideas and opportunities||New Delhi: The Delhi government recently unveiled two new modular Mohalla clinics made from shipping containers in Shakur Basti in northwest Delhi, the constituency of health minister Satyendar Jain, who said that if successful, the government intends to create many more such clinics in the future. Due to problems in getting land, the government has been able to set up only 500 of the 1,000 new Mohalla clinics that it announced to build in 2015. “We will build many more container clinics if we get positive feedback from the people. So far, the response has been great,” says Jain. “These clinics are portable, modular, and occupy less space. Besides, these new clinics are sturdy, so we would not have to face the problem of vandalism and theft that we were facing in many other clinics.” The facilities in the new 350 sq ft air-conditioned clinic include a doctor’s room, waiting area, and pharmacy. While the Capital will be using shipping containers on a large scale for a public infrastructure project for the first time, in the past few years they have been used to build portable schools, skill development centers, cafeterias, and even houses across the country. Experts say they are slowly gaining popularity as an eco-friendly, rapidly deployable, scalable, portable plug-and-play building solution. According to World Shipping Council, there are about 18 million containers in the global fleet. A container, made of weathering steel, has a life span of 10-12 years and thousands go out of service every year. In India, Safeducate, a Delhi-based training firm that proves skill training in logistics was among the first to convert retired shipping containers into classrooms. “We have 25 skill development schools across the country, including one in Gurugram, made from shipping containers. We have trained over 10, 000 youngsters in these container schools,” says Divya Jain, founder and CEO, Safeducate. The company’s training center in Binola, Gurugram, which was inaugurated in 2018, has been built with eight containers, and has classrooms, laboratories, and libraries, among other facilities. “The idea was to recycle discarded containers to develop eco-friendly and cost-effective education infrastructure,” says Jain. Similarly, in 2015, Samarth Bharat Vyaspith, an NGO, and Thane Municipal Corporation built ‘Signal Shala’, a formal school under a flyover in the city. The first registered school under a flyover, it provides education up to the 10th standard and has classrooms, a science lab, and a computer lab---- all running from cargo containers. “Our organisation was working with people who were living under a flyover in Thane and begged at the traffic signal there. There were over 52 children who lived with their families under the bridge, and they too were into begging. We wanted to prepare them for mainstream school, but realised that they could not follow the routine of a normal school,” says Bhatu Sawant, CEO, Samarth Bharat Vyaspith. “So, we thought of setting up a container school for them right under the flyover. We approached Thane Municipal Corporation which, after much convincing, decided to collaborate with us and provide free water, electricity, and security. ” Six years on, many of his students have successfully passed Class 10, got professional diplomas, and are working in good companies, says Sawant, who now plans to open four more such schools under flyovers in Mumbai. “There has been rapid urbanisation, and so many flyovers have been built in cities. I think container schools are the perfect way to utilise spaces under them. The Maharashtra government appreciated our school and said it would replicate the model across Maharashtra,” says Sawant. Very few people talk about the potential of container schools with the passion of Amreesh Chandra, an educationist and founder of Project OoSC (Out of School Children), under which he is setting up over 50 container schools across the country. Chandra announced the project in 2019 at the India Business Group Summit Awards in the British Parliament in London. The first container school was inaugurated in a village near Gorakhpur by Baroness Patricia Scotland, the Commonwealth Secretary-General during her visit to India in January last year. Chandra says two more container schools will be operational in the next couple of weeks in Azamgarh and Maharajganj in UP. Covering an area of about 1000 square ft, each of these container schools boasts two large classrooms, an administrative office, and a backyard. The school in Gorakhpur had 80 students before it had to shut down last year due to the pandemic. “ There are 138 million children in India who are out of school, and one of the reasons is lack of schools in their vicinity. I believe that recycled containers can help quickly create a large number of affordable, eco-friendly schools near where they live. A container school can be created in 100 days with all the furniture, once an area has been identified,” says Chandra. “All of our planned 50 schools would have been operational by now but for the pandemic. Now we now hope to complete them by 2023.” Chandra says that he is also planning a university, with a building made out of containers. “Higher education is costly because of the huge costs involved in the construction of buildings. Container buildings can drastically bring down the cost,” he says. While a university campus made from containers may be a thing of the future, ITS Dental College in Greater Noida has built a massive cafeteria called ‘Cafe Infinity’ on its sprawling campus. Built in 2019 from nine shipping containers, the café is spread over 4,800 sq ft area. “The university wanted to create an eco-friendly and eccentric space and we suggested containers. In fact, the café’s name suggests the infinite possibilities of using containers in construction. India is one of the biggest shipping hubs. On average, container, has a life cycle of 12 years and recycling them is not quite easy, and most are discarded. So it is better to repurpose them,” says Rahul Jain, a Ghaziabad-based architect, who designed the café. “ We need to understand that 50% to 60% of air pollution is caused by construction activities. The flexibility, modularity, and sustainability make shipping containers a perfect alternative to the conventional building structures,” he adds. Saikat Maitra, vice-chancellor, Maulana Abul Kalam University of Technology (Makaut), in West Bengal, could not agree more. In fact, his university has launched a research project, which explores how discarded shipping containers can be best used to build shops, schools, offices, and even low-cost houses. “From the engineering point of view, we are studying how these massive containers can be made modular, be better ventilated, insulated, and integrated together,” says Maitra. “We have created a provision store and a cafeteria within the campus as part of this research.” He says that Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (HIDCO) of West Bengal, a public sector undertaking, has approached the university for technical guidance on creating food courts and shops in New Town area in Kolkata with containers.“There have been reservations about the aesthetic appeal of container buildings, but now people are realizing that this problem can be sorted with creativity and imagination. I believe that containers can be used for creating low-cost houses,” says Maitra. “Container structures are disaster-resilient and can be shifted to a different location if needed . Retired shipping containers contain a whole new world of possibilities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/from-cargo-to-classrooms-containers-triggering-ideas-and-opportunities-101630865077790.html

While working, the crane came in contact with high-voltage cables and electrocuted her son, who died on the spot.She alleged that on arriving at the scene, police did not take any action. The body was moved to the civil hospital, but the family did not allow a post-mortem examination, seeking an FIR against the factory owner. They also organised a protest outside the Kanganwal police post.Sub-inspector Balwinder Singh, SHO, Sahnewal police station, said an FIR under Section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code had been lodged against the accused and the autopsy will be conducted on Monday.Family loses breadwinnerOnly son of his parents, Abhishek worked at the factory to support his family financially.

The project comprises two automated multilevel parking facilities: with the first on Lloyd road at the junction of East street and Coyaji road for which a tender was floated and work finalised as part of the general body decision; and the second to come up at the junction of Dr Coyaji road and Stavely road which was the board administration’s original development plan.However, the project has ground to a halt owing to non-receipt of GST funds from the state government for the past three years. While the parking facility was initially proposed in 2016, the PCB administration in 2019 had available reserve funds that could pay salaries for only three months. With neither the state nor the central government taking up the cause of the PCB GST, the financial position of the board has been dwindling every day.Former PCB vice president Vinod Mathurawala said, “The PCB is undergoing its worst financial crisis and efforts are underway to bring funds to ensure that all development oriented projects are completed on time. At the same time, the board administration is doing its level best to ensure that development projects are not all affected by the seeking of funds from the centre and state.”Not just the PCB parking facility but many other development projects worth an estimated Rs150 crore have been hit by non-receipt of GST funds from the state government for the past three years. For instance, the work on Chhatrapati Shivaji market and Fashion street is stuck due to a similar lack of funds. Restoration of the Chhatrapati Shivaji market following a massive fire in March is yet to begin and likely to be delayed further due to scarcity of funds. The PCB had sought funds from the district administration after which the collector’s office agreed to pay ₹1.25 crore if the board was willing to pay the remaining ₹1.25 crore as part of the ₹2.50 crore required for the restoration project. The board administration on June 30 decided to seek pending taxes from traders wherein an amount of ₹80 lakh is due in taxes from defaulters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/work-on-pcb-s-17-cr-parking-facility-grinds-to-halt-due-to-fund-shortage-101630859616678.html

The objective is to inspire people to give it some thought and move towards a more eco-friendly and conscious celebration,” said Supriya Goturkar- Mahabaleshwarkar, co-convenor, Intach Pune.This idea came about with Covid restrictions that gave a reason to analyse celebrations and its real meaning. “The idea was also to look at the festival from different perspectives of mythology, culture, history, ecology, traditional wisdom and even food and nutrition,” said Goturkar- Mahabaleshwarkar. The series also has Kathak performances choreographed by Rohini Bhate, performed by her disciples.“The series ‘Conscious Ganesha’ has brought together dance along with origin, ecology, history and food practices of our loved festival. I have always believed for dance to be a powerful art tool for spreading awareness and enjoying the festivities, more for what they help us learn. It has brought in an audience who will otherwise have never interacted with each other. We hope the festival starts new, healthy conversations,” said Hrishikesh Pawar, artistic director, Centre of Contemporary Dance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/intachs-youtube-series-on-ecofriendly-ganesh-celebrations-101630859256657.html

Accordingly, mandals which have their own temples should celebrate within the temples. For others, a small mandap with simple celebrations is allowed. Our officials are on the spot, checking last year’s permission for this year,” said Madhav Jagtap, PMC’s deputy commissioner and head of the encroachment/illegal construction removal department.“There are around 2,000 mandals in Pune city. Once the festival starts, we are going to keep a watch on the mandals. We have formed vigilance squads who will check illegal mandaps or any other encroachments around the city,” Jagtap added.Mahesh Suryvanshi, treasurer, Dagdusheth Ganpati Mandal trust said, “All the Ganpati mandals in Pune are going to follow guidelines and restrictions given by the state government, as well as the PMC and police department. Already, due to the pandemic the financial backbone of the mandals is gone for a toss, so there are fewer mandals who would be installing mandaps this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-handing-out-on-the-spot-permissions-to-ganesh-mandals-this-year-101630858956696.html

At the peak of the second wave earlier this year, the district required 360 tonnes of oxygen and so for the third wave, the administration has been asked to ensure for 1,080, metric tonnes of oxygen is ready, per day. To meet the deficit the PMC, PCMC and rural administration is preparing to buy more cylinders and build more liquid medical oxygen (LMO) generation plantsAs per the state government’s orders, districts have been asked to prepare for three times the number of active cases during the peak of the second wave. As per that estimate, the district needed 360 metric tonnes of medical oxygen at the peak of the second wave. Currently, the district has access to about 965 metric tonnes of medical oxygen, which means a deficit of 115 metric tonnes. As per the district’s report, while liquid medical oxygen which is required for Covid-19 patients in the ICU, is in excess. Oxygen from the Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) method is in deficit by 142 metric tonnes, dura cylinders by 72 metric tonnes and cylinders by 63 metric tonnes. To fill this deficit, the administration is purchasing 244 dura cylinders - 92 by the PMC, 92 by the PCMC and 60 by Pune rural. More LMO plants are being built. Dr Ashish Bharti, chief medical officer at PMC said, “PMC has about 10 oxygen plants already functioning and we have six more proposed which would add the capacity by 7,866 oxygen litres per minute. Also we have nine liquid oxygen storage tanks available and we are building three more, so that we can totally have about 173 kilo litres.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-district-s-prep-for-3rd-wave-deficit-of-115-metric-tonnes-of-oxygen-101630856616522.html

After KEM, Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital will also begin trials in a month’s time.Covavax, which is primarily developed by US firm, Novavax Inc, will be mass produced by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) mainly for below-18-year age group. This is the fourth vaccine to be approved for clinical trials in the country and, Pune’s KEM centre at Vadu has also been selected for Phase II and Phase III trials. Dr Avinash Badvekar, principal investigator at the KEM centre said, “We will be starting phase two trials for safety from Monday, and we would vaccinate 25 in total, but at least eight on the first day. Once the safety trial results are out for this age group then phase II would continue, and then it would proceed to a lower age group of about two years. We had sent out applications for parents who would want their children to participate in the trial.”He further added that the trial requires children to be healthy and more importantly, without comorbidities. “After written consent from parents and also informed consent of the child, as per ICMR guidelines, the vaccine will be administered,” added Bavdekar. He also said that the children who have participated in the trial would get a vaccination certificate and those who take a placebo, would be informed to take the vaccine once the government opens up eligibility for their age group. Along with the KEM centre, Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital will also be a site for the Covavax trial in Pune. “However, trials would begin after a month,” said Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covovax-vaccine-trial-for-minors-begins-in-pune-district-on-monday-101630856436602.html

Interestingly, some cut-offs have increased, as others have decreased as compared to those released after the release of the first merit list. The education department fears a large number of seats will remain vacant this year due to the low number of registrations for admissions.In this second regular admission round, a total of 63,757 seats are available, for which 35,694 students applied and 15,967 students were allotted a college. Comparing cut-off lists, prominent colleges like Modern College of Arts, Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar, which had 92.80 per cent cut off for the Science stream in the first list, has now increased its cut-off to 93 per cent. For the Marathi Arts stream it has increased the cut-off 67 per cent to 69 per cent. Similarly, for Symbiosis College of Arts and Commerce, the cut off for the Arts stream was 91 per cent in the first list and it is now 93.80 per cent.There are several other colleges which have increased their cut-offs in the second list. Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal, Modern College of Arts, Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar, said, “There are two major reasons for this increase in the cut-off lists in the second round. Firstly, students got the chance to change their preferences and so it reflected in the merit list. Then there are new students who got registered by filling up part 1 of the form and so the number increased.”Of the 15,967 allotted students, 6,040 students were given a college of their first preference, 3,231 students were given the college of their second preference and 1,988 students were given the college of their third preference. For this academic year a total of 78,745 students registered for Class 11 admissions. Despite a high passing percentage in Class 10 this year, students registration was low as compared to the available 111,205 seats. Last year, the registration number was 102,851. “One of the major reasons for a low number of registrations is rural students who come to Pune for studies have not registered this year. This has had a major impact on the admission process and will result in vacancy of seats,” said Meena Shendkar, assistant director of education, Pune, who is in-charge of the admission process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fyjc-admissions-change-in-cutoffs-after-registrations-remain-low-101630856376576.html

In July it launched legal action against both countries over measures it says discriminate against the gay community.Polish LGBT activists posted a scan of the letter on social media and on Monday a spokesman for the Lubelskie region confirmed receiving it. A European Commission spokeswoman in Warsaw also confirmed the letter had been sent."The Commission would like to stress that declaring LGBTIQ-free/unwelcome territories, workplace or services constitutes an action that is against the values set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union," the letter said.It added that extra funding under part of the bloc's COVID recovery fund would be put on hold pending the regions' responses to the Commission's concerns.The funds are part of REACT-EU (Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe), a package of additional cohesion funds under which Poland has been allocated a total of over 1.5 billion euros."At the moment, it (the letter) is being analysed in order to prepare an answer," the Lubelskie region spokesman said in an email.Lubelskie and Malopolska regions have both recently voted to remain free of "LGBT ideology".Gay rights is a deeply divisive issue in predominantly Catholic Poland.Also Read | Hate crime, violence feared in Polish 'LGBT-free zones'Many religious conservatives see the fight for LGBT equality as an attack on traditional values.

This marked the first US-facilitated overland evacuation since all its troops pulled out from the now Taliban-controlled Afghanistan on August 31. “We have facilitated the departure of four American citizens from Afghanistan via an overland route. Our embassy greeted the Americans as they crossed the border into the third country,” the officials noted without divulging any additional information, including the country they were evacuated to. US Congressional Representative Ronny Jackson confirmed the evacuation on Twitter, and also identified the four Americans as part of his constituent district in Texas. He added that the evacuation was successfully executed “after two weeks and multiple life-threatening attempts.”

06-09-2021||World||‘Concerned over terror spreading from Afghanistan’: Russian envoy||Russia and India have the shared concern of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan spreading to Russian territory or to Kashmir, Russian ambassador Nikolay Kudashev said on Monday against the backdrop of the Taliban takeover in Kabul.Counter-terrorism cooperation is a key part of the India-Russia dialogue at various levels, and Moscow wants an inclusive government in Kabul to ensure stability and sustainable development in Afghanistan, Kudashev told reporters during an interaction at the Russian embassy.Separately, Bangladesh information minister Hasan Mahmud, who is on an official visit to New Delhi, told reporters at the Press Club of India that his country is closely watching developments in Afghanistan as they have implications for regional stability.“We are keeping an eye on that. Stability in Afghanistan is important for stability in the South Asian region,” Mahmud said. He added it was too early to talk about any recognition of a set-up formed by the Taliban.Kudashev, who spoke to reporters on the margins of an event at the Russian embassy, said Russia is closely cooperating with India to counter the danger of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan. Any flare-up of the civilian conflict would result in terrorism spilling over across the region, he said.“As far as the phenomenon of terror is concerned, we do share our concerns with India. There is a danger of terror...being spread to the Russian territory, to the territory of Kashmir maybe,” he said. “We want an inclusive government, we expect that Afghan soil would not be a source of terror emanating to the other countries of the region,” he said. “Thus, this is a matter of common concern and this is a matter of continued dialogue between Russia and India within multiple frameworks, be it the bilateral counter-terrorism working group, [or] the track of national security councils [or] the track of defence ministers [and] foreign ministers,” he added.Russia’s main concern is stability in Afghanistan and building an inclusive government that can “offer itself for recognition to the international community to secure stability and sustainable development,” Kudashev said.Afghanistan “deserves peace, predictability and sustainable development, and India and Russia want “Afghanistan to be peaceful [and] friendly with each and every country in the region,” he said. “These are the very basic values which bring Russia and India together. I don’t see much of a difference in our positions,” Kudashev added. Both countries are also cooperating on Afghanistan within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and its working group on Afghanistan. Kudashev said it was too early to talk about any recognition of a set-up created by the Taliban. “The new Taliban dispensation should prove that it is a responsible government, that it is able to build an inclusive government, that it is able to look after each and every minority, each and every region of Afghanistan, that it is able to build predictable foreign ties...with the regional and international community,” he said. “If that will be the case, we will be able to revisit this question,” he added.Kudashev’s comments came against the backdrop of some amount of disquiet in New Delhi over Moscow’s efforts to work more closely with Islamabad on the issue of Afghanistan. India was kept out of several recent meetings of the “extended troika” format organised by Russia, and Pakistan was part of these discussions.Zamir Kabulov, the Russian special presidential envoy for Afghanistan, had even said that India was not invited to participate in the “expanded troika” meetings because it does not have any influence on the Taliban. Kudashev said in response to questions that India and Russia were expected to hold multiple interactions this year, including the annual bilateral summit, a 2+2 dialogue of the defence and foreign ministers, and meetings of the military and technical commission, trade and economic commission, and other expert-level groups. These meetings will focus on matters such as UN reforms, strategic stability, the emerging regional architecture in Asia and the Pacific, and challenges such as terrorism, drug trafficking and crime.He noted, there are “enormous opportunities” for bilateral cooperation in defence, oil and gas, nuclear power, space, infrastructure and connectivity. The Russian proposal to build six new nuclear reactors is still “on the table” and “it is for the Indian government to take a decision” on this matter, he said.Kudashev said Russia is expected to deliver the first batch of S-400 air defence systems under a $5.4-billion deal by October. “There are no issues as far as the timeline is concerned. It would be performed in due course,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/concerned-over-terror-spreading-from-afghanistan-russian-envoy-101630945666257.html
06-09-2021||World||Over 1,000 await flight clearance to leave Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif: Report||About 1,000 people, including Americans, have been stuck in Afghanistan for days awaiting clearance for their charter flights to leave, an organizer told Reuters, blaming the delay on the US State Department.The confusion was the latest flashpoint following a chaotic US military withdrawal completed after Taliban Islamist insurgents seized power in Kabul on Aug. 15, after the Western-backed government collapsed.Exasperated by the delays, the organizer said the State Department had failed to tell the Taliban of its approval for flight departures from the international airport in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif or validate a landing site."They need to be held accountable for putting these people's lives in danger," said the organizer, who sought anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.Reuters could not independently verify the details of the account.A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, challenged the idea that Americans were at risk, saying the US government "has not confirmed any Americans are in Mazar-i-Sharif trying to leave from the airport."Asked about charter flights, a State Department spokesperson did not address specific accusations but stressed the United States did not have personnel on the ground and so lacked a reliable means to confirm the basic details of charter flights.That includes verifying the number of US citizens and others aboard, the accuracy of the rest of the manifest or "where they plan to land, among many other issues."The spokesperson added, "We will hold the Taliban to its pledge to let people freely depart Afghanistan."Earlier on Sunday, the senior Republican on the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, Mike McCaul, told "Fox News Sunday" that six airplanes were stuck at Mazar-i-Sharif airport with Americans and Afghan interpreters aboard, unable to take off as they had not received Taliban clearance.He said the Taliban were holding passengers "hostage for demands," but multiple sources disputed that account, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity.Another Republican US representative, Mike Waltz, called on the State Department to work with non-government groups he said were trying to clear charter flights to evacuate Americans and Afghans at risk.There were manifested charter flights "available, funded, and ready to fly" people out, Waltz told Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a letter, citing remarks of several NGOs.The United States' two decades-long invasion in Afghanistan culminated in a hastily organized airlift that left behind thousands of US-allied Afghans. Washington completed the withdrawal on Aug. 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-1-000-await-flight-clearance-to-leave-afghan-city-of-mazar-i-sharif-report-101630944339193.html

Ireland meat checks||The UK and the European Union are set to extend the grace period during which certain food products can cross the border from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, people familiar with the matter said.Under the original Brexit deal struck with the EU by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the sale of chilled meats and fresh sausages into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK was going to be outlawed by the end of June. This extra time was given to let companies adapt to Brexit, but instead led to a confrontation, dubbed “sausage war.” The two sides defused tensions over the summer by extending the transition to the end of September. But now the new deadline is encroaching and there is still no resolution.A fresh extension may be announced as soon as tomorrow, according to three people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity discussing unannounced policy. They didn’t specify how long it would be for. Two officials said that while the EU hasn’t agreed to the postponement, the bloc wouldn’t start infringement proceedings, effectively nodding it through.The UK and EU are locked in discussions to try to resolve the issue, with Johnson’s government calling on the EU to rewrite a part of the Brexit deal that effectively keeps Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs area and much of the single market and means cargo coming from mainland Britain needs to be checked before or on entry to ensure it meets EU standards.Separately, two people familiar with the matter said that European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic and UK Brexit Minister David Frost will hold a call later this week to try to make progress on a solution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sausage-war-uk-set-to-extend-brexit-grace-period-on-n-ireland-meat-checks-101630940900997.html

The statement from the Islamist group comes after it confirmed that Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed met Taliban’s de-facto leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in Kabul last week in an unannounced visit.Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid, while speaking to Afghan news agency Khaama, said the group will not allow any country to interfere in the nation’s internal affairs. ISI chief Hameed was the first high-ranking foreign official to visit Afghanistan from Pakistan following the Taliban takeover last month.Mujahid confirmed that Baradar met Hameed, news agency BBC Urdu reported citing people familiar with the development. He also said that the Taliban assured Islamabad that the Afghan soil will not be used against Pakistan.Pakistan earlier said that the ISI chief visited the nation on the Taliban’s invitation, but the Islamist group denied the claim and said that Pakistan proposed the meeting. The group, however, said that the Pakistani spy agency chief was in Afghanistan to improve bilateral relations between Kabul and Islamabad.Taliban spokesperson and deputy head of its cultural commission, Ahmadullah Wasiq, said that both the leaders discussed problems faced by passengers at the Torkham and Spin Boldak passes between Afghanistan and Pakistan.“The Pakistani official came to solve Afghan passengers’ problems at the border areas, especially in Torkham and Spin Boldak. They wanted (his visit to Kabul) and we accepted,” Wasiq was quoted as saying by Afghan news agency Tolo News.Pakistan closed the Chaman border crossing, which is the second-largest commercial border point with Afghanistan after Torkham in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, owing to security concerns.The high-level visit of Pakistan ISI chief to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan caused concern and surprise among security experts. The Afghanistan government, led by former president Ashraf Ghani, accused Pakistan of giving the Taliban military aid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-won-t-allow-pak-to-interfere-in-afghanistan-s-internal-affairs-report-101630940167009.html

The HMS Queen Elizabeth arrived at the US Navy base in Yokosuka near Tokyo last week. It is Britain’s largest and most-powerful warship. HMS Queen Elizabeth is capable of carrying up to 40 aircraft such as F-35 stealth fighters, according to the Royal Navy.Japan is seeking to expand its military cooperation beyond the US as the Chinese navy presses territorial claims in the South China Sea. The aircraft carrier participated in a joint exercise with warships from the US, the Netherlands, Canada and Japan before arriving in Yokosuka.“European countries' interest in (China's) unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas ... contributes to the peace and stability in this region. I expect the port call will contribute to a further development of Japan-British defense cooperation,” Kishi was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. He also said that the previous exercise was part of efforts to achieve a ‘free and open Indo-Pacific’ - a vision led by Washington and Tokyo.China’s military influence in the region along with the nations escalating tensions with Taiwan and the US is a cause for concern for Japan. It protested Chinese presence near the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands. China also claims these islands and calls them Diaoyu.Commodore Moorhouse upon his arrival in Yokosuka said that the strike group’s meeting was part of the UK's ‘commitment to strengthen our diplomatic, economic and security ties in the Indo-Pacific’. He said that interaction will take ties between Japan and the UK to a ‘new level’.“The Carrier Strike Group’s presence embodies the United Kingdom’s support for the freedom and security of the region’s vital trading routes, and for an international system that benefits all countries,” Moorhead said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-aircraft-carrier-arrives-in-japan-for-drill-aims-to-counter-china-101630939013817.html
06-09-2021||World||Pakistan ISI chief meets Taliban top leader Mullah Baradar: Report||The Taliban on Monday confirmed that Pakistan's powerful intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed has met its de-facto leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, amidst efforts by the insurgent group to finalise a government in Afghanistan.Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt Gen Hameed dashed to Kabul on an unannounced visit last week, becoming the only high-ranking foreign official to visit Kabul since the Taliban seized the Afghan capital in mid-August.During a press conference in Kabul on Monday, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed that the ISI chief had met with Mullah Baradar during his visit to Kabul, BBC Urdu reported.The Taliban has assured Islamabad that Afghan territory will not be used against Pakistan, it said.Earlier, Pakistani media reported that a delegation of senior officials led by Lt Gen Hameed was in Kabul at the invitation of the Taliban, but the insurgent group said that Islamabad had proposed his visit to Kabul.On Sunday, the Taliban said that the top Pakistani spy was in Afghanistan to improve bilateral relations between Kabul and Islamabad.Ahmadullah Wasiq, deputy head of the Taliban’s Cultural Commission, said that the Taliban leaders talked with Lt Gen Hameed about bilateral relations and the problems of Afghan passengers at the Torkham and Spin Boldak passes between Afghanistan and Pakistan."This Pakistani official has come to solve Afghan passengers’ problems at the border areas, especially in Torkham and Spin Boldak. They wanted (his visit to Kabul) and we accepted,” Wasiq was quoted as saying by TOLO news.Pakistan on Thursday temporarily closed the Chaman border crossing - the second-largest commercial border point with Afghanistan after the Torkham commercial town in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – due to security threats.At his press conference, Mujahid noted that the recent delegation to Kabul said the crossings had been closed due to security concerns linked to release of prisoners inside Afghanistan, and requested checks for those seeking to enter or leave the country.Citing sources close to Hizb-e-Islami party leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the channel said that Pakistan's intelligence chief also met him and discussed the current situation in the country.In a short video clip circulated in the media last week, Lt Gen Hameed was seen trying to respond to questions by a journalist who first asked: “Will you be meeting senior people in the Taliban?""No, I’m not clear…" the ISI chief said and looked towards Pakistan ambassador to Kabul Mansour Ahmad Khan, who was standing by his side, to respond to the question.In response to another question, Hameed smiled and said: "Don’t worry, everything will be okay."Hameed's visit to Afghanistan came amidst mounting pressure on the Taliban to form an inclusive government acceptable to the international community. The insurgent group is struggling to give shape to a broad-based and inclusive administration acceptable to the international community.It was the first high-level visit of any Pakistani official to Afghanistan since the Taliban took over Kabul on August 15, in a move that surprised both their foes and friends.Since then, the Taliban have been trying to form a government but so far have held back the announcement.Pakistan was often accused by the Afghanistan government of giving the Taliban military aid, a charge denied by Islamabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-isi-chief-meets-taliban-top-leader-mullah-baradar-report-101630932646364.html
06-09-2021||World||Beijing refuses to answer question on Taliban’s invitation to Afghan government inauguration||The Chinese foreign minister refused to answer media questions on the Taliban extending an invitation to China, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey, Iran and Qatar to the inauguration of the new government in Kabul. The spokesperson for the country’s foreign ministry, Wang Wenbin, told reporters that he has “no information to offer at this moment”.China has kept its embassy in Kabul open, joining the leagues of countries like Russia. Media reports suggest that Beijing is awaiting the formation of a Taliban-led government in Afghanistan. "We always respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Afghanistan, follow the principle of non-interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs and adhere to the friendly policy for all the Afghan people," Wenbin told reporters in late August.“China also stands ready to continue to develop good-neighbourliness, friendship and cooperation with Afghanistan and play a constructive role in Afghanistan's peace and reconstruction," he added.Also Read: Warming relations between China, Taliban cause fear among Uyghurs: ReportThe official stance of Beijing in regards to a Taliban government is centred around preventing cross-border terrorism in its western Xinjiang region from anti-Beijing East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) militants, who, China fears, could seek sanctuary within Afghanistan.“China's primary concern now is for the Taliban to ... build an inclusive and moderate regime so that terrorism would not spill over to Xinjiang and the region. Any other calculus further to that remains to be seen," the foreign ministry told Reuters in August.To assuage China’s apprehensions Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar had assured Beijing that EITM militants will not be allowed to carry out operations on Afghan soil. Ghani who was on an official visit to China in July told Chinese state media that Beijing has always been a “reliable friend” and “the Afghan Taliban will never allow any force to use the Afghan territory to engage in acts detrimental to China.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-refuses-to-answer-question-on-taliban-s-invitation-to-afghan-government-inauguration-101630928354586.html
06-09-2021||World||Afghanistan crisis: NRF leader says resistance forces still present in Panjshir,||The National Resistance Front (NRF) are still present in Panjshir, the last resistance stronghold of Afghanistan, and continuing their fight against the Taliban, said its leader Ahmad Massoud, in an audio message on his Facebook page, according to a report by Tolo News.This comes hours after the Taliban which took over the capital city of Kabul on August 15 following the US drawdown, said it has captured the remaining province of Panjshir, located in the northeastern part of the country. However, the NRF has denied the claims and says the fighting is still going on. Its forces are positioned on all strategic points, NRF spokesperson Ali Nazary said earlier in the day.After the fall of Kabul, Panjshir remains the only defiant holdout where resistance forces led by Massoud, the son of late former Afghan guerrilla commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, are fighting the Taliban. Over the days, both sides have claimed to have an upper hand in Panjshir, even as neither of the parties have produced any conclusive proof to support the claim.Afghanistan fell to the Taliban last month as the United States and its NATO allies began withdrawing their forces from the country, ending the 20-year long war. The forces had entered the south Asian country in 2001 in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack for anti-terror operations.With the collapse of the Afghan government which was led by President Ashraf Ghani, the Taliban is now set to form its government. Meanwhile, Ghani has fled to the United Arab Emirates along with his family and key officials.On Sunday, Ahmad issued a statement, calling for an end to the fighting and offered a ‘peace’ deal. The leader of the resistance force said he is ready to ask his forces to lay down their weapons, only if the Taliban agrees to end their assault.However, late on Sunday dozens of vehicles loaded with the Taliban were seen swarming into Panjshir Valley, according to a report by Associated Press.Meanwhile, the Taliban has assured the residents of Panjshir that they will be safe and the group aims to serve the country for a "common goal.""We give full confidence to the honourable people of Panjshir that they will not be subjected to any discrimination, that all are our brothers, and that we will serve a country and a common goal," said Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid in his statement earlier.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-crisis-nrf-leader-says-resistance-forces-still-present-in-panjshir-101630928240714.html
06-09-2021||World||University classes resume in Afghanistan with a 'curtain of separation'||A local news agency in Afghanistan reported on Monday that university classes started in the country but with a "curtain of separation". A photo posted on Twitter by Aamaj News shows male and female students sitting in a class room with curtains between them.در تصویر: دروس دانشگاه با پرده جدایی آغاز شد #آماج_نیوز pic.twitter.com/2we0oqRnbSThis is a result of education policy outline given by the Taliban, now in power in Afghanistan, through their diktats. Taliban have said in many interviews that they have no issue with women education "but they should study with a hijab".In a lengthy order issued on Saturday, the Taliban ordered women attending private Afghan universities to wear an abaya robe and niqab covering most of the face. They also said that classes must be segregated by sex - or at least divided by a curtain.The Taliban diktat said that female students should only be taught by other women, but if that was not possible then "old men" of good character could fill in.Women must also end their lesson five minutes earlier than men to stop them from mingling outside, the Taliban order further said.For students, the curtains have become a barrier. "Putting up curtains is not acceptable," Anjila, a 21-year-old student at Kabul University who returned to find her classroom partitioned, told news agency Reuters by telephone."I really felt terrible when I entered the class ... We are gradually going back to 20 years ago."The decree, said Taliban, applies to private colleges and universities, which have mushroomed since their first rule ended in 2001.During that period, girls and women were mostly excluded from education because of rules regarding same-sex classrooms and the insistence they had to be accompanied by a male relative whenever they left the house.A journalism professor at Herat University in the west of the country told Reuters he decided to split his one-hour class into two halves, first teaching females and then males.Of 120 students enrolled for his course, less than a quarter showed up at school on Monday.The Taliban have assured of a moderate and inclusive government this time and have issued statements in a bid to build confidence. But on the ground, situation hasn't changed much.On Saturday, a pregnant Afghan policewoman Banu Nigara was shot dead by Taliban fighters in front of her husband and children at her home in Firozkoh, local media reported. “Nigara a police officer was shot dead infront of her kids and husband last night at 10PM in Ghor province. Nigara was 6 months pregnant, she was shot dead by the Taliban,” leading Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary tweeted on Sunday citing her family members.The Taliban have, however, denied they were involved in the killing of Nigara.Colleges and higher education institutions opened in Afghanistan on Monday after remaining closed for months, first due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and later because of chaos in the war-torn country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/university-classes-resume-in-afghanistan-with-a-curtain-of-separation-101630925501362.html
06-09-2021||World||New Taliban provincial governor vows to fight IS||As a Taliban commander, he spent years battling the former Afghan government. Now, with his hardline movement back in power, Mullah Neda Mohammad vows to continue fighting against rival jihadists, the Islamic State (IS) group.Following the Taliban's victory in August, Mohammad took over as governor of Nangarhar province, home to the IS Afghanistan-Pakistan chapter's stronghold."We are searching for individuals who are hiding," Mohammad told AFP, claiming his forces have arrested 70 to 80 IS members since they took control of Nangarhar's provincial capital Jalalabad, the country's fifth biggest city.IS have been responsible for some of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan of recent years, massacring civilians at mosques, shrines, public squares and even hospitals.The group claimed responsibility for a devastating suicide bombing near Kabul airport on August 26 that killed more than 100 Afghans and 13 US soldiers.It was the deadliest attack against American forces in Afghanistan since 2011.After the blast, the US military said it had carried out a drone strike against an IS "planner" in the Nangarhar province.Still, Mohammad says he does not believe IS poses a great a threat as they did in Iraq and Syria."Here they have suffered many casualties in northern and eastern Afghanistan," he told AFP in Jalalabad, at the governor's palace, now decked with Taliban flags.With the Taliban in power, "there will be no reason for (IS) to be here", he said. "We don't consider IS as a threat."Bloody infightingAlthough both IS and the Taliban are hardline Sunni Islamist militants, they have differed on the minutiae of religion and strategy, while each claiming to be the true flag-bearers of jihad.That tussle has led to bloody fighting between the two.One IS commentary published after the fall of Kabul accused the Taliban of betraying jihadists with the US withdrawal deal, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors militant communications.The latest estimates of IS's strength vary from 500 active fighters to as high as several thousand, according to a UN report in July.However, a spree of prison breaks by the Taliban during their summer offensive also led to many IS militants being released.The Taliban swept to power with staggering speed, and Mohammad described how he and his fighters were able to march on Jalalabad without firing a shot.There had been intense fighting against former government forces in nearby Sherzad as they made their advance, but once the Taliban took the village they received word of a surrender.Jalalabad's former leaders "sent a representative who told us that they did not want to fight any more and wanted to hand over the local government peacefully", Mohammad said."We built our organisation here," he said. "We appointed the police chief, intelligence chief and the governor -- which was given to me."Scarred by memories After two decades of fighting an insurgency, the Taliban must rapidly transition into a governing force that can manage a humanitarian crisis and war-wrecked economy.It has resulted in commanders more at ease with organising ambushes now running cities of hundreds of thousands of people.Like most in Afghanistan, the people of Nangarhar are scarred by the memories of the Taliban's brutal reign in the 1990s, which was infamous for deaths by stoning, girls being banned from school and women from working in contact with men.The province's new governor has offered reassuring words, but many people remain sceptical about the Taliban's pledge of a different kind of rule."We will protect their rights and we won't allow criminals to harm the people of Afghanistan, particularly the people of Nangarhar," Mohammad said.Despite the assurances, an aid worker in Jalalabad said on condition of anonymity that "a lot of people in the city are not happy, and they are afraid for freedom of expression".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-taliban-provincial-governor-vows-to-fight-is-101630924486774.html

06-09-2021||World||International flights from Kabul airport to resume soon: Report||The Taliban said international flights from Afghanistan will resume shortly as Qatar and Turkey help restart operations at Kabul airport and the group has complete control over the country with the last pocket of resistance in the north now defeated.“Domestic flights have already started and we’re waiting to hear when we can start overseas flights,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed said at a press conference in Kabul. “We plan to start overseas flights very soon.”Restarting international flights and allowing safe passage to Afghans who wish to leave the country is key to the Taliban gaining international legitimacy. The other pledges from the militant group that the international community will watch out for are to allow women to work within the confines of Shariah law, and to prevent their land being used for terror activities.Mujahed addressed a wide range of subjects at Monday’s press conference but gave no details on when the group would announce their new government. “There have been some technical issues that delayed the formation of the new government,” he said. “The issues will be resolved and we will soon then announce the government.”Taliban have said they will be announcing their new ‘inclusive’ government soon. Their Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada will head any governing council and his deputy leader Abdul Ghani Baradar will likely be in charge of the daily functioning of the government, a member of the Taliban Cultural Commission, Bilal Karimi, said last week.The militant group has invited officials from Turkey, China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan and Qatar to participate in the ceremony that will welcome the new government, Afghan television channel 1TVNewsAF, reported citing Al Jazeera.While all of those countries have extended varying degrees of support to the Taliban, on Monday Iran pushed back against the group’s capture of the northern Panjshir valley. Saeed Khatibzadeh, spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry, criticized the Taliban for blockading the region and cutting off food, water and electricity supplies and urged the group to abide by both international law and its own promises to the Afghan people.Pakistan’s military spy chief, Faiz Hameed, arrived in Kabul over the weekend to meet with Taliban leaders to discuss security, border issues and government formation. The U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs Martin Griffiths also met with Baradar in Kabul over the weekend and promised that the international agency would continue to provide humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-flights-from-kabul-airport-to-resume-soon-report-101630922902624.html

"My leader and brother Ahmad Massoud is safe and will be giving a message to our people very soon!" Nazary tweeted.The Taliban claimed earlier on Monday that their fighters have captured Panjshir valley - the last pocket of resistance in Afghanistan - but the NRF quickly dismissed the claim. It said that fighting is still going on and that its forces are positioned on all strategic points.Here are the latest developments:1. The NRF posted a tweet from their unverified account on Monday, assuring people of Afghanistan that the struggle against the Taliban and their partners will continue.2. Iran "strongly" condemned the Taliban's military offensive against holdout fighters in Afghanistan. "The news coming from Panjshir is truly worrying. The assault is strongly condemned," Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh told reporters.3. The resistance in Panjshir is being led by Massoud - the son of the iconic anti-Taliban fighter Ahmad Shah Massoud who was killed just days before the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States - and former Afghan vice president Amrullah Saleh, who has vowed to not surrender before Taliban.4. In a statement on Sunday, Massoud's son Ahmad called for an end to the fighting. The young British-schooled Massoud said his forces were ready to lay down their weapons but only if the Taliban agreed to end their assault.5. The statement was issued as Taliban claimed victory over Panjshir. Late on Sunday, dozens of vehicles loaded with Taliban fighters were seen swarming into the valley. News agency AP quoted witnesses to report that thousands of Taliban fighters overran eight districts of Panjshir overnight.6. Fahim Dashti, the spokesman for the anti-Taliban group, was killed in battle on Sunday, according to the group’s Twitter account. Dashti was the voice of the group and a prominent media personality during previous governments.7. He was also the nephew of Abdullah Abdullah, a senior official of the former government who is involved in negotiations with the Taliban on the future of Afghanistan.8. The whereabouts of Saleh and the young Massoud are not known.9. A Taliban spokesperson, meanwhile, said on Monday that a new Afghan government would be announced soon, but he did not specify when.10. The spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid called on former members of the Afghan forces to integrate with the new hardline rulers and added that any insurgency against their rule would be "hit hard".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/panjshir-valley-latest-developments-afghan-resistance-force-claims-ahmad-massoud-safe-101630916428929.html

The Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said at a press conference there are “some technical things left” and that the new Afghan government to be announced could be interim with a view toward changes in the future, according to Reuters. "Final decisions have been taken, we are now working on the technical issues. We will announce the new government as soon as the technical issues are resolved,” Mujahid said.Reports in the past week have said that there has been a power struggle between two senior Taliban leaders— the group’s co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and Anas Haqqani. The disagreement between Baradar and Haqqani has mostly been on the way the group handles the resistance forces in Panjshir.An unverified Twitter handle of Panjshir Observer, which describes itself as an independent news outlet covering Afghanistan and Panjshir, said the gunfire heard last Friday was over the tussle between the two senior Taliban leaders."Gunfire last night in Kabul was a power struggle between two senior Taliban leaders.

06-09-2021||World||Works of 3 Indian directors to feature at Toronto film festival||Three debut features from Indian directors, two fiction and one documentary, will be showcased at the 46 edition of North America’s leading movie event, the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).Two of the films selected for the 10-day festival, which begins on September 9, are debut projects and both are featured in the Discovery section, a platform to introduce fresh talent.Mumbai-based Ritwik Pareek directs the Hindi film Dug Dug, which will have its world premiere at TIFF. A satirical film, it has at its core bizarre events surrounding a motorcycle that unleashes religious fervour. TIFF programmer Peter Kuplowsky described the feature as a “slick satire of religious commercialism and uninhibited idolatry” as Pareek’s maiden venture “abounds with irreverent wit and formal invention, exuding an irresistible zeal that mesmerises as it begs the biggest of questions”. The film, inspired by the esoteric temples Jaipur-born Pareek visited frequented with his grandmother in the remotest villages of Rajasthan, “astutely explores the contagious power of faith and its metaphysical - and often transactional -mysteries”, Kuplowsky noted.Just as unconventional in its theme is Nithin Lukose’s Paka (River of Blood). This Malayalam movie was touted by TIFF’s co-head Cameron Bailey as a “Romeo and Juliet-esque vengeance tale is set deep in the forests of Kerala, where the river is witness to a violent, generations-old feud”. He went to call it a “riveting modern folktale”.The third Indian film that will figure at TIFF will be Payal Kapadia’s debut feature-length documentary A Night of Knowing Nothing, which is in Hindi and Bengali. Calling it one of the year’s “most electrifying debuts”, TIFF programmer Andrea Picard said this was “a fever dream of impossible love tied to a broader reflection on contemporary India”. The documentary has already received global acclaim, being awarded Best Documentary at Cannes and Picard gushed that this film “announces the arrival of an audacious cinematic talent”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/works-of-3-indian-directors-to-feature-at-toronto-film-festival-101630907440634.html
06-09-2021||World||Canada polls: ‘Parties must reject vote-based divisive politics’||Major Indo-Canadian groups are becoming increasingly active as the 2021 Federal elections approach, in an effort to place their interests on the agenda of the main national political parties and their leaders.The umbrella National Alliance of Indo-Canadians (NAIC), which includes 30 organisations, has sent representations to the leaders of the principal parties, including Justin Trudeau, leader of the ruling Liberal Party and Erin O’Toole, leader of the opposition Conservative Party. The letters were also sent to the leaders of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Greens and Bloc Quebecois.The letter states that support for the objectives outlined “would garner support from the incredible Indo-Canadian community”. Among these are to representing the “viewpoint of the politically marginalised Indo-Canadian community in the parliament” and “rejection of vote-based divisive politics, based on ethnicity, religion, race, gender etc”.It also asks for “policy and programmes that integrate and enhance understanding of the Indo-Canadian heritage, including art, music and culture, in the mainstream Canadian society” as well as “better and enhanced Canada-India relations”. These letters are also being distributed to individual candidates as they seek votes from the community. This initiative, a first in Canadian elections by Indo-Canadians, is aimed at countering the increasing influence of pro-Khalistan elements in the country as well as divisions that have emerged between different groups within the community over issues like the ongoing protests in India against three farm laws.Concerns over such friction also led a group of Indo-Canadians to protest outside the offices of NDP leader Jagmeet Singh in the town of Burnaby in British Columbia. Singh represents the riding (as constituencies are called in Canada) of Burnaby South in the House of Commons and the protests started at his official MP’s office before those gathered marched to his campaign headquarters. About 70 people participated in the protest and among them was Sushil Nagar, a resident of Burnaby and, in fact, a constituent of Singh’s riding.Nagar said their objective was to highlight the growing divisions between the Hindu and Sikh communities in Canada over the farm laws and, as the leader of a major Federal party, they wanted Singh to address the matter as elections approach and issue a statement calling for “amity” within the larger community. He said they had held similar events since February this year but Singh had kept “ignoring” their pleas. “We feel like we’re a significant minority in Canada, and in Burnaby. We want a message from him that Hindus and Sikhs should not be divided because of the farmers’ protests,” Nagar said.These developments come as the World Sikh Organisation (WSO) has also issued an election guide for Canadian Sikhs. Among the issues it has raised are an expedited process for immigration of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus to Canada. It also condemned as “misguided” the inclusion of Sikh (Khalistani) Extremism in the 2018 Public Safety Canada Report on the Terrorism Threat to Canada was extremely misguided and called for suspending the Framework for Cooperation on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism between Canada and India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-polls-parties-must-reject-divisive-politics-better-ties-with-india-101630905340929.html

Banu Nigara was said to be killed in front of her husband and children at her home in Firozkoh, reports said. “Nigara a police officer was shot dead infront of her kids and husband last night at 10PM in Ghor province. Nigara was 6 months pregnant, she was shot dead by the Taliban,” leading Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary tweeted on Sunday citing her family members.The Taliban denied they were involved in the killing of Nigara. “We are aware of the incident and I am confirming that the Taliban have not killed her, our investigation is ongoing," Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujaheed told the BBC. Mujaheed said the policewoman could have been killed because of “personal enmity or something else” adding that the Taliban had already confirmed amnesty for people who worked for the previous administration.“Nigara a police officer was shot dead infront of her kids and husband last night at 10PM in Ghor province.

06-09-2021||World||20 years on, pandemic gives 9/11 conspiracists fresh impetus||For Heather Bauer, 9/11 anniversaries are about something other than the fallen Twin Towers, smoking wreckage at the Pentagon, and a crashed airliner in a Pennsylvania field.Instead of the accepted version of events -- that Al-Qaeda conducted the attacks -- she believes the US government was primarily responsible. That is among falsehoods being promoted at various events to mark the 20th anniversary of September 11."I question absolutely everything now, and I wonder how much or what we have been told of history is even really true," Bauer told AFP. That includes Covid-19, which she does not believe exists.Bauer, a Wisconsin homemaker, was 14 when the attacks left nearly 3,000 people dead.She believed the official narrative for years, but after falling into QAnon conspiracy theories, she looked again at the 9/11 story. She now thinks the attacks were orchestrated to justify the war in Iraq that followed in 2003.She is a devoted adherent of the 9/11 truther movement. Its members tirelessly discuss online what they see as evidence that the Twin Towers fell because of controlled demolition techniques, not because commercial planes flew into them.Those claims were developed in incredible detail over the past 20 years, and have been debunked just as minutely by documentarians and journalists.The general idea, including the oft-cited "jet fuel can't melt steel beams" argument, is to prove that some entity must have planted explosives in the towers, because they could not have collapsed so neatly from being hit by planes.- 'Uniquely conspiratorial country' -In-person conferences planned by the truther community for the 20th anniversary of 9/11 will also discuss the origins of the coronavirus pandemic and vaccines.The 17th edition of the "9/11 Truth Film Festival" will take place at an Oakland, California theater and be streamed online, featuring two documentaries related to the pandemic, including "Plandemic," a debunked documentary rife with falsehoods about the virus.Carol Brouillet, the event's organizer and founder of the Northern California 9/11 Truth Alliance, said: "We have so much that we want to cover, and only eight hours."The amount of 9/11 truther content is, as Brouillet said, enormous.One of the festival's speakers, Ken Jenkins, alone has produced dozens of 9/11 DVDs, according to the event's webpage.Conspiracy theories over 9/11 were the first to benefit from widespread internet access, spreading much faster than previous alternative interpretations of history, including about John F. Kennedy's assassination, and the Moon landings."America is a uniquely conspiratorial country," said Garrett Graff, a journalist and author of a book on the subject.With the internet, he said, 9/11 truth theories were able to not only have a greater and faster reach than previous conspiracies, but also enabled those who believed in them to network far more effectively.- 'Anthrax to the pandemic' -"9/11 conspiracies arrived at the precise moment where social media and online media like YouTube really began to allow people to spread these ideas in big and colorful and compelling ways," he added.Like Brouillet's group, the Lawyers' Committee for 9/11 Inquiry will hold a conference on the 20th anniversary, and will feature a Covid-19 discussion.The event is named "From 9/11-Anthrax to the Pandemic," in reference to letters containing the poisonous substance sent to journalists and politicians over several weeks in September 2001.For Mick Harrison, an Indiana lawyer and the committee's litigation director, the connection between the anthrax in 2001 and the Covid-19 virus today is clear."Because we researched the history of US work on bioweapons for the anthrax case, we're now concerned that there may be an ongoing problem with the use of bioweapons in this country," Harrison said.Asked about why they are fighting to overturn an established 20-year-old narrative, Bauer and Harrison both said they saw it as a civic duty."I'm trying to make this country better by making its government more democratic, more accountable, more transparent," Harrison said."9/11 is a big problem in that regard, because we still don't know the truth about what happened."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/20-years-on-pandemic-gives-9-11-conspiracists-fresh-impetus-101630893966439.html

The head of Guinea’s special forces, Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, announced the takeover on state television on Sunday and urged the armed forces to back him.The action was taken to address financial mismanagement and corruption in Guinea under President Alpha Conde, he said. “If you see the condition of our roads, of our hospitals, you realise that it is time for us to wake up,” Doumbouya said. “We are going to initiate a national consultation to open an inclusive and peaceful transition.”Guinea vies with Australia as China’s largest supplier of bauxite, the raw material used to make alumina and eventually aluminium. The country shipped 82.4 million tons of the mineral globally last year, according to government data. Much of that went to China, which is the world’s biggest aluminium-consuming country.After seizing the airwaves, the mutinous soldiers vowed to restore democracy and gave themselves a name: The National Committee of Gathering and Development.Doumbouya sat draped in a Guinean flag with a half dozen other soldiers in uniform alongside him as he read the statement, “The duty of a soldier is to save the country.”He made no mention of Conde’s whereabouts and it was not immediately known where the 83-year-old leader was after Sunday’s developments.UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres condemned the coup in Guinea and urged putschists who said they had seized power to release the country’s detained president. “I strongly condemn any takeover of the government by force of the gun,” Guterres tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coup-in-guinea-new-leader-says-govt-is-dissolved-101630877607548.html
06-09-2021||World||Joe Biden to visit all three sites of 9/11 attacks||US President Joe Biden will visit all three 9/11 memorial sites to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks and pay his respects to the nearly 3,000 people killed that day.Biden will visit ground zero in New York City, the Pentagon and the memorial outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where United Flight 93 was forced down, the White House said on Saturday. He will be accompanied by first lady Jill Biden.Vice-president Kamala Harris will travel to Shanksville for a separate event before joining the president at the Pentagon, the White House said. Harris will travel with her spouse, Doug Emhoff.Biden’s itinerary is similar to the one former president Barack Obama followed in 2011 on the 10th anniversary of the attacks. Obama’s visit to New York City coincided with the opening of a memorial at the site where the iconic World Trade Center towers once stood.Next Saturday’s anniversary falls less than two weeks after the end of the nearly two-decade-long US war in Afghanistan. The war was launched weeks after the 9/11 attacks to retaliate against the Al-Qaeda plotters and the Taliban, who provided them safe haven.Biden has found support from the public for ending the conflict but has faced sharp criticism, even from allies, for the chaotic evacuation of US troops and allied Afghans during the final two weeks of August.Biden on Friday directed the declassification of certain documents related to the September 11 attacks in a gesture towards victims’ families who have long sought the records in hopes of implicating the Saudi Arabian government.The conflict between the government and the families over what classified information could be made public came into the open last month after many relatives, survivors and first responders said they would object to Biden’s participation in 9/11 memorial events if the documents remained classified.Iran tells America: Stop addiction to sanctionsIran has urged the United States to stop its addiction to sanctions against the Islamic republic and accused Biden of following the same “dead end” policies as his predecessor Donald Trump.Foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh made his remarks a day after the US treasury announced financial sanctions against four Iranians accused of planning the kidnapping in the US of an American journalist of Iranian descent.“Washington must understand that it has no other choice but to abandon its addiction to sanctions and show respect, both in its statements and in its behaviour, towards Iran,” Khatibzadeh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-visit-all-three-sites-of-9-11-attacks-101630877418826.html

The UN had said that Afghanistan is mired in a humanitarian crisis affecting 18 million people, or half the population.UN aid efforts can finance help for only 38% of the country’s population, so the world body urgently needs nearly $800 million, the report says.“I call on all donors to renew their support so that life-saving response is urgently scaled-up, delivered on time and suffering is mitigated,” said Guterres, who has convened an international aid conference for Afghanistan in Geneva for September 13.He also called on countries to take in Afghan refugees and refrain from deporting any they might already be hosting.Some domestic flights have resumed at Kabul airport, with the state-run Ariana Afghan Airline operating flights to three provinces.Shershah Stor, the airline’s station manager, told AP the flights took place on Saturday to Herat, Kandahar and Balkh provinces. But he added that they were conducted without a functioning radar system at the airport.Taliban accused of killing pregnant cop: BBC reportThe BBC reported on Sunday that Taliban fighters gunned down a policewoman who was pregnant, citing witnesses.

06-09-2021||World||India has good reason to worry over Taliban's rise: Ex-CIA official||As someone who oversaw operations in Afghanistan as the CIA's chief for counterterrorism in South and Southwest Asia during 2016-18, Douglas London had a ringside view of key developments and events that culminated with the fall of Kabul to the Taliban on August 15.London, who was involved in assessments of Afghanistan prepared for former US president Donald Trump and consulted as a volunteer with Joe Biden’s counterterrorism working group during the campaign for the last presidential election, says India has good reason to worry about the rise of the Taliban, given Pakistan’s backing for the group and the complicated security scenario in the region.The CIA veteran, who retired in 2019 after 34 years of service, argues that what happened in Afghanistan was worse than an intelligence failure, and outlines the Haqqani Network’s long-standing ties with the Pakistani military. London, who is publishing a memoir of his time at the CIA this month, “The Recruiter: Spying and the lost art of American intelligence”, talks about how the US-Taliban peace deal of 2020 was the “worst agreement” the US has ever negotiated.This conversation was edited for clarity.Senior US officials such as Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have implied an intelligence failure with regard to the Taliban victory in Afghanistan. You have been arguing it's much worse than that.Under both the Biden and Trump administrations, I observed that the calculus for Afghanistan policy was more geared towards domestic political considerations as opposed to national security issues resulting from the consequences of leaving or staying in Afghanistan. In my opinion, that made it worse than an intelligence failure, which would have been the case had the intelligence community failed to forecast the developments which played out or became aware of crucial information but neglected to bring to the attention of policy-makers. Neither of those scenarios turned out to be the case nor influenced the decisions taken by both administrations.Were you surprised by the speed at which the Taliban marched into Kabul?Every scenario is forecasted against a range of conditions and “what ifs”. So when an assessment is done – and I’m sure the RAW and IB do it the same way – they offer a range of possible outcomes given projected conditions and policies. The assessment for such outcomes varied based on scenarios, which ranged from different levels of US forces or the timeline for US withdrawal, and for the state of progress in negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government. Another key factor was the stability of the Afghan government. As it turned out, we faced the worst case scenario, under which [President Ashraf] Ghani was unable to maintain strong alliances with various political and regional groups, while at the same time the US had highlighted its intent to go early on. Meanwhile, the Taliban proved insincere in its pledge to pursue a political rather than military settlement and increased the level of violence while undercutting the government's cohesion by negotiating and paying off regional opponents who were left unpaid, unsupported and without US military or logistical support. Under such circumstances, it was expected the government could collapse within days to weeks. I think Gen Milley's comments that he never saw an assessment projecting “the government could collapse in 11 days” were good political theatre but no intelligence assessment predicts to a day.You’ve also described the 2020 deal between the US and the Taliban as catastrophic. One of the things that surprised people in India was how the Taliban were not being held to any commitments.I think the problem was the treaty language wasn't really binding to specific commitments, and offered the Taliban room for interpretation. So, when the US negotiated the treaty, it didn't even require the Taliban to recognise the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan by name. Yet the Taliban were recognised in the agreement by their name, “the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan known as the Taliban”. The Taliban had the freedom to interpret the agreement because the language only required them to talk to other Afghan parties, leaving them the room to choose who they thought were legitimate or non-legitimate representatives. Even in the prisoner exchange of about 5,000 people, if you look at the language, the agreement said they were to be released by the “other side”, it didn't even speak to an official entity or name the Afghan government.Regarding relationships with terrorist groups, the Taliban believed it was required only to prevent Afghan territory from being used for terrorist operations. The Taliban saw no requirement to break their relationships or expel such groups, let alone turn over those indicted for prosecution by other countries. Now, if you noticed, I think about a week ago, a Taliban spokesman mentioned the Taliban was yet to be convinced that al-Qaeda was responsible for 9/11. So bearing that in mind, how likely do you think it is that the Taliban would acknowledge the presence of foreign terrorists on their soil, let alone turn them over?So, if you look at the conditions [in the treaty], they didn't reduce violence. Violence increased remarkably within the week after the February 2020 agreement was signed, they chose not to recognise any official representatives of the government and they didn't cut ties to terrorists. The only aspect to which they held was in not instigating attacks against US forces, but that was in their own interests. By not instigating attacks, they didn’t provoke retaliation or increase the possibility the US would stay or increase its forces. So it was probably, diplomatically speaking, the worst agreement I've ever seen the US negotiate.You’ve also been critical of the role played by former secretary of state Mike Pompeo and Zalmay Khalilzad, the special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, especially how Pompeo championed the agreement despite intelligence warnings.Pompeo was the director of the CIA before he became secretary of state. During that time is when [president Donald Trump] announced the new South Asian strategy, in August 2017. That was the result of the intelligence community really sounding the alarm about the consequences of a precipitous US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the potential resurgence of al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups in an accelerated fashion, enabling them to resume external plotting, including against the US homeland. Pompeo supported that view in 2017 and the intelligence never changed.In 2018, [president Trump] lost patience very quickly, before the new South Asian policy was given time to reap results. He had made it clear that he wanted to leave Afghanistan expeditiously. For political considerations, Pompeo flipped and went ahead to provide the president a solution to support his desire in spite of the intelligence. He wound up connecting with Khalilzad, who was conducting his own independent effort at the time to try to get back into the action by talking to Afghans he believed represented the Taliban. That's how he sold his way into Pompeo’s circle and thus became the new special representative, usurping the work of then US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs, Alice Wells, who was taking a hard stand with the Taliban and Pakistan. It's my personal opinion that Khalilzad was willing to do anything it took to gain Trump's favour because he was hoping to become secretary of state to replace Pompeo on the assumption, which was pretty much the given at that time in the US, that Pompeo was looking at a Senate run, which he then abandoned later on due a lack of political support.A recent development that really struck people in South Asia was when the state department spokesperson said the Taliban and the Haqqani Network are separate entities. Do you have any thoughts on that?Clearly, he misspoke. That's not the position of the US government. Officially, we identify the Haqqani Taliban Network – that’s actually its official name in the US intelligence community – as being part of the Taliban. The Haqqanis are, by themselves, a vast and longstanding criminal network, but they swore bay’aht, pledged allegiance to the Taliban and fought under the Taliban and really provided the teeth to the Taliban strategy, which was to destabilise the Afghan government by attacks in the cities, including massive suicide bomber attacks, truck bombs and vehicle-borne IEDs, which really did shake up the government.They concurrently promoted a military campaign in the rural areas and the countryside to try to isolate the provincial capitals and the big cities.I know [state department spokesperson] Ned Price made that comment, which was really unfortunate and Jen Psaki upheld it, but it is at odds with the official US government view as related by the intelligence community. All you need to do is look up the Rewards for Justice and the state department website, and you'll see it's the Haqqani Taliban Network.Admiral Mike Mullen, former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, described the Haqqani Network as a “veritable arm” of the ISI in 2011.The Haqqanis are in bed and in league with the ISI. I wouldn't say they're a product of the ISI, which was responsible for enabling the Taliban and the Haqqani Network. Without the sanctuary from which the Taliban and Haqqanis could protect their leaders and move materials, arms and fighters across the border, they could not have endured and prevailed, but I don't believe the ISI actually created the Haqqanis. The Haqqani Network is long-standing, it’s principally a criminal network involved in narcotics, extortion, real estate and all of that business for years and years.They [the ISI] certainly provided great support to the Haqqanis, but it was a co-dependent relationship. The Haqqanis profited from the ISI and the ISI profited from the Haqqanis.Images have emerged of the ISI chief arriving in Kabul for meetings with the Taliban. What do you make of that?I've seen pictures of Lt Gen Faiz Hameed. These are all people he's met before. I mean he was meeting them in Pakistan, though obviously they can’t acknowledge that. So, it's simply taking the relationship to a different place out in the open, and at a different and now official level.With the Taliban clearly facing problems on the economic front, how important will be the role of the Haqqanis in managing finances for the regime in Kabul?The Haqqanis are looking after their own finances. Their priorities are money, the family and their own establishments in the north and northeast. I hear the commentary by the White House and other governments, which suggests that because of this great financial need that the Taliban will have in governing, that there will be leverage on the part of the West. I'm not so confident because what the Taliban does not want is interconnectivity between Afghanistan and the rest of the world. There's a reason they would like to keep Afghanistan free from global integration.I believe they're prepared to look for ways to finance essentially an agrarian subsistence economy but they’re going to have more trouble in the cities, where 20 years of development and education have raised expectations. I don't see the Taliban, despite their lip service, wanting significant industrial development for the country that could provide more influence and presence to the West, which for them brings with it all the problems of keeping its own society in line with a very reactionary and repressive philosophy. In a way, I see a similarity between the Taliban leadership and the hardliners in Iran, who want to be free from the threat of sanctions, influence and pressures the West can use in its investments to leverage change in their country. I think the Taliban will be content to find a way to be self-sufficient to the point of subsistence, which I think is in their power to do over time based on their regional relationships with China and other sources of income. They’re going to court a variety of foreign investments from China and others without becoming overly reliant on any one, particularly Western sources. China's desire to press ahead with its Belt and Road Initiative will make them an enthusiastic partner. They're going to benefit from foreign remittances among Afghan labourers abroad, donations and criminal enterprises such as the narcotics trade. I think their preference is not to get too far down the line with great development projects, which will leave them vulnerable politically to outside influence and pressure and require global integration that might threaten their control at home.The Taliban seem to have learned how to handle public relations better and the projection of issues such as human rights in an apparent effort to get some sort of legitimacy. But will the world community be able to hold them to these commitments?I think they became very media-savvy because they pursued a very concentrated disinformation programme throughout the war, for which we gave them lots of material to use, what with the civilian casualties and the errant airstrikes. It totally fed into their narrative, and they became very aware of how successful that was. It worked very well and they got better press than the Afghan government did. A lot of their success was making more out of their gains than was really happening militarily, because they weren't winning military battles in their final conquest. They were basically paying people off and negotiating their way from city to city and town to town, similar to what they had done in 1996.The West kept talking about this great juggernaut, which really played into their strategy. If you're sitting up in Balkh or somewhere else in the north or west, you'd be thinking they’re going to take over the country and it would be better to cut a deal. And in terms of the Taliban's pledge to be different than they were in regards to the rights of women and other basic civil liberties, that dialogue and messaging is not from the people who've been making the decisions for the Taliban for the last 20 years. Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai has been out of the country for 20 years. He was part of the Taliban five who were traded for [kidnapped US soldier Bowe] Bergdahl. Moreover, Stanekzai was under house arrest by the Taliban before 9/11 and Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar was left to rot in prison for eight years. If the Taliban really wanted Baradar out, I guarantee you they could have gotten him out. They made no such effort because he was long out of favour with the Taliban's senior leaders then living in Pakistan.So, all these people that are talking about Taliban 2.0, a kinder, gentler Taliban are under the lights of cameras, whereas we don't know what’s going on where we have no visibility, nor what's in the minds of the Taliban's actual decision-makers.The reflections I see on social media suggest rather that it's the same old Taliban, they’re hunting enemies, they're executing people, they're torturing, and they’re keeping women at home. That's the Taliban, and decisions are not being made by Baradar, Stanekzai or any of these folks now on camera. The decisions are being made by a much closer circle of people from whom we don't hear.Given your focus on South Asia in your last role in the CIA, what implications will the rise of the Taliban have for this region and primarily for India? There is evidence out there of the presence of fighters from Pakistani groups in Afghanistan and what does that mean for regional security?I think India has good reason to worry. Pakistan's policies of supporting various jihadist groups and the Taliban were all done through the prism of Pakistan-India rivalry. They obviously see your country as an existential threat and any issue or challenge to them is viewed through that prism.My concern is that Pakistan's support of these jihadi groups has unleashed forces that could eventually go beyond their control and threaten the rule even of the generals in Pakistan. What comes then, if the generals are overthrown by jihadist, religious or an ISIS-like set-up, would be very disconcerting.I don't think India has helped itself by its virulent anti-Islamic campaigns and use of nationalism and religion for political gain at home. I think it will leave India as well pretty vulnerable to threats from within as well as from without.Tensions obviously have only increased with China, which is a closer partner with Pakistan and is trying to cultivate a stronger relationship with Afghanistan. China is concerned about what will happen if the Taliban support and cultivate Uyghur separatism in China, and so wish to discourage giving Afghanistan any reason to do so but I see the Taliban leaders as willing to promote and facilitate the jihadist groups with which they have long fought, partnered and even intermarried, and that's a threat for Pakistan, India and the Central Asia republics.Now you have the Taliban in charge of Afghanistan, and I don't see them cutting their ties with any of these groups, with the Kashmiri liberation groups that fought with them over the course of the war, the Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Jaish-e-Mohammed.I think the time has come for regional players like India, the generals in Pakistan, Iran and the Central Asian states to realise that they need to start making some changes and finding a way to work together so as to impede forces that could lead to greater turbulence and instability across the region.I think people need to start talking. I think the Pakistani generals need to realise that time is not on their side, [because of] having cultivated a lot of these forces that can consume them as well. I'm just worried the timing is not right because the Indian government has not extended a hand to the Muslim community inside of India, and is therefore probably not in a real great position to start looking at compromise with the Pakistanis or the Chinese.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-rise-a-concern-for-india-ex-cia-hand-101630869550332.html

In videos circulated on social media, a group of monkeys were seen hopping from bed to bed and scaring patients and attendants in the healthcare centre.Gadag district officials told an online portal which reported about the incident first that a bunch of monkeys entered the children’s ward at the state-run maternity hospital at Gadag’s KC Rani Road and triggered panic among patients and staff. Residents of the area said despite repeated complaints to the forest department, the primates creating ruckus in the area have not been rehabilitated.The four-legged animals have been in the news frequently for creating ruckus in public places. The Mathura municipal board in Uttar Pradesh has started a 15-day programme to nab monkeys from Bankey Bihari temple area in Vrindavan, Chaubiapara and Dwarkadhish temple for creating menace for devotees. “Over half a dozen people lost their lives either due to attack or fear of monkeys in Vrindavan within (past) two years,” the head of an ashram in Mathura told PTI. The monkeys were captured and released in the wild after the forest department gave its nod.Earlier in June of this year, a monkey was spotted riding in a Delhi Metro coach from Yamuna Bank to Indraprastha station in the heart of the capital. The animal had boarded the train from Akshardham metro station and sauntered off before Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) officials could get a hold of it. Following the incident, the DMRC came up with a standard operating procedure for tackling such episodes, and advised passengers to not feed or encourage the animals under any circumstances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monkeys-enter-state-run-hospital-ward-in-karnataka-patients-and-staff-panic-101630952694666.html

However, he took the autorickshaw in a different direction and picked one of his friends en route and both assaulted her at a secluded spot. Later, they threatened to hurt her parents if she raised an alarm and kept on passing her to different locations. Her parents had registered a missing person complaint, and a case of kidnapping was registered based on it on September 1,” read a statement issued by the Pune police. The complaint was lodged by the girl’s father while she is undergoing tests at Sassoon General Hospital.

The move came at the conclusion of ICY’s two-day national executive meeting on Monday.Srinivas BV, president of the Indian Youth Congress, took to Twitter to share a copy of the resolution and said, “At the National Executive meeting of the Indian Youth Congress, IYC jointly passes a resolution that Rahul Gandhi should be appointed as AICC President as per the constitution of Indian National Congress. It is the wish of lakhs of workers to have him lead us at a time of great adversity.”All national office bearers and all state presidents were present in the meeting.“He (Srinivas BC) also said that in the coming days, the Youth Congress will fight on all burning issues in the interest of the country on the streets and will take this struggle to the people,” a statement from the party’s youth wing read.In the two-day national executive meeting of the IYC, which began on Sunday, the leaders discussed challenges before the organization and how success can be achieved on those challenges, major programs of the organization, internal elections, membership, all the major issues including the campaign were also discussed.“National In-charge of Indian Youth Congress and AICC Joint-Secretary Shri Krishna Allavaru ji said that every single worker of Indian Youth Congress will fight against this dictatorial government in the coming days and will work to take the ideology of Congress party and the message of Shri Rahul Gandhi ji to the people of the country,” the IYC statement added.Rahul Gandhi, who took over as Congress president from Sonia Gandhi in 2017, quit the post after the party’s flop show in the 2019 general elections.In his resignation letter, Rahul Gandhi had stated that a non-Gandhi should head the Congress, which has mostly been run by members of the Nehru-Gandhi family during its 135-year-long history.The political resolution, which was also passed unanimously by the IYC in Goa, sought to protest the Chinese illegal occupation of India’s sovereign land and demanded that India reclaim its sovereign territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/youth-congress-passes-resolution-to-reappoint-rahul-gandhi-as-party-chief-101630950045666.html

The house was recently allocated to Union railway minister, Ashwani Vaishnaw.According to a leader close to Chirag Paswan, the family had sought time from the government to vacate the house, which was agreed to. “The family has made it clear that they will vacate the house and take the bust with them as well. There is no controversy or disagreement over the issue,” the leader said.Chirag Paswan, who represents Jamui Lok Sabha constituency in Bihar, has been allotted a house in North Avenue and will be moving there soon, the leader said.“On September 13 there is a meeting of the senior party leaders in Patna where some crucial decisions will be taken, including on when the house will be vacated,” the leader said.In 2014, the Union cabinet had decided not to allow any government housing to be turned into a memorial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ljp-denies-speculation-of-paswan-family-s-reluctance-to-vacate-12-janpath-bunglow-101630948607080.html

India administered 10,576,296 vaccines on Monday at the time of writing this report.With Monday’s vaccination tally, India has now vaccinated at least 69.72 crore people, out of which, 53.43 crore people have been vaccinated against Covid-19 with at least one dose and 16.29 crore people have been fully vaccinated with both doses.India administered more than 1 crore vaccines first on August 27 when 10,064,032 people got the shots. India’s health workers helped break this record once again when the nation recorded 1.09 crore vaccinated on August 31.The Prime Minister while addressing a virtual gathering earlier in the day said that the nation is administering a record 1.25 crore Covid-19 vaccine shots. PM Modi stressed that this figure is larger than the entire population of several nations.“India is creating a record by administering 1.25 crore vaccines every day. The number of vaccines administered in a single day by India is more than the entire population of several countries,” PM Modi said. He also lauded efforts undertaken by health workers and the nation’s Covid-19 warriors.Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya in a series of tweets congratulated PM Modi for leading the fight against Covid-19. “September has started on a high note as India touches 1 crore COVID-19 vaccinations today. Under PM Narendra Modi's leadership, the world's largest vaccination drive is scaling massive heights,” Mandaviya said.India’s health ministry as well as Union leaders and chief ministers of various states, however, have asked citizens to not abandon Covid-19 preventative measures ahead of the upcoming festive season.

06-09-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: Sept 7, 1969 — PM, Kosygin discuss bilateral issues||New Delhi- Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi discussed world issues and Indo-Soviet relations at an hour-long meeting at Palam airport this morning. The talks were held at a secured first-floor room attached to the VIP lounge. There was no aide present with either leader barring Mr Kosygin’s language interpreter. The Soviet Premier, on way to Hanoi leading a high-power Soviet Communist Party and Government delegation to Dr Ho Chi Minh’s funeral, stopped over for an hour, altering his earlier plan to halt in Calcutta for refuelling. Foreign Minister Dinesh Singh was also at the airport, but did not join the talks. Readily agreeing to newsmen’s request, Mr Kosygin himself gave a brief account of the discussions. He said when Prime Ministers of two “great countries -India and the Soviet Union- meet they have quite a lot to talk about.” On bilateral relations, he said, the two Premiers had come to the “joint conclusion” after the talks that there were progressing in the direction of further strengthening. The discussions on international questions, he said, covered all those issues which were I “troubling the world.” The talks were “useful, important and necessary,” he added. Only clue Mr Kosygin did not list the specific subjects discussed at the meeting. Mrs Gandhi took off for Lucknow in a special IAF aircraft within minutes of the Soviet Premier’s departure without leaving a brief even for the officials. The only clue, therefore, is Mr Kosygin’s description that global issues included those “troubling the world.” These would evidently include Vietnam, West Asia and last but not the least, the, reports on the impending clash of arms between the Soviet Union and China. According to some observers here, the main significance of the Soviet Premier’s last-minute change of programme for a meeting with Mrs Gandhi lies in the delicate balance Moscow maintains in its relations with India and Pakistan. There are reports of new doubts assailing New Delhi on account of the recent Islamabad announcement on Pakistan President Yahya Khan’s visit to Moscow later this month. The members of the Soviet delegation, travelling with Mr Kosygin, included Party Secretary Katoshev and the President of the Russian Federation, Mr Yasnov. Also on the plane were two North Vietnamese, including the DRVN Ambassador to Moscow, Mr Nguyen Tho Chan. Among those who went to Palam airport to greet the Soviet Premier was DRVN Consul-General here, Mr Nguyen Hoa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-sept-7-1969-pm-kosygin-discuss-bilateral-issues-101630945425747.html

We'll go to every state where they've killed democracy,” the TMC general secretary told reporters on Monday.Abhishek Banerjee, who was in Delhi after being summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), levelled allegations against BJP, adding that he has been questioned for the last eight hours. “Anyone who fights against the BJP is harassed. This case has arisen out of Kolkata, I've been summoned to Delhi. I have been asked questions non-stop for the last 8 hours. From day one, I've been asking to bring evidence, if any, against me into public domain,” the TMC leader said.“BJP's tyranny will be defeated. Let BJP put all its might, vigour, threat and resources, mind my words, their resources are going to fall flat. TMC will defeat BJP in next polls,” he added.Abhishek Banerjee is being investigated by ED in a money laundering case linked to an alleged coal pilferage scam in Bengal. His statement was recorded under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on Monday in Delhi. His wife Rujira Banerjee had also been summoned to Delhi on September 1 by the investigative agency but she had asked the agency to reconsider, citing that as a mother of young children travelling during a pandemic puts her in risk.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had come to her nephew’s defence, alleging that BJP is “letting loose” central agencies on political opponents."The BJP and the Union government can't fight us politically. The party was defeated in the assembly polls, and now they are using central agencies against our leaders like Abhishek Banerjee and others. But let me tell them they can't bulldoze or intimidate us with such threats. We will continue our fight against them," the TMC supremo told party supporters on August 28. She also challenged BJP to fight them “politically” in the 2023 Tripura Assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-won-t-accept-defeat-like-congress-abhishek-banerjee-hits-out-at-bjp-after-grilling-by-ed-101630944312793.html

In the letter, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan also suggested containment measures as he confirmed that a team of experts have found that a majority of cases of viral fever and deaths among children in Firozabad are due to dengue, a few cases of scrub typhus and leptospirosis.The central team of experts included officials of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP).Under the recommended measures, Bhushan asked the district administration to screen all patients with fever for dengue, malaria, scrub typhus and leptospirosis. The senior official also asked the administration to "strengthen ELISA based testing facilities.""Activities related to fever survey, vector control and fever camps to continue as per micro plan submitted by the central team," the health secretary also wrote in the letter.Meanwhile, the NCDC deputed two officials in the district for the next 14 days to assist the district administration in strengthening its outbreak response.This comes as the western part of Uttar Pradesh is battling a major outbreak of dengue. Firozabad and Mathura are the worst-affected districts in the region where more than 100 cases have been reported in the past two weeks. The viral disease has claimed 51 lives so far, most of them being children.The Firozabad district administration is releasing about 25,000 fish that eat larvae of dengue-breeding mosquitoes in ponds to check the spread of the disease, news agency PTI reported quoting a senior district official.The fishes, generically known as Gambusia, are reportedly being released in ponds in urban as well as rural areas of the district.Meanwhile, district magistrate Chandra Vijay Singh directed the health and municipal corporation officials to conduct a door-to-door survey to drain out stagnant water from coolers, pots and other utensils.What the Union health secretary suggested:1) Surveillance to be strengthened with the implementation of Integrated Health Information Platform in the district in coordination with Central Surveillance Unit, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, NCDC.2) Entomological activities to be strengthened and continued as per standard guidelines and standard operating protocols of the NVBDCP.3) Isolation beds and admission facilities in the district hospital of Firozabad and neighbouring districts to be augmented.4) He also asked the administration to organise a short reorientation of all doctors at primary health centres, community health centres and district hospital-cum-medical college of Firozabad and neighbouring districts on recent guidelines for the management of dengue, scrub typhus and leptospirosis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/majority-of-child-deaths-in-up-s-firozabad-due-to-dengue-says-centre-101630943015904.html

Bharatiya Janata Party has started running helter skelter,” the former UP chief minister tweeted.Yadav lauded the Kisan Mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar for birthing a “people’s revolution”as he said that it would help the country progress. “Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar has given birth to a 'people's revolution' which will take the country out of the darkness of BJP's hate politics and towards a new light of peace and progress,” he stated on the microblogging site.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) and Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) had organised a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar on Sunday, which was attended by thousands of farmers from all over the country. BJP leader Varun Gandhi, too, extended his support to the protesting farmers after the Mahapanchayat concluded, becoming the first leader from the ruling party to do so.Farmers’ unions have also called for ‘Mission Uttar Pradesh’ to continue discussions on the three controversial farm laws as the state gears up for assembly elections next year.Yadav also criticized the Yogi Adityanath-led UP government for the rising number of dengue deaths in Firozabad, Mathura, Mainpuri, Kanpur and Farrukhabad, and Lucknow.“There is an outcry in the state due to dengue and viral fever. There are huge crowds in hospitals, and children are dying due to a lack of proper and timely treatment. The BJP government is, however, not paying attention to the collapsed health services in the state,” Yadav said in a party statement on Monday, alleging that the state government is ignoring it all and making false claims of “all is well”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/success-of-muzaffarnagar-kisan-mahapanchayat-caused-bjp-to-run-helter-skelter-akhilesh-yadav-101630943343123.html

We've made all arrangements. Some routes have been diverted and sufficient security forces have been deployed,” Anil Vij was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. The traffic on National Highway 44, which connects Delhi to Chandigarh, will be diverted from Karnal district and internet and SMS services will be suspended in and around the protest venue from midnight on Monday.The state government has deployed around 40 companies of additional forces, five superintendent-rank officials and 25 deputy superintendent-rank officials along with thousands of police personnel in Karnal for the Kisan Mahapanchayat.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmers unions protesting against the Centre's contentious agricultural laws, called the crucial Kisan Mahapanchayat on Tuesday in protest against police lathicharge on farmers on an expressway in Karnal on August 28.Hundreds and thousands of farmers plan to gherao the mini-secretariat in Karnal to demand action against sub-divisional magistrate Ayush Sinha over his “break the heads” order.Last week, Haryana police personnel baton-charged a group of protesting farmers in Karnal. The incident drew flak from several quarters after videos of Karnal sub-divisional magistrate Ayush Sinha ordering to “break the heads” of any protesters who "cross the barricades" went viral on social media.Several protesters were injured in the incident, following which SKM leaders sought the resignation of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. The IAS officer has since been transferred.The leaders of farmers unions from Haryana demanded registration of FIRs against Ayush Sinha and police personnel involved in the lathicharge, as well as financial assistance of ₹2 lakh for those injured in the incident.However, they called the Mahapanchayat after talks between Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Gurnam Singh Charuni and Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar failed on Monday morning.A day ago, hundred and thousands of farmers from across the country gathered at Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh to set the stage for ‘Mission Uttar Pradesh’ and continue discussions on issues plaguing them.The gathering was attended by social activists such as Yogendra Yadav and Medha Patkar, who shared a dais with Bharatiya Kisan Union leaders Rakesh Tikait and his brother Naresh Tikait, as well as khaps and farmer leaders.Farmers from across the country have been seeking the repeal of three controversial agriculture-related laws — Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 — which they say will do away with minimum support price for their produce and expose them to exploitations by corporates, even as the Centre claim these laws will bring "reforms" in the agriculture sector through private-sector investment and create supply chains for the produce in the national and global markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kisan-mahapanchayat-karnal-anil-vij-farmers-protest-haryana-101630939485409.html
06-09-2021||India||Nipah virus: Kerala reports another case from Kozhikode||Kerala recorded another case of Nipah virus on Monday in Kozhikode, news agency ANI reported citing Kozhikode district collector GS Sameeran. Earlier on Sunday, the state reported that two healthcare workers showed symptoms of the virus and a 12-year-old boy died due to Nipah.Kerala health minister Veena George earlier said that there were chances that the 12-year-old boy who succumbed to Nipah could have come in contact with a larger number of people. She also said that samples of 7 high-risk contacts were sent to the Pune’s National Institute of Virology for testing.“The most important job is to strengthen contact tracing. We are giving special training to our field workers. It is equally important to find the source of infection. Whether this child is the first to get infected or from where this child was infected,” George was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. She further added that 188 contacts were traced on Sunday and said that there are possibilities that there can be more contacts.A central team is currently in Kozhikode to monitor the Nipah virus spread and is working with the state health department in order to stop further transmission. The team inspected the house of the 12-year-old boy who died due to Nipah virus on Sunday. Kerala health minister Veena George on Sunday said that two healthcare workers also developed symptoms of Nipah virus.Kerala, earlier in 2018, witnessed an outbreak of the Nipah virus due to which 17 people died. Nipah is a zoonotic disease and fruit bats are considered as main vectors. Bat-bitten fruits often spread the disease when consumed by humans. Humans further spread the disease through bodily fluids.If infected a person will experience fever, headache and vomiting along with muscular pain, dizziness, and nausea Some patients may also have signs similar to people suffering from epilepsy. If the disease remains untreated it could trigger brain fever leading to fatalities. The case fatality rate of Nipah virus is 40-80%. The incubation period of Nipah is two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nipah-virus-kerala-reports-another-case-from-kozhikode-101630938460406.html

Is any government or any governing structure officially available in Kabul now? Not yet. It is admitted by Afghans themselves. After decades of war, it hasn't come as a surprise to us,” Kudashev told news agency ANI.He said that when it comes to the motives related to Afghanistan, Moscow’s position is “very close” to that of New Delhi with both Russia and India wanting an Afghan-owned government.“What the two of us need in Afghanistan is security, predictability, inclusive government, which will satisfy the needs of the Afghan people. Afghan-owned and Afghan built government. That’s the basics of the Indian position (which is) very close to us,” Kudashev noted.Addressing the growing worry that Afghanistan will once again become a safe haven for global terrorism, the Russian envoy expressed his concerns. “Whether we are concerned with the promise of the resurrection of terrorism? Yes, we are, same as you do,” he said, adding that the countries can give their best to “prevent the situation in and around Afghanistan.”Speaking about Pakistan-backed terrorism in Afghanistan, Kudashev said, “Let’s offer solutions better, more promising and more attractive than terrorists do.”Let's offer promising solutions than terrorists do. If you want to offer income sources, let's offer development programs. There're multiple platforms to unite our forces. Let's look for creative solutions:Nikolay Kudashev on fears of Pak-backed terrorists to be part Taliban govt pic.twitter.com/nOOFYwt6OvHowever, Kudashev pointed out that he is “optimistic” about the situation in the country improving in the days ahead. “Given them (Afghans) some time and a ray of hope. It’s early to say if there is complete understanding. Let us bring them on board and talk to them and bring our ideas closer to them,” the Russian envoy told ANI.Russia’s reluctance to immediately recognise the Taliban as the new government of Afghanistan comes after the US on Friday echoed similar views. “I want to be really clear: there’s no rush to recognition of any sort by the United States or any international partners we have talked to,” White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters, according to AFP.As per recent reports, Taliban have said that they can announce the new government soon. This comes even as battle continues in Afghanistan’s Panjshir valley between Taliban fighters and the Northern Alliance force. In recent development, the National Resistance Front (NRF) spokesperson Ali Nazary said Ahmad Massoud is safe and that the valley is yet to fall – dismissing Taliban’s claim earlier on Monday that they have captured the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/too-early-russian-envoy-to-india-on-recognising-taliban-as-afghanistan-govt-101630936861102.html

"Fruit bats live in a specific geographical territory. If they fly to other places, naturally this virus can be transmitted," Dr Ashutosh Biswas, a professor at the department of medicine at Aiims said.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Nipah Virus is a respiratory illness that is also known to cause fever, muscular pain, dizziness and nausea. In case the disease aggravates, it can lead to a patient becoming unconscious and contract brain fever, which could be fatal.The virus spreads through the saliva of fruit bats and Bat-bitten fruits are considered to be a major spreader of the disease among humans. The disease can further transmit to other humans through body fluids.The fatality rate of the Nipah virus is 40-80% while its incubation period is two weeks.On Sunday, a 12-year-old boy succumbed to the infection in a first such incident three years after it wreaked havoc in parts of Kozhikode and Malappuram districts of Kerala.Following the child's death, the Centre rushed a team of experts to provide technical support to the southern state. The team also visited the child’s house and collected samples of Rambutan fruits from the vicinity to identify the source of the infection.Meanwhile, the Centre advised locals to follow immediate public health measures including contact tracing for any affected persons in the past 12 days after the infection is diagnosed. The Centre has also called for a strict quarantine of the contacts and isolation of any suspects. It had also asked to actively collect samples and transport them for lab testing for further research.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-specific-treatment-for-nipah-virus-aiims-doctor-says-amid-kerala-outbreak-101630935498535.html

Dhami was addressing a public meeting as a part of the BJP’s Jan Ashirvad Yatra in Almora ahead of the 2022 state assembly polls in the presence of party state president Madan Kaushik, Union minister of state for defence and tourism Ajay Bhatt, Cabinet minister Rekha Arya and other party leaders. “People ask me what is my agenda for the elections. I tell them, it will be there when elections will come, not now. Our overall agenda is the development of Uttarakhand unlike Congress which has only one agenda which is the elections with the sole aim to defeat PM Modi and BJP,” he said. Continuing his attack on Congress, he said, “In the last 70 years of the country, one party and a family has ruled for about 55 years in which it did only appeasement and no development. They never worked to eradicate illiteracy, injustice and poverty. But after PM Narendra Modi led government in 2014, the works of development started.” Also Read | Harish Rawat asks people to vote carefully in 2022During his address, Dhami also raised the issue of filling about 22,000 vacancies in government departments, saying that as soon as his government made the announcement, the Congress alleged that “it’s just an announcement, it’s not possible with just six months remaining before the next elections.” “They are wrong. We have made it possible with the recruitment process starting from August 15. We have the willpower to make it possible...We have also announced various development schemes but the Congress alleged that those are mere announcements as the government doesn’t have funds. They are wrong as the government has adequate funds,” he said. Earlier, Union minister of state Bhatt lauded PM Modi for working for the “welfare of every citizen, unlike Congress”. BJP state president Madan Kaushik said that “2022 assembly elections would be a different one from usual elections.” “It is so because the parties against us don’t talk of development but only of defeating Narendra Modi. One of the prime example of it was Bengal elections in which the BJP went from three seats to 78 but Congress came down from 100 to 0. Despite that, they are claiming that they have succeeded in stopping Modi from forming government in Bengal which is ridiculous,” said Kaushik. Attacking the previous Congress government in state, he added, “They never thought of the welfare of people. When the BJP came to power under the leadership of PM Modi, new development works have started in the state. Now, under the leadership of our young CM, the definition of development has changed. We are always determined to work for the development of state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppositions-agenda-is-only-elections-u-khand-cm-dhami-at-jan-ashirvad-yatra-101630934204313.html
06-09-2021||India||Kerala HC asks Centre to allow registration of Covishield for those who want it early||Kerala high court directed the Centre to allow scheduling of the second dose of Covishield on the CoWIN portal four weeks from the date of the first dose for those who want to vaccinate themselves earlier than the suggested gap of 84 days.A bench headed by Justice PB Suresh Kumar said that if the Centre and state governments can allow people travelling overseas to choose between early and better protection from Covid-19 similar privilege can be extended to people living here. He said that this provision can be allowed if it is needed by the beneficiary in connection with their employment or education.“The fourth respondent (Centre) is directed to make necessary provisions forthwith in the CoWIN portal, so as to enable scheduling of second dose of Covishield vaccine after four weeks of the first dose for those who want to accept the second dose after a period of four weeks in terms of the initial protocol of the vaccine,” the court said in its order.The court also highlighted that according to the policy made by the Union ministry of health, people shall have the choice to get early vaccination because of which vaccine is being distributed through private hospitals as well on payment basis.The court further added that according to rules set by the Centre, vaccination remains voluntary and there is no compulsion on the part of anyone to accept it. The court said that since there is no compulsion therefore the requirement to administer two doses of the vaccine and the time interval between them for better efficacy and protection from Covid-19 can only be seen as an ‘advisory’.It said since people have the right to refuse to accept vaccines, there can be absolutely no reason why the government should take the stand that they will not be permitted to accept the second dose after four weeks in terms of the original protocol, especially when they themselves are procuring Covid-19 vaccine by spending their own money.The court’s observation came after a plea was filed by Kitex Garments Ltd. The firm wanted its workers to administer the second dose of Covishield without having to wait for 84 days.Kitex in its plea said that 5,000 of its workers were vaccinated with the first dose and it made arrangements for vaccinating all of them with the second dose while bearing the entire cost, which was worth ₹93 lakh, but could not go ahead with the vaccination due to prevailing restrictions.Centre expressed its opposition to the plea by saying that the 84-day gap between two doses of Covishield was designated to increase the efficacy of the vaccine, as recommended by National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) and the technical inputs provided by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation in India (NTAGI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-asks-govt-to-allow-registration-of-covishield-for-those-who-want-it-early-101630933795240.html

06-09-2021||India||Days of unilateralism are over: What Jaishankar said on Quad||Union external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday said the Quad grouping is the solution to resistance towards reformation of international organisations.“Days of unilateralism are over, bilateralism has its own limits and multilateralism is simply not working well enough,” Jaishankar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI as he delivered a keynote address at the JG Crawford Oration in Australian National University.S Jaishankar was speaking on India's perspective on the Indo-Pacific and India-Australia relations in the face of global security challenges and rising economic and human toll from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.He stressed that Asia and the Indo-Pacific are vast expanses, with greater diversity and less collective persona.“The focus of Asian sub-regions on growth and modernisation led them to take a relatively minimalistic view of political accompaniment of their economic journey,” the foreign minister was quoted as saying.The Quad, or the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, is a strategic group comprising the United States, Japan, Australia and India. Its first inklings go back to 2007 but a recent resurgence is largely seen as a strategy to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.“As we seek to discern outlines of what emerges next, there's no question that Indo-Pacific would be very much at its core. Even though Asia has been more dynamic than Europe in the last few decades, its regional architecture is far more conservative,” Jaishankar added.ALSO READ | Vaccine partnerships, climate change on agenda of Quad key officials meetPrime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to discuss bilateral ties, the security situation in Afghanistan, counter-terrorism and the Indo-Pacific region with US President Joe Biden during his visit to Washington, DC on September 23.This will be followed by a physical summit of Quad partners on September 24, and Modi's address at the UN General Assembly on September 25.Speaking further on the security challenges in the Asia-Pacific region, Jaishankar said, “Where the US is understandably struggling as an entrenched power in respect of new manifestations of exerting influence and wielding power. It not only has inherent vulnerabilities but also structural constraints while engaging in contemporary forms of competition.”The Indian foreign minister said we have entered a new phase of international relations and the full impact of China's re-emergence will be felt more than those of major powers. “Let's be clear, this is not just about the rise of another power, however major,” he said.Elaborating on Indo-China relations, Jaishankar narrated how former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi went to China in 1988 to boost New Delhi's relationship with Beijing predicated on the fact that the border would be peaceful and tranquil. “We did that by a series of agreements which built confidence, which said don't bring your military to the border,” Jaishankar was quoted as saying.“After 1975 when we had a relatively small clash, we actually had no fatalities on the border. Yet what we saw last year was a complete departure. There was a very large Chinese military presence in very operational mode at the border without a good reason,” Jaishankar further saidHe mentioned the Galwan Valley clash in Eastern Ladakh in June last year, and how it led to the loss of lives on both sides of the Line of Actual Control between India and China. “It has taken the relationship in a completely different direction,” Jaishankar said, adding, “In India, the challenge of how to manage our relationship with China ranks very very high.While China calls the Quad security dialogue as the new NATO framed against Beijing, the Quad partners view it as a grouping where democratic countries can get together and cooperate to build up resilient supply chains, health architecture, disaster management and security to the shipping lanes handling the trade of the world, particularly in the Indo-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/days-of-unilateralism-are-over-what-jaishankar-said-on-quad-101630928538606.html

06-09-2021||India||Sri Lankan refugees hope for citizenship after Tamil Nadu CM Stalin’s support||A 55-year-old Sri Lankan refugee in Chennai, who was a member of the militant Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO), was among the many who came to Tamil Nadu for protection after the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) withdrew its troops from Sri Lanka between late 1980s and 1990. He built a life in the state, marrying another refugee from his camp and raising two sons in their mid-20s. “My children are of Indian origin being born in Tamil Nadu, they have no relationship with Sri Lanka and yet they are called refugees,” says the man, who doesn’t wish to be identified. His adult sons are neither Indian citizens nor Sri Lankan citizens or of any other country but this nation-state (India) is the only one they know of. “Since we live outside of the camp, my sons and I have to register at the local police station. It’s a scar to live like this.”TELO was a separatist militant organisation like the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) that fought for an independent Tamil statehood in Sri Lanka but much of their cadre was wiped out by the latter. TELO organised itself as a political party and has two members in the Sri Lankan parliament. Since the 55-year-old fled alone at that time, much of his family still lives in the island nation.But there is new hope among Sri Lankan Tamil refugees like him in the state that they will be able to attain Indian citizenship in the light of chief minister MK Stalin’s slew of announcements for the community who are not covered under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019. The controversial CAA allows India citizenship for persecuted immigrants except Muslims from three neighbouring countries -- Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh -- but leaves out Sri Lanka.Though the DMK has been against the CAA, it is their election promise to help ensure citizenship for Sri Lankan Tamils. On August 27, MK Stalin in the assembly said that his government will soon set up a high-level committee under the chairmanship of minorities and non-resident Tamils’ welfare minister K S Masthan for granting dual citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamils as well as uplifting their living conditions.He announced a ₹317-crore package for the welfare of refugees and ₹231.54 crore for reconstructing more than 7,000 new houses in refugee camps, providing free gas stoves and cylinders. He increased subsidies and scholarships and introduced training to make them employable. A day later, he renamed them as rehabilitation camps. “They are not orphans to be called refugees. We Tamils are with them and in that spirit, the government has renamed the refugee camps as rehabilitation camps for Sri Lankan Tamils,” Stalin said in the assembly on August 28. “This brought a lot of joy. We have been here for three decades so why still look at us as refugees?” said a refugee in a camp in Gummidipoondi. They distributed sweets and posters of Stalin came up welcoming the funds allocated for infrastructure development. There are presently 58,822 refugees in 822 camps in 29 districts, while 34,087 refugees live outside the camps. Activists say that this is the first time such a large-scale allocation has been made for Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in the state. “These are homes that were built at least three decades ago,” said a refugee now working in an NGO for the rehabilitation of people like him. He adds that if there were about 50 people at that time, their families have grown and now 100 people live in the same 10x10 square feet space. “But the new announcements aren’t just about infrastructure, it also provides for comprehensive growth for education and employment,” he said. However, a few leaders from refugee groups who are in the forefront of rallying for citizenship have a different worry. “By providing us with better housing facilities, it raises doubts if our fighting for citizenship will ever happen,” wonders a refugee living in a camp in Sivaganga district who came to the state with his family in the 1980s.In the past few years, Sri Lankan Tamils who lived in refugee camps in Tamil Nadu and returned to their homes have warned others not to return because they haven’t been able to rebuild their lives on the island. The Rajapaksas who were in power during the end of the war in Sri Lanka in 2009 and the return of their dynastic rule to the island have added to the factor for some to return to their homeland judging it would be safer in the camps. “Some of them have come back and they have been allowed to live in the camps but they cannot avail of any of the state government’s benefits,” said the activist quoted above. Some of the camps are also of Indian Tamil origin who were sent to work in the tea plantations in Sri Lanka during the British colonial rule. Experts say Sri Lankan Tamil refugees are treated like illegal immigrants. “There is no paradigm of human rights. Legally there is no status for refugees in India and the CAA exploits the situation for geopolitical interests. So the Sri Lankan refugees are solely taken care of by the state government in Tamil Nadu and they are treated like people who are out on bail,” says Thiyagu (who goes only by a first name), general secretary, Tamil National Liberation Movement. He says while the new announcements would help the community it isn’t enough.“We have to move beyond mere concession and look at granting them political and civil rights. About 2 lakh Sri Lankan Tamil refugees live in Canada and so many of them are now politicians. Their refugee passports in Europe are in effect as good as a citizen’s passport. But for Lankan Tamils here, they can’t even get into medical courses, they can study law but not practice in Indian courts, they cannot avail government jobs. These issues haven’t been addressed by the state.”Political analysts say that Stalin is addressing the issue of Sri Lankan Tamils given the fact that the Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK) founded by Tamil nationalist S Seeman soon after the war with LTTE chief V Prabhakaran as their idol has garnered 6.7% votes in the last assembly elections. NTK is now the third largest party in Tamil Nadu which is a huge leap from the 1% vote share it received in the 2016 assembly elections. NTK and Vaiko’s Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) have grown solely maintaining the Sri Lankan Tamils issue as their core ideology. “Based on only the Eelam cause, NTK has scored so much so Stalin is also focussing on it,” says political commentator Raveendran Duraisamy. “Regarding dual citizenship, it is in the hands of the NDA government, but they will not look into it now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sri-lankan-refugees-hope-for-citizenship-after-tamil-nadu-cm-stalin-s-support-101630927602713.html
06-09-2021||India||What’s next for farmers’ protests||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a large platform of farm unions, hopes to mount a countrywide opposition to the Modi government’s economic policies by setting up units in every state, two of its leaders said after a huge rally in Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar on Sunday. Tens of thousands of farmers thronged the town of Muzaffarnagar, where they formally launched “Mission Uttar Pradesh”, a programme to propel their protests into the political bellwether state.Farmer unions had launched their agitation in November 2020, demanding a repeal of three controversial farm laws--the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act--but leaders of the movement have now broadened their agenda to oppose the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its economic policies.Also Read | Talks fail, Karnal prepares for Mahapanchayat tomorrowOn the face of it, the farmers have had little success in convincing the government to scrap laws that provide for freer agricultural markets and allow big supermarkets and food businesses to skirt regulated markets. The legislations also permit traders to stock large quantities of food for future sales and lay down a new format for contract farming.The unions declared they will oppose the move by the Modi government to monetise state-owned assets over the next four years to earn ₹6 lakh crore and boost infrastructure spending to spur economic growth.“India is now on sale to Adani and Ambani. We will not allow that to happen. We will hurt them in elections to teach them a lesson,” Rakesh Tikait, a leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Indian farmers’ union) or BKU said.The farm leader claimed the plan to lease out assets, such as food warehouses, roads and railways, will benefit a few big corporations. The farmers are especially directing their anger at “(Mukesh) Ambani and (Gautam) Adani”, a reference to the owners of two of India’s biggest business conglomerates which operate everything from seaports to airports.Farm leaders have called a nationwide strike on September 27. “Sunday’s rally has given us new energy as well as direction. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha will set up units in every state and in all of Uttar Pradesh, from Gazipur on Delhi’s border to Ghazipur in the eastern-most part of Uttar Pradesh,” said Yogendra Yadav, a key leader of the farmers’ platform.Assembly elections are due in Uttar Pradesh next year. Tikait said farmers would work to defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP, which governs the state.Farmers are also demanding a law to guarantee minimum prices for their produce. India’s farm economy, supported by broad subsidies, tends to swing from one crisis to another and farmers often suffer negative returns. The Modi government has repeatedly said the new reforms were necessary to boost farm earnings.The Tikaits belong to the influential Baliyan khap, a dominant farming clan among the Jat agrarian community in western UP, most of which is made up of sugarcane growers. They voted overwhelmingly for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha, and the 2017 assembly elections.Tikait also called for Hindu-Muslim unity on Sunday. The Muzaffarnagar region saw Hindu-Muslim clashes in 2013. “We will not allow anybody to divide farmers into Hindus and Muslims,” Yadav said.The BJP had won by a landslide in the 2017 assembly election. “Steps taken by the government to improve farm incomes, cash transfers for farmers, linking of markets, building of warehouses, expansion of procurement, funding for agricultural markets known as mandis…all these together will counter any negative fallout,” said Gopal Aggarwal, the BJP’s national spokesperson overseeing economic affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whats-next-for-farmers-protests-101630927542607.html

The national spokesperson also accused Rahul Gandhi of posting an old picture of farmers' protest while referring to their Sunday mahapanchayat in Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar district, and said it is part of his politics of "spreading confusion and lies."This comes as the Congress party is leading criticism against the ruling BJP over the farmers' protest which is continuing for more than 100 days now. Patra was speaking at a press conference in Delhi."The Congress party is incapable of raising ground issues," said, adding, "this is why Sonia Gandhi (interim president of Congress) holds virtual meetings with leaders of other parties while Rahul Gandhi relies on old photographs in his attempt to spread confusion for politics."“As a cuckoo does not build her nest and seeks comfort in the nests of other birds, Rahul Gandhi also works in a similar manner,” he further said, adding, he "does not work to build his party's organisation". "It has become his habit to use others' shoulders for politics," Patra also said.With protesting farmer unions slamming the government for not paying heed to their demands, Patra also claimed that the Modi government is dedicated to farmers and it will remain so in the future.At the conference, Patra also took shots at the Gandhi scion over his earlier criticism against the slow pace of inoculation drive against the Covid-19. After initial hurdles, the vaccination drive in India is now gaining pace and administering millions of doses in a single day.Over 68.75 crore people have received at least one dose of vaccination, which has reached an average daily figure of 85 lakh, he said. "Now Rahul Gandhi is not seen posting any tweet on the vaccination drive," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-political-cuckoo-seeks-others-shoulder-for-politics-bjp-101630926019444.html

06-09-2021||India||Security beefed up as farmers||The Haryana government on Monday ordered suspension of mobile internet and SMS services in Karnal district till Tuesday midnight while police tightened security arrangements and imposed section 144 in the district, a day ahead of a massive gherao planned by farmers at the mini-secretariat over the August 28 lathicharge, officials familiar with the developments said.“As a precautionary measure, we have written to the government to suspend the internet service in the district for 24 hours as to maintain law and order situation and Section 144 has been imposed till further orders,” said the Karnal district magistrate, Nishant Yadav.The precautionary measures and arrangements came as the Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) announced no changes in the plan after talks with Karnal deputy commissioner, seeking action against those involved in the lathicharge and relief for the injured, failed earlier in the day. Over 40 farmers were injured in the clashes last month.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions spearheading the protests against the farm laws since November, had threatened to lay siege to the secretariat if its demands for action were not met by September 6. “The deputy commissioner could not give any satisfactory response on the demands raised by the morcha leaders and we will go ahead with our panchayat and gherao of the mini secretariat as per the schedule as the deadline of our ultimatum will expire this evening,” Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh Charuni asserted. “The government may also prevent us from reaching the grain market but we will protest wherever we are stopped and we will cross their barricades,” he added.According to the people cited above, at least 40 companies of additional forces, five superintendent rank officials and 25 deputy superintendent rank officials along with thousands of policemen will be deployed to oversee the law and order situation in the district. The district administration also issued traffic advisory with planned route diversions. The traffic on National Highway-44, which connects Delhi to Chandigarh, will also be diverted, the people added. “We are prepared to deal with any situation and nobody will be allowed to disturb law and order and gherao the mini secretariat,” Yadav said, adding that the administration is not ready to meet any of the “illegal” demands of the farmers. Officials in the district administration said that efforts will be made to stop the movement of farmers from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh after Charuni urged protesters from the two states to arrive at the Karnal grain market at 10 am.“We request farmers to come on tractor-trolleys and in groups, and break the barricades without causing any violence,” he said. “Let the police beat you, but don’t attack them as it may damage the andolan,” he added.Karnal superintendent of police Ganga Ram Punia said 10 companies of central forces have also been summoned to manage the situation. A local court has also passed an order and directions have been issued to eight farmers’ leaders, asking them not to block any highway. “The primary objective of these arrangements is to maintain public peace and order, prevent any kind of violence, facilitate the functioning of traffic and public transport systems and to safeguard the public property across the state in general, and Karnal in particular,” Haryana additional director general of police (law and order) Navdeep Singh Virk said. Several protesters were lathicharged on August 28 while heading towards Karnal to protest against a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) meeting. On September 1, the state government transferred Karnal sub-divisional magistrate (SDM-civil) Ayush Sinha, who was caught on camera directing police to hit protesting farmers on their head if they breached the security cordon.The farm union leaders have demanded registration of FIRs against Sinha and police officials involved in the lathicharge, a compensation of ₹25 lakh and a government job to the kin of farmer Sushil Kajal, who they claimed died due to police action, and financial assistance of ₹2 lakh each to the injured farmers besides free treatment in government hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-fail-karnal-prepares-for-mahapanchayat-tomorrow-101630925802657.html

Justice Chndrachud said that everyone is focusing on managing the pandemic in India and trying to not ‘delve into conspiracy theories.’“We will rather focus on managing the pandemic in our country than delving into conspiracy theories involving other nations, on which we don't even have a jurisdiction,” Justice Chandrachud said according to a report by news agency ANI.The petition was filed by Mumbai-based Pankaj Phadnis, a researcher and a trustee of Abhinav Bharat Congress, who later withdrew it.“We have no jurisdiction over Chinese or American citizens. The government is there to hear you. Plea dismissed as withdrawn,” the Supreme Court said.The plea also sought direction to the Union of India to keep track of any further mutation so that it is not caught unaware if cases surge. “A recent report co-authored by the former chief economic advisor to the government of India confirms the existence of a war-like situation by suggesting that as many 3.9 million Indians have been killed in the last three months by the second wave of the pandemic. The monumental tragedy is not yet over,” the plea, accessed by ANI, said.The plea said that the international task force should also include Chinese nationals and added that the origins of the ‘Wuhan’ virus needs to be known as well as the Delta variant.The plea claimed that the Delta variant of Covid-19 is ‘bringing opprobrium upon India in the eyes of the world’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-plea-for-setting-global-task-force-on-covid-19-origins-101630923949976.html

Last time we got low results (in Belagavi),” Basavaraj Bommai said on Monday.

The Botanical Survey of India (BSI), which is the custodian of this largest repository of centuries old textile designs, natural dyes and plant drawings, has digitally archived all its collections preserved till date. “It is a huge repository. Paintings of plants, textile designs from various countries and even natural dyes that have remained hidden for centuries are now accessible with a single click. They will be very useful not just for botanists but also professionals working in the field of fashion and garment technology,” said AA Mao, director of BSI. The collection contains the original set of 15 volumes of 19th century British businessman Thomas Wardle’s specimens of Fabrics dyed with Indian Dyes. It has information on 4,100 samples of dye patterns, extracted from 64 plants, depicting Indian dying traditions, compiled by Wardle in 19th century and is considered one of the most comprehensive and complete documentation, said senior BSI officials The archive also contains 18 volumes of textile designs comprising 1,700 samples, starting with turbans, saree, dhoti, trouser, carpet, mosquito curtain, coat, shawl, tent cloth, gowns and even saddle cloths among others, compiled by John Forbes Watson between 1866 and 1874. “You may find the design of a choga (long-sleeved robe) worn in Afghanistan’s Herat province in the 19th century, design of a Cashmere shawl woven by artisans at Kangra in Himachal Pradesh in the 1850s or the design on a gown made of camel hair known as Burruch and worn by Europeans and natives of Mashhad province of Iran almost 200 years ago,” said SS Dash, in-charge of BSI’s technical section. It also has some of the finest designs, from various parts of India, made out of cotton, silk, muslin and wool, woven with gold and silver threads dating back to the same time or even earlier. “Historical evidences suggest that since ancient times, India has been known to traditionally use natural dyes such as Indigo, Madder and Kermes, extracted both from plants and animals including lac- a red dye extract from the scale insect Laccifer lacca and cochineal- a scale insect from which the natural dye carmine is derived. The archive also contains information on such dyes that were not only used for colouring garments, but also in medicines and for camouflaging during battle,” said a BSI official. The BSI has also digitised the original set of 2,532 plant drawings made by William Roxburgh, a Scottish botanist and physician who was known as ‘Father of Indian Botany’. The drawings were preserved in the Central National Herbarium at Howrah near Kolkata. “India is the second country after the United Kingdom which made Roxburgh’s drawing online for the public. The digitised materials of the archives are the most accurate means of recording natural specimens and also easier to store and transport. There are 3,280 life-size botanical paintings other than Roxburgh paintings drawn by Indian artists,” said Mao. India is now the second Asian country after China to provide open access to its huge collections of type specimens (original specimens collected by scientists and stored in the BSI).“The archive is extremely innovative. I have never seen such a thing. It is very interesting. It has designs for various types of garments, on various materials, for various uses and from various countries. It’s a huge collection and would be very useful for fashion designers and textile designers from around the world,” said Agnimitra Paul, noted fashion designer turned politician.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centuries-old-textile-designs-natural-dyes-archived-digitally-101630923822776.html

Known as a rich source of antioxidants, and vitamins A and C, the humble bhindi is on the menu of almost every restaurant in the country.But now, a farmer in Madhya Pradesh's capital Bhopal has given a twist to the green vegetable. Misrilal Rajput is growing red okra in his garden, and claims it is healthier than the existing natural variety."The ladyfinger that I grow is red in colour instead of its usual green colour. It is more beneficial and nutritious than green ladyfinger. It is extremely beneficial for people who are facing heart and blood pressure issues, diabetes, high cholesterol," Rajput told news agency ANI.The highlight of this crop is its price. While normal okra is available around ₹40 per kg in Delhi, the red ladyfinger commands a premium. "This ladyfinger is 5-7 times more expensive than ordinary ladyfingers. It is being sold from ₹75-80 to ₹300-400 per 250 gram/500 gram in some malls," said Rajput.The farmer from Khajuri Kalan area in Bhopal district said he purchased 1 kg seeds from an agricultural research institute in Varanasi. "In around 40 days, it started growing," said Rajput.He added that no harmful pesticides were used during the cultivation of red ladyfinger. Rajput said that a minimum of 40-50 quintals and a maximum of 70-80 quintals could be grown on an acre of land.A similar story had emerged from Madhya Pradesh's Jabalpur in June, where orchardist couple Rani and Sankalp Parihar grew unusual ruby-coloured mangoes. To the couple’s pleasant surprise, the mangoes turned out to be Japanese Miyazaki.Miyazaki mangoes are among the most expensive in the world and sold at ₹2.70 lakh per kilogram in the international market last year, according to the Japanese media reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhopal-farmer-grows-rs-800-a-kg-ladyfinger-why-is-it-so-special-101630917953479.html

If needed, more experts will be deployed. Since the whole state is following strict physical distancing and masking, chances of high transmission are low. But we can’t lower our guard,” she said.

It’s been close to two years since we left and have no idea as to what is happening to our belongings,” said a third-year medical student, on the condition of anonymity.Indian students of Chinese universities returned last year following the outbreak of the pandemic-- first detected among humans in China in December 2019-- leading to complete lockdown of Chinese cities and varsities in early 2020. Many left their belongings behind hoping to return soon, which has not materialised due to a continuous travel ban imposed by China on international students. Only those from South Korea and the United States of America have been allowed to return so far.In June, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) issued a notice asking Indian students studying in international universities, stuck in India due to the pandemic, to write to its overseas Indian affairs (OIA) office about difficulties in reaching their universities along with their contact details.Thereafter, affected students urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an open letter to intervene and facilitate students’ return. However, there’s been no response yet.Ishwari Chandran, who recently graduated from the Zhejiang University at Hangzhou, China, completed her internship online. Fortunately, Chandran’s university continues to store the belongings of foreign students. “My university has let us keep all our things. They haven’t charged any dorm fee either. In fact, they refunded a part of it for the days we weren’t there,” she said.Meanwhile, students attending lectures online are under mental stress and anxiety. Neha, a fourth year MBBS student at Jianghan University, Wuhan, China, said, “The MBBS course requires students to gain practical experience. For almost two years we’ve been bereft of that. It’s starting to bother my confidence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unable-to-return-to-china-mbbs-students-worry-about-belongings-experience-101630904741047.html

He said that top priority should be accorded to education and health sectors with a greater allocation of budget.Referring to the fast-changing technological world, the Vice President urged medical colleges to ensure that those graduating stay abreast of the latest diagnostic and treatment systems. “This has become all the more imperative in the wake of the pandemic as everything about the novel coronavirus is new learning to all -- from scientists to doctors,” he said.The Vice President also paid his homage to former President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan in whose memory his birth anniversary is celebrated as Teachers Day in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rural-service-for-doctors-should-be-mandatory-saysvpnaidu-101630899280057.html

06-09-2021||India||Muzaffarnagar Mahapanchayat invokes sharp reactions: Who said what||Thousands of farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Rajasthan and Maharashtra gathered at Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh for Kisan Mahapanchayat on Sunday in protest against the Centre’s controversial farm laws. The event was organised by Samyukt Kisan Morcha at the Government Inter College grounds. Farmers have also been protesting at different Delhi borders over the same since November last year.The Mahapanchat has garnered support from politicians from across the spectrum. Here are some of the reactions it invoked:Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said the Mahapanchayat echoed the “call of truth” that an “unjust government” must listen to. Supporting the protesters, Gandhi tweeted in Hindi, “The call of truth is echoing. You have to listen, unjust government!” Several other Congress leaders also threw their weight behind the Mahapanchayat.Also Read | Massive show of strength at farmers’ UP mahapanchayatCongress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said that the “arrogance of power” cannot withstand the roar of the farmers. “Farmers are the voice of this country. Farmers are the pride of the country. Arrogance of any power cannot withstand the roar of the farmers,” she said.“The huge crowd gathered in the Kisan Mahapanchayat of Muzaffarnagar shows that the farmers of Uttar Pradesh and the country are fed up with the BJP,” said Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot. He said the farmers of the country won’t lag in teaching the saffron party a lesson at the right time. The farmers are fed up with the BJP, he claimed.“They are our “annadatas”. They keep us alive and the government does not care to listen to them,” said CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury. While urging the government to listen to the farmers’ demand, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) spokesperson Sudhinder Bhadoria said, “It’s a democratic right of every citizen to have a peaceful protest and it should not be stopped by the police.”Bhadoria termed the security arrangements as an “insult” to the farmers. He said, “This kind of security arrangement would make the Kisan Mahapanchayat look like the India-Pakistan border.”BJP MP Varun Gandhi said, “We need to start re-engaging with them in a respectful manner.” The Pilibhit MP called farmers “our own flesh and blood”, and insisted their hardships be taken into consideration. “Lakhs of farmers have gathered in protest today, in Muzaffarnagar. They are our own flesh and blood. We need to start re-engaging with them in a respectful manner: understand their pain, their point of view and work with them in reaching common ground,” he tweeted on Sunday.Meanwhile, BJP’s Kisan Morchahead and MP Rajkumar Chahar claimed in a statement that it is politics and not concerns for farmers which have been on the agenda of those behind the Mahapanchayat. “This was very much a political and election meeting. The Opposition and these farmer union leaders have been using the shoulders of farmers to engage in politics,” he said.Union minister Anurag Thakur pointed out that the government has held 11 rounds of talks with farmers. He also said that the government has increased the minimum support price for the benefit of farmers.Taking a veiled dig at Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait, who is spearheading the farmers’ protest, Thakur asked how many mandis have been shut down in the last two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muzaffarnagar-mahapanchayat-invokes-sharp-reactions-who-said-what-101630898140494.html

The circular has been reportedly issued to prevent Deshmukh from leaving the country.Enforcement Directorate issued a lookout notice against former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh in connection with a money laundering case(File pic) pic.twitter.com/Eg0le4cR4yOn September 3, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested a member of Deshmukh’s legal team, Anand Daga, after day-long questioning for allegedly trying to influence the agency’s probe into the corruption charges against his client.Earlier, the former minister had said he would appear before the ED only "after the legal process is completed", claiming the Supreme Court had accepted his plea on the matter and the case would be heard soon. He had, however, offered to make himself available for recording his statement by electronic medium of the agency’s choice.The apex court had refused to offer him interim relief from coercive action in the lawsuit last month.On August 23, the federal agency filed a charge sheet against two of his aides in the case. Kundan Shinde, who was Deshmukh's assistant, and his personal secretary Sanjeev Paland have been chargesheeted in the case, according to the news agency. Both were arrested by the federal agency on June 26 for their alleged role in the laundering of money on Deshmukh’s directions.Also read | The travails of former Maharashtra home minister Anil DeshmukhThe ED had registered the money laundering case against Deshmukh after the CBI filed a first information report (FIR) against him on April 21. Deshmukh had in the past said that the allegations against him are false.The central agency has alleged that while serving as the Maharashtra home minister, Deshmukh misused his position, and through assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze – who has now been dismissed and is in Taloja jail for his alleged role in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder case – collected ₹4.7 crore from Mumbai’s bars for their “smooth functioning”.Later, through hawala channels, this money was sent to two brothers in Delhi who operated bogus companies, said the agency. It claimed that at the behest of Deshmukh’s son, Hrishikesh, the two brothers diverted the money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, an educational trust controlled by the Deshmukhs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-issues-lookout-notice-against-former-maharashtra-minister-anil-deshmukh-101630896403893.html
06-09-2021||India||Central, west and northwest India to receive fresh spell of rain||A wet spell has commenced over central, west and parts of northwest India in association with a low pressure area that has formed over west central Bay of Bengal on Monday, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday. A low-pressure area has formed over northwest and adjoining westcentral Bay of Bengal, off south Odisha-north Andhra Pradesh coasts. The low-pressure area and its remnant is very likely to move west-north-westwards during the next 4-5 days. The monsoon trough is lying south of its normal position which is very likely to be south of its normal position during the next 4-5 days.A shear zone, a zone of change in wind speed and direction, is likely to persist over south Peninsular India during the next 4-5 days. Due to these meteorological conditions, widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy rain is likely over Odisha, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh on Monday and Tuesday and Marathawada, Madhya Maharashtra, Konkan, Gujarat till Saturday. Isolated extremely heavy rain (over 20cm) is also likely over coastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Maharashtra, north Konkan and Gujarat till Wednesday.Rainfall activity is also likely to increase over most parts of northwest India with isolated heavy rain over Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Jammu region and East Rajasthan till Friday. Very heavy rain is likely over Uttarakhand and East Rajasthan between Wednesday and Friday.“A low-pressure area has already formed off south Odisha-north Andhra Pradesh which will move inland and travel in the west northwestwards direction bringing heavy rain in its track. We are expecting widespread and heavy rains over central India and the west coast during the next 3-4 days. The system will also bring rain to northwest India because easterly winds will set in. There are scattered rains over northwest India mainly due to the monsoon trough but this will enhance further by around September 8. Even after the low pressure system weakens its cyclonic circulation will continue to bring rains,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre, IMD. There is also likelihood of another low pressure area forming over Bay of Bengal next week. “Development of that low pressure area is being monitored. Some models are indicating that another low-pressure area will form,” she added.Between 8.30am on Sunday and 8.30am on Monday, certain stations in coastal Andhra Pradesh recorded heavy rain including Vizianagaram -18cm, Srikakulam -13cm, Visakhapatnam -7cm; In West Madhya Pradesh: Khargone-12cm; Sehore-10cm; In Uttarakhand: Chamoli- 9cm; In East Rajasthan: Rajsamand-8cm; and in Kerala: Vaikom-7cm.There is a 9% rainfall deficiency over the country with 13% deficiency over central India; 13% over northwest India; 10% deficiency over east and northeast India and 10% excess over peninsular India. Over northwest India, while Delhi and Haryana have recorded 26% and 20% excess rains respectively; Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir have over 20% deficiency; Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have 7% and 9% deficiency respectively.There is likely to be above normal rainfall activity at over 110% of the so-called long period average or LPA in September, and while this will reduce the current monsoon rain deficiency of 9% over the country, overall monsoon rain (June 1 to September 30) will still be in the “lower end of normal category,” the IMD said in its monsoon monthly forecast last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-west-and-northwest-india-to-receive-fresh-spell-of-rain-101630895860012.html

We have been assured of adequate supply by the Central government, and if the vaccine production increases, the numbers may go up even further. Private hospitals have also contributed significantly to the vaccination drive,” said Dr Vyas.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray described vaccines as the shield against Covid-19 virus. “We need to stop the third wave or at least postpone it. Citizens should fully support the vaccination drive. Doctors need to educate citizens that they should take both the doses. There can be cases where people take both the doses and still get Covid-19. However, the severity of the virus will be less,” he added.Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 4,057 new Covid-19 cases and 67 related deaths.

While it is not yet known whether he will, in fact, appear before the CID or not, his party has termed the notice as “vendetta politics.”The case pertains to the death of Subhabrata Chakraborty, Adhikari’s personal security guard, who allegedly died by suicide on October 13, 2018. Chakraborty, a state armed police personnel, was part of the BJP leader’s security detail from the time the latter became a parliamentarian. At the time of Chakraborty’s death, Adhikari was a leader of the Mamata Banerjee-led ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and was serving as the transport minister in her cabinet. However, in December last year, he joined the BJP and defeated his former boss from Nandigram in the assembly elections earlier this year though the TMC won the polls comprehensively, coming to power for a third straight term.On July 12, the CID constituted a four-member team to probe Chakraborty’s death after a complaint was filed by his wife seeking fresh inquiry into her husband’s demise. On July 22, Adhikari filed a petition in the Calcutta high court seeking transfer of all criminal cases registered against him to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Also Read | Suvendu Adhikari files petition; Calcutta HC to transfer criminal cases to CBIAlso summoned for questioning are Adhikari’s driver Sambhu Maity and close associate Sanjeev Shukla.

Classes 1 to 11, the first seven semesters of graduation and first-year students of post-graduation will continue with their online classes.The Assam government issued a supplementary standard operating procedure (SOP) and said that for reopening, the institutions are focusing on two criteria—the willingness of the students to attend the classes and the Covid-19 positivity rate in particular districts, reported news agency PTI.The Assam government said the supplementary SOP has been necessitated “considering the importance of continuous education and improvement in the Covid-19 situation in the state as on date.” It further said that the online mode of education will continue for students who prefer to attend online classes rather than physically attend school, adding that physical attendance in schools is optional and not mandatory.Assam closed its schools and colleges in April when the second wave of coronavirus pandemic was reported.

06-09-2021||India||If you have evidence against me, make it public: Abhishek Banerjee before facing ED||Trinamool Congress (TMC) national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee on Sunday threw a challenge at the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) saying if central probe agencies had any evidence against him in any case they should make it public. “TMC will never bow before you (BJP). Do whatever you can. If the ED has any evidence against me, make it public. Why don’t you do that? If anybody can prove that I have accepted even ten paisa from anyone I will voluntarily walk to the gallows and hang myself,” the chief minister’s nephew said at the Kolkata airport before flying to Delhi where he had been summoned to the ED’s office on Monday for questioning in the coal smuggling case. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is also probing the case. “I said at a public meeting in November that I am ready to face any probe. They have called me to Delhi although the case is relevant to Kolkata. They (BJP) lost the polls and are now using the agencies to carry out vengeance. Let any BJP national leader face me on a live television show. Let them choose the time and place. I will prove what they have done to the nation,” said the young TMC Lok Sabha member. His wife Rujira Banerjee on Wednesday did not go to the ED’s office in Delhi where she was summoned in the same case. Citing the risk a mother of two infants faces while travelling during the Covid-19 pandemic, she wrote a letter to the agency saying it will be convenient for her if ED officers come to her Kolkata residence. Focusing his attack on Suvendu Adhikari, ex-TMC minister and leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly, Abhishek Banerjee on Sunday said, “Why is no action being taken against the leader of the opposition who was caught on camera accepting bundles of money?” Banerjee was referring to the Narada sting operation that the CBI and the ED are probing. The ED was recently permitted by a special court in Kolkata to summon two ministers, Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, TMC legislator Madan Mitra and former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee for questioning in the Narada case. They were all arrested by the CBI on My 17 and released on bail after days of judicial custody. A controversy erupted ahead of the 2016 assembly elections after the Narada News portal uploaded a series of videos purportedly showing several high-profile TMC leaders, including Adhikari, receiving money in exchange for favours to a fictitious company. Adhikari joined the BJP in December last year. Adhikari, who, has been summoned for questioning by the state Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Monday in connection with the unnatural death of one of his security personnel in 2018, refused to react to Banerjee’s remark on the Narada probe. “I do not want to say anything on this,” Adhikari said in Kolkata. However, while addressing a BJP event at Tamluk in East Midnapore district, he referred to the CID summons and said, “You (BJP workers) need not worry. They cannot do anything to me. I am a bachelor. I have nothing to look back at except my aging parents.” Adhikari, however, did not specify whether he will face CID officers on Monday. Dismissing Banerjee’s allegation that the CBI and ED were being used by the BJP and saffron camp leaders were not being touched, the party’s Bengal vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said, “The BJP is not conducting the probes. The agencies are doing their job following court orders. The CBI and ED decide who will be grilled and when.” The ED has also summoned three Indian Police Service officers, Shyam Singh, Gyanwant Singh and S Selvamurugan to Delhi on September 8, 9 and 10 respectively. Rujira Banerjee was questioned by the CBI in February in the coal smuggling case. The CBI team visited Abhishek Banerjee’s residence. In March, the CBI also questioned Rujira’s sister Maneka Gambhir and the latter’s husband Ankush Arora and father-in-law Pawan Arora. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee reacted sharply in February when a CBI team visited the south Kolkata residence of her nephew to serve notice to his wife. “A tiger cub is not scared of fighting cats and rats. Muscle flexing or threats of jail sentence cannot scare us. We have stood before guns in the past. I will not surrender as long as I am alive,” the chief minister said at a public event. The CBI registered the coal smuggling case in November last year. It is alleged that illegally mined coal, worth several thousand crores of rupees, have been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of West Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited runs several mines. Among the prime suspects is former TMC youth front general secretary and businessman Vinay Mishra who renounced his Indian citizenship in December and became a citizen of Vanuatu, a small island country in southwestern Pacific Ocean. In July, the state CID started a probe into the death of Adhikari’s bodyguard Shubabrata Chakraborty who died of a gunshot injury in 2018. His family has now alleged foul play. The complaint has been filed by Suparna Kanjilal Chakraborty, the wife of the deceased. A CID team visited Adhikari’s residence in July. They talked to members of the family, including Dibyendu Adhikari; the BJP leader’s bother who is also the TMC Lok Sabha member from the district’s Tamluk Lok Sabha seat. Their father, Sisir Adhikari, is the TMC Lok Sabha member from Contai. The TMC has sought Sisir Adhikari’s disqualification from the Lok Sabha as he shared the dais with Prime Minister Narendra Modi before the March-April polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-you-have-evidence-against-me-make-it-public-abhishek-banerjee-before-facing-ed-101630881818789.html
06-09-2021||India||In Chhattisgarh, right-wing leaders thrash pastor inside police station; SHO removed||The Chhattisgarh police removed the station house officer (SHO) of a police station in Raipur after a video went viral on social media, in which he was seen present, when a group of right-wing leaders manhandled a pastor on Sunday. “I am removing the SHO, Yadumani Sidar, after the video went viral since it happened inside the police station. He will be attached with the Raipur police headquarters for now,” said Superintendent of Police, Raipur, Ajay Yadav adding a case has been registered against eight people who manhandled the pastor. The SP further said that a group of right-wing members reached Purani Basti police station on Sunday and alleged that a few people of a community were involved in forceful conversion in their area. “The SHO took the complaint of the right-wing leaders but suddenly the pastor along with a few others also came inside the police station after which the right-wing leaders manhandled the pastor Harish Sahu,” said the SP adding that more arrests will follow in the case. However, a leader of one of the right-wing outfits claimed that no one was beaten inside the police station and they were only there to lodge a complaint. “We informed the police about religious conversion in the area earlier as well. Every weekend people are called in the name of the prayer and then are manipulated to accept another religion,” said a right-wing leader on condition of anonymity. He further said that people had gone to submit a complaint when the pastor and others provoked them continuously but they never reacted. Arun Pannalal, president of Chhattisgarh Christian Forum said one of the pastors went to the police station on Sunday morning when suddenly people from a Hindu group came inside the police station and started beating him up. “Our concern is not that these incidents are happening, what we are concerned about is the silence of the government and the administration,” he said. On August 30, a group of over 100 people allegedly beat up a 25-year-old pastor after barging into his house at a remote village in Kabirdham district during which they were heard raising slogans against religious conversion. The mob also vandalised his property and manhandled his family members before fleeing from the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-chhattisgarh-right-wing-leaders-thrash-pastor-inside-police-station-sho-removed-101630881639076.html
06-09-2021||India||TMC fields CM Mamata as nominee from Bhawanipore for upcoming Bengal by-polls||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Sunday evening named chief minister Mamata Banerjee as its candidate for the assembly by-poll in south Kolkata’s Bhawanipore from where she had won in the past. For Murshidabad district’s Samsergunj and Jangipur seats - where elections could not be held in March-April because the ruling party’s candidates died of Covid-19 - the TMC on Sunday fielded Amirul Islam and former minister Jakir Hossain respectively. The latter was injured in a bomb blast in February this year. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on August 24 filed the chargesheet in the Nimtita railway station bomb blast case saying the target of the February 17 IED (improvised explosive device) attack was Hossain, who was then the state’s deputy labour minister. The NIA said the blast was carried out to derail the local poll. “People of Jangipur are facing problems as they have no legislator to represent them. The election is necessary,” said Hossain. Although polls and by-polls are to be held in seven seats in Bengal, the Election Commission of India (ECI) on Saturday announced elections in only three seats. Though the TMC demanded early polls in all seven, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the state’s principal opposition, claimed that the situation is not conducive as the pandemic is not under control in any part of Bengal. Since the Congress and the Left parties could not win a single seat for the first time since Independence, the contest in the coming elections is likely to be bi-polar. The BJP did not name its candidates for the three seats till Sunday evening. Its leaders said the decision will be taken after consultation with national leaders. “Of course, we will contest these seats,” said Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh. Banerjee is contesting again as she lost to her aide-turned adversary Suvendu Adhikari at Nandigram in East Midnapore district where polls were held in the second phase on April 1. To continue as chief minister, she needs to get elected before November 21. While addressing a rally in Nandigram prior to the polls, Banerjee surprised everyone when she announced that she would not contest from Bhawanipore and face Adhikari instead. She was injured in the left leg during the campaign and addressed all rallies from a wheelchair. Adhikari won the Nandigram seat in 2016 and was made a cabinet minister by Banerjee. He joined the BJP in December last year. State power minister Sovandeb Chattopadhyay contested the Bhawanipore seat and defeated the BJP candidate, actor Rudranil Ghosh. However, Chattopadhyay stepped down so that Banerjee could contest again. In the March-April polls, the BJP bagged 77 seats while the TMC won 213. The polls were held in 292 of the state’s 294 seats as the two TMC candidates died in Murshidabad. Two TMC candidates from North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas died of Covid-19 after the polls and it was found that they had won. These seats too are lying vacant. Though the BJP wrested 77 seats, its score came down to 75 as two legislators resigned from the assembly to retain their Lok Sabha seats. One of them is Nisith Pramanik who took oath as Union minister of state for home affairs during the cabinet reshuffle on July 7. Also, four BJP legislators have returned to the TMC although none have officially resigned from the party. Among them is Krishnanagar North MLA Mukul Roy, a founder-member of the TMC who switched sides in 2017 and was made a BJP national vice-president last year. The BJP has sought Roy’s disqualification under the anti-defection law and has sought explanation from the other three who left the party last week. Roy is still a BJP legislator on paper and has been appointed as chairman of the assembly’s public accounts committee. Top TMC leaders started campaigning on Sunday itself. Minister Firhad Hakim held a party workers’ meeting. “People of Bhawanipore are ready to welcome the festive season. They will welcome Mamata Banerjee before Goddess Durga arrives. Nothing can be more auspicious.” TMC legislator from Kamarhati, Madan Mitra, who lives in Bhawanipore, also campaigned on Sunday. BJP leaders, meanwhile, said they may move court challenging the ECI’s decision to hold elections. “We learnt that that the chief secretary wrote to the ECI that it will lead to a constitutional crisis if polls are not held in Bhawanipore. We want to know how the ECI is so sure that Mamata Banerjee will win the polls and how can it conclude that Bhawanipore is Covid-19 free and other constituencies such as Dinhata, are not?” said BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu. Nisith Pramanik, who won from Dinhata in north Bengal, did not take oath to retain his Lok Sabha seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-fields-cm-mamata-as-nominee-from-bhawanipore-for-upcoming-bengal-bypolls-101630871198187.html
06-09-2021||India||Deliveries started, but HAL yet to get contract for LCH||Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is yet to get a contract from the defence ministry for supplying light combat helicopters (LCHs) to the Indian Air Force and the Indian Army, but that has not stopped the state-owned plane maker from manufacturing the helicopters and delivering them to the two services, people familiar with the developments said.HAL is awaiting a contract from the ministry for 15 limited series production (LSP) helicopters and expects follow-on orders as the IAF and the army have a combined projected requirement of 160 LCHs. Of the initial 15 LSP helicopters approved for purchase by the defence acquisition council (DAC) – India’s apex defence procurement body – 10 are for the IAF and five for the army.“HAL has already supplied three LCHs to the IAF. The first LCH for the army was completed last month. By the year-end, a total of 10 LCHs would have been delivered to the two services. We are retaining five LCHs for the next year’s programme to keep the production line operational,” a senior HAL official said.In a year-end review of its various activities, the defence ministry had said on January 1 that the case for procurement of LCH from HAL was in the final stage and the contract was likely to be signed in the first quarter of 2021. “We are delivering the helicopters prior to the finalisation of the contract as a proactive measure. That happens sometimes after getting approval from the board of directors,” said a second official.It is critical for HAL to get the LCH orders on time to keep the production line running. If it becomes inoperative because of lack of orders, the production line will have to be recertified, which is a time-consuming process, the second official said.The IAF and the army need the LCH, and HAL is likely to be awarded the contract soon, a defence ministry official said. “There has been some delay, but the acquisition is on track. It will provide a boost to the Make in India initiative,” he said.The LCH figures on the government’s negative import list that seeks to ban the import of different types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years. In the last one year, the government has imposed a ban on the import of 209 defence items to boost self-reliance in the defence sector.“India’s military helicopter production capabilities have come of age, and we have reached a stage where we don’t need to import helicopters. LCH will be a potent and versatile platform for the IAF and the army, especially in a high-altitude role,” said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.Though not ordered yet, the twin-engine LCH was deployed in the Ladakh sector to support the IAF, in the midst of the border row with China last year. The deployment of the LCH in the Ladakh sector was symbolic in nature and an acknowledgement of the potential that the platform holds.Meanwhile, HAL has set a March 2022 deadline to carry out the first flight of the LCA (light combat aircraft) Mk-1A jet after wrapping up the necessary design activities, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. Last month, it signed a deal with US firm GE Aviation for 99 F404 engines to power India’s latest indigenous fighter.The defence ministry awarded a ₹48,000-crore contract to HAL for 83 LCA Mk-1A jets for the IAF in February. The first Mk-1A aircraft will be delivered to the air force by March 2024, with the rest slated to join its combat fleet by 2029.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deliveries-started-but-hal-yet-to-get-contract-for-lch-101630871035102.html
06-09-2021||India||Section 377, 3 years on: Walking down the aisle of history||Today is the 3rd anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in Navtej Johar, holding that sexual acts between consenting adults in private does not attract section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). It is also 20 years after the Naz Foundation challenged the constitutional validity of Section 377, which we won in 2009.The long journey has been a roller coaster ride.Gay men starting to come to our (Lawyers Collective’s) office after a major victory in an HIV case in 1997. The pain of their stories of blackmail by the police, their casual partners, parents etc., was an impetus to find a solution. That quest led us to locating section 377 as the source of evil. The constitutionality of section 377 had to be challenged.The next step was getting the petition draft and settled and then trying to locate a petitioner. But no gay man, except Ashok Row Kavi, was willing to come forward to be a petitioner because of the extreme stigma.However, the petition had to be filed in Delhi as the AIDS BhedBhev Virodhi Andolan (ABVA) had already filed a petition there and if filed in the Bombay high court, the government would have got both transferred to the Supreme Court, which might have dismissed it and sealed our fate for a long time. At this juncture, Anjali Gopalan from Naz Foundation came forward.In the meantime, in 2001, there were arrests in Lucknow of the Bharosa Trust activists for reaching out to the gay community and making them aware of safe sex.The LGBTQI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex) community was in the throes of fear. We were able to respond to that in Mumbai by an exhibition at Flora Fountain on what the LGBTQI community was all about. The overwhelming support we got from ordinary people emboldened us.The petition was filed in the Delhi high court in 2001 on the basis of the ABVA petition that was pending there. Unknown to us, it had already been dismissed. Unfortunately, we faced a lot of criticism from the community for lack of consultation with them before filing it.We corrected course and proceeded to have consultations regularly from then on. The community got involved in a big way on decisions on the petition as it traversed through the labyrinth of the courts.The media also got involved. In television debates, mothers pointed out that their sons or daughters were gay or lesbians, who were perfectly normal and loving whom they loved, all with quiet dignity.They also spoke on how section 377 was unjust in providing for severe jail sentences just because they were engaged in acts perfectly normal to them. In one debate with me on Karan Thapar’s show, Ravi Shankar Prasad, till recently the Union law minister, claimed that section 377 was “part of our culture” and “will never go”. History rightly proved him wrong.In such debates, Saleem Kidwai and Ruth Vanita’s book, Same-Sex Love in India: Readings from Literature and History, was critical to show how India had a liberal culture on sexuality no matter which religion, before the British imposed their Victorian values on us.The first failure, the dismissal of the Naz petition in 2004 as well as the review petition arising out of it in the Delhi high court on technical grounds, was a big let-down; but not for long as the Supreme Court set aside the dismissal and remanded the matter back to the Delhi high court for a fresh hearing on merits.The Naz petition got a huge boost when Voices for Equality joined in to support it. There was fun too when the National Aids Control Organization filed an affidavit supporting us. It contradicted the government of India’s stand. But we also had to watch the sad spectacle of the additional solicitor general trying to defend section 377.There was euphoria when the judgment of the Delhi high court was pronounced in 2009. That was a second independence day for those still imprisoned by the chains of British Victorian morality. Those chains were now broken.But then Suresh Kumar Koushal and others approached the Supreme Court. We had to defend the Delhi high court judgment. There was a lot of fun on the way too.There was an extremely humorous interaction with justice Mukhopadhyaya and me on whether a mother putting her breast in her lactating child’s mouth would amount to penetration under section 377. Explaining to him that there was no sexual connotation in the mother putting her breast in her infant child’s mouth was no easy task.The Supreme Court dealt a devastating blow when on the last day of justice GS Singhvi’s tenure on December 11, 2013, it set aside the judgment of the Delhi high court in Naz and made the LGBTQI communities criminal again.I wrote a series of articles criticising the judgment and trying to boost the morale of the community by pointing out that the judgment will be set aside as justice is on our side. But the blow was too much for some. Faced with hopelessness, some gave up the fight.It was then a matter of taking the long road to win back the rights of the LGBTQI communities. We filed review petitions that were dismissed and then we filed curative petitions. We also filed writ petitions. They were taken up and the rest is history.Though it was a long and arduous road, it ensured that the victory that came from a constitutional bench was bound to stay. More particularly, because the communities were mobilised, the victory is now firmly entrenched in our society, especially amongst the young, who will see a different world.There is still a lot to be done. Same-sex marriage, change in rape laws, rights on inheritance and anti-discrimination law in the private sector. That will also come. For justice is on our side.(Anand Grover is a senior advocate practicing in the Supreme Court.

06-09-2021||India||As Taliban sends conflicting signals, India maintains studied silence||The Indian government has opted to maintain a studied silence as Taliban leaders and spokespersons have offered widely divergent views on issues such as Kashmir that have traditionally been red flags to the foreign policy establishment in New Delhi.Against the backdrop of a discreet outreach towards India by senior Taliban leaders ahead of the formation of a new dispensation in Kabul, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen caused consternation by telling BBC in an interview on Thursday that the Taliban intended to raise its voice for Muslims in Kashmir and India. Shaheen’s remarks ran counter to an assertion earlier this week by senior Taliban negotiator Anas Haqqani, also a senior leader of the terrorist group Haqqani Network, that the Taliban has a policy of not interfering in the internal matters of other countries, such as Kashmir, and looked forward to “positive” relations with India.In a lengthy video statement issued a week ago, senior Taliban leader Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai, who is tipped for a senior position in the new set-up in Kabul, said the group wants to continue Afghanistan’s political, economic and cultural ties with India. In remarks that were generally perceived as conciliatory, Stanekzai described India as a “very important” player in the subcontinent and avoided any mention of touchy issues such as Kashmir.Stanekzai also met India’s ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, at the Indian embassy in Doha on Tuesday, the first officially acknowledged contact between the two sides.The external affairs ministry has said the meeting was held “on the request of the Taliban side” and that Stanekzai had assured Mittal that issues raised by the Indian side – including the safe return of Indians still in Afghanistan and Afghan soil being used for anti-Indian activities and terrorism – would be “positively addressed”.As reported by Hindustan Times, Stanekzai and Anas Haqqani are apparently spearheading the outreach towards India. Both have spoken to an Indian news channel, though it is rare for senior Taliban leaders to give interviews to the Indian media.While most of their comments have been measured and nuanced, the latest remarks by Shaheen have not been viewed positively in some quarters in New Delhi.In his interview with BBC, Shaheen said the Taliban don’t have a policy of launching armed operations against any country but added: “As Muslims, we also have a right to raise our voice for Muslims in Kashmir, India or any other country.”Shaheen’s other remarks, related to the Haqqani Network and the hijacking of Indian Airlines flight IC-814 from Kathmandu to Kandahar by five Pakistani terrorists, are also red flags for India’s security and foreign policy establishment, especially those sections which harbour deep-seated suspicions about the group and its long-standing relations with Pakistan.Indian, American and Afghan officials have blamed the Haqqani Network for carrying out a suicide car bombing outside the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008. The attack killed nearly 60 people, including the Indian defence attaché and a diplomat. Shaheen contended allegations against the Haqqani Network are claims. “The Haqqanis are not a group. They are part of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. They are the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,” he said.He also denied the Taliban had a role in the hijacking of IC-814 and the Indian government should be “thankful” to the group for the help it extended during the hijacking. “India had requested us [to allow the plane to land in Kandahar] because the jet had insufficient fuel and then we helped in the release of the hostages,” he said.Analysts in New Delhi have noted that the Taliban has so far not publicly acknowledged the meeting between Stanekzai and the Indian ambassador in Doha, especially at a time when Taliban spokesmen have been issuing statements or tweeting about meetings between Stanekzai and envoys of countries such as Pakistan, the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, Canada and France.The external affairs ministry has so far declined to comment on the Taliban’s lack of acknowledgement of the meeting in Doha and said it is too early to say anything on the possible recognition of a Taliban set-up in Kabul. Some of the reticence to speak publicly on such matters can be attributed to New Delhi’s focus on the safe repatriation of Indians still in Afghanistan, currently believed to number a few dozen though the government has declined to give specific figures. India, which has maintained channels of communication with some Taliban leaders since last year, has insisted that its main concern on Afghanistan as of now is the use of Afghan soil for terrorism or any anti-India activities. While setting aside questions about recognising a Taliban government at a news briefing on Thursday, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said, “Let’s just treat the Doha meeting for what it is – it is just a meeting and I think these are still very early days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-taliban-sends-conflicting-signals-india-maintains-studied-silence-101630867059836.html
06-09-2021||India||France’s biggest trial to begin Wednesday||The biggest trial in France’s modern legal history begins on Wednesday over the November 2015 attacks on Paris that saw 130 people slaughtered at bars, restaurants and the Bataclan concert hall. The bombing and gun assault by three teams of jihadists, claimed by the Islamic State, was France’s worst post-war atrocity. A purpose-built facility at the historic court of justice on the Ile de la Cite in Paris will host the trial, with 14 of the 20 defendants present, including the only surviving attacker, Salah Abdeslam. “Everyone has their own expectations, but we know that this is an important milestone for our future lives,” said Arthur Denouveaux, a survivor of the Bataclan music venue attack and president of the Life for Paris victims’ association. The trial over the traumatic jihadist killings, which were planned from Syria, is on a scale unmatched in recent times. It will last nine months until late May 2022, with 145 days for hearings involving about 330 lawyers, 300 victims and former president Francois Hollande who will testify in November. The case file runs to a million pages in 542 volumes.Surviving gunman Abdeslam, a Belgium-born French-Moroccan, fled the scene of the carnage after abandoning his suicide belt, which investigators found to be defective. Abdeslam, now 31, was later captured in Brussels after four months on the run. He has resolutely refused to cooperate with the French investigation and remained largely silent throughout a separate trial in Belgium in 2018 that saw him declare only that he put his “trust in Allah” and that the court was biased. He is scheduled testify in mid-January 2022.Fourteen of the accused – who face a range of charges from providing logistical support, to planning and weapons offences – are expected to be present in court. Six are being tried in absentia. Five of them are presumed dead.The alleged coordinator, Belgian national Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was killed by French police five days after the attacks. The horror was unleashed late on November 13 when jihadists set off suicide belts outside the Stade de France stadium where President Hollande was in the crowd watching France play Germany. A group of gunmen then indiscriminately opened fire from a car on half a dozen restaurants in the trendy 10th and 11th districts of Paris. The massacre culminated at the Bataclan music venue where a packed concert was underway. Three jihadists stormed in and a total of 90 people lost their lives there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/frances-biggest-trial-to-begin-wednesday-101630867058440.html
06-09-2021||India||Tamil Nadu honours freedom fighter VO Chidambaram; PM says he stood for self-reliance||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday hailed the contributions of freedom fighter V O Chidambaranar on his 150th birth anniversary while the Tamil Nadu government observed the day as a state event with chief minister M K Stalin and leaders cutting across party lines honouring the state’s icon of the freedom movement.Modi tweeted: “Remembering the visionary V O Chidambaram Pillai on his Jayanti. He made pioneering contributions to our freedom movement. He also envisioned a self-reliant India and made key efforts towards it, especially in the ports and shipping sectors. We are deeply inspired by him.”Chidambaranar’s life-size statue, which was decked with garlands and flowers for the anniversary, is on the Chennai Port premises.VOC (5 September 1872 – 18 November 1936) is an icon of freedom movement in Tamil Nadu and respected for his sacrifices for the sake of nation.Stalin released leaflets in Tamil and English on the life and times of the freedom fighter and the first copies were received by Nehru.Union minister of state for fisheries L Murugan was among others who recalled the yeoman services of VOC to the nation and paid tributes.An arterial road, renamed after VOC, in Tuticorin was declared open by minister for social welfare P Geetha Jeevan, along with party MP Kanimozhi and they also garlanded a statue of the leader in the southern port city.Fisheries minister Anitha Radhakrishnan visited VOC’s memorial at Ottapidaram in southern Tamil Nadu and paid floral tributes.Leader of Opposition in the Assembly and top AIADMK leader K Palaniswami hailed VOC for standing up to the British colonialism and praised the leader for continuing to sow the seeds of freedom among the people despite the cruelty he faced during his prison term.Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan was among others who visited the freedom fighter’s memorial at Ottapidaram and paid homage.Participating in an event to honour the leader, Soundararajan paid rich tributes and underscored his contribution to India’s freedom movement including his Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company initiatives.Paying his tributes, PMK founder leader S Ramadoss recalled that VOC was treated with cruelty when he was imprisoned for spearheading the freedom movement and oil extraction in Coimbatore prison was only one of the punishments he endured during his incarceration.The 150th birth anniversary celebrations of the leader, which would be till September 5, 2022, provided the nation and people a good opportunity to pay their respects and accord due recognition to his sacrifices, Ramadoss said.BJP Tamil Nadu unit chief K Annamalai, who paid floral tributes at VOC Manimandapam in Tuticorin, tweeted “V O Chidambaram Pillai born on Sep 5, 1872 in Ottapidaaram, Thoothukudi, fondly called as VOC is a freedom fighter of the highest order.”Annamalai said VOC was a famous lawyer and writer during his hey days. “He sacrificed everything at one go and started a shipping company Swadeshi Steam Company to take on the British monopoly in shipping. United our workers against the unjust trade practices of Britishers. The British government arrested him and made him to do merciless hard labour in Coimbatore prison. He sacrificed everything for our freedom & for our nation.”Dravidar Kazhagam chief K Veeramani garlanded a statue of VOC in Tiruchirappalli and Naam Tamizhar Katchi was among other outfits which honoured the leader on the occasion.To honour V O C, Stalin had on Friday announced a 14-point programme which includes refurbishing his memorials and instituting an award in the leader’s name as a mark of respect to his contributions to the freedom movement which includes his work in various spheres including shipping.The TN government has also lined up several year long initiatives (Sept 5, 2021-Sept 5, 2022) like a photo exhibition on bus for students and naming government buildings after him as part of the 150th anniversary celebrations of the freedom fighter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-honours-freedom-fighter-vo-chidambaram-pm-says-he-stood-for-selfreliance-101630866940290.html

Farmers across the country are happy with the decision of the Modi government. Those who are misled, we have talked to them in the past and are prepared to do so in the future as well since the Modi government is interested in the welfare of farmers,” Thakur said, while speaking to reporters in Bengaluru.Thakur said that under Modi’s government the number of mandi’s have increased and there are also efforts to link them to the national agricultural market e-nam.Responding to allegations of lower value and procurement, Thakur said that the government has increased both during the last two years.“When the world over, and even in India, fertilizer prices doubled, Prime Minister Modi did not put the burden of even Re 1 on farmers,” Thakur said.Meanwhile, the government of Karnataka on Sunday said that thrust would be given to post harvest management under Comprehensive Agriculture Policy.Basvaraj Bommai launched the CM Raitha Nidhi Scholarship programme aimed at children of farmers on Sunday.“If the farmers children too are educated, the situation of the farmers too would be improved and therefore the scheme is being implemented, he said. The Scholarship will be provided to students who join different courses after SSLC. The amount will be disbursed through DBT to about 1.7 million students,” according to a statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO) attributing it to Bommai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-open-to-holding-talks-with-agitating-farmers-thakur-101630866937801.html
06-09-2021||India||Tamil Nadu on alert after Kerala Nipah death||Tamil Nadu has stepped up measures to monitor people who arrive from Kerala in nine bordering districts, in the wake of the neighbouring state reporting a death due to Nipah virus infection, minister for medical and family welfare Ma Subramanian said on Sunday.A 12-year old boy died on Sunday due to Nipah virus infection at a hospital in Kozhikode, according to Kerala health minister Veena George.“Already we have been monitoring the nine districts that border Kerala. We have been conducting door-to-door awareness campaigns in the districts on the spread of Zika virus... In the wake of the Nipah virus, we have issued an advisory to district health officials to expedite measures like holding fever camps,” he told reporters.The minister said health officials of the nine districts to hold fever camps at the entry points in the border districts besides conducting thermal screening of the passengers, testing their saturation levels. “Already, we are allowing people to enter (Tamil Nadu) only if they have a Covid-19 vaccination certificate nor a RT-PCR negativity report,” he said.Health secretary J Radhakrishnan said people who enter Tamil Nadu from Kerala were screened not only for Covid-19 but also for other communicable diseases like Zika, Nipah. “We are continuously monitoring the people who enter Tamil Nadu. People need not panic about the Nipah virus. But at the same time they should not show negligence (in following the government advisory),” he cautioned.Health department officials of the nine districts that border with Kerala were urged to conduct surveillance for all communicable diseases, especially Zika and Nipah. “Deputy directors have been informed and the local bodies in border areas should stay alert about these diseases,” a message sent to the district health officials said.Nipah virus is a zoonotic virus -- it is transmitted from animals to humans -- fruit bats and pigs -- and can also be transmitted through contaminated food or directly between people.To a query about a few school students and teachers having tested Covid-19 positive after schools were reopened on September 1, Radhakrishnan said they might have contracted the virus earlier.“...these people (teachers and students testing Covid-19 positive), might have contracted the virus ahead of coming to the schools. There is still prevalence of the Covid-19 virus...People should strictly follow Covid-19 protocols,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-on-alert-after-kerala-nipah-death-101630866877803.html
06-09-2021||India||Section 377, 3 years on: Want the pace of change to accelerate||Three years after the Section 377 verdict, which read down the criminalization of adult consensual same sex desire, while we have made progress in addressing the inequality that faces the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex (LGBTQI+) community, there’s a lot that still needs to be done to translate that verdict, as well as some of the others that came before it into reality. With the 2014 Nalsa judgment, which recognized the gender identity of transpersons, the 2017 nine-judge bench decision on privacy, which read it as a fundamental right of all citizens and the Navtej Johar verdict of 2018 which read down Section 377, a momentum was gathering: it was one of equal rights to LGBTQI+ citizens. Now, three years on, what we have is, at best, non-criminality. What will it take for us to move towards more equality? In a post-Covid world, I would want the pace of change to accelerate in two areas. The first is the law, where I would like to see progress on a meaningful anti-discrimination law that protects the rights of LGBTQ+ people and other minorities. This would be useful to enhance the thrust of Navtej verdict and the others that preceded it. Many community organizations and individuals are also moving court to rectify some provisions of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, because many feel that it doesn’t serve transpersons meaningfully in its current form. Thirdly, there is the issue of marriage equality. There is a long road ahead for this but given our strong socio-cultural imperative towards marriage, the right to choose to enter into this institution in the same way that heterosexual Indian citizens can choose to do so, is a big step towards equality of queer citizens of India. But the law is only part of the equation. Social realities are the other. I would want the family, the workplace, educational institutions, and even media, to become more inclusive. There are already small pockets of change, as I’ve detailed in Queeristan. There are so many instances of birth families of LGBTQ+ persons accepting them and their partners. There are educational institutions that have created incredible environments for queer students. There have been so many workplaces, both in the private and public sectors that are conducting inclusive hiring. A World Bank report published in 2014 calculated that homophobia had cost India up to $30.8 billion in 2012 alone. It’s this sort of regularization of queer people that I want to see more of. This is how society shifts: when we are present everywhere, when our presence is imagined and included as normal and not as tokenism or comic relief, that’s how the spirit of the Navtej verdict will translate into lived reality. For this to happen, mainstream society needs to step up. It is not the onus of LGBTQ persons alone to struggle and fight for these changes; we are only 6 to 10% of the population. It’s time for mainstream society to be an ally and join the inclusion revolution. For years, queer people have been doing the labour of arguing, doing advocacy, and asking for inclusion. It’s time for mainstream societies to understand that by creating these spaces for all of us to flourish in, is ultimately to their advantage. Take for instance what Dalit and trans rights activist Grace Banu has done in Tamil Nadu: a trans-led milk cooperative has come up in Thoothukudi with the help of public and private enterprise and this benefits everyone. This is a template for a queer inclusive future. What also excites me is how many intersectional queer organizations are being formed to platform and bring forward queer voices or experiences that were hitherto marginalized, such as the Ya-All community organization in Manipur or the Queer Muslim Project or the Dalit Queer Project, among others. This articulation of various kinds of diverse queer experiences is important because it reminds us that the struggle for queer rights is linked to other struggles of different communities. At the end of the day, we all want the same thing: a better, more equal and inclusive world. Work by scholars like the recently deceased historian Saleem Kidwai and Ruth Vanita, a professor at the University of Montana reveal that queer identity is very much situated in Indianness. Inclusiveness is a very Indian thing to do. This argument has to be made not just in courts, but also in families and workplaces and educational spaces. What is alien is discrimination.

06-09-2021||India||Kerala’s Covid-19 graph shows a slight dip, 26k cases reported||After recording over 30,000 cases in the last few days, Kerala on Sunday reported 26,701 fresh Covid-19 cases and 74 deaths pushing the total infection count to 4,207,838 and the fatalities till date to 21,496, according to the state health ministry. The test positivity rate (TPR) was 17.17 per cent after testing 155,543 samples in the last 24 hours, the health ministry said .Kozhikode district topped the table with 3,336 fresh cases, followed by Thrissur 3,214 and Ernakulam 2,915. A look at last seven days’ average TPR shows that four districts, Thrissur (23.37%), Palakkad (22.10%), Kozhikode (21.48%) and Wayanad 20.65%, reported more than 20 per cent positivity rate. In some of the worst affected districts like Malappuram and Ernakulam, cases subsided a bit and TPR dipped to 15-20% bracket. Kasaragod in north Kerala recorded the lowest TPR with 12.91%. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines, TPR should be below 5 per cent if an area has to be declared out of the critical zone. Majority of the districts in the state reported three to four times higher the rate explaining the intensity of the infection. The country on Sunday reported 42,766 new cases, 308 deaths while the TPR is below 3%. As per government data, Kerala’s high caseload is the prime reason for the national surge. With cases showing no sign of declining, the government has decided to take strict action against those found violating home quarantine guidelines. Those who violate the norms will now be booked, fined , which startes from ₹2000 onwards, and they will be shifted to institutional quarantine centres by the police, expenses of which will have to been born by the violators. Many experts have blamed lax home quarantine rules for the persistent surge in cases. In north Kerala, many houses still have joint family which results in spreading the virus among other members. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday said situation was under control and that there was no big jump in infections after the Onam festival and also adding that situation will subside by the second week of September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-covid-19-graph-shows-a-slight-dip-26k-cases-reported-101630866760210.html
06-09-2021||India||Karnataka allows Ganesh festival with Covid curbs||The Karnataka government on Sunday decided to allow Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations in districts where the positivity rate is less than 2 per cent , with a set of restrictions, which will remain in place for five days.“The (Karnataka) government is allowing the (Ganesh Chathurthi) festival but many restrictions are there. There will be no procession orchestra, no DJ and pandals must be 50/50 (meaning??) and Covid vaccination is compulsory wherever the Ganapathy festival is being held,” R Ashok, Karnataka’s revenue minister said on Sunday.The decision was taken after an hour-long meeting chaired by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, members of the experts committee, cabinet members and other officials in Bengaluru on Sunday.The move to allow public celebration of Ganesh Chathurthi comes at a time when Karnataka’s new Covid-19 infections appear to have stabilized but the threat of the virus remains just as potent as the first two waves.Though the Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has retained a significant number of restrictions like night and weekend curfew in different parts of the state, the decision was also taken after a number of members from the saffron outfit insisted that permission be given to celebrate a “Hindu festival”.Ashok said that the government has approved to allow one Ganesh festival per ward in urban areas and that district authorities would decide on similar requests in rural regions.However, the minister was not clear on how the government or authorities will decide who will be allowed to keep the idol in public spaces. In Karnataka, like other states, Ganesh Chathurthi is celebrated with much pomp and fervour with public processions, dance, cultural programmes which attracts large crowds of worshippers and others.The festival also sees competition by local groups, backed by political leaders, to celebrate the day as a spectacle of sorts with new designs of the deity that is placed in pandals by collecting money from the public and small establishments in these localities.“The police, local authorities and MLA will not compromise. Because Covid is also very important,” Ashok said.The minister also said that in border districts where the positivity rate is higher than 2%, the festival cannot be celebrated in public.Ashok said that the decision was taken after consulting the experts as well.The minister said that all committee members incharge of public installation of these idols will have to be vaccinated.The government has also decided to set up vaccination centres at such places where the idol will be kept and doses will be administered.In apartment complexes, no more than 20 persons will be allowed and several such residential spaces have come up with innovative ways like online darshan to avoid people gathering in small spaces, Ashok said.Despite the restrictions being imposed on the common man, political leaders continue to flout Covid norms during events like campaigning and other programmes that witnessed huge crowds with no masks nor maintaining social distancing and taking other precautions.There are 17,501 active Covid-19 cases in Karnataka after 1,117 more people tested positive, the state health department said in its daily bulletin on Sunday. The bulletin also added that 1,354 more recovered and the death toll rose to 37409 as eight more people succumbed to the virus. The positivity and case fatality rate both stood at 0.71%, data shows.Bengaluru’s active case count rose to 7,205 as 358 more tested positive. There were 530 more recoveries and the death toll rose to 16,024 as five more people died in India’s IT capital.Ashok said that experts predict that a third wave of infections in Karnataka is expected around October and that the next two months is crucial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-allows-ganesh-festival-with-covid-curbs-101630866759201.html
06-09-2021||India||Infra challenges keep B’luru on the back foot||Bengaluru is arguably one of India’s well-known cities globally, housing large corporations and getting monikers like ‘technology and start-up capital’, among other attributes that give the city a distinct identity. To top it up, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai also shared his ‘new vision’ for the city. His aim is to double the existing metro lines to over 300kms, interlinking multi-modal transport systems, pursuing large infrastructure projects and other ambitious targets.However, irrespective of the political party or the man in charge of the state, reality has been very different to the dreams these state leaders have promised to the city’s residents.Since 2007, the Bengaluru Metro project, currently underway in the city and will continue to be under construction for at least another ten years, has just completed 56kms of operational lines with another 100kms in various stages of construction left. That is an average of just 4kms per year.“Do not compare Phase-I because the challenges were different. It was a learning process for us. But today, we are not in that situation. Today, we’re in a much better situation in terms of technology, in terms of what problem you faced at that time, and how it has been solved. So, whatever time Phase-I took, you cannot put phase-II in that frame. Phase-II is much faster,” Anjum Parvez, the managing director of Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) said.According to Parvez, the underground work can on the average move around four meters per day while the overground is almost double that.Bengaluru is one of the biggest revenue earners for the state and Centre’s coffers with its large Information Technology exports industry but the public infrastructure reality for its over 12 million residents is almost an antithesis, experts said.The lack of vision in the project is apparent as overhead and underground lines are now being forced into the larger plans in the name of “integration”, the experts added.Legendary architect Charles Correa in 2011 made no secret of his criticism of the Metro. “Elegantly designed, the entire Metro could have been a hi-tech train, a symbol of Bangalore, it’s IT industry... Many places in the world have used steel for similar trains. But now you are stuck with this, you cannot dismantle it; you cannot get rid of it even if you bomb it. It is vandalism,” he said, the Times of India reported.Despite the capital and employment generation, the city is better known for its nasty traffic, crater-abundant roads, toxic lakes, rising pollution levels that demonstrate the “shortsightedness” of the city’s administration and planners today, experts said.“We are a city and country of announcements and not one of delivery. We are weak on delivery, planning (and) overall vision of what it means to live in a city,” V Ravichandar, an urban infrastructure expert, chairman of a consulting firm, Feedback Consulting and a former member of Bangalore Agenda Task Force (BATF).On Saturday, residents of Anjanapura on Kanakapura Road in the southern part of Bengaluru used Coracles to cross the road and even planted paddy to vent their anger for the poor and water-logged road to protest the administration’s apathy.“Anywhere you go, it is impossible to drive without potholes. It has become kind of a Mohenjo Daro excavation city, which is perpetually dug up,” Ravichandar added.Most, if not all, of Bengaluru’s roads, are perpetually dug up in the garb of development, smart city and various other projects that have made it a nightmare for commuters and pedestrians, who do nothing short of risking their lives each time they tread these streets.Gaurav Gupta, the chief commissioner of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on Sunday said that the city’s civic body has issued directions to fix these potholes.“Road infrastructure department has been taking up road development work through arterial and sub arterial roads development, project (central zone) department, under white topping and TenderSure Road projects. Due to a lack of coordination in various departments, fixing the potholes has not been adequate,” Gupta said.The lack of coordination is largely due to the existence of multiple agencies like Bengaluru Development Authority, BBMP, Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board and Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority, among others whose area of scope overlaps and adds to the lack of coordination between multiple agencies and their exact purpose.A crackdown by the Karnataka high court, following the tragic death of a 19-year-old medical student on February 6, and hearings of Public Interest Litigations (PILs) have revealed that there are at least 5,435 potholes, bad roads or bad footpaths in Bengaluru, Hindustan Times reported in March.The data was revealed in a report submitted by the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority (KSLSA) to the Karnataka high court. However, these 5,435 may well be a sampling. KSLSA arrived at these numbers by conducting a surprise inspection of 25 roads in the city based on information collected from volunteers.The HC had come down heavily on BBMP’s inaction following the death of a 19-year-old medical student, Tasdeeq Bushra while trying to avoid a pothole and was hit by the truck belonging to BBMP on Lingarajapuram-Hennur main road. “Imagine people dying because of potholes on roads. Imagine the plight of the family,” a division bench of Justice BV Nagarathna and Justice MG Uma said during the hearing of a PIL on February 8, Hindustan Times reported.According to Knight Frank, a real-estate consulting firm’s Bengaluru Infrastructure Report-2020, the city’s population was projected to rise from 11.69 million in 2011 to 16.48 million in 2021, registering a 40% increase in 10 years as against 29.3% the previous decade.The vehicular growth has matched the rise in population, 3.79 million in 2010-11 to almost 9.4 million as of May 2020, according to Department of Urban Land Transport and the Knight Frank report.Bommai has said that he will now supervise all mega projects undertaken in the city and dedicate the first working hour of his day to monitor its progress.But whether the projects make progress is a question the chief minister has no answer to at the moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infra-challenges-keep-b-luru-on-the-back-foot-101630866757969.html
06-09-2021||India||Bengaluru breaches 10 million vaccine mark; rural areas still lagging||Bengaluru on Sunday breached the 10 million vaccination mark, as the total number of doses administered in the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) region rose to 1,00,69,050, as per CoWin data as of 8.45 pm on Sunday.This includes 7,180,718 first doses and 2,888,332 second doses, data shows.“As of today, BBMP has administered a total of 1,00,37,956 doses in B’luru. More than 10 million doses only means that we will continue to vaccinate every eligible adult! We believe Covid-19 can be completely kept at bay when all of us are fully vaccinated. Towards a stronger Bengaluru!” Gaurav Gupta, the chief commissioner of the BBMP said in a post on Twitter.With this, the total number of doses administered in Karnataka rose to 4,49,94, 227 which includes 3,37,45,573 first and 1,12,48,654 second doses, according to CoWin data.Bengaluru accounts for almost a quarter of all doses administered in the southern state as against only three quarters in all 29 other districts.Data shows that the government has continued to prioritise urban areas of the state over rural regions.Out of the 191,287 doses administered on Sunday till 8.45 pm in the state, the coffee growing region of Kodagu, about 225 kms from Bengaluru, accounted for only 246.The contrast in vaccination drives is apparent in other districts of the state when compared to Bengaluru which has fueled the state’s drive but clearly left a void in rural regions, Hindustan Times reported on Saturday.Out of the 44 million vaccines administered in Karnataka, Kodagu accounts for just 454,000, data shows.Kodagu is one of two districts in the state where restrictions which were imposed over two months ago remain in force due to the high positivity rate in the region allegedly due to its proximity with Kerala.Locals have complained about the frequently sighted “no stock” boards on the health centres in Kodagu, forcing many to remain indoors.Access to vaccine centres in such places is also very poor in such regions where people have to travel long distances which has become more difficult with the recent bout of rains in the state.The situation is similar in districts like Bidar, Yadgir, Gadag and Chamarajanagar where, officials said, vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-breaches-10-million-vaccine-mark-rural-areas-still-lagging-101630866700170.html

06-09-2021||India||C’garh CM Baghel’s father booked over hate speech against brahmins||Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel’s father Nand Kumar Baghel, 86, has been booked for allegedly making derogatory remarks against the Brahmin community, saying they should be boycotted, officials said on Sunday.The chief minister reacted to the FIR saying “nobody is above the law”.A case for promoting enmity between different groups was registered against the CM’s father on the complaint of Sarv Brahmin Samaj at the DD Nagar police station in Raipur city on Saturday, the officials said.“A case was registered under Indian Penal Code Sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language) and 505(1)(b) (with intent to cause, or likely to cause, fear or alarm to public, or to any section of public whereby any person may be induced to commit offence against the state or against public tranquillity) against Nand Kumar Baghel (86),” said superintendent of police , Raipur, Ajay Yadav.In its complaint, the outfit has alleged that the CM’s father at an event in Uttar Pradesh last week urged people to “boycott Brahmins” and termed them “foreigners”. It also accused the 86-year-old of asking people to “evict” Brahmins from the country, an official said. A video of the event has since been widely circulated on social media. HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the clip.In the past also, the CM’s father allegedly made derogatory comments against Lord Ram, the official said, citing the complaint.In a statement issued after the FIR was filed, the chief minister said: “Remarks made by my father Nand Kumar Baghel against a particular caste have come to my attention. The comments have hurt the sentiments of the community as well as social harmony and I was also pained by it.”“Every person is equal before my government. Everyone knows about my ideological differences with my father. Our political thoughts and beliefs are different. I honour him as his son but as a CM I cannot forgive him for such statements which disturb public order,” the statement said, adding that legal action in the matter will be ensured.“Nobody is above the law in my government even if he is the chief minister’s 86-year-old father,” the CM said.The SP said the police will follow all the legal procedures and the accused will be arrested soon.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cgarh-cm-baghel-s-father-booked-over-hate-speech-against-brahmins-101630866457225.html
06-09-2021||India||Management schools record 23% dip in placements amid Covid: AICTE data||India’s management schools saw a 23% drop in placements in the academic year 2020-21 as compared to 2019-20, according to data compiled by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), the country’s professional education regulator. The sharp decline -- the placement figures plummeted to a nine-year low in 2020 -- is being attributed to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on education and the economy.Official statistics reviewed by Hindustan Times revealed that only 92,322 students in management courses graduated with jobs in hand from AICTE-approved management colleges in 2020-21 as compared to 119,546 students the previous year. The numbers relate to students enrolled in AICTE-approved management colleges and institutes in undergraduate, postgraduate and diploma courses in management. Enrollment remained the same during both the academic years, the data showed.AICTE chairperson Anil Dattatraya Sahasrabudhe attributed the decline to classes, even internships, shifting out of physical locations to the online mode due to the pandemic.“The pandemic forced all education institutions, including those offering professional courses, to switch to online education for the entire academic year 2020-21. Many companies, as a part of their recruitment policies, observe the candidate during internships and then hire them. This could not happen in the last academic year since even internships were held online,” Sahasrabudhe said.“Besides, the entire placement process was conducted in an online mode unlike the 2019-20 session when the major part of the process was already completed before the pandemic hit. It looks like many companies were not keen on hiring a lot of people based on their performance in virtual internships and interviews.”Officials at several management institutes attributed the drop in placements to the Covid-19 pandemic which resulted in uncertainties including inadequate training during the online internships, virtual recruitment process and adverse market conditions.The data shows that placements dropped even in states known for their strong service sectors such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi, and Maharashtra, amid the pandemic.In Andhra Pradesh’s 330 institutes, the placements dropped by 35% to 6,982 while in national capital Delhi, only 2,569 students in 40 institutes in the city received a job offer in 2020-21, a 37% decline over 2019-20’s 4,053 students.According to the data, B-Schools in other states also saw placements plunging: Maharashtra (20%), Karnataka (15%), Tamil Nadu (26%), Madhya Pradesh (22%) and Uttar Pradesh (28%) all saw a dip.A second AICTE official who has analysed the data from the country’s 3,100 management institutes, most of them are in the private sector, said the biggest impact was reported in new or less sought-after colleges (also known as tier-2 or tier-3 colleges).These figures exclude the premier Indian Institute of Management (IIMs) since they are autonomous and do not fall under the purview of AICTE.C Poovendran, placement officer at Coimbatore Institute of Management and Technology in Tamilnadu, said they were among those institutes where placements took a hit. “The pandemic had completely changed the way we used to conduct placement drives and badly affected the job market. Despite our best possible efforts, we could not get as many recruiters as we do in normal times. The job opportunities were really low in some sectors including human resources, marketing and hospitality. Things are slowly picking up now and we expect to conduct offline placement drives this year,” he said.“We had to put extra efforts to recruiters to get this 2020-21 batch placed,” said an official at a new management institute in Andhra Pradesh’s Guntur district.“Even if there were recruiters, the number of people they wanted to hire was very low because of the changes in recruitment policies of companies amid the pandemic. Institutes like us who are still in the process of building their brands were worst affected by the pandemic in terms of placements,” the official said on condition of anonymity.But there were several other institutes such as FORE School of Management, Sydenham Institute of Management Studies, Research and Entrepreneurship and Delhi Technical University (DTU) in Delhi, and Jaipuria Institute of Management in Ghaziabad, who insisted that the number of placements did not drop. But they acknowledged difficulties in getting recruiters in several sectors.“The sectors which were hiring well earlier namely hospitality, manufacturing and real estate have considerably decreased the intake as these industries have been severely impacted by the pandemic. Whereas, Ed tech, insurance and healthcare saw a proliferation in the business due to online classes, the uncertainty of life and need of healthcare services respectively,” said Ashwani Varshney, Dean (student welfare), Jaipuria Institute in Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/management-schools-record-23-dip-in-placements-amid-covid-aicte-data-101630866337905.html
06-09-2021||India||RSS distances itself from article on Infosys||The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on Sunday distanced itself from an article published in its affiliate Hindi magazine Panchjanya, which alleged that Bengaluru-based IT major Infosys supported “anti-national” forces.The four-page article, which appeared as the cover story in the current edition of the weekly magazine with the headline ‘Saakh Aur Aaghaat’ (‘reputation and affront’), accused Infosys of trying to destabilise the Indian economy and also accused it of helping “Naxals, Leftists and tukde tukde gang”.Clarifying the organisation’s stand, RSS spokesperson Sunil Ambekar said in a Twitter post: “As an Indian company, Infosys has made seminal contribution in progress of the country. There might be certain issues with a portal run by Infosys, but the article published by Panchjanya in this context only reflects individual opinion of the author.”“Panchjanya is not a mouthpiece of the RSS and the said article or opinions expressed in it should not be linked with the RSS,” he added.The article comes in the backdrop of glitches in the new Income Tax e-filing portal developed by Infosys. Last month, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman summoned the firm’s CEO, Salil Parekh, and asked him to fix the glitches in the I-T portal by September 15.Following the RSS statement, Panchjanya Editor Hitesh Shankar tweeted, “Panchjanya stands firm with its report. If Infosys has objections, it should present its side by urging for a more thorough investigation...”The article drew flak from the Opposition parties.“The scurrilous attack on Infosys in a RSS publication is outrageous and actually anti-national. Companies like Infosys have transformed India... The article is an attempt to shift the blame from the Govt...,” Congress leader Jairam Ramesh tweeted.Shiv Sena leader Priyanka Chaturvedi on Sunday questioned the “silence” of India Inc on the issue months after commerce minister Piyush Goyal’s criticism of Tata Sons.“Then they came for me. And there was no one left to speak out for me” “RSS affiliated Panchajanya, says Infosys is working with anti-national forces and is part of tukde tukde gang. First the attack on Tatas by Commerce Minister and now this. Silence by industry biggies. Okay,” she said in a tweet.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-distances-itself-from-article-on-infosys-101630865617166.html
06-09-2021||India||President Kovind honours 44 teachers for outstanding work||President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday conferred the National Teachers’ Awards on 44 teachers for their remarkable contributions to the field of education, as he stressed the need to ensure “the all-round development of each child according to their special needs, interests and abilities”.The Union education ministry awards teachers for their achievements every year on Teachers Day -- celebrated on September 5 to mark the birth anniversary of the first Vice President of India, Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.“Teachers should pay special attention to the fact that each student has different abilities, talents, psychology, social background and environment. Therefore, emphasis should be laid on the all-around development of each child according to their special needs, interests and abilities,” said the President during the virtual award ceremony.Noting that the primary responsibility of a teacher is to combine the inherent talents of the students with theirs, Kovind added: “A good teacher is a personality-builder, a society-builder and a nation-builder...Our education system should be such that students develop a commitment to the constitutional values and fundamental duties, strengthen patriotic feeling, and make them aware of their role in the changing global scenario.”The President also appreciated the teachers for their efforts to ensure that the Covid-19 pandemic does not hinder students’ education. “In this situation, even when all schools and colleges were closed, teachers did not allow children’s education to stop. For this, teachers learned to use digital platforms in a very short time and continued the education process. Some teachers have developed remarkable infrastructure in schools with their hard work and dedication. I appreciate such dedicated teachers and hope that the entire teaching community will keep on changing its teaching methods according to the changing circumstances.”The awardees include two teachers each from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Sikkim, Odisha, Bihar, Gujarat, Delhi and Rajasthan. This year, the online self-nomination process was followed by a three-tier selection process at district, state and national levels.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also lauded the teachers on the day. “On Teachers’ Day, greetings to the entire teaching fraternity, which has always played a pivotal role in nurturing young minds. It is commendable how teachers have innovated and ensured the education journey of students continues in the Covid-19 times,” he said in a Twitter post.In a related development, the Prime Minister’s Office announced on Sunday that Modi will virtually address teachers, students, parents, and stakeholders associated with the education sector during a conclave on Tuesday.During the inaugural session of the conclave, the PM will launch several initiatives including Indian Sign language dictionary of 10,000 words, audiobooks for visually impaired students, social quality assessment and accreditation framework (SQAAF) of CBSE, NISTHA teachers’ training programme, and ‘Vidyanjali Portal’ for facilitating donors of CSR contributions for school development, the PMO said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-rise-a-concern-for-india-ex-cia-official-101630865497159.html
06-09-2021||India||SC fines lawyer for trying to block selection of HC judge||The collegium system of appointing judges has adequate safeguards and any attempt to prejudice a collegium against a candidate must be dealt with sternly, said the Supreme Court as it imposed a penalty of ₹5 lakh on a lawyer for trying to block the selection of a high court judge.A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh termed it a “gross abuse of process of law” to file petitions in the constitutional courts with the sole motive of obstructing a candidate’s elevation to the high court as a judge.“The process of appointment of judges to the High Court is under a well-known established process where the collegium of the High Court considers recommending the names and in case of judicial officers by seniority and on merits,” said the bench.It further noted: “Thereafter, the proposed IB (Intelligence Bureau) inputs and other inputs are obtained and the Government processes the names. The collegium of the Supreme Court has the benefit of all the material before taking a call on whether to recommend the name or not. The appointment takes place thereafter by issuance of warrants of appointment. Thus, sufficient safeguards exist in the system.”The collegium system, which does not find mention in the Indian Constitution, was evolved through the judgments of the Supreme Court, starting 1981 and culminating in the final judgment in 1998 when it was declared that the Chief Justice of India, along with four senior-most judges of the apex court, will make recommendations to the Union government for appointment of judges in the high courts and the Supreme Court. The judgments also laid down that while the government will be consulted on names, the CJI will have primacy in matters of appointment.The central government tried to have a greater say in the appointment process by bringing in the National Judicial Appointment Commission (NJAC) in 2014 through a law that envisaged a role for the law minister and some independent jurists.But the constitutional amendment validating the NJAC was quashed by the Supreme Court in 2015 while ruling that judges’ appointments shall continue to be made by the collegium system in which the CJI will have “the last word”. However, the collegium system continues to be criticised by a section for being non-transparent and lacking objective yardsticks for the appointment of judges.Meanwhile, the bench observed that the collegium system has in-built safeguards to take into account seniority, comparative merit and other relevant factors of the candidates being considered for appointments.In the present case, it noted that multiple proceedings were initiated by advocate B Sailesh Saxena targeting Telangana high court’s registrar general Venkateswara Reddy to stall his elevation as a judge in the high court.“This is gross abuse of process of law...We consider the endeavour of the petitioner (Saxena) as one of harassing Respondent No. 4 (Reddy) and abusing the court proceedings and since nothing else seem to deter the petitioner in such endeavours, we are of the view that appropriate imposition of costs seems to be the only solution,” held the bench in its order last Friday.The court also asked the Bar Council of Telangana to examine Saxena’s conduct and take appropriate action.The bench said it is “surprised at the brazenness” of Saxena who chose to file a writ petition in the Supreme Court after the Telangana high court had already dismissed his separate petition in 2018 while noting that the lawyer was an accused in six criminal complaints involving charges of forgery and creation of fake documents.In one of these cases, the court said the registrar general, on the direction of the high court, had lodged a complaint against Saxena for filing a petition in a land dispute case by submitting fake and forged documents of non-existent people.“Respondent No. 4 (Reddy), as the responsible officer, only followed the direction passed by the learned judge of the high court,” said the bench, adding the high court had dismissed Saxena’s petition holding it to be an abuse of the process of law and a counterblast to the series of criminal complaints filed against him.The bench then proceeded to dismiss Saxena’s petition with a cost of ₹5 lakh, which, it said, will be deposited with the Supreme Court Advocates On Record Welfare Fund within four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-fines-lawyer-for-trying-to-block-selection-of-hc-judge-101630865437640.html
06-09-2021||India||Discontent in RSS over Centre’s monetisation policy||There is unease among the affiliates of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological fount of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), over the Union government’s decision to announce a monetisation policy, the delay in addressing concerns over high inflation, and New Delhi’s formal engagement with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, said people aware of the developments.According to RSS functionaries, the issue of rising prices has been underscored by various affiliates of the Sangh. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), one of the largest labour unions, at its national executive has already passed a resolution against price rise and asked the government to take remedial steps.“The situation has worsened after Covid. Workers are the most affected by job cuts and wage cuts and there is no control over inflation,” said Binay Kumar Sinha, general secretary of the BMS.The affiliate that has called for a nationwide protest on September 9 against inflation has also suggested that apart from mentioning the selling price of products, the government should introduce the provision where the cost of production is also mentioned on the label so that people are aware of the profits that companies are making.“For instance, in the pharma sector, there is no control over how much profits they can make. Similarly, if the government has been talking of one nation, one tax, why not bring petrol under GST to prevent everyday fluctuations that affect the lives of the common man? We have also been demanding that edible oils and other food items should also be brought under the ambit of the Essential Commodities Act to prevent hoarding and black marketing,” Sinha said.While the BMS will also hold a pan-India protest on the national monetisation pipeline (NMP) on November 2, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, an RSS affiliate that pushes for indigenous production and opposes privatisation and disinvestment, has also criticised the ₹6-lakh crore NMP programme unveiled by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month.While the government has defended the plan to raise funds by leasing infrastructure assets of the central government ministries and state-run companies under NMP over four years, from FY 2022 to FY 2025, the SJM has cautioned against letting assets into private hands.A senior functionary of the SJM said that it is still studying the finer details of the policy and will soon come out with its observations, but it is not in support of any move to give national assets into private hands.“A quick assessment shows there will be practical problems in the implementation of the monetisation policy since there are so many assets involved. Besides, the government itself claims that the use of technology has cut inefficiencies. For example, after the use of FastTags, revenue losses have been plugged, so where is the need for monetisation if technology can come in handy to plug losses and improve efficiency?” the functionary said.Sinha said the government should look at alternative revenue generation models. “Corporatisation and monetisation are just juggleries of words, the aim is to privatise industries and we are against it. We have been suggesting alternative models of revenue generation. We have also been saying that the government must look at rationalisation. Use the money for creating jobs and strengthening the sectors,” he said.The government, for its part, has refuted the charge that the monestisation policy is selling off assets. The finance minister, while speaking at an event in Mumbai on August 25, had said there will be handing back of assets being monetised, and only underutilised brownfield assets will be offered up for better use without any change of ownership.Apart from the Sangh affiliates, opposition parties such as the Congress had termed the NMP policy “a scandal and a daylight robbery” and said the Union government was planning to sell off the assets created in 70 years of Independence.On the issue of talks with the Taliban, a senior functionary said though the Sangh has praised the Union government’s efforts in evacuating Hindus and Sikhs from Afghanistan, the idea of engaging with the Taliban has evoked criticism among a section. Earlier this week, the ministry of external affairs said India’s ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, met with the head of the Taliban’s political office, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, following a request from the Taliban. They discussed the safety, security and early return of Indian nationals in Afghanistan, the ministry said.“The Sangh normally does not interfere in issues related to foreign policy, but we are watching the developments unfold,” the functionary said on condition of anonymity.In the past, the Sangh has advocated a muscular policy to deal with Pakistan and China and its affiliates have mobilised campaigns to boycott Chinese goods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/discontent-in-rss-over-centre-s-monetisation-policy-101630865378299.html
06-09-2021||India||Kerala on high alert as Nipah resurfaces, 12-year-old dead||A 12-year-old boy died on Sunday after being infected with the Nipah virus in Kerala, prompting the Centre to rush a team of experts to the state that is also recording a surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, officials familiar with the matter said.The boy was initially admitted to a hospital on August 25 and later shifted to the government medical college and then to a private hospital on September 1. His samples were to the Pune National Institute of Virology, which confirmed the presence of the virus, state health minister Veena George said.“A case of Nipah virus has been detected in Kozhikode district of Kerala. A 12- year-old boy who presented with features of encephalitis and myocarditis was reported on September 3, 2021… The boy was hospitalised and has passed away,” the Union health ministry said in a statement and added that “the central government has rushed a team of NCDC (National Centre for Disease Control) to the state” to provide technical support to local authorities.The virus that causes high fever, headache and coma in extreme cases is spread by fruit bats. Body fluids can cause human-to-human transmission of Nipah, which can have a mortality rate of up to 75%, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). There is no treatment or vaccine available for either people or animals. State health authorities said they were trying to ascertain the source of the infection but like previous cases, fruit bats were likely to be the primary cause this time, too.The public health measures that the Centre has advised to the state include active case search in the boy’s family, village and areas with similar topography (especially Malappuram); active contact tracing during the past 12 days at least; strict quarantine of the contacts and isolation of any suspects; and collection and transportation of samples for lab testing.George said they have identified 188 primary and secondary contacts of the boy and placed them under observation. “We have identified 188 contacts till now. The surveillance team has marked 20 of them as high-risk contacts. Two of these high-risk contacts have symptoms. Both are health workers,” she said.Kerala has witnessed localised outbreaks of the disease in the past. In May 2018, the virus claimed 17 lives in the state.The state government assured the public that the situation was under control. “No need to panic. But a high vigil is the need of the hour. We have a strict Nipah protocol and we will go by this,” George said.Critical care expert Dr AS Anoop Kumar who played a key role in containing the 2018 outbreak, said they were better prepared to deal with the disease this time around.“Situation is not like 2018 when we were totally in the dark. Since a majority of people are observing physical distance and masking it can be contained effectively,” Kumar said.According to WHO, Nipah virus was first identified during an outbreak in Malaysia in 1998. “Both animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission have been documented. From 1998 to 2015, more than 600 cases of Nipah virus human infections were reported. Subsequent outbreaks in India and Bangladesh have occurred with high case fatality,” said a WHO document.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-on-high-alert-as-nipah-resurfaces-12-year-old-dead-101630865323656.html
06-09-2021||India||RSS icon, Ambedkar to be part of MBBS course in Madhya Pradesh||Medical students in Madhya Pradesh will now be taught about RSS founder KB Hedgewar, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leader Deendayal Upadhyaya, Swami Vivekananda and BR Ambedkar as part of the first-year foundation course, state education minister Vishwas Sarang said on Sunday. The next academic session for MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery) students is likely to start from 2021-22.“I have asked to add this in the foundation course as we don’t want to just teach the students expert knowledge about a subject. We want to make them responsible citizens. We will educate them about the Indian tradition and ideology through the life and deeds of famous personalities,” Sarang said.“The National Medical Council (NMC) has said that ethical values should be part of the foundation course in the first year (of MBBS). So we thought of incorporating these great personalities for building the character of students,” he added.An official familiar with the matter said the addition was made on the basis of the recommendations made by a five-member committee of the medical education department. “We have not made any changes in the topics of medical education programme 2019 of National Medical Commission. The life and deeds of famous personalities have been added as a lecture on the topic of Medical Ethics. We have included it to inspire the future doctors and motivate them to work hard,” said the official, who asked not to be named.The additional lectures are likely to be clubbed in the topic of medical ethics in the foundation course, added the official.Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, a surgeon, founded the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh in Nagpur in 1925. Deendayal Upadhyaya was one of the prominent leaders of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh and the forerunner of the BJP.Hailing the leaders, the education minister said: “RSS first chief Hedgewarji, Upadhyayaji, Vivekanandji and BR Ambedkarji were great visionaries and human beings. Their lives were based on values. Their thoughts, conduct, and very personalities are inspiring.”“Deendayalji’s thought of ‘Antyodaya’ for helping the last man (the poorest of the poor) was exemplary. Swami Vivekanandji travelled far off lands to showcase the Indian vision. B R Ambedkar was born in a poor family but he went on to frame our Constitution. We have decided to teach (MBBS) students about the inspiring lives of these great personalities from the coming academic session (2021),” Sarang added.The medical fraternity, however, expressed concerns over the additions.“If they want the students to motivate by teaching life and deeds of famous personalities, they should teach about good doctors and scientists. They shouldn’t force students to teach about heroes of one particular ideology. By doing this, they are spoiling the future of medical students by putting a tag of being rightist,” said Dr Anurag Gupta, state unit chief of the Indian Medical Association (medical students’ network).The Opposition, too, attacked the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state for “imposing” its ideology on the students.“BJP keeps working to impose its ideology and its particular agenda on the people, whether it is in the field of education or other areas. Now MBBS students in Madhya Pradesh will be taught the thoughts of the founders of Jan Sangh and RSS. BJP leaders are deliberately working to distort the history, glorify their leaders and impose their ideology,” said Kamal Nath, the Congress’s state unit chief and former chief minister.BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said: “It is a very good decision of the state government and before accusing BJP of imposing an ideology, they should at least see the history of Congress of promoting and glorifying only one family.”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-icon-ambedkar-to-be-part-of-mbbs-course-in-madhya-pradesh-101630865318607.html
06-09-2021||India||Maharashtra lists 7 ‘districts of concern’, Mumbai also faces Covid spike||The Maharashtra government on Sunday identified seven of the state’s western districts, including Pune, as regions of “concern” and took note of an upward trend in new cases in Mumbai, as the state government grapples with concerns that a new wave of the pandemic could be in the making.The last 10 days have not seen any drop in the number of cases; instead, there has been a slight jump in new infections, said state health authorities at a conference in Mumbai.The observations about the seven “districts of concern” – Pune, Ahmednagar, Satara, Solapur, Sangli, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg – were part of a presentation made by additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas during a conference called ‘Majha Doctor’ (My Doctor) that was chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in Mumbai on Sunday.Data showed that even though the weekly positivity rate stayed below 5% in all districts for the last several weeks, this week, some districts such as Pune and Ahmednagar saw the figure at 6.58% and 5.08%, respectively. Mumbai was back among the top five districts having the most cases.Of the total 52,025 active cases in the state, 90.61% belong to 10 districts of which 37,897 or 72.84% are located just in five districts – Pune, Thane, Satara, Ahmednagar and Mumbai.The state authorities have termed Pune, Ahmednagar, Satara, Solapur, Sangli, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg as ‘districts of concern’. “The growth rate of new infections, and weekly positivity rate in these districts is too high. With the Ganesh festival beginning Friday, likely to be celebrated on a large scale in these districts, there are chances of a third wave starting... The district administrations need to take utmost care,” said Dr Vyas.Of the 44,437 new Covid-19 infections reported in the state in the last 10 days, 30,313 (68%) are from Pune (22%), Ahmednagar (17%), Satara (11%), Solapur and Mumbai (9% each), while the remaining 32% patients are from 30 districts. After reporting less than 400 cases consistently for 38 days — from July 25 to August 31 — new infections in Mumbai are again nearing the 500-mark. There were 495 new Covid-19 infections reported in the metropolis on Sunday.Vyas, however, said that the second wave in 17 of the remaining districts appears to have subsided for now. Seven of them have less than 10 active patients while in 11, the number of active patients ranges between 11 and 100. Most of these districts are in Vidarbha and Marathwada. At the conference, CM Thackeray said his government’s priority is to avert the third wave or reduce its intensity if it strikes. “We have increased the number of beds, but the question is whether we would be able to supply the oxygen required for the patients. Almost 80,000 patients during the peak of the second wave required oxygen. We will attempt to ensure that oxygen requirement does not go beyond 1,400 metric tonne per day, which we have been generating every day,” the CM said. He added that at present, 350MT oxygen is being administered to Covid and non-Covid patients daily. “There has been a brief rise in the daily caseload in the last few days, but we endeavour to bring it down to zero,” Thackeray said. Dr Mehul Mehta, who is a senior fellow at Harvard Global Health Institute, said masking up and vaccination were effective tools to keep the infection at bay. He gave the example of the southern part of the United States that has been witnessing a high number of cases because of low vaccination and Covid-inappropriate behaviour by the people. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state-appointed task force, said the state government is aggressively carrying out vaccinations in Dharavi, as there was a possibility that antibodies among the people there have reduced. “During the first wave, our Dharavi model was appreciated across the globe, and despite the Delta Plus variant, daily caseload there could not cross 20 on any given day. But the antibodies among people there is expected to have gone down because of which vaccination drive in Asia’s largest slum is being aggressively implemented,” Joshi said. He added, “Masking and vaccination are two effective tools to avert the third wave or reduce its intensity. The people who have already been infected and have been fully vaccinated have double antibodies.” Dr Joshi also allayed fears about the C 1.2 variant of the virus found in South Africa, saying that it has been seen in just seven countries and the number of cases of the variant is not more than 100.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-lists-7-districts-of-concern-mumbai-also-faces-covid-spike-101630864178773.html
06-09-2021||India||Govt relaxes green norms for projects connecting mines||Roads, conveyor belts, railway infrastructure etc. that connect mines to ports or other destinations can now be considered as standalone projects that can be approved by the regional offices of the union environment ministry, the ministry said in a letter to state governments.“The State Government/User agency shall ensure that dispensation considered by the Ministry is not misused in any way and likely tendencies to detach linear projects from the main proposal of mining should not be encouraged. To the extent possible, linear infrastructure such as roads/railways/conveyor belts, etc. ancillary to mining should be included in the main proposal and under inevitable circumstance only, such proposals submitted by the user agency should be considered as standalone projects,” the letter, dated August 23, stated.It has, however, cautioned that all forest clearance proposals for mining shall have an additional column for the project proponent to certify that they have critically examined the mineral extraction pathways and that no new extraction path outside the mining area shall be proposed during the next five years. As far as possible existing roads, railway infrastructure should be strengthened to minimise forest and tree cover loss, the letter states.The letter states that the ministry of coal had requested the environment ministry to consider the possibility of constructing new linear projects linking mines to dumping or loading sites. The ministry of coal launched an auction for mines last year. In the first tranche 38 were listed and in the second tranche 67 mines in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh were listed for commercial coal mine auctions.“Based on the recommendation of the FAC and approval of the same by the competent authority, the ministry hereby conveys that supplementary linear project linked to mining that are conceived after the start of the original mining, should be considered as a standalone linear project and decisions on according approval for those shall be made at the REC/IRO (regional empowered committee/integrated regional office of MoEFCC) concerned as per provisions provided in the Forest Conservation) Rules, 2003,” the letter stated.Transportation of coal is a contentious issue in many parts of the country where locals have opposed it due its large pollution footprint. For example, locals in Odisha’s Sundargarh district have been opposing transportation of coal through their villages because heavy dust pollution caused by the transportation has been damaging our crop production continuously and children are avoiding school for the fear of being run over according to their petitions submitted to the forest advisory committee.“This delinking of linear infrastructure has to be seen along with the changes in mining laws that allow for mineral extraction without specifying end use. This means that evacuation routes and all the related impacts can continue to shift throughout the life of a mine. Our regulatory appraisal, compliance and monitoring protocols are not designed to address this dynamic demand. In the present case, the enabling conditions are drafted more as a request to user agencies not misuse this privilege and minimize damage. They also give a lot of discretion to the ministry’s regional offices to determine the form and future of linear infrastructure linked to mining projects,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.“All linear projects are considered by regional offices. In this case the ministry has very specifically said that the need for supplementary infrastructure shouldn’t arise at least for the next five years because transportation should be considered by the mining project. If it does arise then regional offices can critically examine the impact of such supplementary projects,” said a senior environment ministry official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-relaxes-green-norms-for-projects-connecting-mines-101630863998260.html

06-09-2021||India||Amid rumours about talks ULFA-I rejigs outfit||Amid speculations on possible peace talks, the banned United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) on Sunday announced ‘structural changes’ in the outfit. According to a statement issued by the militant outfit (which HT has seen) to editors of media organisations, three new councils have been formed with vice-chairman and commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah heading the supreme council. There would be no change in the military wing of the outfit. “With effect from September 4, while the military wing of ULFA-I would remain as before, the outfit’s central working council has unanimously decided to temporarily suspend the constitutional infrastructure and carry out the mentioned structural change,” the brief statement issued by ‘brigadier’ Arunudoy Asom read. There was no mention of what prompted the outfit to make the changes. ULFA-I used to have a military as well as a political wing. There’s no clarity yet on what will be the status of the political wing after creation of the new councils. Besides self-styled general Baruah, two others---self-styled lieutenant general Michael Asom and self-styled major general Nayan Asom are other members of the supreme council. Michael Asom aka Joy Chandra Das was appointed in November last year as deputy c-in-c of the outfit following the surrender of Drishti Rajkhowa, second in command to Baruah, in Meghalaya after a gun battle with security forces. The outfit’s new high council, which has four members, will be headed by Nayan Asom. It will have three other members with rank of self-styled brigadiers. Nayan Asom would also be the chief of lower council of ULFA-I that would have a total of 13 members. Since May this year, when the second Bharatiya Janata Party-led government assumed office in Assam, there have been speculations that ULFA-I could join peace talks with the Centre. The outfit, has, however maintained that the issue of Assam’s sovereignty should be part of talks---a pre-condition, which has been ruled out by the Centre as well the state government. Citing the Covd-19 pandemic, the outfit declared a unilateral ceasefire in May for three months. It was extended by another three months in August. This year, for the first time since its inception in 1979, ULFA-I didn’t boycott the Independence Day celebrations or called for a ‘bandh’ to mark the occasion. “Our organization is not against talks or belligerent. But it is not possible to deny historic facts or waver from our ideological goals in the name of talks. Indian authorities have maintained that talks with ULFA-I can’t include the question of (Assam’s) sovereignty,” ULFA-I said in a statement released in August. “The Constitution of India has been amended nearly 100 times. Why can’t it be amended again to allow for talks with ULFA-I? If India wants talks, it should amend the Constitution to approve right to secede by communities or allow a plebiscite participated in by bonafide indigenous communities,” it added. On Saturday, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told journalists in New Delhi that unofficial links have been established with ULFA-I c-in-c Paresh Baruah (to bring the outfit to talks). “It would take time, but I am hopeful,” he said. ULFA was formed in April 1979 with the aim of establishing a sovereign Assam through armed struggle. The group split in August 2012 with several senior leaders shunning arms and agreeing to sit for talks. The anti-talks faction renamed itself at ULFA-I and continues to pursue the slated goal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-rumours-about-talks-ulfa-i-rejigs-outfit-paresh-baruah-to-head-supreme-council-101630843595955.html
06-09-2021||Editorials||The revolutionary potential of account aggregators||It’s been said by many before but it merits repetition because it is true. What UPI did for payments in India, account aggregators (AAs) will do for credit. This radical mechanism was launched quietly last week, and it has not received as much attention as it deserves, partly because of a lack of comprehension of what it can do. The mechanism is still in its infancy — eight banks have signed on, including the country’s largest State-owned and private lenders. But, once it expands, it can help track the credit footprint of just about every Indian who wants (more) credit.
06-09-2021||Editorials||The symbolism of Muzaffarnagar||On Sunday, farm unions, demanding a repeal of three farm laws, organised a kisan mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar in west Uttar Pradesh (UP). The choice of location had an obvious political subtext. West UP is a stronghold of Jats — who have been at the forefront of the protests along with predominantly Sikh farmers from Punjab. West UP is also the home of Rakesh Tikait, who after a range of short-term political dalliances with a range of political formations, has found strength by returning to issues concerning agriculture that catapulted his father, Mahendra Singh Tikait, to prominence. The fact that Muzaffarnagar was the site of communal violence in 2013, which benefited the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), made it a symbolic site for an agitation against the BJP. But above all, it sent a clear signal that what began as a social movement, rooted in economic grievances, had now acquired a salient political character — with the stated aim of defeating the BJP in the UP assembly elections of 2022.
