A health department official said they acted on a tip on Gurugram’s Devilal Nagar resident Satyendra Pratap Singh who allegedly took pregnant women from the district to Delhi and Uttar Pradesh to abort female foetuses, a crime under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition Of Sex Selection) Act​ (PCPNDT).According to the FIR filed in the matter, the suspect charged ₹35,000-45,000 for sex determination tests and abortion. On Thursday, the health department deployed a decoy “customer” who approached Singh. Singh allegedly took ₹35,000 from the woman at Devilal Nagar and together made their way to Etah where they allegedly met a doctor of a local hospital on Aligarh Road. The doctor was paid around ₹14,500 to conduct an immediate sex determination test, officials said. On his directions, the woman was then taken to another clinic allegedly run by two other suspects who the officials identified as local residents Sanjeev Kumar and Ruchi. There an ultrasound test confirmed a female foetus, said the official. “It was then the health team along with the local police arrived and arrested Kumar and Ruchi at the clinic. Singh was also arrested from Aligarh road while the doctor managed to escape,” said the official.The FIR states that Kumar and Ruchi allegedly confessed that they did not have a medical education or a qualification to conduct the ultrasound, and that their clinic was not registered under PCPNDT Act. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Illegal ultrasound machines have been recovered from the spot. The FIR was filed under several sections of the PCPNDT Act and Indian Medical Council Act late Thursday night after the Gurugram health teams along with the Etah police busted the nexus. In the last few months, several such raids have been conducted. It shows that a network exists in Delhi and UP for illegal abortions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/health-depts-busts-nexus-that-conducted-illegal-sex-determination-101630693221810.html

In a meeting with the district administration officers and people’s representatives, he reviewed the relief and rescue operation launched in the three districts. He also distributed relief material among the flood victims. Speaking in Bahraich, the CM said 15 districts in the state were flood -affected. Bahraich was located on the confluence of Sharda and Ghaghra rivers which entered Uttar Pradesh from Nepal. Due to heavy rainfall in Nepal and the river basin area, there was sudden increase in the water level of the rivers leading to flood. As many as 2,500 people in four villages had been affected, he said. The state government had launched relief and rescue operation on a war footing. National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF), State Disaster Relief Force (SDRF) and Provincial Armed Constabulary had been deployed for relief and rescue operations. Flood posts had been set up, drinking water was being supplied and chlorine tablets had been distributed, he said. Snake venom antidote and anti- rabies vaccines had been supplied to the health centres to protect the people from snake and dog bites, he said. Speaking in Gonda, Yogi said for the third time in this rainy season the people were facing flood. In spite of the heavy rainfall in the area the impact of the flood had been minimized with the launch of the flood control measures. The dredging and channelization of the rivers helped in controlling the flood, he said. Ten villages in Gonda district were flood-affected, he said, adding relief and rescue operations had been launched in the villages. NDRF, SDRF and PAC teams had been deployed as well. Adequate boats and steamers had been arranged to shift the people to safer spots. The state government had directed the district magistrates of the flood -affected districts to carry out survey of crop loss so that compensation was distributed among the farmers who suffered losses, he said. With the decline in the flood water, the outbreak of vector-borne and water -borne disease loomed large. To check this, the state government had launched a special sanitation drive from September 5 to 12. All the departments had been directed to coordinate for the drive, which would be supervised by the people’s representatives, he said. If any person drowned in the flood water or dies of snake bite, his family members would be given ₹4 lakh financial aid. Under the agriculture accident insurance scheme, the family member of the farmers would get ₹5 lakh insurance cover. The people whose houses had been destroyed with flood would also be given compensation, he said. In Balrampur, the CM said with the rise in the water level of the Rapti, 60 villages had been inundated and 65,000 people affected. Relief and rescue operations had been launched in the villages, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yogi-surveys-3-flood-hit-districts-reviews-relief-and-rescue-work-101630693041410.html

Police said the suspect has previously been arrested in 2018 with 407 cartridges, allegedly intended for Maoists in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli, and was also involved in supplying arms and ammunition to criminals in Delhi and Bihar, and Maoists in Odisha as well.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah said that on Wednesday, a team from the special cell received information that a habitual firearms trafficker from Bihar, identified as Ram Krishan Singh alias Master, would reach the area near Sunder Nursery’s parking in south Delhi’s Nizamuddin to deliver a consignment of arms and ammunition.“A trap was laid and Singh was caught with a bag containing five pistols and 200 cartridges. The bullets and pistols were to be supplied to three criminals, including one from trans-Yamuna area,” said DCP Kushwah, adding that Singh had procured the seized items from his contact in Firozabad, Uttar Pradesh.Police said that Singh, a B.Com graduate, worked as a private school teacher in Bihar’s Ara and Bhojpur districts between 1989 and 2014. In 2015, he came in contact with a local criminal who lured him into the illegal trade of arms and ammunition trafficking. In 2018, the special cell arrested Singh with 407 cartridges that he was to deliver to Maoists in Gadhchiroli.“His interrogation at that time led to the arrest of another arms trafficker, Sanjay Singh, from Ara, who carried a reward of ₹1 lakh announced by Bihar Police. Two Maoists -- Ajit Akhil Ray who carried a reward of ₹2 lakh, and Raj Bahadur who carried a reward of ₹1 lakh -- were arrested from Gadhchiroli and Ara respectively. A total of 506 cartridges and several weapons, including INSAS and SLR (rifles) were seized from them,” added Kushwah.Police said Singh remained in jail for nearly four months and came in contact with criminals of Delhi-NCR. Police said though he was inactive for a while, he began the illegal activities post the second wave of Covid-19.

03-09-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram civic body to redevelop a pond to mitigate waterlogging on NH 48||To mitigate waterlogging on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway (national highway 48, NH-48), the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will redevelop a pond at Mohammadpur Jharsa village located near Narsinghpur.Similar to the Minto Bridge in Delhi, the Narsinghpur-Khandsa stretch on the Expressway inevitably floods with a short spell of rain. On Wednesday, the rain was heavy at 100.8mm. The stretch was the worst-affected stretch that day in Gurugram. Such was the waterlogging there that all service lanes and much of the main carriageway were inundated triggering a four-hour-long traffic jam with vehicles taking nearly 25 minutes to cross the three-kilometre stretch.On Thursday evening, the MCG issued a tender inviting bids to redevelop the pond.“We aiming to start the work from October. We have two main objectives with this project. This first is to increase the groundwater table through natural absorption of rainwater and secondly, resolve waterlogging related issues in the area by channelling all rainwater towards the water body,” said Amarjeet Bisla, executive engineer, MCG who is looking after the project.Bisla said that the project will be carried out independently by the MCG.“The village already has a pond. We want to increase its capacity thereby increasing the catchment area. Besides the expressway, it will also solve the waterlogging issues of the village as well as nearby villages such as Khandsa, Narsinghpur, and other vital stretches nearby,” said Bisla.The pond in Mohammadpur Jharsa village is located close to important roads such as the Dwarka Expressway, Pataudi Road and the Central Peripheral Road (CPR). MCG officials said that rainwater from these stretches will also be channelled to the water body.Bisla said that the MCG was encouraged by the success of developing localised ponds in the creeks of Aravallis that accumulate downstream rainwater and prevent flooding of Golf Course Road (GCR) and the agency plans to replicate the same model at other points of the city.As part of the restoring process, Bisla said that encroachments along the catchment area will be cleared, garbage and construction and demolition (C&D) waste will be removed to ensure there is no obstruction in the passage of rainwater towards the pond. The green cover too will also be increased with native plants and trees to absorb and channel rainwater, he added.The entire restoration project is expected to cost around ₹94.56 lakh. Bids of the tender would be opened on September 10, following which a contractor will be finalised.Dr Indu K Murthy, principal research scientist at the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP), said that the authorities should redevelop the pond keeping in mind the current land use and structures around the water body as otherwise it could be counterproductive. “Just diverting rainwater will result in all the waste and muck being piled into the water body and thereby polluting it. Installation of a filter unit for removal of dirt and groundwater-recharging structures is a must for facilitating water recharge and conservation. If planned well, tree planting around the water body can further rejuvenate the environment,” said Murthy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-civic-body-to-redevelop-a-pond-to-mitigate-waterlogging-on-nh-48-101630692200855.html

He alleged that chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh was following in the footsteps of his boss Narendra Modi and was torturing farmers, due to his secret pact with the Badal family. “People of Punjab will never tolerate this,” he added. Criticising Congress state president Navjot Singh Sidhu, Sandhwan said the police of the Congress government was oppressing the farmers, day in and day out; but Sidhu had preferred to be silent on the issue. “Sidhu is seen shouting in favour of farmers from stage, but is yet to utter a word against the caning and the FIRs that the Punjab Police have lodged against farmers,” Sandhwan claimed. SUKHBIR, CAPT BOTH ANTI-FARMER: SISODIA Responding to the Moga lathi-charge, Delhi deputy CM and AAP leader Manish Sisodia tweeted, “Brutal attack by police on farmers in Moga is unpardonable. The eerie silence of Sukhbir Badal, against whom the farmers were protesting and CM Captain Amarinder Singh, to whom the police reports to, further vindicates that both of them are as much anti-farmers as the BJP govt in the Centre.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-questions-punjab-govt-on-cane-charging-farmers-in-moga-101630688240291.html

Such vehicles were allowed to be plied in public places for a considerable period, thus potentially jeopardising public interest and endangering human life and property. It is only under the monitoring of this Court from time to time and more particularly interim orders since 2019 that the corporation took steps for complying with the mandate of law and getting the vehicles registered under the Act,” observed the bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Partha Sarthy.The bench ordered that “no vehicle of the PMC, the state government or its authorities would be plied in derogation of the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988,” and directed the principal secretary (urban development department) to probe and take appropriate action against the erring officers/officials.“The disciplinary proceedings must be completed within four months from today,” the bench said.The HC was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by one Nirbhay Prashant in 2019, seeking direction to the municipal corporation for registration and insurance of around 925 vehicles used for collecting garbage and ensure the collection of revenue loss caused by non-registration and non-insurance of the vehicles of the Corporation. The petitioner stated that he had filed a representation before the municipal commissioner and the secretary, transport department, bringing to their notice the violation of the Motor Vehicles Act by the Corporation, but no action was taken, after which he approached the HC.Later, in its affidavit, the Patna district transport officer admitted that the transport department had come to know of government vehicles plying without registration and the department secretary had written to all officials concerned for registration of official vehicles and submit a list of vehicles plying without registration and insurance. The secretary of the transport department also set up a committee to inquire into the matter.In its order, the bench observed that the Motor Vehicles Act, being a welfare legislation, was enacted to ensure road safety, compensation for victims of road accidents, third party insurance and health and safety of vehicles and registration of vehicles was an essential step in achieving this objective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-slaps-rs-5-lakh-fine-on-pmc-for-plying-925-unregistered-vehicles-101630686920591.html
03-09-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Congress MLA Irfan Ansari backs Taliban, BJP hits back||Congress legislator in Jharkhand Irfan Ansari, who is a former working president of the party’s state unit, on Friday praised Taliban for “having done a good job in forcing the USA to leave Afghanistan”, prompting an immediate backlash from the Opposition.Speaking to media persons at the Jharkhand assembly after the first day of the Monsoon session, Ansari said, “They (Taliban) should be lauded, as they chased the Americans out of Afghanistan. We all know the kind of excesses the American forces used to commit in Afghanistan,” said Ansari, a two-term Congress MLA from Jamtara. Told that he was supporting a front widely viewed as a terrorist organisation and is yet to get global recognition, Ansari said, “Yes, they are a terrorist organisation, but they have been revolutionary in forcing the American occupational forces to leave that country.” The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) immediately hit back at Ansari, saying his remark shows the “Talibani mindset of the Congress.” “He is speaking this language because the Congress party itself has a Talibani mindset. He is supporting a terrorist organisation that is known for cruelty against women and minorities. Several of our mothers and sisters and others are fleeing Afghanistan because of fear. Does Ansari want to see similar things happening here?” said Biranchi Narayan, BJP’s chief whip in the state Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-congress-mla-irfan-ansari-backs-taliban-bjp-hits-back-101630686860281.html
03-09-2021||Other||{Punjab polls 2022/Row over ticket} Maluka indifferent to SAD efforts to pacify him||Bathinda Former Punjab minister Sikander Singh Maluka continues to be in a dissent mode, even as the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leadership is trying to pacify him over the issue of him being announced as the party candidate from Rampura Phul for the assembly elections due in 2022. Maluka, a two-time MLA and once a blue-eyed aide of SAD patriach Parkash Singh Badal, has not issued any statement since Sunday, the day he expressed displeasure over the ticket allocation. Maluka is keen to contest from Maur and wanted his son Gurpreet Singh Maluka, a former chairperson of Bathinda zila parishad, to be given the SAD ticket from Rampura Phul. Since then, Jagmeet Brar has been announced as SAD candidate from Maur. On Wednesday, SAD general secretary Bikram Majithia met Maluka in Chandigarh and on Thursday Brar called on the ex-MLA’s native village in Bathinda.At a press conference at Chandigarh on Thursday, Majithia showed photos of the Maluka father-son duo with him the previous day, claiming that there was no dissent in the party from any quarters. There has been no statement by the SAD indicating that Gurpreet’s name is under consideration for a ticket. Maluka’s last public appearance, however, was in Maur on Sunday where he expressed his anger against the leadership for ignoring his earlier appeal to consider Gurpreet from Rampura Phul. Since then Maluka and his son Gurpreet remained incommunicado. Both are not holding any public meetings for five days and there has been no post on their Facebook pages. Sources said Maluka is trying to meet former chief minister Badal.Political watchers said what may have embarrassed the once all-powerful Akali leader is that in spite of Maluka’s public utterances, the party took no time in announcing the name of Brar, a party-hopper, as its candidate from Maur.Brar was with the Congress for over three decades and was elected MP twice before he was shown the door in April 2016 for “indiscipline and working against the party’s interest in Punjab.” In November 2016, he joined the Trinamool Congress but in less than two years, quit as its Punjab chief.Brar’s entry into the SAD in 2019 was interesting, as before this his entire electoral career had been focused against Akali patriarch Badal and his son and now SAD president Sukhbir Badal. Sources said former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal had pushed for his induction. “Maluka was eyeing two party tickets from Bathinda. The SAD, however, did not want giving the baton of the political management of their traditional electoral bastion to one family. Clipping Maluka’s wings and his open dissent over ticket distribution was unexpected. Brar is a resident of Muktsar and never contested election from any of Bathinda Lok Sabha seats, but the Badal family is banking on him to curtail any parallel political force in the constituency,” said an observer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-polls-2022-row-over-ticket-maluka-indifferent-to-sad-efforts-to-pacify-him-101630686740255.html

The legislator, Gopal Mandal, MLA from Gopalpur in Bhagalpur district, later defended himself, saying he had an “upset stomach” soon after he boarded Tejas Rajdhani Express in Patna Thursday evening and that he was rushing to the lavatory when some passengers created a ruckus.According to news agency ANI, Mandal lodged a complaint at Government Railway Police (GRP) at New Delhi Railway Station on Friday, accusing one Prahlad Paswan of abusing him, misbehaving and snatching his gold chain and rings. The case is now being transferred to Buxar (where the incident took place) for further action, GRP officials said. “The matter was sorted out as the melee led to the RPF (Railway Police Force) being called. They recorded my statement and of the hostile co-passenger,” Mandal told reporters in New Delhi.He, however, insisted that the co-passenger had “overreacted”. “I was suffering from dysentery. No sooner did the train chug off that I felt the need to urgently relieve myself and made a dash to the toilet,” he said.“On the way, I was accosted by this man. I shoved him away and after relieving myself, I confronted him. I admonished him saying he should have looked at my age. I am 60. He spoke of female passengers feeling uncomfortable though no woman or girl was inside the compartment,” the MLA said.The legislator also claimed he suspected that the co-passenger was “drunk”, which has not been confirmed by railway and police sources here. Sale and consumption of liquor is banned in Bihar.Patna resident Munder Shah, who was travelling with his mother in the same coach, said the MLA got into heated arguments with his fellow passengers and some of them pulled the alarm chain while others video-recorded his misbehaviour.Rajesh Kumar, chief public relations officer of East Central Railway, said the matter was sorted out when the train’s escort party and travelling ticket examiners pacified the passengers. “The MLA was later shifted to another coach even as the train was stopped briefly at Dildarnagar because of the ruckus,” said an official.RPF inspector at Dildarnagar, Sanjiv Kumar, said no action was initiated as no one lodged any complaint.Back home, JD(U)’s rivals said the incident brought “a bad name to Bihar”. “I am not aware of the full episode. But I must say it is incidents like these that are responsible for Bihar’s poor reputation. I wish the chief minister, who is now left with just a handful of MLAs, could spend some time tutoring the public representatives on public conduct,” said LJP MP Chirag Paswan.RJD MLA and chief spokesman Bhai Virendra concurred. “The so-called sushasan babu (reffering to CM Nitish Kumar) should take note of such foul behaviour. The state keeps getting a bad name for such reasons”.Last month, JD(U) had sought Mandal’s explanation for his comments against deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad, who he accused of visiting Bhagalpur frequently to extort money from traders.With agency inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-mla-pic-in-undergarments-on-train-goes-viral-jd-u-faces-fire-101630686680192.html

As Rao has to surrender on September 5, he approached the HC seeking an extension of the bail. However, due to paucity of time, the matter could not be heard. In light of this, Rao’s counsel sought reliefs from HC, however, after the NIA assured of no coercive action, HC posted a hearing of the matter to Monday, September 6.When the application of the Telugu poet and activist came up for hearing before the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, senior advocate Anand Grover for Rao informed the bench that the period of bail granted by the bench for six months was coming to an end and he had to surrender to the Taloja jail by September 5.However, due to paucity of time, the bench said it would hear the application on Monday to which Grover sought directions to the NIA and the prison authorities to not take any steps as per law against Rao for not surrendering on the given date.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the NIA gave a statement that no coercive action would be taken against Rao in the event of he not surrendering on September 5 as the court was going to hear the application the next day, which was accepted by the bench.Rao’s wife had approached the HC seeking medical bail for her 84-year-old husband who was kept at Taloja jail with other accused in the Elgar Parishad case. The application had stated that as Rao suffered from various ailments and the jail did not have sufficient facilities, he should be released and permitted to join his family in Telangana as his daughter was a doctor and she would take care of him. The HC had granted him bail on February 22 on furnishing a surety of ₹50000 with strict conditions which included that he had to stay within the jurisdiction of the special NIA court at Mumbai and not interact with anyone among others.

There is an upper air cyclonic circulation in the Saurashtra and Kutch area and another on coastal Andhra Pradesh and Bay of Bengal. Another upper air cyclonic circulation east-central Bay of Bengal is active currently. The revival of monsoon is expected around September 6,” said Kashyapi.He added that on September 6 and September 7, it is likely that ghat areas around the city will receive isolated heavy rain.“Pune city will have cloudy weather and light-moderate rainfall during this time. Along with Pune district, Konkan and Goa will receive isolated heavy rainfall. Moreover, parts of Marathwada, central Maharashtra and Vidarbha may receive light to moderate rainfall along with thunderstorm and lightning activity till September 7,” said Kashyapi.Because of monsoon breaks in August, Pune city reported a deficiency of 62.5 mm rainfall between June 1 to September 3. The actual rainfall received by the city was 388 millimetres against the normal of 450.5 mm as per IMD.Pune district has reported a deficiency of two per cent between June 1 to September 3. This rainfall deficiency has increased because of the frequent breaks by the southwest monsoon.With two consecutive breaks by the southwest monsoon, rainfall across Maharashtra has been normal. So far, Nandurbar, Buldhana, Gidnia and Gadchiroli have received largely deficient rainfall between June 1 to September 2. The rest of the districts in the state have normal or above-normal rainfall.Maharashtra state so far has reported only three per cent excess rainfall which falls under the normal category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/light-to-moderate-rain-likely-in-pune-on-september-6-7-101630684941577.html
03-09-2021||Mumbai||Pune land deal case: ED files charge-sheet against Eknath Khadse’s son-in-law||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday filed a prosecution complaint or charge sheet in the Bhosari (Pune) land deal case against the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Eknath Khadse’s son-in-law Girish Chaudhari. Chaudhari was arrested by ED on July 7 in connection with the case.Lawyer for the Khadse family, advocate Mohan Tekavade, said that he has not yet seen the charge sheet and would offer comments only after perusing it.The case pertains to the purchase of a plot at Bhosari village in Haveli taluka on April 28, 2016, by Khadse’s kin for ₹3.75 crore against the prevalent market rate of ₹31 crore.ED’s case is based on a first information report (FIR) by Maharashtra anti-corruption bureau (ACB) against the Khadses in 2017. ACB later closed the case, but ED continued its probe into the alleged financial irregularities in the land deal.The plot’s ownership was contentious as the industries department acquired it in 1971, but the final award of the land was not made, and the owner had not been compensated for it.According to ED, Khadse and his family, despite having knowledge that the plot was reserved for Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), fraudulently purchased it so as to obtain compensation from MIDC, about thrice its market value. Last month ED had attached properties worth ₹5.73 crore belonging to Khadse and his family including a bungalow, flats and seven land parcels worth ₹4.86 crore in Jalgaon and Lonavala. Bank balance worth ₹86.28 lakh was also frozen. Khadse and his family are accused of defrauding the exchequer of ₹61.25 crore. Khadse’s wife Mandakani and the Bhosari land’s owner Abbas Rasalbhai Ukani were also booked in the case by ED on August 28, 2019. Khadse has claimed ED was set after him because he left the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pune-land-deal-case-ed-files-charge-sheet-against-eknath-khadse-kin-101630684940217.html
03-09-2021||Mumbai||Pune land deal case: Bail plea of Eknath Khadse’s son-in-law rejected||The special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Friday rejected the bail application of Girish Chaudhari, son-in-law of NCP leader Eknath Khadse. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a charge sheet in the matter against Chaudhari in the Pune land deal case.Advocate Mohan Tekavde had argued for Chaudhari that no actual loss was caused to the government exchequer due to the deal and sections 3 and 4 of PMLA did not apply to them and the arrest itself was illegal.ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar and Kavita Patil had opposed the plea, primarily citing that the agency was about to file a charge sheet in the matter.They said the sale deed was executed in the name of Chaudhari and Khadse’s wife Mandakini at a much lower price of ₹ 3.75 crore when the actual market price of the plot was much more - about ₹ 31 crore.They added that the sale deed was entered to get compensation - thrice the market price of the plot - from the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC).The prosecutors pointed out that the money for the alleged deal was routed through five shell companies. Part of the money was received from Benchmark Buildcon Private Limited, a company that had no income and didn’t exist at its registered office. The agency had further found that Benchmark had, in turn, received the money from five other non-existing shell companies - Proficient Merchandise, Abjayoni Trading, Adamina Traders, Chemexgoods Private Limited and Pearl Dealers Private Limited.Chaudhari had claimed to the agency that this money was a loan he had taken from Benchmark Buildcon. However, the agency had later found out the money was layered and routed through shell companies.Venegaonkar had further argued that while Khadse was the revenue minister in 2016, he used his position and government machinery to manipulate the actual market price of land. The deal cost the state exchequer a loss of ₹ 61.25 crores.The ACB had registered an FIR against Eknath Khadse, Mandakini his wife, son-in-law Chaudhari and original landowner Abbas Ukani on the directions of the Bombay High Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pune-land-deal-case-bail-plea-of-eknath-khadse-s-son-in-law-rejected-101630684774683.html
03-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body gives nod to 1,389 Ganesh pandals||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has received over 2,200 applications for setting up Ganesh Pandals in the city, of which it has approved 1,389 applications. This year the permissions are expected to be above the 1,700 applications approved last year. Every year, before the outbreak of Covid-19, the BMC received around 3,000 applications, however the number went gone down since the past two years due to the pandemic.According to the data, until Friday, the BMC has received 2,216 applications for approval of which it has approved 1,386 applications, 228 applications were rejected, and 601 applications are under process. The highest number of applications have been received from Andheri East, Dadar, Parel and other areas around Grant Road.Further, like last year the BMC has capped the height of Ganesh idols to four-feet in case of mandala and two feet for home. No procession will be allowed during visarjan and mandals will be given slots, during which, they will have to arrive at the collection points for immersion.Last year many organisers cancelled the festivities and instead held blood donation camps. BMC is expecting an uptick in the number of pandals to be set up in the city. Following the pandemic last year only 1,764 applications of Ganesh mandals were approved. The Lalbaugcha Raja Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal, which is Mumbai’s most-visited Mandal, had called off last year’s festivities in light of the pandemic. However, this year they have planned online darshan.The BMC is expected to release a detailed circular in this context next week. However, even this year those taking idols at home will be asked to conduct immersion in the artificial ponds of the BMC and mandals will be allowed to do immersion in the sea. But no gathering will be allowed and limited members of mandals will be allowed to come till collection points for sea immersion. The BMC has also mandals to not have more than five people inside pandals and appealed to organise online darshan.A BMC official said, “We will be generating a QR code and sending it to big mandals of the city including Lalbaugcha Raja and other big mandals in the city. Further those, taking idols at home will have to take slots for immersion at artificial ponds. We will appeal to citizens to conduct immersion in their buildings itself like last year. Also, no aarti will be allowed at the location of immersion.”In 2020, 31% dip was recorded in immersion of Ganesh idols in 2020 compared to 2019. This the BMC attributed to many who preferred to conduct immersion at their homes or inside their residential premises. According to the figures provided by the BMC last year, around 1.35 lakh Ganesh idols immersed in 2020 compared to 1.96 lakh idols immersed in 2019. Further, usage of artificial ponds for immersion doubled from 33,000 in 2019 to 70,000 in 2020 owing to restriction of immersion in sea.Meanwhile, Naresh Dahibavkar, president, Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshostsav Samanvay Samiti (BSGSS) said, “This year we have not allowed gathering during immersion and only 10 people from each mandal is allowed to come till collection points. However, the condition is that 10 people should be fully vaccinated but in the younger population not all are fully vaccinated.”Dahibavkar added, “We are expecting that BMC allows usage of loudspeakers while going to the collection points as it is required to make announcements, if there is any gathering. Also, loudspeakers have been allowed in Pune. Further, we are also expecting the BMC to allow fully vaccinated people to come for actual darshan in limited numbers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-gives-nod-to-1-389-ganesh-pandals-101630684460065.html
03-09-2021||Pune||Pune court denies bail to woman accused of using derogatory remark on Ambedkar||PUNE: A court in Pune has denied bail to a woman whose social media account has published posts making defamatory remarks about Babasaheb Ambedkar. Identified as Vandana Santosh Bhosale (38), the woman was booked in a case for causing enmity between two groups and defamation registered at Loni Kalbhor police station. The order was passed by Additional Sessions Judge BP Kshirsagar on September 1, with public prosecutor Premkumar Agarwal and advocate VM Patil as defense lawyer. Vandana was arrested on August 23 and after spending two days in police custody, she was remanded to judicial custody where she remains. A complaint against her was lodged by Shashikant Gaikwad who has identified himself as a journalist in his complaint. While the woman’s lawyer has claimed that it is a fake account in her name, the complainant in the case has stated that the woman had accepted that the posts were made from her account when he went to her house. The investigating officer has also submitted to the court that the posts are made from the woman’s account. “The applicant either used the defamatory words or she propagated the said information maliciously, deliberately to harm his image, reputation and to insult the feelings of not only that particular community but of all persons who respect him for his work,” read one of the concluding remarks in the order. The sections invoked in the case against the woman invite punishment up to 3 years upon conviction. Due to overcrowding in jail and Covid situation, the courts encourage bail to people booked in cases that invite less than 7 years punishment upon conviction. “Her remarks are so hurtful that the court has decided to not grant bail. The court has recorded statements of the people who went to her house to talk to her about the posts. They have all said that she agreed to have posted those words and asked them to do whatever they wanted to do,” said Agarwal. The legal representative of the woman, advocate VM Patil, submitted in the court that the woman had lodged a complaint with the cyber cell about a fake profile being created. “The applicant herself lodged the complaint dated August 12 to the cyber cell informing that her fake account is opened on Facebook to publish such defamatory posts. Thereafter, certain organisation had been to the house of applicant, the members of those organisations abused the applicant, threatened her and therefore, she called the police. The informant is the press reporter, he lodged false FIR. The alleged posts are written by someone else. The applicant herself raised these issues at initial stage on August 13,” reads the submission made by Bhosale’s legal counsel. The woman is in judicial custody till September 6 and the case will be heard next on the last day of her custody. A case under Sections 153(a), 295(a), 500 of Indian Penal Code was registered against the woman at Loni Kalbhor police station. Police sub-inspector Amruta Kate is investigating the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-court-denies-bail-to-woman-accused-of-using-derogatory-remark-on-ambedkar-101630684339468.html

This could be major relief for Punalekar as his aide, Vikram Vinay Bhave, is facing charges for conducting recce, providing a bike and an escape route to the two shooters of Dr Dabholkar. “I’m stating it in open court that charges against you will be under Section 201 (destruction of evidence) of IPC. Charges against you will not be framed under Section 302 (murder) and 120(b) (criminal conspiracy) of IPC,” said Judge Navander. During their arrest in May 2019, Punalekar was accused of advising Kalaskar, who is also accused in Gauri Lankesh murder case, of disposing of the weapon used for killing Dr Dabholkar. Bhave, who works in Punalekar’s office, was accused to helping the two shooters. They were arrested based on an alleged confessional statement made by Sharad Kalaskar to the Karnataka police during his interrogation in Lankesh case. His statement incriminating Punalekar and Bhave was recorded under the Karnataka Control of Organised Crime Act. “There is no evidence suggesting that I had any involvement that falls under Section 201 of IPC. I never spoke with the CFSL expert Nilesh Wagh as claimed by the prosecution. And they have no weapon recovery from the Thane creek even after spending more than 3 years on it,” said Punalekar in his defense. Bhave is convicted under Explosive Substances Act in a bomb blast case, according to the defense and SPP Prakash Suryavanshi. Punalekar had represented him in that case. “He is being targeted due to his conviction. He has written to the government about his ordeal post-conviction in a letter and published a book about the unknown story about the Malegaon blast case,” said advocate Virendra Ichalkaranjikar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/charges-against-punalekar-will-be-framed-for-destruction-of-evidence-not-murder-court-101630684279419.html

Three decades on, she is not only an established artisan but also a meticulous trainer, empowering thousands of women to hone their skills and earn a livelihood from the comfort of their homes. At 42, she is the mother of a teenage daughter and believes that the best way to empower a woman is to provide her with a skill. “In difficult times, the woman of the house faces the brunt. If she is skilled and can earn, she can become the family’s backbone,” she says. She has chosen to share her skill for the uplift of Kashmiri women, most of them downtrodden and without any formal education. “In 22 years, I’ve trained more than 10,000 women in tailoring, fashion designing besides Aari and Sozni embroideries and helped them become self-reliant,” she says proudly. Following her heart A resident of Munawarabad in Srinagar, Hassina opted out of formal schooling after matriculation as her heart lay in learning embroidery from artisans of the handicrafts department. Though she started out when she was in Class 8, the eldest of seven siblings says she decided to take up handicrafts as a profession after Class 10. “My parents were supportive and later my husband also encouraged me to pursue my passion,” she says. Embarking on her journey in 1989, she started a cooperative society along with other members and the government provided them with subsidy of ₹10,000 to buy their own material. “We bought shawls and started doing Aari and Sozni work on them. A government federation bought our products and things took off,” she says. When her work helped her financially and got her recognition, she decided to give back to society. “The skills I learnt should help more women,” she says. She works with the departments of handicrafts, women’s development corporation and urban development agency for providing training and supplying products. She has participated in 25 exhibitions. Bold move that paid off After she started her training centre in 2001, Hassina took the bold decision of training women of a leprosy colony in Srinagar. “People would be reluctant to go there but I wanted to do something for the inmates,” she recalls. Two decades on, when the government decides to start a training programme, the authorities start with the leprosy colony. “I know many families who started educating their children after they earned a livelihood through the Kashmiri art of Aari and Sozni. Now their children have become officers, and some have shown interest in this skill,” she says. Catch them young At present, she works with 300 women on embroidering pherans (outer loose gowns), suits, shawls, cushion covers, bed covers and file folders in jute. “I have helped women to start their own self-help groups that are working independently for livelihood in many parts of the Old City and also in south Kashmir,” she says. She wants the government to start skill development courses in schools. “Kashmir art skills should be introduced in schools and colleges so that students get a vocational edge,” she adds.

Earlier, data suggested that many beneficiaries preferred government centres as vaccines administered were free of cost. However, now the overall contribution by private centres has seen a rise in the city. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said, “Though the visitor count remains more or less same, there is a rise in second dose beneficiaries. First dose beneficiaries are still trying for government centres. With regular supply now, there is no delay in giving jabs.” Speaking about the vaccination drive, Dr Sachin Edke, district immunisation officer, said that 61,160 doses of vaccine are remaining as of Friday afternoon. “There are 18,690 doses of Covaxin and 42,470 of Covishield,” said Dr Edke. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer at zilla parishad (ZP), said free vaccination campaign has been started at 12 select centres across the city for economically weaker sections. “These centres are located in Wanowrie, Wagholi, Janta Vasahat, Chandannagar, Aundh, Kondhwa, Mundhwa, Erandwane, Hadapsar and Sinhgad road. Beneficiaries can avail the benefits by showing their ration card at the centre,” said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/vax-jabs-at-pvt-centres-on-par-with-govt-count-in-pune-101630680139198.html

The direction came after the city unit president on Thursday sought CCTV camera footage of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) standing committee meeting to check its party members’ action as it was alleged that some corporators supported the proposals put forth by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) public representatives. According to the NCP leaders, though the party is taking an official stand to oppose some proposals in PMC, the party’s standing committee members are supporting the BJP plans. “They (public representatives) have to listen to the city unit president as he consults leaders and executive committee members before taking a decision. There is nothing wrong to check CCTV camera footage. It is not to insult anyone, but verify facts.” NCP has four members in the PMC standing committee. The party president had instructed them to oppose appointment of a security agency owned by BJP MLA. However, the members voted in favour of the proposal, and they went against the party’s line for the third time in one month. The members had also voted in favour of selling of PMC flats against the NCP’s stand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/checking-cctv-camera-footage-to-verify-corporators-action-is-not-wrong-101630678579102.html

Against this background, we should follow caution.”Pawar said, “We too want to respect residents’ faith. No government wishes to close religious places, but we cannot act on emotions and agitations. We need to give priority to health and life of citizens.”Regarding the recent statewide agitations by the BJP and the MNS to reopen temples, Pawar said that such public events are organised to gain political mileage with civic elections round the corner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjp-mns-leaders-should-read-centre-s-letter-before-demanding-to-reopen-temples-pawar-101630677319138.html

While buses from Pune have been cancelled on various routes including Bhor, Indapur, Pirachiwadi, Dahitane, Koregaon Bhivar.With buses plying empty, MSRTC is not keen on restarting bus service to small villages within Pune and Satara districts.Few long route buses stop at some villages, but its timing is not suitable, claim villagers.“I have to come daily to Pune from Indapur as I work at a shop on Laxmi road. State transport bus is safer than travelling in a cab. The evening return journey becomes difficult as direct buses are not functioning,” said Sayali Pingale.Vilas Sikchi from Bhor, said, “Walking to the highway to avail bus service is difficult as I commute early in the morning. Also, once schools will start in Pune city, many students will face travelling issues due to the non-availability of direct buses.”Since last one year, the number of buses starting from small villages have been curtailed by MSRTC as it was suffering major losses due to empty rides. With schools and colleges not functioning, MSRTC is not looking forward to starting buses from Pune to various villages in and around the city.“MSRTC is suffering losses and still buses on a number of routes are not running to their full capacity.

03-09-2021||Pune||Stricter restrictions will be back in Pune if crowd seen during Ganeshotsav: Pawar||Pune: Deputy chief minister and Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar warned of imposing more Covid restrictions if safety norms are found flouted during the Ganesh festival. Following the weekly Covid review meeting on Friday, Pawar announced no new restrictions during the Ganeshotsav, but return of impositions if crowds are seen on the first day of the festival. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pune police have already issued guidelines to celebrate the 10-day festival as per the Covid protocol. “In Pune, there is a tradition to visit Ganpati pandals throughout the night. People come to see the decorations, displays and live skits. However, this year the mandals are keeping the celebrations simple because of the Covid situation. People’s representatives and officials are in contact with each other. Failure to manage crowd control on the first day of the festival will see return of stricter norms from second day onwards. I request residents and Ganesh mandals to not let this happen,” said Pawar. On Tuesday, Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner of Pune police, issued rules and regulations for the upcoming 10-day Ganpati festival which begins on September 10. No processions on the first or the last day will be allowed this year. The police have urged temples having big sanctum to not move the idols to mandaps. The height of public idols is limited to four feet, while household idols cannot cross two feet in height, according to the police rules. The puja cannot be attended by more than five people who are required to follow sanitisation, wear mask and observe social distancing. The police have also urged mandals to not put up huge displays or live skits.” “This festival is celebrated with a lot of enthusiasm in Pune and all over the state. I request people to follow Covid safety measures,” said Pawar. More vaccine doses administered in August than July “In July, 1,781,000 vaccine doses were administered in Pune district. Our efforts are to increase the count every month. The figure in August was 1,880,000 vaccine doses,” said Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/stricter-restrictions-will-be-back-in-pune-if-crowd-seen-during-ganeshotsav-pawar-101630675758963.html

The chief medical and health officer (CMHO), Poonam Singh Sisodia , served notice to two doctors, including the surgeon who conducted the surgeries, on August 28.Officials claimed that the women, mostly tribals, were from Mainpat block of the district and were sterilised at Narmadapur community health centre on August 26. As per local media reports, the tubectomy surgeries were reportedly carried out between 7pm and 3am. “We have issued a show-cause notice to two doctors, including a surgeon, and are waiting for their reply. If they are found guilty, action will be taken,” said the CMHO. According to authorities, 30 sterilisation camps were held in Surguja this year, and 821 sterilisation operations have been carried out till now. “ Fortunately, all women are healthy, but because the number of sterilisation operations has crossed the stipulated guidelines, I am ordering an inquiry into the matter,” said Alok Shukla, secretary health department, Chhattisgarh. Under the Central government’s guidelines for National Family Welfare Programme , a doctor can conduct maximum 30 sterlisation operations in a day. “The surgeon told us he was pressurised by the villagers stating that they had travelled long distances and it would be difficult for them to come again. This, however, doesn’t mean that surgeons should flout the government guidelines, and hence we have ordered an inquiry,” Shukla added. Also Read | After Punjab and Chhattisgarh, Congress now fights with itself in KeralaWhen asked why the surgeries were done at night , Shukla said that the surgeon, in his written response, told the department the surgeries were conducted between 12pm and 6.30pm. The surgeon Dr Jibnus Ekta, who conducted surgeries and block medical officer, Dr RS Singh, who was present during surgeries , were unavailable for comment even after repeated phone calls. Ram Kumar Ravi, who was with his wife when she was operated at the camp said, “My wife is healthy and has had no issues after the sterilisation operation till now.” His wife told HT she was operated upon around 10pm.In 2013, at least 14 women died when a doctor operated upon 83 women within six hours at the Sakri health camp in Bilaspur (which would mean that he spent just two minutes per tubectomy). Health activists believe that Chhattisgarh authorities have not learnt from previous tragedies and the same violations happening again. “What has happened in Narmadapur is a clear violation of both government and court orders on quality standards to be maintained during female and male sterilisation. The Supreme Court banned such sterilisation camps in 2016,” said Dr Sulakshana Nandi, national joint convener, Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, adding that the demand for contraceptive services is very high in the community, but its burden falls on women who are then subjected to such procedures under terrible conditions. Nandi said that the Chhattisgarh government must take strict action against the officials and doctors who took the decision to go ahead and against the orders of the District Quality Assurance Committee (DQAC), whose responsibility is to monitor and ensure the guidelines are followed. “There is always a demand for family planning in rural Chhattisgarh but due to Covid-19, in the last one-and-a-half-years, women could not reach health centres for sterilisation and now they want surgeries due to family pressure or other reasons. The government should chalk out a plan for accumulated sterilisation surgeries in rural areas because this will continue for next few months,” said Dr Nandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chhattisgarh-orders-probe-into-mass-sterilisation-camp-in-surguja-district-101630673839479.html
03-09-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: A Wellness Pioneer||Backdrop: The late Nineties. Time: Mid-morning. Scene: A nondescript low-star hotel in Juhu. Action: Under a blazing hot sun, a gaggle of 30 or so young women in leotards are being put through what looks like an intense boot camp, by a male instructor who has a striking resemblance to Freddy Mercury. The routine he commands is rigorous by any standard; they are required to jog in place, break into circuit training, followed by calisthenics then isometrics, then aerobics, then dancercises, and then start all over again. Clad in similar attire, the girls are skinny, uniformly pretty and difficult to distinguish from one another. It is tiring just watching them; and just when I think they will collapse from sheer exhaustion, the instructor announces the day’s last routine — they will have to line up in a single file and run all the way up five floors to the hotel’s terrace through its narrow staircase and all the way down again, with 6 kgs of weight strapped on to their backs! This time I’m sure there will be a mutiny; but no, I watch incredulously as the girls muster up their last vestige of energy and queue up for their arduous hike up and down. “You’ll thank me when you’re wearing the crown,” their instructor calls cheerfully after them. For these are no ordinary girls — each is a potential beauty queen and international pageant title holder, who is being put through rigorous training as a Miss India contestant. And the instructor is none other than Mickey Mehta who, along with a handful of elite nutritionists, cosmetologists, etiquette tutors orthodontists and even arts and culture gurus, has been tasked with polishing these rough diamonds into celebrated gems. ***************************************************** When he was nine years old, long before fitness became a byword and a brand and Talwalkars gymnasiums where sweaty beef cakes would pump iron on torturous machines was the only brush with fitness for many of us growing up in Mumbai, Mehta, who used to see his cousins working out at home, recalls asking his mother for a membership to a gym. It was a few days before his birthday and the most reasonable gym to be found had been the YMCA; but being underage, Mehta had been refused membership. “Disappointed, I came home with a long face and asked my parents to provide me some gym equipment at home,” he says. But again, there was to be disappointment. “Personal equipment cost a couple of thousands, and I realised that my parents’ salary was around a few hundred a month each,” he says. It was then that his mother had suggested that he follow in the footsteps of his sister: “She is doing yoga at home, why don’t you look at her and learn?” And that’s how Mehta’s tryst with fitness — which was to turn him in to a brand, a corporate entity and a household name and which in many ways mirrored the growth of Mumbai itself — began. After completing school, he had joined a cousin’s martial arts academy and his formal orientation in fitness was to accelerate. “Normally one would do three one-hour classes a week, adding up to 12 hours a month, instead I did three-four classes a day, making it an 18-20 hours a week and almost a 80 hours a month,” he says, adding, “Thus, I got my black belt in around 18 months and somehow even found the time to enrol in programmes in various disciplines like health and nutrition with Dr Vijaya Venkat, and programmes in Naturecure, drugless therapies, calisthenics, agility drills and functional training, apart from my continued exploration of yoga and martial arts.” To support this deep dive into holistic health, Mehta served various hotels as a health club manager, and it was on one such stint at a hotel in Oman where the former school swimming champion, who had been named by his father after the Hollywood star Mickey Rooney, found great success with his “Mickey Mehta’s Learn Swimming In 24 Hours” programme, which he later taught along with fitness and nutrition at a Juhu hotel for a few years, gaining much fame. That had led to him being signed on as one of the official instructors of the Miss India pageant, and from there, there was no looking back… ******************************************************************** With the unprecedented success and fame of being trainer to Miss India contestants under his belt, Mehta’s rise to pre-eminence in his field was a foregone conclusion. Soon, his fitness empire straddled TV, radio, print and also digital media. Along the way, he pioneered the rise of the star personal trainer when he was signed on by some of the biggest names in India Inc, Bollywood and the corridors of Mantralaya; and professional engagements with the police, Army, Navy, Air Force, municipal corporation, immigration, customs and speaking invitations at leading educational institutions around the world followed, along with engagements across prestigious hospitals like The Tata Memorial and ambassadorships of campaigns like Fit India. Mehta had now become as rich and famous a name as some of the A-list clients who he trained. And as a crowning achievement, next month along with his friend and celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor, Mehta will launch a book, his third, on a topic that’s on every one’s lips — immunity, making him, he says, another leading Parsi along with global immunity master Adar Poonawalla to address the subject. ******************************************************************* “Mickey Mehta’s uniqueness lies in his unique approach to fitness. While spirituality, work-life balance and health of the mind are buzzwords today, Micky has always approached fitness through the prism of wellness; even when he was training buff, overly muscular men for the Mr India pageant decades ago,” says Jamal Shaikh, editor of Brunch who had once helmed a leading fitness magazine. This is what, Mehta says, his “Get Mickeymized” programme is about. “In the early Eighties, I had a choice to be just a martial arts/ fitness/ swimming / nutrition/ yoga coach… Instead of choosing one, I started propagating the concept of holistic health. It’s what I have been doing with corporates in the past year-and-a-half or two. It’s not about weight loss, it’s about evolution of the mind. Statistics say that today 45% of corporate executives need psychiatric help and 25% of them are already on psychiatric medicine and most of them are taking sleeping aids. Pressure and stress make people buckle in, crumble…,” he says. Last week, when Mehta turned 60, the manner in which he spent his day was a paean to his holistic approach to wellness. “I woke up with gratitude, bowed my head to the ground, surrendered to the will of Mother Nature,” he says. “Then, I lit some lamps at my altar and went to thank my mother and take her blessings.” Mehta spent the rest of the day attending to his clients and replying to thousands of messages that had poured in from friends and fans; and in the evening, he visited an old age home before returning to have dinner with his family. “And then before I went to bed, I once again offered gratitude to Mother Nature for her blessings, and went to sleep energised, to get revitalised, and…” “Mickeymized?” I prompt. “Yes, to get Mickeymized,” says Mehta, smiling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-a-wellness-pioneer-101630673120532.html

Some say schools should open after Diwali, while others say they should be reopened in places where the Covid-19 positivity rate is zero,” the deputy chief minister added.As Ganesh Chaturthi is coming closer, Pawar also said that people must refrain from celebrating in a grand way. Pointing out that all big organisers will observe the festival in a simple manner and there will be no decorations, he said there is no scope of crowding. “We will monitor the situation from day one, and if we find that gatherings are taking place, stricter measures will be taken from the second day,” Pawar added.Also Read| Mass gatherings should be discouraged ahead of upcoming festive season: CentreThe Union health ministry on Thursday advised that mass gatherings across the country should be discouraged, specifically in the upcoming festive season, adding full vaccination should be a prerequisite if it is absolutely critical to have a gathering of some people.

Some of the houses also developed cracks on their walls.“We have sent a revenue team to the village...We are also sending a team of geologists to study the phenomenon,” said Phincha Ram Chauhan, additional district magistrate Pithoragarh. Locals said they panicked when they saw 20 to 50 metre long cracks in the ground. “Some of the houses have become dangerous to live in due to cracks. That’s why, we have shifted 80 villagers to a safer area,” said Abhay Pratap Singh, sub-divisional magistrate, Munsiyari. Also Read | Tipped off about acid attack on Congress rally, says Harish Rawat.”We have never witnessed such a phenomenon in our lives,” said Bhagat Singh Bachami, a local. District geological officer Pradeep Kumar said the cracks have surfaced due to shifting of the land towards the river flowing nearby. “I have seen the photographs and video of the cracks. These are due to gradual sliding of land towards the river flowing near the village,” he said. The villagers are scared as this comes within a week of five people dying in a landslide triggered by a cloud burst. Meanwhile, the national highway between Tanakpur and Pithoragarh opened after 12 days. The closure of this road link resulted in heavy losses to traders of Champawat and Pithoragarh areas as the supply of goods was halted.“The highway could not be opened due to landslides and boulder fall at Swala village near Champawat,” said LD Mathela, executive engineer National Highway Authority of India in Pithoragarh.

03-09-2021||Bangalore||Bangalore Talkies | A local snack that only a few have heard of||There are some snacks that have a pan regional jurisdiction, while there are those that are authentically linked to one particular state.Mention chivda and quite a few north Indians from different states will perk up. Mention chakli and the same will happen to south Indians. But if I say “kodubale, anyone?” all I get is a “Huh?” or a “Kodu-what?” Which is a shame because this snack, much like Congress peanuts, or avarekalu mixture is beloved in Bengaluru and all over Karnataka.Kodu refers to an elongated shape. For example, in Kannada alasande kodu refers to long beans or snake beans that we typically make into sabzi. Bale means bangle and alludes to the shape of these bangle-like round snacks. The recipe is pretty much the same as in many south Indian savoury items. Dry roast rice flour, along with a little chiroti rava and maida. Separately, grind some chutney kadalai or fried gram. To that, add curry leaves, grated coconut and spices-- chili powder, salt to taste, asafoetida. Grind the flour and spice mixture together. Finally, add a big spoon of piping hot oil. This gives the crispiness, so don’t miss this step. Give the whole thing a twirl in the mixie. Then take it out, add water and make it into a roti-type dough. Next comes the shaping of the kodubale. First elongate, then bring the two ends together so it looks like a bangle. Deep fry, naturally. Eat right away or store in a jar and savour over weeks. If they last that long.There are three types of kodubale. The Mysuru style ones are the most common and are available all over Bengaluru. The Malnad style is made with maida instead of rice flour and is smoother instead of grittier. Then there is a version that is hard on the outside and soft instead. This is the mosaru kodubale or the yogurt/curd based variety. In this sour curd is added in addition to water, then deep fried. This comes out like one of those vadas sold in Udupi restaurants all over the country. Except that they taste infinitely better. In fact, how these big urad-dal-ka-vadas took over the country instead of the slimmer mosaru kodubale is a mystery. The thing with the yogurt based version is that it won’t keep. You have to make it and eat it right away.Also Read | The city’s favourite monsoon snack— nippattuIf you want a compromise between crispy and soft, I recommend the maddur vada as the opening batsman followed by a mosaru kodbale, both served with a dollop of white coconut chutney. What is a maddur vada, you ask? The man, let us call him Basavanna, is on his way back to his “native,” as we say here in Bengaluru. Call your accountant during these Covid times and he might say, “Connection poor, madam. I am in my native in Shivamogga.” The virus has troubled us long enough but one side benefit is the number of people who have decided to go back home.There is only thing that Basavanna needs to carry back, one thing that his relatives wanted and that is a stack of maddur vadas. To do that, he has to get to Maddur, a town in between Bengaluru and Mysuru on the banks of the river Shimsha, a tributary of the Cauvery. This town in the rich, fertile Mandya district of Karnataka has become the ‘tender coconut capital’ of the world, sending its coconuts far and wide up the Konkan coast. People come here for its temples, its sugarcanes and of course, to eat its maddur vadas. In what is typical of the Tamil-Kannada debate, the name of the town too is open to interpretation. Some say that an inscription in Ugra Narasimha temple calls this town Marudhur. Others say that Madduru means gun powder and refers to the town’s military past. What it is known for today however are its snacks.Although you can buy these vadas all along Maddur town, the place to go if you want a bit of history is Maddur Tiffanys on the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway 275. This family establishment is part of the lore of the snack. One of the owners is a descendent of Ramachandra Budhya who ran VTR or Vegetarian Tiffin Room inside Maddur railway station. Upon learning that a train was arriving early, Budhya hastily converted the mix for his pakoras into a flattened version that would cook faster and sold it as maddur vada. This accidental invention with its happy mix of onions, spices, sooji and maida turned 100 in 2017. It is the reason Basavanna’s relatives have asked him to bring home four dozen vadas, because you see, they keep for a few days without putting them in the fridge.In Bengaluru, I go to Woodys on Commercial Street for my maddur vada fix. And when I go up north, the snack I carry for discerning foodie friends is also the maddur vada, along with, you know it, the kodubale.Shoba Narayan is Bangalore-based award-winning author.

03-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai University members approach Governor against latest perspective plan||Teacher representatives part of the senate, academic and management councils of the University of Mumbai have approached the chancellor of all state universities, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari to share their dissent on the recent events at the varsity. This comes days after teacher unions addressed the issue of 74 new college site approvals for 2022-23 as part of the University’s perspective plan to the Mumbai University (MU) vice-chancellor and received no positive response on the same.Recently, the MU announced the approval of 74 new college sites for the next academic year and immediately invited flak from several stakeholders. While many questioned the need for new colleges for an already overburdened varsity, which currently boasts of over 840 affiliated colleges, others highlighted how the approvals were given by flouting several university statutes and demanded that the university refer back the perspective plan.The perspective plan is an annual exercise to chart out MU’s future growth. It provides details about prospective colleges for different regions under the university’s jurisdiction. The plan needs the state government’s nod before it is finalised.“MU statutes mention that a special committee should survey the location and understand from stakeholders the need for colleges before approving a new institute in the perspective plan. However, no such physical survey was conducted. Approving colleges in a city that already is overflowing with institutes, especially for traditional arts, science and commerce shows zero research by MU,” said Tapati Mukhopadhyay, president, Maharashtra Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organisation (MFUCTO).In the letter addressed to Governor Koshiyari, members have also highlighted how approval of 74 new colleges is a 12.2% increase in existing non-technology faculty whereas the university law only allows a 5% increase. “What’s more is that several members of the senate rejected the proposed perspective plan when it was tabled in the senate, despite which the university approved the same,” said members in their letter.The governor, in his role as the chancellor of state universities, can advise the university to review and revise the perspective plan. Members of the senate, however, said no positive action has been taken by the state Governor previously when a similar dissent letter was sent by members in 2018 against the 2018-19 perspective plan.The university controls over 840 affiliated colleges across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (NMR), including Thane and Palghar as well as Raigad, Sindhudurg, Daman and Goa. The large area and number of colleges, coupled with an acute shortage of staff, often create administrative problems for the varsity, affecting the overall quality of education.According to the new perspective plan, the MU has recommended starting 46 new arts, science and commerce colleges, 15 law colleges, eight night colleges and three women’s colleges. While 12 locations have been identified in suburban Mumbai, five are in the city. Once the locations are finalised, applications will be invited from parties interested in setting up the college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-university-members-approach-governor-against-latest-perspective-plan-101630667781054.html

According to the Vishnu Nagar police, the accused, identified as Sunil Bhandari (35), was involved in a deadly assault on Dombivali resident Hemant Bhoir (43), his brother Milind (42) and their friend Pramod Patil (39) in March 2019. The trio was on their way home after attending a pre-wedding ceremony of ‘haldi’ when Bhandari and eight others accosted them.“The victims and the accused had a long-standing dispute over a land deal gone sour. Both the parties were present in the ‘haldi’ ceremony where one of them had bumped into the other while dancing, which also led to a fresh quarrel. Subsequently, the accused lay in wait for the victims and attacked them with swords, sticks and a country-made pistol,” police inspector Rahul Khilare, Vishnu Nagar police station, Dombivli, Maharashtra, said.The assault was so serious in nature that Milind lost both his hands from the elbows downwards after the accused allegedly chopped them off with swords. He spent several days in a serious condition in the hospital but ultimately survived. Meanwhile, the Vishnu Nagar police registered a complaint of attempt-to-murder against the accused and arrested seven of them, while two remained at large.“Since the case was registered, we made repeated inquiries with Bhandari’s family, friends and associates. We also tried tracking his cell phone location but he had switched off his phone as soon as the crime was committed and there was no sign of him,” Khilare said.Over the next two and a half years, the investigating team, through repeated visits to the Devicha Pada area in Dombivli where Bhandari stayed, cultivated several informants based around his house. All of these were given a single task - to inform the police as soon as Bhandari was seen.The police’s efforts finally paid off in the last week of August when Bhandari came to meet his wife, aged parents and young son. He would later tell the police in his interrogation that he was unable to stay away from them any longer. Unknown to him, this was exactly what the police were banking on.As soon as they received the tip-off about Bhandari being seen in his area, the police sent a team to his residence and picked him up on August 24. After inquiries confirmed his involvement in the case, he was placed under arrest and was charged for an attempt to murder under the Indian Penal Code, officers said.“A chargesheet has already been filed against the seven accused arrested earlier and we will file one against Bhandari soon. Efforts are underway to trace and apprehend the last remaining accused in the case,” Khilare said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-accused-of-attempted-murder-gets-nabbed-on-his-visit-to-family-101630665199931.html

03-09-2021||Kolkata||End stir by 3 pm: Calcutta high court to Visva Bharati students||Students of Bengal’s Visva Bharati university must end their agitation outside the residence of the vice-chancellor by 3pm, the Calcutta high court ordered on Friday after hearing a petition the university authorities filed on Wednesday, seeking the court’s intervention to clear the impasse. The agitators had been protesting since August 28 when three students were expelled on disciplinary grounds. The state’s only central university -- which was set up by Rabindranath Tagore at Bolpur in Birbhum district in 1921 -- said in its petition that security on the campus was breached by the agitators and vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty was confined to his quarters. In his order, justice Rajasekhar Mantha said the students must end the agitation by 3pm on Friday and move away. The V-C’s movement cannot be stopped and the district police authorities must provide three constables for his security, said the court. Also Read | Retired Calcutta high court CJ to head SIT probe Bengal post-poll violenceThe order also said that public address systems cannot be used on the campus and students may hold a peaceful agitation 50 metres away from the administrative building. The court asked the Visva Bharati registrar to file a report on September 8 when the students will also be heard. Justice Mantha observed that a student agitation cannot resemble a trade union movement, said advocate Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee who represented the university. “Justice Mantha also observed that the atmosphere on any campus must always be peaceful,” said Chatterjee. Lawyers representing the students told the court that the gate to the V-C’s residence was not locked by the students as alleged. The lawyers also said the students did not breach any security or pose any danger to the V-C. “We will decide our next step after studying the order,” said Rupa Chakraborty, one of the agitators, who were left with around three hours to abide by the order. Visva Bharati, of which the Prime Minister is the chancellor, did not make any statement till 1pm. Members of the Students Federation of India (SFI), the students’ wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), spearheaded the agitation. They regularly sent food items and vegetables for the V-C and his family but they refused to accept them. After Chakraborty lodged a police complaint on August 30, four constables and a sub-inspector were deployed outside his home. Aishe Ghosh, former student union president at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University led the agitation on Tuesday. The three students, who were suspended in January last year, took part in agitations against several actions taken by Chakrabarty and visits by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders such as Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta in 2020 and Union home minister Amit Shah before the March-April assembly polls. The SFI alleged that the V-C was acting on behalf of the Rashtriya Shayamsevak Sangh (RSS). In January last year, there was a student unrest when Dasgupta was invited by the authorities to speak on the Citizenship Amendment Act at a seminar. A month after this incident, Chakrabarty triggered a controversy when he said those who gather at Delhi’s Rajghat donning white caps on Gandhi Jayanti are “the country’s biggest thieves”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/end-stir-by-3-pm-calcutta-high-court-to-visva-bharati-students-101630662139260.html

They are now planning to develop infrastructure for table tennis and volleyball along with an open gym under the flyover that connects Sanpada, sector 16 with sector 8. Sanjay Desai, city engineer of NMMC said, “The space under most of the flyovers in Navi Mumbai is lying unused and taking advantage of the situation some people have encroached on them for parking vehicles, running small shops among others. Some homeless people are also staying under a few flyovers and neither. We, nor the police department, have any idea about their background. So to beautify the place, we have decided to develop sports infrastructure and open gyms under the flyovers.”In the first phase, the NMMC has chosen two flyovers at Nerul and Sanpada. The work at Nerul flyover was completed earlier this week. “We are now waiting for the approval of the civic body for the work at Sanpada, we have set aside a budget of ₹60 lakh for it,” he said.Another senior officer from the engineering department said that they are now conducting a survey to finalise few more flyovers in the city. “In this survey, we will prioritize only those bridges which are in proper residential areas. Those on the highways will not be selected as that may not be safe for the users,” he said. Rajat Bose, 39, a resident of Nerul said, “During monsoon, we normally cannot go for a walk in the parks and gardens and hence cannot work out at all. Now, with these gyms and jogging tracks in place, we can go and work out under the flyovers even when it rains heavily. The NMMC should take such measures in other areas too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/in-a-first-navi-mumbai-civic-body-to-develop-sports-infrastructure-under-city-flyovers-101630658063112.html

The six youngsters, including one from Deoria in Uttar Pradesh, were duped by the accused identified as Sunil Kumar to the tune of ₹2.25 lakh, officials said. Kumar, who stays in Old Grand Bungalow (OGB), 13 in Danapur Cantonment area, gave them false assurances of recruitment in military engineering services (MES) and the Indian Army. People privy to the development in the MI disclosed that a sports quota/dependent recruitment rally is being scheduled at the premises of Bihar regimental centre with effect from September 5. Acting on a tip-off, the MI unit, Lucknow, intervened and searched the area. Upon receiving information about a dozen suspicious men staying in OGB, personnel of the Military Intelligence unit of Lucknow rushed to the spot and detained six youths identified as — Sanoj Kumar, Amrendra Kumar Yadav, Abhishek Kumar Mandal (all three from Munger), Manish Kumar (Araria), Rahish Kumar Yadav (Lakhisarai) and Manu Prasad (Uttar Pradesh). All six were interrogated. They were found hiding in OGB number 13 in front of Tweed Gate of BRC. Sunil Kumar and some other accused managed to escape from the spot. The six job aspirants told MI officials that they were desperate to get a job in the Indian Army. Five of them reached Danapur in the third week of August. Talking to HT, Manish, a 12th pass student, revealed that he was selected twice in the PET test but was declared unfit in the medical exam. This time, he would get the last chance. “Sunil sir promised that he is the only person who managed army officials for recruitments in any post. He sent a video that three people, including a woman, who were wearing army combat uniform and performed medical fitness test,” said Manish. An amount of ₹3 lakh each was demanded from the five youngsters for a ‘group D’ post at the MES in Danapur cantonment. Undergraduate’s job aspirants paid ₹30,000 each as an advance to Sunil Kumar through cash. Kumar asked them to stay in Danapur for a few days while their joining letters were sent to respective postal addresses. The MI also seized several incriminating documents like reporting forms, medical fitness certificates, appointment letters and family declaration certificates. According to the MI official, Kumar had contacted the job aspirants through WhatsApp. “The final amount of ₹7 lakh was to be given after their enrolment was done,” said an MI official on condition of anonymity. All candidates were provisioned for food by one Raju Kumar said to be a social worker affiliated with ‘Vaidik Samajik Sikhsa Uthhan Sangthan’. The MI unit is also on the lookout for such touts to stop fraudulent selections in the Indian Army. During the scanning of cell phones, the officials found that Sunil Kumar and his team members lured job aspirants from Haryana, Pathankot, Rajasthan, Aligarh and West Bengal. Hindustan Times also learned that a group of five people were seen in the video posing as a doctor, an army official, a woman and a man in army combat uniform, and another one posing as an army official.

Speaking to ANI, Delhi Legislative Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel said that the tunnel connects the legislative assembly to Red Fort and was used by the Britishers to avoid reprisal while moving freedom fighters."When I became an MLA in 1993, there was hearsay about a tunnel present here that goes till Red Fort and I tried to search for its history. But there was no clarity over it," he stated."Now we have got the mouth of the tunnel but we are not digging it further as all the paths of the tunnel have been destroyed due to metro projects and sewer installations," he added.Goel further informed that the Delhi Legislative Assembly, which was used as Central Legislative Assembly after shifting of capital from Kolkata to Delhi in 1912, was turned into a court in 1926 and Britishers used this tunnel to bring freedom fighters to the court."We all knew about the presence of a gallows room here but never opened it. Now it was the 75th year of independence and I decided to inspect that room. We intend to change that room into a shrine of freedom fighters as a tribute to them," he said.The assembly speaker added that in view of the history of the Delhi Legislative Assembly associated with the independence of the country, he intends to open the gallows room for the tourists by the next independence day and the work for the same has already started."This place has a very rich history in the context of the freedom struggle. We intend to renovate it in a way that tourists and visitors can get a reflection of our history," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/secret-british-era-tunnel-found-in-delhi-legislative-assembly-connects-to-red-fort-101630646451796.html

03-09-2021||Jaipur||Meet Rajasthan’s unique camel cart-bound mobile library for village kids||Kids in rural Jodhpur are joyous at seeing the library coming to them on a camel cart. At a time when the schools are closed for primary sections, the library with a storyteller has become an attraction for villages located in the remote desert areas of Rajasthan.A unique initiative of the mobile library on camel cart has been started for children in remote villages and hamlets of the state. Decorated with balloons and loaded with over 1500 books, the cart is probably the first such initiative.Joint director, school education, Prem Chand Sakhla said the department, along with NGO Room to Read, has started this initiative under the International Reading Campaign 2021. “The School for primary sections is closed, though online classes are running but to ensure their connection with reading, the program has been started. The reading habit of children should not discontinue,” he said.Sankhla said a camel cart was used as a library as other vehicles cannot reach remote desert areas.Program officer and additional district project coordinator, Samagra Shiksha, Jodhpur, Laxman Gehlot, said this mobile library will cover 30 villages in rural areas of Jodhpur. The theme of ‘Nahi Rukhenge Nanhe Kadam; Ghar Par Bhi Sikhenge Hai Hum; and ‘India Gets Reading at Home’, has been kept under the Room to Read campaign.He said a cart is accompanied by a rider, two members of the NGO, and a teacher of the nearby school. The children are given books according to their age and interest. The effort is not just to make the children read but to make learning interesting for them – the stories are narrated to them by the teacher, the NGO member, and even by the local educated villagers. “If the children are interested, then even the books are issued to them,” said Gehlot.He said it has been over one and half years, the children need to be brought into the mainstream and the initiative is a step to maintain the connect. “The parents are also asked to involve with children and conduct some activities of reading and writing for at least 15 to 20 minutes every day,” said Gehlot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthans-unique-mobile-library-and-storyteller-on-camel-cart-for-village-kids-101630641077702.html

The slope that descends from the bank to the pond’s bed or belly on all sides is called the alluvium of the pond. The alluvium of the pond is the place in which its water level remains highest during the rainy season and lowest in the peak of summer. This alluvium is the habitat and breeding ground of hundreds of aquatic organisms including fish, snail, crab and tortoise”, said the memorandum. “The concrete works executed around the pond and a Bhoj-Patra tree, which is rarely found in plains will do irreparable damage to them,” Choudhary told HT over the phone on Thursday.Despite repeated attempts, LNMU officials, including registrar Mustaque Ahmad, were unavailable for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/talab-bachao-abhiyan-in-bihar-expresses-concern-over-beautification-of-pond-on-lnmu-campus-101630640419527.html

03-09-2021||Mumbai||As Maharashtra mulls reopening schools, here's what task force on children says||As Maharashtra is poised to take a decision in the next few days on reopening schools in the state, the Covid-19 task force on children has stressed vaccinating teachers and non-teaching staff must be prioritised among other things. Bachchu Kadu, Maharashtra minister of state for school education, said on Thursday the decision on reopening schools would be taken in the next two days. Kadu said a meeting in this regard will be held in the next few days. "Schools have started in other states of the country and should be started in the state as well. But the decision will have to be taken carefully considering the fact that Maharashtra has the highest number of active cases after Kerala,” Kadu said.Physical classes in schools were shut in Maharashtra in March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the state. Schools in rural areas were allowed to resume physical classes for Class 8 to 12 students on July 12 but only in areas where Covid-19 cases are minimal.Also read | As festival approaches, Covid test positivity rate inches up in MaharashtraThe pediatric task force has discussed the plan with the state school education department officials to reopen schools in the state and wants to ensure schools are fully prepared and physical classes will not lead to a spike in Covid-19 cases.“We also want the schools to be reopened but with certain precautions as we are concerned about their health. Children are definitely suffering from mental health issues and nutrition and thus schools should be reopened but in a safe environment," Dr Bakul Parekh, a member of the pediatric task force, said.The paediatrician task force was formed by the Maharashtra government in May to prevent children from contracting Covid-19 amid fears of a possible third wave of the pandemic.The task force has recommended that teaching and non-teaching staff of schools should be vaccinated and there must be proper seating arrangements in classes and one bench should be reserved for one student only. "If possible, schools with online teaching infrastructure can simultaneously hold physical as well as online classes. Students can attend (in-person) classes by rotation,” Parekh said.Classes must be sanitised and there must be a monitoring system in place in all schools. The school staff should also be trained to deal in case of a medical emergency, Parekh added.Schools should divide students into two batches and they should be called for physical classes on alternate days, he said. "For example, half of the students can be called today and the rest tomorrow and at the same time online classes can also be continued,” he said.Also read | Maharashtra may bring curbs back to avert third Covid waveSports activities, which require close contact, should be avoided. Schools can also be started in a staggered manner by allowing some classes now and increasing them later based on the situation and if in case any rise is observed they can be stopped immediately. Parekh said vehicles ferrying school children should not have closed windows and they should have sufficient ventilation.“The task force has suggested the school administration to hold parent-teacher meetings before re-opening schools. At these meetings, parents should be apprised about precautions schools will be taking for the safety of students," Parekh said.Also read | Karnataka, Maharashtra tighten rules at airports over new Covid-19 variants Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that the state government planned to fully vaccinate all teaching and non-teaching staff before the reopening of schools. The state health minister Rajesh Tope also said on August 29 that they are working on vaccinating all teaching and non-teaching staff by September 5.Based on predictions by experts, the state government is expecting a rise in Covid-19 cases between September 15 and the first week of October, which could also be the beginning of the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The steady rate of daily cases of Covid-19 has become a cause of concern for officials. Maharashtra still has more than 50,000 active cases and they are hovering around between 50,000 and 51,000 for the past week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/as-maharashtra-mulls-reopening-schools-here-s-what-task-force-on-children-says-101630630817873.html

We want the contribution of all the citizens of Delhi in making the parks of this city beautiful. Let us all contribute together in making Delhi a vibrant city. The Delhi government is committed to make this a prosperous city. Beautifying all the parks will prove to be a big step in this direction. The atmosphere of these parks will become better and citizens will be able to enjoy getting out,” said Sisodia after the meeting.“Under this campaign, I will myself visit all the parks of Delhi and take stock of the situation. Along with this, suggestions will also be taken from the residents living around these green spaces on how they want the beautification to be carried out,” he said.After reviewing the suggestions, the entrances of the parks will be made attractive, there will be open gyms, tracks will be improved for people to walk, and new different species of flowers, fruits and shady plants will be put, the government said.The Capital has about 18,000 parks, and 250 resident welfare groups maintain nearly 1,300 parks at present, and the rest are managed by civic agencies and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-kick-off-campaign-to-spruce-up-parks-gardens-in-city-101630627585607.html
03-09-2021||Noida||Greater Noida murder suspect nearly pulls off perfect getaway||Sensational details emerged of a Greater Noida family’s murder on Thursday, a day after police arrested a 38-year-old man who almost pulled off a perfect getaway.The man murdered his wife and two children three years ago as he wanted to settle down with a woman he was in an extramarital relationship with, zeroed in on another man who somewhat resembled him in appearance as well as build, murdered him and passed it off as his own death, police said after the arrest of five of his accomplices.Those arrested were identified as Rakesh, 38, his father Banwari Lal, 65, mother Indirawati, 62, two brothers Rajiv, 36, and Pravesh, 34, and a woman constable, Rubi, 30, who was in a relationship with the main accused Rakesh, police said.Rakesh, from UP’s Aligarh, lived with his family in Chipyana Buzurg in Greater Noida. Botre Rohan Pramod, superintendent of police, Kasganj, said Rakesh worked as a medical lab technician from 2011 to 2018 and he was aware of certain aspects of forensic investigations.“Rakesh married Ratnesh in 2012 and they had two children – a three-year-old daughter and an 18-month-old son. However, he was also in a relationship with Rubi, and he wanted to marry her. On February 14, 2018, he killed his wife and children with an iron rod and buried their bodies in their house’s basement and destroyed evidence,” he said.The suspect fled the spot after the crime. While Ratnesh’s family filed a complaint of abduction against her husband, Rakesh’s family members filed a counter-complaint of abduction against his in-laws at Bisrakh.To pass himself off as dead, Rakesh planned another murder. Pramod said Rakesh identified a vulnerable friend, Rajendra alias Kalua, who was similar to him in appearance and build, and took him on a motorcycle from Aligarh to Kasganj on April 26, 2018.“On the way, Rakesh offered drinks to Kalua and then killed him with a sharp weapon. He decapitated the victim’s head and hands to ensure the investigators would find no concrete evidence or fingerprints and threw the body near a railway track. The suspect wrapped the victim in his clothes and planted his ID in his pocket,” the SP said.Rakesh’s family members, who were aware of the conspiracy, allegedly reached the spot and claimed the victim was Rakesh. They also filed a case of murder against Rakesh’s in-laws. But police probed the matter and evidence and DNA reports revealed the deceased was Rajendra and not Rakesh.On the other hand, Rakesh made a fake Aadhaar card with an assumed identity as Dilip Sharma, a resident of Kushinagar. He shifted base to Panipat, Haryana, where he worked as a mason. “He underwent nose surgery in order to change his identity,” SP said. On Wednesday, Rakesh came to meet Rubi in Kasganj when he was arrested.Ankur Agarwal, additional deputy commissioner, Noida Central, said police excavated the burial spot and found some parts of skeletons. “The samples are being sent for forensic examination and DNA testing. A case of murder will be filed in Noida, too, once the report corroborates the murder theory,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-murder-suspect-nearly-pulls-off-perfect-getaway-101630623983604.html

This land is colloquially known as the Dangal Maidan... It is a prime land behind Delite cinema... The BJP-ruled MCD is now preparing to sell this location as well at a throwaway price,” he said.Delhi BJP said the North MCD has no such plan. “A few properties are being leased for long-term at almost double the prevailing circle rates through tender...,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/north-mcd-trying-to-sell-dangal-maidan-aap-101630619514406.html
03-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt invites applications to set up oxygen plants in city||The Delhi government has invited applications from industries for setting up plants to augment the national capital’s oxygen generation and storage capacity by up to 1,900 metric tonnes (MT) by March next year, a notice issued by the state industries department said on Thursday. It also released a fresh set of guidelines for companies to avail of the new incentives and reimbursements being offered to boost oxygen production and storage.According to the order, the Delhi government is aiming to set up liquid oxygen generation plants with a targeted capacity of 100MT and a minimum load of 50MT at the latest by December 31, 2022. The same capacity has been set for installing non-captive pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants and air separation units (ASU), the deadline for which is March 31, 2022.Currently, 31 PSA plants are fully functional in Delhi, and 57 more are expected to be operational next month. These include 26 plants allotted to Delhi under PM-CARES fund, of which 17 have been commissioned so far, government data showed. Together, they are capable of producing and storing about 64MT of oxygen.The subsidy being offered by the Delhi government will be ₹20 lakh per MT and an additional electricity subsidy of ₹4 per unit for five years, the government guidelines stated.In addition, the stamp duty paid for the purchase of land for medical oxygen generation plants or non-captive oxygen generation plants will also be reimbursed. “We hope that the policy will encourage firms to set up new manufacturing units and expand the production capacity of existing ones for uninterrupted oxygen supply to hospitals and nursing homes and facilitate storage and transportation of medical oxygen in Delhi. There is a ₹3 lakh subsidy per MT capacity for cryogenic tankers; and a one-time subsidy of ₹1 lakh per MT for liquid medical oxygen storage for hospitals, nursing homes and refillers,” said a senior official involved with the project.The guidelines also state that if the deadlines are not met, or in case of any violation of terms, the incentives will be recovered from the beneficiary, with an annual interest of 18%.Thursday’s order comes after the Delhi government on August 26 notified the “Medical Oxygen Production Promotion Policy 2021”, which seeks to make the Capital self-reliant in the production of medical oxygen.The policy was approved by the Delhi cabinet on August 3.The government has set up a seven-member committee to screen all applications and recommend the approved incentives to the secretary, industries department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-invites-applications-to-set-up-oxygen-plants-in-city-101630618214216.html
03-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Monument to the bald||Standing atop a grassy mound, it has the remoteness of a tower. But it doesn’t look like a tower. It doesn’t even have a dome to which it could owe its name, Munda — the bald.This 13th century stone pavilion in south Delhi’s Deer Park overlooks the Hauz Khas lake on one side and the park’s grassy greens on the others. In the early hours, elderly morning walkers from nearby Safdarjung Enclave sit by its weather-beaten walls to catch their breath. Some daring young men climb to its roof—there’s a staircase—in a show of swagger, and loudly stamp their feet on the stones. The edifice is guarded by tall and beautiful trees on its four corners, much like the four marble minars of the Taj Mahal in Agra.This morning, the grass on the ruin’s low hill is drenched wet with the night’s rain. The darkened old stones have gone mossy in various places. Inside, the chamber is dark and dingy, and at least today the place is smelling of clothes when they have stayed humid for too many days. The chamber is filled with stacks of slim wooden twigs — they seem to have been used to block the stairways to the roof, but have been displaced. The daylight is streaming in through four arched doorways. Big makoras (ants) are marching along the floor as if in a military march. The walls are scrawled with declarations of love, and even post-love hatred. Shruti weds Mukul, says one of these scribblings.It’s a relief to emerge into the open air from this dim and musty chamber, and see the world afresh in daylight. Down the slope, the pedestrian track is busy with walkers and their pedigreed dogs (to whom they loudly command in accented English), and beyond it is the still water of the lake, with little ducks peddling along it. The sky is punctuated with birds. Underneath one of the four trees is a bench. It could be an idyllic place to read poetry; right now two girls have taken over the place, listening to Guru Randhawa’s High Rated Gabru on mobile.A tattered board informs that the MundaGumbad was built during the Khilji period, and was probably a double storey pavilion. It assumes that the missing second floor used to be topped by a dome.Meanwhile, a bunch of pigeons arewheeling about the gumbad repeatedly, as ifthey were waiting for the missing dome to reappear so that they can finally rest on that perching spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-monument-to-the-bald-101630617576223.html

Other than that, C-section is performed at Kalka sub-divisional hospital, community health centre in Raipur Rani and now at Sector 26.As far as normal deliveries are concerned, three urban health centres and nine rural health centres cater to the service. “C-section is completely free of cost for Haryana residents and minimally charged for people from other states. Deliveries are conducted free for all,” said spokesperson Dr Mankirat.“This is our initiative to improve health services at the polyclinic in Sector 26. This will help the pregnant women living in the areas located on the other side of the Ghaggar and Raipur Rani. Earlier, they all had to go to the Sector-6 GH and wait in long queues,” said chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Mukta Kumar.She said that though separate staff had not been sanctioned for the clinic, she will try her best to get additional staff. “We have started other services like orthopaedics, ophthalmology, dermatology and paediatrics, gynaecology OPDs. Today, the first C-section was performed here. Both baby and mother are safe and sound,” the doctor said.The CMO added that earlier, the daily footfall at OPDs was around 150 per day, whereas the count had now increased to 450 per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-polyclinic-now-offers-c-section-delivery-services-101630617435270.html

The purchase, proposed setting up and inauguration of the zoo has not been done as per the laid down procedures. Hence, it is requested that they discontinue the process till such time, all necessary approvals are granted by the competent authority and also refrain from formal opening of the impugned zoo.”The move came after a city-based activist, RK Garg, highlighted the issue that the aviary would be like a cage for the birds. Animal rights activist and politician Maneka Gandhi had also raised her voice against the project. Besides, several high courts including the Punjab and Haryana high court had forbidden the caging of birds.Meanwhile on Thursday, Garg said, “The project has been stopped in view of the serious irregularities in the making of the bird aviaries. Also, irregularities can be seen in audit objections on the working of the forest department. Hence, we demand that all the contracts awarded by the forest department in the last four years be made public, so that all irregular practices are exposed fully.”Even though activists and environmentalists had raised concerns over the making of the aviary, the UT forest department had maintained that they had taken all approvals and had not violated any guidelines or laws.The exotic birds kept in the two walk-through aviaries will be those commonly bred in India, the UT forest department had said.The department had also said that the enclosure would be 58 feet high and spread over 3-4 acres, so it would have ample space for the birds, adding that the forest guards would ensure that the birds were treated well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/discontinue-work-on-sukhna-walk-in-aviary-aig-forests-to-chandigarh-forest-dept-101630616235129.html

Registered graduates is the largest constituency with 3.6 lakh voters and 15 members are elected from it in seven states. On the last hearing on August 12, the court had observed that it had full faith in the vice-chancellor and appreciated his efforts for holding the elections. The matter will now be taken up on September 13 with PU seeking time to examine the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nod-from-delhi-uttarakhand-awaited-for-graduate-constituency-polls-panjab-university-to-hc-101630615755965.html

03-09-2021||Chandigarh||Untreated wastewater from Mohali IT City entering N-Choe||Even though the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (Gmada) had developed IT City (adjoining Airport Road) seven years ago, despite directions of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, it has not constructed two sewage treatment plants (STPs) each with 10 MLD capacity. As a result, the untreated sewage is being discharged into N-Choe passing through the IT City. In 2019, the development authority had built a portable STP of 500 KLD, which is lying defunct since then. Residents allege that with untreated sewage being discharged in N-Choe, harmful waterborne pathogens and bacteria pose a high risk to human and animal health. N-Choe is a seasonal stream that originates in the north of Chandigarh and runs across the city before meeting the Jagatpura drain at Manauli village in Mohali. The water finally drains into Ghaggar river. The IT City is spread over 1,722 acres across sectors 66B, 82A, 83A and 101A adjoining the Airport Road and has major IT companies, industrial units, residential areas, one private school, and commercial units. Also, two major private universities have set up their campus there. The first housing scheme in IT City was launched in February 2014 with 325 residential plots, the second scheme in July 2016 with 750 plots, and the last scheme in April 2018. Ranjiv Mankatala, executive engineer of Gmada who is dealing with the STPs, admitted that portable treatment plant was not functional. “But we will make it operational in a few days as enough sewage is not being generated,” he added. Regarding the construction of the two STPs of 10 MLD each, he said the work would start soon. It is pertinent to mention that in February 2019, while giving the revised environment clearance, the ministry had clearly directed the Gmada to construct two STPs of 10 MLD each, but even after two years, nothing has been done. Ikesh Pal Singh, general secretary of RWA, IT City ( Block C), said, “Gmada has laid down incomplete infrastructure in the IT City. They were supposed to treat the waste water generated in the residential area and channel it back to the houses for irrigation and construction purposes. For this, dual plumbing has also been laid out in the area, but it is incomplete. There are more than 30 houses that have completed the construction and people are living there. Sewage is being generated and disposed of unscientifically in the choe.”Last month, the development authority had held a draw of lots for showrooms and booths for the land acquired in the IT City housing scheme at Aerocity in December 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/untreated-wastewater-from-mohali-it-city-entering-nchoe-101630615215219.html
03-09-2021||Chandigarh||Defunct loo facility forces 150 families in Ambala to defecate in open||The only community toilet catering to at least 150 families living in a slum near Amba market of Ambala City is defunct for the past about one year, leaving the users with no other option but to defecate in open. Almost a kilometre away from deputy commissioner’s office, the facility was built a few years ago, but was renovated early in 2020. However, soon after its reopening, the sewer line got clogged and the toilet had to be closed for public, Mukesh, a vegetable vendor and a slum dweller, said. “We were glad to see its restoration, but didn’t know it won’t last long. The renovated toilet functioned merely for two-three months. Young people can manage to walk to use public conveniences almost a kilometre away, but the elderly can’t,” Ashok, another resident of the colony said. 60-year-old Devi Das is among numerous women living in the slums under the flyover leading to district courts, DC office and mini secretariat and are forced to walk up to the railway line early in the morning. “I’m aged and find it difficult to even walk to the toilet that’s shut now. I always wanted a loo just near our locality, but we don’t have one,” said Das, a widow, who is unable to walk without support. Mukesh said he had asked former councillor Pawan Aggarwal to resolve their issue, who then told the incumbent ward member Mithun Verma to look into the matter.“We have already written to the municipal corporation and our application was forwarded to the official concerned in May last year. We were told that the sewer line of the toilet was choked and there was no machine to clean it then,” he added. Councillor Verma had raised the issue during the zero hour of the second House meeting on August 16. “This is painful to know that the women in slum have to defecate in the open. In response to my issue at the meeting, MC commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata had assured of arranging a community toilet facility at the place,” he added. It is pertinent to mention here that Ambala MC is among 958 urban local bodies having already attained open defecation free plus plus (ODF++) status under the Swachh Bharat Mission.As per the union ministry of housing and urban affairs, ODF++ protocol adds the condition that “A city/ ward/ work circle can be declared as SBM ODF++ city/SBM ODF++ward/SBM ODF++work circle if, at any point of the day, not a single person is found defecating and/or urinating in the open, all community and public toilets are functional and well maintained, and faecal sludge/septage and sewage is safely managed and treated, with no discharging and/or dumping of untreated faecal sludge/septage and sewage in drains, water bodies or open areas.”Advocate Rohit Jain, who has filed a couple of petitions in the court regarding sanitation issues, claimed, “As per the definition, it seems that it is a clear violation of ODF++ status.”While comments of chief sanitary inspector Madan Lal could not be elicited, MC chief Dhirendra Khadgata refuted the violation claim. “Though there are one or two more toilets near the area, I will ensure that the problem is resolved within a week,” he added. “We are looking into the matter which had also come up during the House meeting. The problem pertains to the cleaning of a sewer line by the public health engineering department. I’ve already written to them,” Khadgata said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/defunct-loo-facility-forces-150-families-in-ambala-to-defecate-in-open-101630615155116.html

03-09-2021||Other||With Geelani’s death, Hurriyat stares at a leadership void||The death of senior separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani is set to create a big void in the rank and file of the Hurriyat Conference that till last year was led by Geelani and separatist politicos.Geelani, during his prolonged illness, had resigned from the All Party Hurriyat Conference last year which he led for almost 17 years. Though the group had been grooming Mohammad Ashraf Khan alias Sehrai, Geelani’s close aide to take over the reins of the separatist amalgam after Geelani, Sehrai’s death last year at a Jammu jail due to Covid-19 has been a big blow to the group. Sehrai was leading the Tahreek-e-Hurriyat that was formed by Geelani, however, after Sehrai’s death nobody was announced as his successor.Even after Geelani’s resignation from the chairmanship of his faction, nobody was named in his place, though Abdullah Geelani, who is in Pakistan, claimed to represent Geelani by issuing statements on different occasions.“Geelani’s death is a big loss to the separatist politics of Kashmir. After his death, nobody of his stature is within the rank and file of his faction Hurriyat who can replace him,” said a senior separatist leader who wished anonymity. “The two deaths, first Mohammad Ashraf Sehria and now Geelani is big setback for the separatist movement in J&K. I don’t see any other leader having such capacity or capability to replace Syed Ali Geelani who had decades of political experience and a huge following, especially among youth.”Post abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of J&K into two UTs, the separatist leadership is under tremendous pressure and majority of the leaders are either in jail or have gone into hibernation. Occasionally, press statements were issued in Geelani’s name, which, police say, were being issued from Pakistan.With Geelani gone, now it remains to be seen who will replace him as there is not a single person in the separatist camp who holds sway on people like Geelani did.The faction will now look towards another jailed leader Masrat Alam, chairman of Muslim League, however, it will take years for Alam to reach to the stature of Geelani and under current circumstances, it’s very difficult for Alam to be released from jail. With the death of Geelani, all eyes will be focused on Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq who is under house arrest after the revocation of Article 370 and most of separatist leaders will look towards him.Pervaz Majeed, who teaches journalism at Amar Singh College, Srinagar, said that Geelani had an experience and was witness to three generations of political shift and in that respect, nobody could have been of his “stature” in separatist politics. “For Islamist separatists, it’s going to be a big and irreplaceable loss,” said Majeed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-geelani-s-death-hurriyat-stares-at-a-leadership-void-101630614734998.html

Their size has been brought down to 50 acres and a notification will follow within a week,” said Sarvjeet Singh, principal secretary, housing and urban development, Punjab.He added that the amendment will help ensure proper utilisation of vacant land pockets to provide more housing infrastructure in New Chandigarh.Land developers hail decision“The policy reflects the government’s growth-oriented vision. Nod to 50-acre townships will allow quality developers to enter the region and enable a healthy realty market. The 200-foot PR7 road through Mohali will help connect New Chandigarh with the existing infrastructure of Mohali, including the airport,” said Umang Jindal, founder of Homeland Group.On other hand, MS Aujla, former director, town planning, local government, Punjab, said that when 100-acre townships were proposed, the idea was to include required health, education and other social infrastructure. “Reducing the size to 50 acres may compromise availability of accessible facilities. Now, with the changed policy, the authorities must ensure that the required peripheral road infrastructure is provided,” he said.New Chandigarh is located in close proximity to Madhya Marg in Chandigarh along the operational Chandigarh-Baddi road. As per the master plan, Mullanpur’s population is expected to rise to 2,00,000 by 2031 and 3,50,000 by 2056 with a gross residential density of 100 people per acre.Encashing the emerging opportunities due to the rising residential realty demand, leading developers have pumped in crores in Mullanpur alone within a short span of time.The Greater Mohali Area development Authority (GMADA) is also constructing an extension of the 200-foot PR7 road, commonly known as the Airport Road, which begins from the dividing road of Sectors 120/125 in Sunny Enclave and connects to the PR4 road in New Chandigarh. Expected to be ready by year-end, the road extension will reduce the travel time between Mohali and New Chandigarh by 15-20 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-nod-to-policy-for-50-acre-townships-in-new-chandigarh-101630614674898.html

Geelani, 91, had passed away at his residence around 10.30pm on Wednesday night. Only close relatives and neighbours were allowed to participate in the funeral at the local graveyard that was completely sealed by the forces.Geelani’s family members told mediapersons that the police forcibly took away the body and carried out the burial even before their relatives could reach Srinagar. They also accused the police of misbehaving with them.Even mediapersons were prevented from covering the funeral and were stopped by police near Hyderpora.Apprehending trouble, authorities had imposed restrictions across Kashmir and snapped the internet and mobile phones.Only postpaid BSNL mobiles were working in Kashmir and forces were deployed across the district, with all roads leading towards Hyderpora completely sealed.Additional troops were deployed at sensitive places, especially in old city and north Kashmir. In the morning, police stopped vehicles on the national highway at several spots and didn’t allow them to move towards Srinagar or other major towns.The roads of Srinagar city presented a deserted look as people stayed inside their homes. Police and security forces were seen patrolling at different places even as bullet-proof mobile bunkers were paced at sensitive spots.Inspector General of Police, Vijay Kumar said that soon after Geelani’s death, restrictions were imposed across Kashmir as a preventive measure. For the past many months, police had been carrying out mock drills for the funeral of the separatist leader as many of his supporters wanted to bury him at the martyrs’ graveyard in old city.Family claims police forcibly took away bodyNayeem Geelani, the elder son of Syed Ali Geelani, accused the police of forcibly taking away his father’s body for burial, stating that even family members weren’t able to attend the funeral.Nayeem, who, along with other family members, was at Geelani’s Hyderpora residence when the separatist leader passed away, said that his father had developed breathing problems around 9.30 pm. “We put him on oxygen support but he passed away around 10pm,” said Nayeem.He said that soon after Geelani’s death, police officers approached them and told them that they had to bury the separatist leader at a local graveyard at night. “We told them about my father’s wish to be buried at Eidgah but the officer in-charge told us that there was pressure from higher officials to bury him at night.”Nayeem, who is a doctor by profession, said the police then forcibly took away the body at 3am. “The body was taken to a local Jamia Masjid and then buried after religious formalities. After police snatched the body, they had asked us to attend the funeral which we refused.”Nayeem said the family members only went to Geelani’s grave in the morning. “We had even requested the police wait till morning so that our relatives could reach the city but they didn’t pay heed to us.”He said that even after Geelani’s death, authorities were fearful of him. “They (govt) thought that this death could trigger upheaval.”Inspector General of Police, Vijay Kumar, refused to comment on the alleged forcible snatching of Geelani’s body from his house.A police spokesman said that the situation across valley remained peaceful and no any untoward incident was reported. “Pertinently, some vested interests tried to spread baseless rumours about forcible burial of SAS Geelani by police. Such baseless reports which are as a part of false propaganda to incite violence are totally refuted by the police. As a matter of fact, police facilitated in bringing the body from house to graveyard as there were apprehensions of miscreants taking undue advantage of the situation. The relatives of the deceased participated in the burial,” he said, adding that restrictions and internet shutdown will continue tomorrow. “We shall review the situation tomorrow afternoon and take further course of action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/geelani-buried-at-graveyard-near-his-residence-amid-tight-security-101630614554925.html

Addressing the media, she alleged that on the orders of the state government, the administration had already decided to “break farmers’ skulls”. “No officer can issue such order without the support of the government. Now, we are demanding action against the officer concerned (then SDM Ayush Sinha) and those who attacked the farmers, severely injuring many,” the former Union minister said.On being asked about the difference of opinion between Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and his deputy Dushyant Chautala on action against the officer, she said the government just wanted to confuse the people. “The Congress has already approached the National Human Rights Commission, initiated action and sought a report from the district administration,” she added. Selja also slammed Khattar for blaming the Punjab Congress for the protests and said that the CM should resign as he couldn’t handle his state. The party also handed over a memorandum addressed to Haryana governor to additional deputy commissioner Yogesh Kumar on the issue. She was accompanied by Congress MLA from Assandh Shamsher Singh Gogi, former Haryana assembly Speaker Kuldeep Sharma, former Haryana minority commission chairperson Tarlochan Singh and other local leaders.In Ambala, a similar protest took place from the city’s Manav Chowk to the DC office. Leading the protests, Mullana MLA Varun Chaudhary said with the Land Acquisition Amendment Bill, the government intended to end the existence of agriculture in the state and the farmers, who are already protesting against the three farm laws.In Yamunanagar, Sham Sunder Batra, district coordinator of the party, sought registration of a murder case against the SDM.

The Parliament is also not able to make use of the opportunities to plan activities and campaigns in accordance with the changing situation in China and the international community, said the Sikyong.The stalemate began in June when 22 MPs refused to take oath from the interim speaker stating that the Chief Justice Commission who appointed the interim speaker has no jurisdiction over the matter, as he was removed by the previous Parliament.He said the Kashag has been informed of several instances of the Chinese government exploiting this issue to spread falsehood inside Tibet, create division in the exiled Tibetan community and misuse it on the international platforms, said Tsering.As all of us know that there are people in our small community who are just venting emotions without careful thinking, he added.Tsering hailed the Tibetans inside Tibet for showing indomitable courage and determination in the face of China’s continued policy to exterminate the Tibetan identity and their efforts to protect Tibet’s religion, culture, language and tradition. “It is this strength that unites the Tibetans-in-exile and keeps alive the freedom struggle. It is the common wish in our heart to reunite in Tibet,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tibetan-president-calls-to-end-deadlock-in-parliamentinexile-101630614196454.html

Police rounded up 25 violators, seized 11 vehicles and issued four challans for drunken driving. A drive was carried at Sarabha Nagar, Sidhwan Canal Road, South City, Sarabha Nagar Puli (Hero Bakery Chowk) and Ferozepur Road.Police teams turned up outside eateries and started rounding up those drinking inside their cars. The police recovered liquor bottles, beer bottles, disposal glasses and eatables from the cars. Many violators tried to influence police officials using the names of senior officials and political leaders, but to no avail.“Many violators said they had just started drinking, some said they were drinking in the open for the first time and they would not repeat it in future,” an officer said. Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, investigation) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti said the police had received several complaints regarding people consuming alcohol outside eateries, following which the cops carried out the drive. The ADCP added the commissioner of police had already banned drinking in the open, as it leads to scuffles and causes mishaps. The ADCP said the eatery owners had also been asked to not serve eatables in cars. Officials say more drives will be carried out on other parts of the city as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/25-people-rounded-up-for-drinking-in-open-11-vehicles-seized-in-ludhiana-101630613355760.html
03-09-2021||Chandigarh||HT interview: Mistrust between Capt, Sidhu must end soon, says Punjab Cong affairs in-charge Harish Rawat||Even for a Congress leader as seasoned as Harish Rawat, the dual challenge is proving a tough row to hoe. As AICC general secretary in-charge of Punjab, he has been busy for three months firefighting an internecine war between chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and his bete noire Navjot Singh Sidhu that has only turned worse since the latter’s elevation as state Congress chief last month. At the same time, as the party’s tallest leader in Uttarakhand, Rawat is running out of time to focus on his own political sweepstakes in the home state that goes to assembly polls alongside Punjab early next year. Not surprisingly, former CM-five-time MP appeared to betray his sense of exasperation by asking the high command recently to relieve him of the Punjab responsibility. In Chandigarh for another round of parleys to defuse the Capt-Sidhu slugfest, Rawat, 73, sat down with Hindustan Times on Thursday for an exclusive interview. Edited excerpts:Who will lead the Congress in the 2022 polls – Capt Amarinder or Sidhu? The Congress has some established norms that are applicable to all states. Where we are in government, both the chief minister and the PCC president are there. The PCC chief is always there and represents the AICC. The CM runs the government and people want to see how you have governed the state. This is always the issue that centres round the CM and he has an important role. This is the standard practice. After the elections, MLAs sit together and almost always they resolve to leave the decision of selecting the leader to the Congress president. Therefore, who will be the face of the party is not an issue. These established norms can’t change for Harish Rawat or Punjab. But the party had named Capt Amarinder Singh as its CM face before the 2017 polls. We were not in the government then. Amarinder Singh Ji was PCC president at that time. He was named the chief ministerial candidate to boost the prospects. At present, we are in the government and have the PCC also. Both situations cannot be equated. Both are very important people and have their role and responsibilities. What about your statement last week that the party will go into the polls under Capt Amarinder’s leadership? My complete statement was not reported. I had made mention of the Congress tradition in this regard, but it was left out. It was unfortunate that some of my colleagues (in Punjab) made it an issue of public debate. Instead of talking to the media, they should have called and spoken to me. You have visited Chandigarh several times and tried hard to solve this crisis. Why has it not been resolved so far?Let’s look at the recent history of any political party in Punjab. The BJP was a small partner of Akalis, but they fought. There is no comparison between the Congress and the BJP. We are a democratic party, but they are not. As for the SAD, see how many Akali Dals have been formed by splinter groups. At least you should give us credit that we have stopped the situation from drifting to this level. People have high expectations from the Congress. I expect party leaders to resolve their differences and issues within the party and not go public. Still, we are far better in Punjab than our competitors. When the Congress high command made Sidhu the PCC chief, it was expected that it would solve the issue, but it hasn’t, and the party still has two centres of power.We were also hoping that with greater responsibility and a bigger platform under his feet, he will be able to resolve contradictions. I think he will learn by experience. We will have to understand one thing that Sidhu’s politics is based on anti-incumbency. When Sidhu was in BJP, he was criticising the SAD even though the two parties were in alliance. The issues he raised were also taken up by the Congress, but they are not so simple that you can resolve them by pressing a button. If someone who is saying that Bargari or drug issues should be solved, it is not that someone will resolve them just like that. Court is involved, greater interests are involved, and sentiments are involved. On top of it, political personalities of different parties are involved. In such a situation, I know how the chief minister has to walk on a razor’s edge on such issues. He has to ensure that there is no social or communal backlash. Can you be more specific? I have observed that in Bargari, Kotkapura cases, several senior officers have been chargesheeted or jailed. And it is unparalleled in the history of India. The government should have got credit but, unfortunately, I could not give credit to it. For one failure, the chargesheet struck down by the court, we have ignored successes. The same is true for drugs. Half of the convictions in drug cases in the country are in Punjab alone, half of arrests and recoveries are in the state. But some kingpins have managed to escape action till now. This does not mean the government doesn’t have the intention. Still, I am hopeful that having a very experienced and intelligent CM, some significant breakthrough will be achieved in a month or so. PPAs were also a criminal act of the Akali government. The problem is that once you enter PPAs, there is not much scope for exit. It is not just that you pass a resolution in the state assembly, and it all goes away. Despite this, there is option to force and bring them (companies) to the negotiation table and reduce the purchase price to pass on the benefit to people. Here I appreciate the concern shown by the PCC president. We cannot look at just one aspect of Sidhu’s statements. He is only being evaluated as CM’s opponent. I am looking at it from the angle that anti-incumbency is not built against us. But he is emerging as the biggest critic of his own government.There is difference in the way we look at it. On PPAs, electricity bill, bus permits, etc, I am as vocal as Sidhu is. Should I be seen as my own govt’s critic? You seem convinced that the Capt government is showing both intention and direction. Does that mean that this criticism is unfounded? These are very complex issues. We have to look at them in totality. Why can’t the chief minister convince Sidhu about all this? Sidhu is convinced. To certain extent, I will like him to stick on these issues. After all, I have to see everything with electoral angle also. We will find a solution to all these issues if not today, then tomorrow. If that’s so, what is behind the tussle between Sidhu and CM? I pray to ‘Waheguru’ with folded hands daily that mistrust between the two should end. This is significant and my role is important and critical. In politics, everything is not so easy. You have to deal with psychology of human beings. The CM has his own experience and Sidhu has his own style. When you have such people, it is difficult to make them bond, just like it is difficult with fine steel and not raw steel. It takes time. What is the root cause of this mistrust, temperamentally they are different or there is no chemistry? There are many things – background, personality and approach. These cannot be rectified in one day. I am quite hopeful that we will solve this problem before the elections, and everything will be in order. Isn’t the Congress losing out in the battle of perception? We are fortunate that our competitors are like lost gamblers otherwise we would have faced problems. I have no hesitation in admitting this. The opposition SAD and AAP are active and aggressive on the ground but the Congress is still grappling with infighting. Our graph was good till one or two months ago, but people have started criticising us. I think our leaders will take this changing perception as a warning bell and pay attention. I tell people that in Punjab we have plenty of experienced people, hundreds of them who are brighter than me. Do you see any justification in the demand made by some ministers and MLAs for the CM’s removal? It is their right to make a demand, but there is a way to convey things in the party. Sometimes, people get emotional and say things, like this demand that has come from unexpected quarters. It is not that we are ignoring what they have said. We are looking into it and will find a solution soon. We don’t want this abscess to get worse. Do you see any merit in Sidhu camp’s demand for a Congress legislature party meeting to know the MLAs’ views?I am not sure in what context he has said this. We do not want to be reduced to a debating forum on these issues. We are a party in government and do not want to keep debating all the time as it will not work. We are going towards the solution. That’s why I discussed with the CM on Wednesday the points mentioned by Sidhu in his memorandum. Are you convinced with what the CM has done so far? I am convinced that the CM is quite anxious to find the results. What about all this talk of cabinet rejig? In our meeting, we had no discussion on cabinet reshuffle. Our focus was entirely on action points. Whenever it (reshuffle) is to be done, it will require approval from the Congress president. This is not my mandate. What about apprehensions that some dissenters are being targeted by the district administrations in their constituencies? This issue has been raised. I have also discussed it very seriously. Such things cannot be allowed. We are in favour of neutral administration but any plotting against our ministers and MLAs in our government is not acceptable to us. This is a bad commentary on our rule. I understand no such thing is happening except one or two changes at some places. How do you look at Sidhu and his supporters repeatedly suggesting that Capt Amarinder is not taking action in sacrilege and drug cases because he is in collusion with the Badals? Circumstances have placed him in such a situation. Punjab is the only state where cases sent to CBI by the previous Akali government have been brought back by the state government. Tell me has this happened in any other state till now. He has not able to defend himself well (against such talk). It is the duty of the party to do this. But all this is being said by the Punjab Congress president. He (Sidhu) is saying that there is this perception, and we need to break it. I am also saying this. We have to break it together. I expect the PPCC chief and ministers to work with the CM in breaking this perception. There is strong perception that Sidhu’s elevation and 18-point agenda have eroded the Amarinder’s authority. We are an old party and I have been a chief minister myself. Do you think I do not understand that if the CM’s authority is eroded whom will it hurt? Circumstances were such that we needed to take a decision. Unfortunately, the CM took a public stand. I had advised him against taking a stand in public. If any decision was taken against his stand, it was not eroding his authority. In democracy, nobody is the last word. Sometimes, the Congress president’s decision is changed by the working committee. As Uttarakhand is going to polls with Punjab, what is happening on your request to divest you of this charge? The party has given me so much. I am committed to following the directions of the party leadership. I have left the decision to it. If we do not do this, the party will not survive. Unfortunately, some of our friends are not realising this factor. This is why the Congress is seen in bad light sometimes. When the party provides you a platform, it is your duty to deliver to the party. You have to come to Punjab again and again. Are you happy with the situation? Do you think it was resolved to some extent when Sidhu was appointed? In any religion, husband and wife are never asked are you happy or not. We have to do our duty. I am wedded to Congress. It is not even a contract marriage. It is a relationship of a lifetime. How do you look at first five weeks of Sidhu as president? It is mixed. He is learning fast. I have seen his statements. He has appreciated the government on fixing the sugarcane purchase price. He started as an anti-incumbency leader and he is moulding himself as the leader of a political party which is ruling the state. You once said that Sidhu is like a Rafale. Is he in control or gone out of control? Rafale is always in control. Its control system is excellent. I have not wasted my 55 years in politics. You should have some faith in my art. Our Rafale will hit the opposition. We are refining its weaponry system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/htinterview-mistrust-between-capt-sidhu-must-end-soon-says-punjab-cong-affairs-in-charge-harish-rawat-101630613176391.html

Yesterday, when the school hours got over, Sapandeep and her colleague Ramandeep Kaur asked the area municipal councillor to arrange for a person to oversee the inoculation drive and ensure the safety of the school furniture and other equipment. In response to this, the municipal councillor told both the teachers that they can leave the school in the evening after completion of the drive,” said Sekhon.“In the meantime, DEO Jaswinder Kaur, deputy DEO Kuldeep Singh and office clerk Harminder Singh Romi arrived and threatened both the teachers that they will initiate a departmental inquiry against them and transfer them to a remote location.

Rajinder Kumar, the Class 4 employee who was rounded up, accused the Opposition of planting the liquor at his house. Ashok Kumar, who is contesting for the post of general secretary and whose poll symbol is a car, said, “We are fighting to secure more rights for Class 4 employees. The clerical staff sees it as a threat and therefore is using cheap politics such as planting liquor at the house of our group member in connivance with the Opposition.”On the other hand, Brinder Singh, who is fighting for post of president on the symbol of an agricultural tool, said the Opposition was using liquor to grease the electorate. “While they were stocking the liquor, someone informed the police,” said Rajinder Singh.

03-09-2021||Mumbai||OTT parks in Maharashtra to make sector content?||In a push to the growing streaming services market, the Maharashtra government plans to unveil a series of sops for the sector. This is likely to include ‘over-the-top (OTT) parks’ to streamline post-production activities being catalysed on the lines of Information Technology (IT) parks in Maharashtra. The state may roll out a package of concessions for this industry as part of the policy for the IT and ITES sector that is in the works. This policy is expected to be tabled before the state government in a month. “We are planning to include the technology-oriented component of the OTT sector in the forthcoming IT policy,” said Dr P Anbalagan, chief executive officer (CEO), Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC). “They need buildings, connectivity, dormitories… the post-production consists of IT (functions) like visual effects, uploading,” he noted, adding that they would focus on promoting both, pre and post-production activities. These incentives will include flexibility in norms like Floor Space Index (FSI) and Development Control Regulations (DCR), stamp duty concessions and rules on lines of integrated townships that allow private land to be notified as such. This will ensure the setup of OTT parks on lines of IT townships to make it easy for industry players to function and streamline their activities. Like the film cities, where units shoot movies or serials, these space in the OTT parks can be offered on rent for production houses to undertake post-production work and streamline their activities. The IT policy is in the final stages and is expected to be submitted to the state government soon for approval by the state cabinet. Anbalagan added that if the need arose, they could also formulate a separate policy for the sector in the future. Nitin Vaidya, director, Indian Film and TV Producers Council (IFTPC), welcomed the move and noted that like the 1990s had seen the growth of the television sector, OTT platforms were the growth sectors for the future. He however urged the government to create state-of-the art infrastructure, including venues for shooting, post-production activities and data centres. “Despite the fact that Bollywood is one of the identities of Mumbai and Maharashtra, there has been little support from the government. In fact, in the recent years, the sector has developed sans any government aid. The last major government-led initiative for the film and television sector was the development of the Dadasaheb Phalke Chitranagari (Goregaon Film City) in 1977,” said Vaidya. He added that while the OTT sector was expected to grow fast, there was little infrastructure support from either the Central or the State Government. Inadequate infrastructure and high demand at the Goregaon film city and Kolhapur Chitranagari had led to producers scouting for locations at Malvani, Madh, Bhayander and Naigaon near Virar. The television sector, including Hindi and regional channels, had an estimated turnover of ₹40,000 crore in the current financial year. Explaining the employment generation potential of the sector, Vaidya said an estimated number of 143 shows were being shot for the small screen in Maharashtra. While Hindi shows employ an average of 150 people on the sets, the number was at a lower 70 for Marathi. Vaidya noted that considering an estimated 100 people per show, this translated into an average of 14,000 people. The number of those working in film and OTT post-production activities was also significant, and hence a growth in this sector would translate into significant job creation in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ottparks-in-maharashtra-to-make-sector-content-101630611739391.html
03-09-2021||Chandigarh||Now, 7 categories exempted from paying pet registration fee in Ludhiana||With the pet registration drive garnering a tepid response, the municipal corporation has now exempted seven categories from paying the annual pet registration fee. The categories exempted from paying the ₹400 annual registration fee are blind, elderly and specially abled persons; non governmental organisations; security agencies, private and government; veterinary research institutes and hospitals; animal lovers and activists; those below poverty line; and foster homes for dogs. Nonetheless, those exempted from paying the fee will have to register their pets, which will be done free of cost. Officials say those applying for registration under the exempted categories will have to ensure that the anti-rabies vaccine is administered to their pets and that they are collared. NGOs sheltering dogs, and animal activists must also get their dogs sterilised, which will be done free of cost at the Haibowal Dairy Complex. The MC is also working on a project to administer free anti-rabies vaccines. Senior veterinary officer Dr Harbans Dhalla said, “The finance and contracts committee of the municipal corporation has approved the proposal. The exemptions were incorporated on the request of a few NGOs. This will ensure that stray dogs that are sheltered by residents are vaccinated and sterilised. The pets can be registered online at www.mcludhiana.gov.in or at suvidha kendras.” The annual fee for the current financial year (2021-22) has also been exempted for the residents who registered their pets with the MC before March 31. The annual fee has to be submitted for the year 2022-23 before March 31. The pet registration project, which commenced in June 2020, has received a tepid response with only 2,165 residents getting their pets registered with the MC . No cat has been registered so far. The caveat of paying a 10 times higher fine also failed to boost registrations. Lax enforcement is also responsible for the delay in registration. Five months after the deadline, no action has been taken against defaulters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/now-7-categories-exempted-from-paying-pet-registration-fee-in-ludhiana-101630611738200.html

In a written statement, leader of opposition (LOP) Harpal Singh Cheema claimed that a report in the drugs case was lying in a sealed cover in the high court, but the state government had not made efforts to get it opened. He said the state government should immediately file a writ petition in the Supreme Court for transferring the case to high court of another state. “The case has got delayed for a long time for one reason or another and the government should ensure that it is heard on a daily basis and a decision is given within a specified time,” he said. Cheema inducted former judge and ex-chairman of permanent lok adalat Manju Rana into the party fold in Kapurthala on Thursday.

03-09-2021||Mumbai||Maratha quota: Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje seeks President’s intervention||A delegation led by Rajya Sabha member Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje on Thursday met President Ram Nath Kovind, seeking constitutional intervention for the restoration of Maratha quota. The delegation has requested the President for intervention to tweak the definition of the ‘extraordinary and exceptional’ situation in which the Maharashtra government can accord the reservation to any community, or removal of the ceiling of 50% on reservations.Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje – a descendant of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj – has been leading the Maratha protests, demanding the restoration of the reservation for the community, which was quashed by the Supreme Court on May 5. The delegation also consisted of Bharatiya Janata Party’s Ranjeetsingh Nimbalkar, Nationalist Congress Party’s Vandana Chavan, Shiv Sena’s Vinayak Raut and Congress’s Sangram Thopate. After the meeting, Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje said that the President heard them patiently and assured to study the entire issue. “He said that he will inform us about the further course of action by studying the entire matter,” Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje said.He added that they have requested the President for immediate intervention. “While striking down the reservation given to Maratha, SC said that the community cannot be called backward as it does not reside in “far flung and remote areas” which define the extra ordinary and exceptional situation to establish the backwardness. Even if the recent constitutional amendment has given powers back to the state governments to give the reservation on the basis of backwardness, it cannot be of any avail in such a situation. We have requested to either change the definition of backwardness or remove the ceiling of 50% on reservation,” he said.In the letter given to the President, the leaders have stated that not only Maharashtra, but many other states have excluded the 50% reservation limit and are likely to face legal crisis due to the cap on quota. “The Jats in Haryana, Patidars in Gujarat, Kapurs in Telangana and Gujjars in Rajasthan have been demanding reservation as they have been left out of the mainstream. The 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment has deprived them from their right to quota. It is the need of the hour to rethink over the 50% cap to offer them respite. SC has overlooked the 10% reservation given to the economically weaker section recently though it has crossed the limit of 50%. In this view, you are requested to intervene to give respite to not only Marathas but other peasant communities from across the country,” it reads.SC on May 5 had quashed 12% and 13% quota given to Marathas in education and jobs under Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2018. The state government is planning to file a review petition in SC as recommended by a committee of retired high court judge Dilip Bhosale to study the ruling and recommend a way forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-quota-chhatrapati-sambhajiraje-seeks-president-s-intervention-101630611674763.html
03-09-2021||Mumbai||As festival approaches, Covid test positivity rate inches up in Maharashtra||Maharashtra’s weekly positivity rate has increased marginally from 2.48% to 2.6% in the week between August 25 to September 1 compared to the week between August 18 and 24. Public health experts attribute to the rise in Covid-19 cases due to the lockdown relaxations starting the second week of August; districts such as Mumbai, Thane and Pune have recorded the highest rise. However, though the uptick is slight, it is still a matter of concern. Here’s why: the test positivity rate (TPR) has increased despite a decrease in testing. TPR is a function of the number of cases to every 100 tests conducted. If the disease spread were in check, a decrease in the number of tests would be accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the number of cases. Data provided by the state health department shows that 1,327,214 cumulative tests took place between August 18 and 24 of which 32,994 samples tested positive for Covid-19. In the following week, the number of tests between August 25 and September 1 dropped to 1,288,798, but the number of positive cases increased to 33,751. Weekly tests in Mumbai dropped from 273,794 (conducted in the week between August 18 and 24) to 264,731 in the week between August 25 and September 1. But the weekly positivity rate increased from 0.9% to 1.1%. Similarly, in Thane weekly testing dropped by 10.8% from 128,321 to 114,454 in the same two weeks. However, the positivity rate increased from 1.3% to 1.7%. A high TPR accompanied by decrease in testing indicates that the spread of the disease is still prevalent and is not under control. Lesser testing means that people who are being infected may be passing it on to others without realizing. Significance of testing Let’s take the case of Pune where the daily cases are rising. Together with Ahmednagar, Satara and Sangli, these districts have been recording some of the highest positivity rates in the state during the second wave. This continues to be the case: of the 44,366 patients registered during August 22-31, 70% are from these four districts. However, though the latter three have been registering a gradual dip in daily case numbers, the weekly positivity rate of Pune has surged to 6.3% in the last seven days from 5.6% that was recorded between August 18 and 24. However, in Pune, the number of tests has actually gone up. Pune conducted 113,026 tests between August 18 and 24, which increased to 115,914 in the last seven days. “With the identification of the Delta plus variants in the district, we have increased the daily testing which has also contributed to the rise in weekly positivity rate,” a senior health officer from Pune health department said. A total of 127 Delta plus variants have been recorded in the state – six in Pune. Increased testing – alongside other measures like contact tracing, mask wearing, physical distancing and ensuring effective ventilation – helps in controlling the spread of a pandemic. In the case of Pune’s numbers, the rise in cases is an indication of high prevalence; it’s also an indication that the spread isn’t going unchecked. Next 15 days crucial The roll out of relaxations from Covid-19 lockdown in the state is one of the factors responsible for the rise in numbers. Starting August 15, public places like shops, malls, and restaurants were allowed to operate till 10pm, while private offices were permitted to operate all days of the week with staggered shifts. Restaurants, gymnasiums and spas were allowed to operate at 50% capacity. The number of people allowed to attend wedding ceremonies was increased to 200 in open venues. Indoor games were allowed till 10pm to those who were fully vaccinated. The public health department is anticipating a rise in cases in two weeks after the commencement of the Ganesh festival on September 10. The department has cited the example of Kerala, which saw a rise in cases immediately after Onam. “Till now, the situation is under control. With festivals around the corner and the presence of Delta variants in the crowd, people need to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. The next 15 days will be essential to understand the pattern of the pandemic. Meanwhile, the state government is focusing on boosting the vaccination drive across the state,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the state Covid-19 task force. “It is too early to comment if the rise in weekly positivity rate is because of the relaxations. It is only after mid-September that we can confirm it. Rural districts like Washim that are recording a spike are because of a thick tail which is common in any pandemic,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, Maharashtra. Mumbai and Thane officials said that the slight uptick in positivity rates is something to keep a close eye on. “The slight rise in cases is expected post relaxation of the restrictions. Also, local train services have also partially resumed. But so far, we haven’t recorded any sudden surge in cases. Now, we have zero containment zones in slums,” Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said. “As there has not been a major spike in the positivity rate, we have not given orders to increase daily testing. However, the respective administrative authorities are monitoring the cases and if any particular pocket records an increase in cases, we will do the needful to curb the rise in cases. However we have fastened the vaccination process across the district. Currently, we have completed vaccination of 32% of the eligible population,” Dr Manish Renge, district health officer (DHO) Thane, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/as-festival-approaches-covid-test-positivity-rate-inches-up-in-maharashtra-101630611616070.html

He is making haywire statements, he should apologise to the farmers or else the chief minister should sack him for hurting sentiments of fruit growers,” said Rathore. Mahender Singh Thakur had advised farmers that instead of using the cardboard cartons, the farmers should sell their produce in open. Rathore described the stance of the government as anti-apple growers. Rathore also trained his guns on urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj for his statement on the steep crash in apple prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/himachal-congress-attacks-bjp-ministers-over-statements-on-crashing-apple-market-101630611614616.html
03-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Covid case fatality rate on the decline||Despite the recent rise in the daily number of Covid-19 cases, there has been a decline in the number of deaths due to Covid-19 in Mumbai throughout August. While the daily case fatality rate (CFR) has also dropped to below 1% on several days of August, the average CFR for the city was 0.9% last month. For the first time since the beginning of the pandemic in March last year, zero deaths due to Covid-19 were reported on August 22. August saw a total of 88 deaths, in comparison to 438 in July, which had a CFR of 3.4%. August reported a total of 9,376 Covid-19 cases, compared to 12,557 in July. June recorded 625 deaths due to Covid-19 with a CFR of 3.6%, with 16,934 cases; May reported the highest number of deaths due to Covid-19 during the second wave (since March) at 1,701, with the CFR at 2.9%. April reported 1,435 Covid-19 deaths, with a CFR of 0.6%, and March reported 211 deaths. CFR is the total number of deaths in comparison to the total number of cases. ​ For example, Mumbai reported 323 new cases and 1 death on August 31; 333 new cases and 2 deaths on August 30, 345 new cases and 2 deaths on August 29. On August 28, Mumbai reported 4 deaths against 391 new covid-19 cases. Overall, during the second wave, from March to August, Mumbai reported a total of 4,498 Covid deaths and 417,348 new cases, with a CFR of 1%. This has brought down the average CFR for Mumbai since the beginning of the pandemic to 2.1%. Experts said deaths happen in two scenarios in maximum number of cases. First, as soon as the patient arrives in the hospital, as he or she may have ignored symptoms for a longer time before seeking medical attention; the second, after the patient is being treated in a hospital for a longer duration and succumbs to the complications. Dr Rahul Pandit, who is part of the Maharashtra government task force for Covid-19, said, “Over the months during the second wave, our line of treatment has evolved, and medical professionals have understood the nature of the infection. As the number of active cases has dropped, deaths are bound to decrease.” According to Dr Pandit, treatment protocols were set in place, such as how much oxygen is needed, when to put a patient on oxygen support, what medicines are working for what kind of complications, which has contributed to a decrease in the number of deaths. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner incharge of BMC’s public health department, said, “Through the second wave, we optimised our treatment protocols, senior doctors were attending to severe or critical patients, and Mission Save lives was being implemented strictly.” “As number of daily cases decreases, a larger number of positive patients are able to get medical care at tertiary hospitals, due to the decrease in burden on medical infrastructure,” Dr Pandit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-covid-case-fatality-rate-on-the-decline-101630611494535.html

Of the 14,236,000 tap connections to be set up as part of central government’s Jal Jeevan Mission, Maharashtra has completed 65%, while 4.9 million tap connections are remaining.Chairing a review meetings on the Jal Jeevan Mission, Thackeray said the state will not let funds and required manpower fall short for the programme. “The objective under Jal Jeevan Mission is to provide over 14.23 million tap connections in the rural areas of the state by the year 2024. Though this goal is big, this work is virtuous and we have to do it. To achieve this goal of connecting pipes by 2024, a time bound programme should be drawn up and implemented by all agencies on war-footing,” he said as per the statement from CMO.By March 2022, the state plans to provide 2.75 million tap connections, where 13 districts, 131 blocks, and 12,839 villages will have 100% coverage of the scheme, the water supply and sanitation department said. This is expected to cost ₹12,950 crore. According to water supply minister Gulabrao Patil, the Centre has provided ₹7,064 crore, while the state too has allocated same amount of funds making ₹14,128 crore available for the project. In 2020-21, Maharashtra has provided 37.15 lakh tap water connections in rural areas.Of the total tap connections, 9.3 million or 65% work has been completed till August 31, 2021. The remaining 4.9 million connections are pending. The objective is to provide enough water to each household to supply 55 litres of water per person per day instead of 40, the statement from CMO added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-prepare-plan-for-tap-connections-in-rural-areas-says-cm-uddhav-thackeray-101630611256069.html
03-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body asks hospitals, jumbo facilities to be ready for third Covid wave||Civic-run jumbo Covid-19 facilities, peripheral and super speciality hospitals and private medical institutions have been asked to be on alert in anticipation of the third wave in Mumbai. Civic commissioner IS Chalal has instructed all the facilities to take a stock of oxygen supply, medicine stock, manpower among other things in order to be ready if the number of hospitalisation rises. In a review meeting held on August 30, Chahal said all hospitals and jumbo facilities must conduct a thorough review of equipment, medicines and manpower that will be required if Covid cases surge further. He also said that all hospitals equipped with oxygen facilities should ensure that oxygen supply is connected to every bed that is designated as oxygen bed. Mumbai had seen a considerable dip in cases in mid-August. The city had been reporting less than 300 cases till August 29 when the number of cases jumped to 391. Earlier on August 16 daily cases stood at 195 and 196 on August 17. On Wednesday, cases jumped further to 415, and on Thursday the number stood at 440, worrying civic officials. “We have to be on alert in terms of identifying red flags and acting on them promptly,” said Dr Maharudra Kumbhar, officer on special duty at SevenHills Hospital who was a part of the review meeting. The 1,850-bed SevenHills Hospital currently has 40% occupancy. The hospital has used the past few weeks to train and re-train hospital staff in identifying red flags in patients who might deteriorate, treating paediatric patients and overall infection control. “The focus will be on reducing fatality,” said Kumbhar. Private hospitals to hold a meeting Doctors said many activities have resumed in the city which led to the surge in Covid cases. “But in case the numbers go up drastically, there should not be any shortage for our end,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali from Bombay Hospital who represented private hospitals in the review meeting. “All hospitals will be reviewing their situation in terms of oxygen and availability of drugs such as remdesivir, tocilizumab etc. The newer monoclonal antibody drugs will also be kept ready,” he said, adding that chief executive officers of all private hospitals would meet this week to discuss preparedness. Experts have said children may be highly vulnerable in the third wave as they are among the unvaccinated population. According to Bhansali, private hospitals are also likely to have internal paediatric committees to have seamless protocols to treat children. Good contact-tracing and use of masks are crucial in controlling the potential surge in new cases. Chahal has also mandated that any building with more than five Covid-positive patients should be sealed and all residents must undergo testing. Entry of outsiders and exit of residents from such buildings will be strictly prohibited. Civic officials and police will also be vigilant and stringent about wearing masks in public areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-asks-hospitals-jumbo-facilities-to-be-ready-for-third-covid-wave-101630611254870.html

The accused, Gurjit Singh of Talwandi Nauabad village, took the teenager to Ratia city in Haryana’s Fatehabad district and raped her for three days, after which he dropped her at Mullanpur Dakha in Ludhiana and fled. The victim, who lives in the same village as the accused with her mother and siblings, is a Class-9 student. Her father had passed away five years ago. She had come in contact with Gurjit on a social networking site and had established physical relations with him twice. On August 29, Gurjit came to her house and took her with him on the pretext of marriage. He took the minor to his maternal uncle’s house in Haryana and brought her back three days later on September 1. Sub-inspector Rupinder Kaur said that a case had been registered under Sections 376 (sexual assault) of the Indian Penal Code, and sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

The assurance came in response to an application by Navlakha seeking medical examination of a lump in his chest and urging that he be placed under house arrest in view of his advanced age and medical condition. The HC asked the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing the case, and state prison department to reply to the application and posted it for further hearing on September 27. During the course of the hearing, the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar was informed by advocate Dr Yug Choudhry, for Navlakha, that his client had developed a lump in his chest which needed to be examined urgently. Choudhry further said there was a history of cancer in Navlakha’s family and hence there was an apprehension that the lump could be malignant. He added that as Navlakha’s sister was working at Jaslok Hospital, he desired to be examined there.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, for NIA, said while there was no opposition to taking a prisoner for treatment, it opposed Navlakha’s request to be examined at a hospital of his choice. Singh said Navlakha could be taken to a government hospital like Tata Memorial Centre which specialises in cancer treatment.Terming NIA’s objection as vindictive, Chaudhry told the court that Navlakha would visit the hospital at his own expense and there would be no financial burden on the state.The bench than asked Choudhry whether there was a mention of Jaslok Hospital in the application, to which Choudhry replied in the negative and accepted the offer of taking Navlakha to Tata Memorial Centre, saying he could not delay examination of the lump which could possibly be cancer.Thereafter the state confirmed referring Navlakha to the centre on Friday.In his petition, Navlakha has sought shifting him from judicial custody to house arrest on the grounds that he has an unblemished public service record and no criminal antecedents. He has also referred to his house arrest for 35 days prior to being brought to Taloja jail and stated the investigation had not been prejudiced in that period. Navlakha also said he was being denied basic medical facilities and other necessities in Taloja Central Prison and hence, was suffering hardships at his advanced age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-gautam-navlakha-to-be-examined-at-tata-memorial-centre-101630611074682.html

The beautification project included cleaning of the beach, removing encroachments of parked heavy vehicles and hutments, filling up the beach with up to five feet of sand as which was lost due to soil erosion, planting of trees, setting up pavements, garden furniture, a play area for children, and a 30-metre high viewing tower for tourists, that gives a panoramic view of the Arabian sea and the Bandra Worli sea link.The project cost Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) ₹4 crore and was undertaken at the ward level, by the G-North ward, that has jurisdiction over this area.Before the BMC undertook the beautification project, the Mahim beach was defaced with piles of garbage, broken retaining walls around the beach, and unauthorised parking of heavy vehicles. The BMC evicted the hutments, and provided alternate homes to five families. To make up for sand lost due to coastal erosion, the BMC used sand generated from the construction work of the coastal road project, and filled up the beach up to 5 feet. It reinstated the retaining wall, which has now been painted with images depicting the culture of Mumbai. The BMC has also installed a mural, depicting trees in the palm of hands, to convey the message of environment protection and conservation, the civic body said in a statement on Thursday.As part of the tree plantation drive, 200 saplings of Suru tree which contribute to reducing wind speed have been planted, 300 saplings of bamboo, and 550 other seedlings have been planted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-beautified-mahim-beach-now-open-for-tourists-101630611015963.html

Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh, Majithia, accompanied by party MLA NK Sharma, said the disruptive conspiracies were being hatched to postpone the assembly elections in the state and to defame the farmers’ movement. Senior farmer leaders were also wary of this conspiracy and that was why they had given clear-cut directions to take only BJP leaders to the task and not disrupt programmes of any political party in Punjab, he added. “The Samyukt Kisan Morcha has made it clear that protests against any other party except the BJP would only serve to help the central government and would harm the cause of the farmers,” said Majithia.

Paper and other recyclables (including metal) make up 3%, while another 3% is made up of plastic.Though audience members were not permitted to take part in the public consultation, expert invitees in the field of waste management emphasised on the need for improving the existing waste management system in Mumbai. Swati Sambyal, a waste management specialist with United Nations (UN) Habitat, stressed that BMC needs to move away from the current system that is oriented toward disposal and incineration of waste, and find ways to ‘mainstream source segregation’.“We also need much better data management so that patterns of consumption and generation across income groups are brought out. This will help us plan for better collection and transportation, and also bring about a traceability of waste,” Sambyal said, adding that the waste-to-energy models should not be considered as part of MCAP.Other experts, such as Jyoti Mhapsekar of Sri Mukti Morcha, stressed on the need to include the informal sector while proposing solutions for waste management in the city, and also said that there is a large knowledge gap which needs to be addressed.“In my experience, ward officers themselves do not know what the overarching policies are. We have Central laws, but they need to be shaped into local-level guidelines for officials and citizens to understand in their own contexts,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bmc-kicks-off-public-consultations-for-mumbai-climate-action-plan-101630610955948.html
03-09-2021||Chandigarh||NIA team likely to reach Tarn Taran today to probe grenade seizure case||A team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) is likely to reach Tarn Taran on Friday to start probe into the case of recovery of two hand grenades from a man on August 30, a senior Punjab Police official said. Saroop Singh of Johal Dhai Wala village in Khadoor Sahib sub-division was arrested with two China-made hand grenades on the outskirts of Kakka Kandiala village, 4km from the district headquarters. Saroop had identified some locations in Amritsar and Ludhiana to execute terror attacks at the instance of his Germany-based handler, the police have claimed. A video of training module sent by his foreign handler explaining how to successfully explode a grenade was also recovered from the suspect’s mobile phone. “We have identified the Germany-based handler who transferred nearly ₹50,000 to Saroop through Western Union via two transactions for carrying out an attack at some location in Ludhiana,” said an official.Saroop Singh, who is on a seven-day police remand, has been lodged in a joint interrogation centre where various agencies are questioning him. The accused, the official said, came in contact with his German-based handler through social media a few months ago. “He was easily radicalised as he was a soft target being unemployed. Our teams are working to ascertain all linkages of the foreign handler,” he added. “We have got verbal information from the NIA and an order in this regard is likely to be received on Friday,” the police official added. The central agency is likely to take over the case from Monday when remand of the accused will come to an end. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) OS Ghumman, however, said they have not received any order so far on the NIA taking over the case. Saroop, who earlier worked a truck driver and is unmarried, lived with his mother and elder brother, a former armyman. His father died 13 years ago. The police said Saroop had sold his portion of the land to his brother a few years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nia-team-likely-to-reach-tarn-taran-today-to-probe-grenade-seizure-case-101630610954918.html
03-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: AAP faction holding meets pressing on Kejriwal to declare Mann as CM face||A faction of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has started holding meetings, particularly in Sangrur and Barnala districts, pressing on party’s national convener Arvind Kejriwal to announce state unit president Bhagwant Mann as chief ministerial candidate for the 2022 assembly elections. Though Mann is not saying anything on the issue, the move is being seen as a pressure-building tactic on the party high command by many. On Thursday, Kotkapura MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan and singer-turned-AAP leader Balkar Sidhu met Mann at his Sangrur residence. Also, the party volunteers, who had come to meet the Sangrur MP, raised slogans in his favour as the CM candidate. Sandhwan said Mann was fighting a relentless battle against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the corporate houses. “Kejriwal and the parliamentary affairs committee will take a call on this and our CM candidate will be announced before the Congress,” he added.Party’s Mehal Kalan MLA Kulwant Singh Pandori also held a meeting with workers in his constituency and appealed to Kejriwal to announce Mann as CM face. At Lehra, AAP workers held a meeting and asked the party high command not to delay announcing of Mann as the CM face. On Wednesday, over 300 workers held a meeting in Barnala raising a similar demand.“We held a meeting and demanded that Mann should be announced as CM face because he built the party in Punjab and worked hard to serve the state,” said Shishpal Anand who organised the meeting at Lehra.Baljit Singh, who is party ticket aspirant from the Barnala segment, said, “We have been working with the party for a long time. Bhagwant Mann is the first choice of volunteers.”Jagwinder Singh, who reached to meet Mann from Dharampura of Mansa, said, “There is a key issue in Punjab about who will be CM face of AAP. Those who wanted change in Punjab have a single hope from AAP and Bhagwant Mann. Everyone believes one person who can defeat the Badals, Capt Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu. That is Mann” Barnala MLA Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer said the party realised the CM face should be declared in advance. “The AAP will announce CM face on appropriate time,” added the Barnala MLA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-aap-faction-holding-meets-pressing-on-kejriwal-to-declare-mann-as-cm-face-101630610895894.html

The central agency, meanwhile, sought adjournment of the hearing for two weeks, which the court allowed. Thereafter the court said it was an issue between CBI and state, and hence should be resolved among themselves rather than coming to the court. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing the application by CBI seeking directions to the state to handover documents pertaining to its probe in the April 21 FIR, was informed by senior advocate Rafiq Dada that as per the assurances given by the state in the previous hearing, documents sought by the central agency had been handed over to them. Dada further informed the court that he had received a letter from CBI dated August 31 and would require time to go through it and added that if what was being sought by CBI was covered by the undertaking given by the state, they would hand it over as well. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for CBI informed the court that they had received some documents from the state government but requested the bench to keep the application pending for two weeks so that CBI was able to ascertain whether the order of the bench was complied with or not. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that the investigation into the FIR filed by CBI on April 21 was their exclusive jurisdiction and as the state had given the documents, CBI will have to check whether they are the proper documents, the court cannot intervene further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rashmi-shukla-report-documents-handed-over-to-cbi-maharashtra-tells-hc-101630610894546.html

The Ayodhya airport project was stuck due to opposition by locals of Dharampur Sahadat and Janaura villages, who were not willing to hand over their land to the state government . But after 107 families of the two villages agreed to relocate, the administration allotted them alternate land within the limits of the Ayodhya Municipal Corporation. These families will construct houses on this land with money made available under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. After consent of these families, the Ayodhya administration also asked the state government to release fund for house construction under the PM Awas Yojana. “The state government has approved the proposal for extending benefits under the Pradhan Mantra Awas Yojana to 107 families who will be relocated for the airport project,” said Anuj Jha, district magistrate, Ayodhya. “After the villagers agreed to relocate, alternate land was allotted to them within the limits of the Ayodhya Municipal Corporation,” added Jha. According to the Ayodhya administration, ₹2.5 lakh will be given to each family for constructing a house. In the next 20-25 days, the first instalment of ₹50,000 would be transferred into to their bank accounts, while the second instalment of ₹1.5 lakh would be released after the foundation work of the house was complete, added the official. The third instalment of ₹50,000 would be released at the time of completion of construction work of the house. Families relocated for the airport project will also get benefits of various other schemes of the state government. According to the state government, ₹1001.77 crore has been approved for the purchase of 555.66 acres land for the construction of the airport. A budgetary provision of ₹101 crore has also been proposed for development work at the airport in the state’s budget 2021-22.

03-09-2021||Mumbai||12 MLCs’ list: Has Maharashtra govt replaced Raju Shetti?||The ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), led by Uddhav Thackeray, is said to have requested Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to replace one of the names from among the list of 12 people who were recommended for appointment as members of the legislative council (MLC). MVA has submitted a fresh list to the governor with one change. A delegation of MVA leaders headed by the chief minister (CM), along with deputy CM Ajit Pawar (Nationalist Congress Party) and state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat (Congress), met the governor on Wednesday evening.Speculations are doing rounds that they have requested him to remove farmer leader Raju Shetti’s name from the list. Shetti is a former parliamentarian and heads political outfit Swabhimani Paksha. His name was recommended from NCP’s quota but the party is reportedly upset with him over his stand taken against MVA government.The name of the nominee to replace Shetti has been kept under wraps.The appointment of 12 MLCs has become a major friction point between Koshyari and the three-party coalition government. The state cabinet had approved the names last November, but they are yet to be appointed.On Thursday, Pawar said according to new information, a person, who was defeated in a recently held election, cannot be nominated for the Upper House, so they are verifying the same.“Some people said no person can be nominated if they are defeated in the election held recently. One can remember that after senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Arun Jaitely lost the 2014 general polls, he was made a member of Rajya Sabha but not from President’s quota,” the deputy CM said.“If there is any issue in appointing any of the 12 names recommended by the government, then the CM will take a decision,” he said.NCP insiders said the party is upset with Shetti as he is planning to contest Lok Sabha from Hathkanangale constituency with the help of BJP in 2024. “He had recently held a meeting in Walwa area (under Islampur Assembly constituency in Sangli district) from where state NCP president Jayant Patil is an MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly). The meeting was attended by Patil’s political rivals,” said an NCP leader.Currently, Shetti is staging an agitation against MVA government, demanding relief to the flood-hit people from Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli districts.When asked, Shetti said MVA was not doing him any favour by nominating his name and now he does not bother about the outcome of the governor’s decision. “No one has done a favour by nominating my name to the legislative Council. It was a part of an agreement between NCP and Swabhimani Paksha ahead of the general polls 2019. In a meeting in Delhi that was also attended by NCP chief Sharad Pawar, we have had agreed that Congress will leave one seat for Swabhimani Paksha and Hathkanangale will remain with my party, as I contest polls from there, while NCP will nominate a leader from Swabhimani Paksha to the legislative Council,” Shetti told reporters.“I have never followed up on the appointment and now I’m not interested. The governor is free to nominate whoever he wishes to. At present, I am fighting to provide relief to the flood-affected people and will not stop until it is done,” he added.The list submitted to the governor included the names of Vijay Karanjkar, Urmila Matondkar, Nitin Bangude-Patil and Chandrakant Raghuvanshi from the Shiv Sena; Eknath Khadse, Raju Shetti, Yashpal Bhinge and Anand Shinde from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP); and Rajni Patil, Sachin Sawant, Anniruddha Vankar and Muzaffar Hussain from the Congress.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said they expect that Koshyari will clear the nomination of the 12 members to the Council soon. Raut added that the file is with the governor for eight months, suggesting that there is pressure on him not to clear it.He said the visuals of the meeting showed that Koshyari and the three MVA leaders were in a “cheerful” mood and that the governor should show “positive” intent through action now. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Raut said all MVA leaders said the governor is positive and very soon the 12 nominations will be cleared.“Whether the governor will take a decision after this meeting or not will be known by his action. The governor has to merely clear the file on the decision made by the cabinet. If there is any political pressure on him then he must clearly say that he cannot do it,” said Raut.The Sena MP added, “The governor has not cleared the file for the last eight months because there is definitely pressure on him. They [the 12 nominees] aren’t goons or criminals or trained by the Taliban. They are people who have worked in the fields of social, education, arts, etc. How can you deny them their rights only because of political pressure? But looking at yesterday’s meeting, I think, soon, there will be a positive move.”MVA government and Raj Bhavan have been at loggerheads on several issues, including the nomination of the 12 people recommended by the state cabinet. Raut said Maharashtra does not have a “tradition of political conflict between government and Raj Bhavan”. Putting onus on the Raj Bhavan he asked why a conflict emerged on this issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/12-mlcs-list-has-maharashtra-govt-replaced-raju-shetti-101630609874331.html

The complaint in the matter was lodged by a member of the “gondhali” community. The complainant divorced his wife in 2018 due to personal issues between them. However, the couple did not include the jaat panchayat, which operates like an extra-judicial community court, in the process. The complainant has lodged a plaint saying his family has been socially outcast for not consulting with the panchayat. Among those booked in the case are four are the heads of the panchayat and are immediate family members of each other, the others act as panch in the system. The law that came into effect in 2016 in Maharashtra makes it illegal to hold and issue community decrees to boycott anyone from the community. Multiple other cases have been registered in the past against jaat panchayats of other communities. In some cases, the panch ask for money in order to solve familial issues. A case under Section 120(b) (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code along with Sections 5 and 6 of the Maharashtra Protection of People from Social Boycott (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2016 was registered at Wakad police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/case-against-jaat-panchayat-for-social-boycott-of-family-101630609633695.html

While the dates were tentatively announced by state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant last month, no official circular has been released to confirm the dates on the official CET cell website as on Thursday evening.“After the initial verbal announcement last month, no official confirmation about the exam dates has been made. The CET website has no new circular, and even the office number is of no help,” said Anirudh Nair, an MH-CET applicant. Nair, like many other students from Maharashtra, recently appeared for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Mains) and is preparing for MH-CET as well as JEE-Advanced exam, both scheduled to take place in the next couple of weeks.The state government recently announced that CET exams will take place in two phases this year – September 4-10 and September 14-20. Between these two phases, however, students have also pointed that the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) is scheduled to take place on September 12, while the entrance exam for the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is scheduled to take place on September 7, 8 and 13. Earlier this month, a representation of parents and students approached Samant seeking postponement of MH-CET. “Around the same time, Class 12 students from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CET exams ) also have their class improvement exam which is scheduled to take place between August 25 and September 15. If CET isn’t rescheduled, either students will be under a lot of stress to appear for all exams or they’ll end up dropping one or two of the exams, which is unfair,” said a student.As per figures revealed by the CET cell in June, registrations for the exam dropped from 500,000 last year to 430,000 this year. For years now, engineering faculties have been attracting fewer students and the fall in registrations could be due to the same reason, say experts. “A growing number of students are facing financial strain due to job losses in their family, and with the pandemic still very much in place, there’s a good chance that students are not applying for courses due to financial difficulties,” said the principal of an engineering institute in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2-days-before-exam-slated-to-begin-maharashtra-cet-aspirants-await-circular-details-101630609575237.html

After the ongoing booth verification campaign, which saw UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev and other senior state leaders personally visiting various booths to verify booth committees, the BJP would launch a mega membership campaign aimed at adding more voters to the party, BJP leaders said.“Various party activities have been delayed due to the demise of Kalyan Singh ji. Then President Ram Nath Kovind’s four-day visit also kept chief minister Yogi Adityanath ji and other senior leaders engaged. Now, both the party and the government would be launching various campaigns,” a BJP leader said.The membership campaign would be carried out at the booth-level and is also aimed at connecting with influential local leaders from other parties. “There are local leaders in various parties who may not be that well known outside their ward or city but have local connect. We will try and reach out to them too,” a BJP leader said.A few days back, the BJP got former BSP coordinator Ajit Balyan from Aligarh and All India Congress Committee member Ajay Shanker Dwivedi from Jaunpur to join the party.“There are others too whom the BJP has been getting from other parties,” said a party leader indicating towards the likes of Priti Tiwari, former women wing chief of UP Congress and Murli Manohar Jaiswal, the former BSP candidate from Barhaj in Deoria. “We welcome all to the BJP where the respect of each and every one of you is assured,” UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev said.“On Wednesday, the Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav said in Hardoi that everyone was welcome in his party. We too are doing the same thing. The difference is that while the SP leader is trying to send out a subtle message to leaders of other parties to join his party, we are assuring those who have come to us get respect,” a BJP leader said while claiming that several leaders from various parties were in touch with BJP.“This is an interesting game of political one-upmanship being played out between two parties in UP. We recently saw how UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev met Mulayam Singh, the Samajwadi Party founder and patron, ostensibly to invite him to the memorial meet for Kalyan Singh and Mulayam Singh ji cleverly made a statement urging the state BJP chief to join BJP,” said veteran journalist Irshad Ilmi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/eying-influential-local-leaders-bjp-to-launch-membership-drive-101630609574185.html

After this, he filed the complaint before the consumer court. The forum relied on a Supreme Court judgement in which it has been stated that an institute can collect fees for one semester or one year at a time. However, FIITJEE had taken fees for two years. The consumer forum consisting of members Anil Javalekar , Shubhangi Dunakhe and President J V Deshmukh has ordered FIITJEE Limited to refund ₹36,738.50 with 8% interest since 28 July 2016.

Corporators across party lines demanded that CCTV cameras be mandatorily installed for every new flyover. The y also questioned the administration over the quality of the work done and slammed BMC for opening it without proper work. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator and group leader in the standing committee Prabhakar Shinde said, “Last month, the flyover was inaugurated by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. During the inaugural address, CM had asked BMC officials to work on the surface of the flyover. Despite this, it seems the work was not done, due to which accidents were reported.”“Even after the flyover was opened for traffic, the flyover was started only for light vehicles and did not allow heavy vehicles to ply. Why was there a rush to open the bridge when it’s not yet capable of carrying heavy vehicles? BMC ready to take action against the contractor responsible for this,” Shinde added. Meanwhile, Congress corporator and standing committee member Asif Zakaria said, “All political parties have raised the issue regarding the flyover, and we have been assured that a discussion will be conducted on it the next week.”The reactions came in the backdrop of BMC’s announcement to conduct maintenance work on the flyover, which has affected traffic movement on the stretch. BMC has decided to install CCTV cameras, additional speed bumpers and rumblers as well as to make the surface rough.On Wednesday, BMC shut the north side lane that led to stopping the traffic from Ghatkopar to Mankhurd to conduct maintenance work, which is expected to continue for five days. Those heading to Navi Mumbai as well as to south Mumbai and the eastern suburbs will have to use the Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road that will result in traffic snarls.The civic body faced uproar over several accidents on the flyover, including the death of Yusuf Khan, who lost his life after his bike skidded on the stretch. The 2.9-km flyover, constructed by BMC for ₹713 crore, was opened on August 1, three years after its deadline and a cost escalation of over ₹300 crore. The flyover helps cut the travel time for motorists heading towards Navi Mumbai from Ghatkopar as the link road sees heavy traffic, especially at Baiganwadi Junction in Shivaji Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-corporators-slam-bmc-over-ghatkopar-flyover-101630609274380.html

03-09-2021||Lucknow||469 children in Lucknow lost either one or both parents to Covid||LUCKNOW As many as 469 children lost either one or both parents to Covid in the state capital during the second wave of the pandemic and the count is expected to touch the 600 mark, said officials with Women and Child Welfare Department (WCD) that has been assigned with the task of rehabilitating such children. “The pandemic situation has been tough for all. But it was tougher for the children. So far, we have recorded around 469 such children from Lucknow district who got affected in the pandemic,” said Vikas Singh, district probation officer (DPO), while going through the list of pandemic-affected children. Of these 469 children, 19 were orphaned and remaining lost one of their parents, he said.“As of now, we have registered around 419 such children while the paperwork of another 50 is in progress. We expect around 100 more such cases,” said Singh. He said once the enrolment is done, then comes the rehabilitation part that is being done through WCD’s ‘Bal Seva Yojna’. Under the scheme, the department has also announced ₹1,01,000 for female beneficiaries at the time of marriage and tablet/laptop to affected children (enrolled in Class 9 or above, less than 18 years of age). Antigen report, positive RT-PCR report, blood report and CT scan would be considered as a proof of death due to Covid. Cases where the patient tested negative and succumbed to post-Covid complications would also be considered, he said. Highlighting the requirements for enrolment, he said the beneficiary should be a citizen of UP (whose parents died either on March 1, 2020 or after). The scheme would also help children who lost one parent to Covid and whose family income is less than ₹2 lakh. Under the scheme, a beneficiary in 0-10 age group would be given ₹4,000 per month, provided the beneficiary is enrolled in a recognised school. In case a beneficiary is an orphan, the child welfare committee would ensure enrolment in class 6 to 12 in Kasturba Gandhi Awasiya Vidyalay. NGOs and experts on the subject said apart from focusing on children in urban areas, children in rural pockets are more vulnerable. “There is a need for the department to strengthen the system in remote areas. Despite many welfare schemes, benefits are yet to reach beneficiaries. There is a need to sensitise newly elected pradhans that there is also need to identify vulnerable Covid affected children,” said Rajesh Mani, director Manav Sewa Samiti, an NGO working on cross-border child trafficking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/469-children-in-lucknow-lost-either-one-or-both-parents-to-covid-101630608974647.html

The directorate has written to district officials in this regard on Thursday. All schools across Uttar Pradesh (UP) have opened for students of classes 1 to 5 began from September 1. School for students of classes 6 to 12 began in August. In his letter, Ganesh Kumar, joint education director (basic) has asked all basic shiksha adhikaris (BSAs) in UP, to ensure that teachers and staff of schools are fully vaccinated. The BSAs have also been asked to ensure vaccination of parents of school going children too. Some officials claimed that a vast majority of teachers in both government and private schools have received at least one dose of vaccine and about half of them have also their second dose. “It must be ensured that in all government and aided primary and upper primary school teachers, officials, staff and their family members are completely vaccinated,” Kumar’s missive stated. The BSAs have also been advised to contact the chief medical officers (CMOs) of their district and, if needed, organise vaccination camps for teachers and staff. The BSAs have ordered to submit the details of vaccination to education directorate. Some officials said the primary and upper primary schools across the government have registered 25 to 60% attendance of children after resumption of normal teaching on school campuses. Simultaneously, online teaching too has continued to ensure social distancing in classrooms. Officials believe after ensuring full vaccination of teachers and staff, the student attendance on school campuses would go up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ensure-full-vaccination-of-teachers-school-staff-uttar-pradesh-education-directorate-to-bsas-101630608915509.html
03-09-2021||Mumbai||BMC panel nod for extending Kora Kendra flyover till Mumbai’s WEH||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s standing committee on Thursday approved a proposal for extending the flyover at Kora Kendra in Borivli. The decision will lead to an increase in the project cost from ₹160 crore to around ₹650 crore.The proposal of that will lead to over 300% cost escalation was brought in the standing committee for the third time on Thursday, when it was passed unopposed. Earlier, all political parties had opposed the proposal, citing that clear details were not given giving justification for the cost escalation.Currently, a 970-metre flyover is being constructed between Kora Kendra Junction on SV Road and Link Road, for which the work had started by the end of 2018. However, BMC now plans an extension of the flyover up to the Western Express Highway (WEH) to decongest Borivli’s arterial roads.According to the plan, motorists coming from Link Road will be able to skip the Kora Kendra Junction on SV Road as they will directly be able to head to WEH via a set of two flyovers. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator and standing committee member Bhalchandra Shirsat said, “The proposal was passed in the standing committee on Thursday. All political parties agreed for passing the extension proposal as the administration submitted proper details. We had made it clear earlier itself that we are not against development but had opposed the manner in which the process was not being followed.”Meanwhile, BMC said the cost shot up after it made technical changes in the construction. It said the escalation is not only due to extension but also because the guidelines for load bearing have been changed, mandating additional safety measures to be taken. In its justification submitted to the standing committee, BMC said, “Despite a cost escalation of ₹490 crore, BMC will save around ₹63 crore, considering it has not tendered the additional works, but allotted the construction to the existing contractor working on the 970-metre flyover.” BMC said the current contractor has shown intention in doing the work on old rates that will help the corporation save around ₹63 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-panel-nod-for-extending-kora-kendra-flyover-till-mumbai-s-weh-101630608914377.html

The report card was prepared by Parivartan based on responses received from all 15 ward offices of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) under the Right to Information (RTI) Act and on information shared by the municipal commissioner.Tanmay Kanitkar, co-founder of Parivartan, said, “Earlier, benches were a favourite among elected members but during this term, corporators have given priority to distributing jute- and cloth- bags. It is interesting to see where they distributed all these bags.”“Ward-level funds are typically meant for prioritising citizens’ work. There is a provision in law to call a sabha (citizens’ meeting), place the facts before it and take suggestions. Despite follow-ups however, no such meeting was called. It shows that the demand for jute bags is not from the citizens but the elected members have taken the initiative on their own,” Kanitkar said.A majority of corporators also spent the maximum funds on repairing or replacing drainage lines in their wards. A former elected member said, “If the roads get dug up, there are drainage pipes all over the city. It is the easiest way to indulge in corruption as there is no auditing it. Looking at the pattern of spending on drainage works, for the last two to three decades, drainage work is right at the top of the list every year.”Another elected member pointed out that recently, a question was raised in the general body meeting as to why there were only chambers set up in Bhavani peth. “There were no drainage lines but only chambers. Instead of laying drainage lines, only chambers had been set up everywhere and charges were being recovered for laying the drainage lines,” the corporator said on condition of anonymity.As per the report card prepared by Parivartan, this trend was common among elected members from all parties.Indraneel Sadalage, president, Parivartan, said, “There is a need to carry out a social audit whether the work was really carried out on ground or not.”“Parivartan prepared the first report card in 2012 and the intention was to help voters understand their elected representatives and help them choose the right candidate. We also prepare the report cards of MPs and MLAs,” he said.How elected members utilised the ward development fundElected members’ attendance in general body meetingsAsking questions to administration is the key to keeping control; written questions raised by elected members in the general body meetingCriminal background of members but Parivartan did not get this data||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parivartan-report-card-jute-bag-distribution-top-priority-of-elected-leaders-101630608734782.html
03-09-2021||Other||AIMIM to launch UP assembly poll campaign from Ayodhya on Sept 7||Lucknow: All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi will launch the 2022 assembly election campaign from Ayodhya district with ‘vanchit-shoshit samaj’ (deprived and victimized communities) conference on September 7. Along with Muslims, dalits, backwards and upper caste Hindus have also been invited to the conference. “Not only Muslims but other communities too have been harassed and exploited by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the centre and in Uttar Pradesh. The AIMIM has decided to fight for the rights of the people suppressed by the BJP government by organizing a series of ‘vanchit-shoshit samaj’ conferences across Uttar Pradesh,” said AIMIM state unit president Shaukat Ali. On September 7, the AIMIM chief will address a ‘vanchit-shoshit’ conference in Rudauli area of Ayodhya district. The next day he will address the conference in Sultanpur and on September 9 in Barabanki. The AIMIM was not only fighting for the rights of the Muslims but all the communities victimized under the BJP government, Shaukat Ali said. In UP, Muslims, dalits, backwards and even upper caste people had realized that the BJP, the Samajwadi Party (SP) , the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress had been using them as a vote bank. The community was looking for an alternative and the AIMIM emerged as a hope and voice of the deprived communities. The AIMIM would call upon the people to support it in the 2022 assembly elections to form a government that worked for the welfare and development of all the communities, he said. The AIMIM has announced to field candidates on 100 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh. It has also joined an alliance of smaller political parties to form Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, which includes Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) led by Om Prakash Rajbhar, Jan Adhikar Party led by Babu Singh Kushwaha, Rashtriya Uday Party led by Babu Rampal, Rashtriya Upekshit Samaj Party led by Premchanda Prajapati and Janata Kranti Party led by Anil Singh Chauhan. The Morcha has invited the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bhim Army to join the pre-poll alliance. Earlier in July, Owaisi’s visit to Bahraich to pay obeisance to medieval Ghaznavid general Ghazi Salar Masud alias Ghazi Miya had triggered a war of words between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and leaders of Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha constituents. Shaukat Ali said the AIMIM had launched a movement for cleanliness in Bahraich, especially in the dargah area. A large number of pilgrims from across the country and abroad visited Bahraich to pay their obeisance at the dargah. The street leading to the dargah was full of filth and garbage. The fear of outbreak of diseases loomed large but the district administration had not launched a sanitation drive. The AIMIM would launch a protest if the district administration failed to clean the area, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aimim-to-launch-up-assembly-poll-campaign-from-ayodhya-on-sept-7-101630608616297.html
03-09-2021||Mumbai||Since 2019, Maharashtra spent ₹ 14K-crore as compensation for extreme weather events||Since 2019, Maharashtra has paid at least ₹14,000 crore – about 18% of the state’s fiscal deficit for financial year (FY) 2020-21 – as direct compensation to those affected by extreme weather events. This figure was brought out in a presentation made to the state cabinet on Wednesday by the environment department to highlight concerns raised in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) sixth assessment report released last month. The number is, however, a gross underestimation of the total cost of recent climate disasters in the state, officials and experts pointed out.A government official privy to the development, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The numbers presented to the state cabinet are an overview of the most prominent disasters since 2019, such as Cyclones Kyarr, Nisarga and Tauktae, last year’s floods in Vidarbha and the recent Konkan floods. An amount of ₹14,000 crore was the outlay in compensation that was directly paid toward the rehabilitation of affected persons. The real cost of the disasters is of course much higher because a lot of money has to also be allocated toward infrastructure repairs.”Last year alone, Maharashtra paid about ₹5,500 crore as compensation for extreme weather events, including hail storms, unseasonal rainfall, extended monsoon rainfall, cyclone, heat waves, lightning and cold waves, data obtained from the state disaster management authority and the environment and the climate change department has revealed.Most of this amount was disbursed to farmers for agricultural damages – losses of property and crops – after a delay in withdrawal of monsoon led to unseasonal heavy rainfall and damage of harvested crops such as cotton, sugarcane, gram and several fruit harvests. Official data shows that agricultural damage was witnessed over 700,000 hectares across 10 districts in central and western Maharashtra, and almost 89,000 hectares across 36 talukas in the Vidarbha region.But Maharashtra’s total cost incurred due to climate disasters for the year 2020 alone comes to a total of ₹13,000 crore, which includes at least another ₹4,000 crore spent toward fixing damaged roads, reinstating water supplies, refurbishing damaged power infrastructure and various other urban and rural infrastructure fixes, along with ex gratia payments made to victims of heat waves, cold waves and lightning strikes.It also includes at least ₹568 crore that was spent on disaster relief after Cyclone Nisarga hit last June, along with about ₹912 crore that was spent on stormwater drains and flood mitigation projects in Mumbai alone. The Mumbai civic body also spent an additional ₹36 crore for building water-holding structures under the sponge city master plan, disaster management data shows.This year, the state government has paid compensation of at least ₹227 crore directly to the victims of Cyclone Tauktae and Konkan floods, but the total cost of climate disasters in the ongoing calendar year is likely to be in excess of ₹11,500 crore (which is the strength of the relief package announced by the Maharashtra on August 2). “We will have to wait and see how things pan out over the rest of the year. If there are unseasonal rains in October again and crop harvesting is affected, the total cost of climate related disasters will be higher than in 2020,” said the government official quoted above.Even though experts were alarmed at the scale of these losses, they emphasized that the real cost of climate change-induced disasters are intangible. “The government of Maharashtra, which at the very least is cognizant of emerging climate science, may have allotted ₹11,500 as relief to flood victims, but that will only make up for calculable losses and provide relief to the poorest of the poor. That compensation is necessary of course, but try and imagine for a second the larger economic losses that are incurred when hundreds of thousands of people cannot make it to work for a few days, and when thousands of businesses are forced to remain shut because of flooding. It is exponential when compared to the losses we calculate. The cost of our inaction against climate change will only increase unless we first learn to adapt to these emerging trends of extreme weather,” said Dr Anjal Prakash, research director at the Indian School of Business (ISB), and a lead author of the ongoing 6th Assessment Report of IPCC (where he is involved in the chapter on cities, settlements and key infrastructure).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/since-2019-maharashtra-spent-14k-crore-as-compensation-for-extreme-weather-events-101630608614248.html

Turns out the volunteers were satisfied with some arrangements even as they gave suggestions to modify others to make the metro more PWD-friendly.Hemant Sonwane, general manager of Maha Metro – Pune Metro, said, “The visit was to give them a first-hand look at the metro station and it is obvious that the station has all the facilities for the specially-abled. A wheelchair-bound person can easily board a train without anybody’s help. All facilities have been provided.”Whereas orthopaedically challenged Diksha Dinde, a national youth awardee who works on accessibility and inclusive education for PWDs, said, “It was very good initiative by the Pune Metro to invite all specially-abled people to visit and give their suggestions.”“I found my wheelchair stuck in the gap between the platform and train and that would be problematic for people who are visually impaired as chances are they will not see the gap which could lead to an accident. There is a need for signs inside the metro with big writing as people with low vision find it difficult to read small fonts. “The wash rooms were not accessible and should be built in such a way that a wheelchair can go inside. “There should also be supporting bars inside that will benefit the specially-abled,” Dinde said.Anita Iyer - accessibility, diversity and inclusion consultant and disability rights’ advocate and founder of the Ekansh trust – gave a few accessibility suggestions. “The Maha Metro – Pune Metro is taking very good initiatives for PWDs.

03-09-2021||Delhi||JNU teachers, students protest as counterterrorism course gets EC’s nod||The executive council of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Thursday approved a course on counterterrorism, amid protests by teachers and students, even as it gave its nod to other projects, including setting up a medical college and observing Partition Remembrance Day on August 14, in accordance with the central government’s announcement.According to teachers the ‘Counter Terrorism, Asymmetric Conflicts and Strategies for Cooperation among Major Powers’ course — which will be taught to engineering students — had problems with the content and reading list. Student activists called the course ‘Islamophobic’.The course was passed by the Academic Council on August 17.On Wednesday, the university’s vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar said that there was a “needless controversy” over the new counterterrorism course.Kumar said the controversy was being created “without going into the academic merits” of the course.“There is a need to further evolve India’s perspective in a balanced and objective manner. This course has the potential to build a strong narrative for India. An in-depth understanding of various global and regional terrorist networks is a part of the curriculum of this course,” said Kumar.Teachers raised issues during Thursday’s EC meeting on the counterterrorism course. “Courses like these will degrade the standard of the university. No critical scrutiny was allowed on the course even in EC,” said JNU teachers’ association secretary Moushumi Basu.Waseem RS, a member of Fraternity Movement JNU, said “The proposal of the course reflects upon the Islamophobia of JNU administration. The course will create a terrible situation for the Muslim JNU students as it will further the Islamophobic questions they face periodically in JNU,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jnu-teachers-students-protest-as-counterterrorism-course-gets-ec-s-nod-101630608135765.html

Farmers are opposing Centre’s farm laws and have no personal enmity with the CM or other ministers,” said residents of both the villages.On August 18, Khattar and other party leaders had taken part in a public function to felicitate Tokyo Olympics silver medallist Ravi Dahiya at his native Nahri village in Sonepat.Later on the same day, Khattar visited Kurad village in district to felicitate Olympics bronze medallist hockey player Sumit Kumar.Two farm leaders, pleading anonymity, said they will not oppose the CM’s visit to honour the medallists but after that they will continue to lodge protests against the farm laws.“We had not protested his visits to Nahri and Kurad as he was there to honour Ravi and Sumit. And we protested his visit in Karnal last week as it was a party meet. We will continue to not allow him to hold party and government programmes,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wont-oppose-cm-s-visit-to-felicitate-medallists-farm-leaders-101630607954277.html

The officials asked the minors about their whereabouts as they were seen walking on the station premises on Wednesday early morning in suspicious manner. The teenagers said that they have run away from their home. “Their parents were alerted and the boys were handed over to ‘Sathi’, an NGO that works towards finding runway kids. The senior ticket checker Suresh Mishra and Sushil Jha helped the teenagers get back to their family and fall in the trap of anti-social elements,” said Manoj Jhawar, Pune railway division spokesperson. As per the information given by the railways, ticket checkers also observe public movement on the railway station premises. During the night duty at Pune station, Mishra and Jha found the two teenagers at around 3 am without ticket. “Since the Covid outbreak, teenage boys run away from their homes and come to cities like Pune and Mumbai in search of work. They come without informing their parents. Pune Railway Protection Force (RPF) has already formed ‘Savitribai Phule squad’ to identify such children and reunite them with their families. Till now, 235 runaway children were found by the squad in last ten months,” Jhawar said.According to the railway official, the runway kids hail from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Orissa, Goa, Karnataka, Telangana, Rajasthan and even Nepal. While the highest number of children coming from outside state to Pune is from Bihar which is 61.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-railway-ticket-checkers-reunite-two-runaway-teenagers-with-their-family-in-kalyan-101630607903535.html
03-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 4,342 new Covid-19 cases||Maharashtra recorded 4,342 fresh Covid-19 infections, pushing the count to 6,473,674 on Thursday. The tally of active cases reduced to 50,607 as 4,755 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours. The state also saw 55 Covid-19 casualties, taking the toll to 137,551. Ahmednagar reported the highest toll with 14 deaths. It was followed by Satara with nine fatalities.While there are predictions that the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to hit the state this month, the steady rate of daily infections has become a cause for concern for officials. Maharashtra still has over 50,000 active cases and they are hovering between 50,000 and 51,000 for the past week. On August 24, the tally of active cases was 49,752.Meanwhile, the paediatric task force has discussed with the state school education department officials on reopening schools in the state. They want to ensure that schools are fully prepared and physical classes will not lead to a spike in cases.Bachchu Kadu, minister of state for school education, said that the decision on reopening schools would be taken in the next two days. “A meeting in this regard will be held in the next few days. Schools have started in other states of the country and should be started in the state as well. But the decision will have to be taken carefully considering the fact that Maharashtra has the highest number of active cases after Kerala,” Kadu said.Dr Bakul Parekh, a member of the paediatric task force, said, “We also want the schools to be reopened, but with certain precautions as we are concerned about their health. Children are definitely suffering from mental health issues and nutrition and thus schools should be reopened, but in a safe environment. To ensure the same, we have recommended that teaching and non-teaching staff of schools should be vaccinated; there must be proper seating arrangements in the class and one bench should be reserved for one student only.“The schools should divide students in two batches and they should be called for physical classes on alternate days. For example, half the students can be called today and the rest tomorrow and at the same time online classes can also be continued. The sports activities which require close contact should be avoided. Schools can also be started in a staggered manner by allowing some classes now and increasing them later based on the situation and if in case any rise is observed they can be stopped immediately,” he said.Most importantly, classes should be sanitised and there must be a monitoring system in place in all the schools. The school staff should also be trained to deal in case of a medical emergency, added Dr Parekh.Physical classes in schools were shut in Maharashtra from March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the state. On July 12, schools in rural areas were allowed to resume physical classes for Class 8 to 12 students where Covid-19 cases are minimal. Nearly 17,701 schools resumed offline classes in rural areas where Covid-19 cases are on decline, the officials informed.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that the state government planned to fully vaccinate all teaching and non-teaching staff before the reopening of schools. “We have decided that until a decision is taken on school reopening, we will fully vaccinate teaching and non-teaching staff in schools that include all the zilla parishad or government schools and aided and unaided schools,” he said.On August 29, the state health minister Rajesh Tope also said they are working on vaccinating all the teaching and non-teaching by September 5, which will be their first step towards reopening schools in the state.Going by the prediction made by experts, the state government is expecting a rise in Covid-19 cases between September 15 and the first week of October, which could also be the beginning of the third wave.On Wednesday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray during the presentation by the health department on the current Covid-19 situation told his cabinet colleagues that the central government had asked the state to take due precautions during upcoming festivals. He said that the state needs to take care to keep the spread of the Covid-19 under check. The CM is expected to hold a review meeting with the state-appointed task force of doctors and officials from health and other departments in the next few days to discuss the steps in the wake of the possibility of the rise in cases.He will also convene a medical conference with doctors across the state in the wake of the potential third wave on September 5. The state government and the members of the task force will guide the doctors over the precautions and line of treatment during the potential wave.The central government has projected the Covid-19 cases in the third wave to rise to 6 million from 4 million during the second wave, resulting in the oxygen demand to treat patients to rise to 3,500 to 4,000 metric tonnes a day.On Thursday, Mumbai clocked 440 cases and reported a total of 745,010 cases till date. It also recorded three fatalities, taking the toll to 15,984.In the last 24 hours, the state tested 172,579 samples and had a positivity rate of 2.51%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 11.92%, according to the data issued by the state health department.The state also vaccinated 69,909 people on Thursday and has administered a total 60,754,445 doses till date, according to the data available on Co-Win portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-4-342-new-covid-19-cases-101630607897176.html
03-09-2021||Delhi||Gangter’s death in Tihar cell: Delhi high court says injuries point to torture during custody||The Delhi high court on Thursday observed that the nature of injuries on Ankit Gujjar’s body, who was found dead inside his cell at Tihar jail on August 4, clearly suggested that it was case of “custodial violence and torture”.Justice Mukta Gupta, while hearing a plea by Gujjar’s mother who demanded a CBI probe into the alleged murder of her son, said the statements by the eye witnesses given to the police indicated that he was not only beaten, but CCTV was also shut by errant jail officials during the incident.“Nature of injuries clearly show that it’s a case of custodial violence/torture. It’s a very serious matter, how did the CCTV get closed… You see the manner in which the incident has taken place. He (deputy superintendent) not only beats but also gets the CCTV shut down... It’s not simply the case of a departmental enquiry. A life has been lost,” the judge said.The court, while reserving its order on demand for a CBI probe, said the incident involved a larger issue of extortion by jail officials.The post-mortem report describes “haemorrhage because of the cumulative effect of multiple blunt force injuries” as the cause of Gujjar’s death.The gangster’s family have named Tihar deputy superintendent Narendra Meena, three constables, and an assistant superintendent, in the FIR. However, the other accused have not been named in the report. HT has seen the copy of the FIR, in which police have also noted allegations of bribery and extortion by jail officers.According to jail officials, Meena and three others have been suspended a pending magisterial inquiry and police investigation.Deputy superintendent Meena told the investigating officer that they conducted an inspection inside Gujjar’s cell on April 3 afternoon and found a cell phone, data cable, and knife. Meena said Gujjar and two other inmates of the cell number 3 assaulted him and other officials, after which Gujjar was transferred to another cell, and the other two prisoners were sent to a different cell. The jail officers told the investigating officer that between 6am and 6.30am on August 4, when they went to check on Gujjar during the roll-call of inmates, he was found unconscious and was rushed to the jail hospital. Gujjar was declared brought dead by the doctors at the hospital.“The nature of injury clearly shows that it is a case of custodial violence... There is no escape to it. It is writ large that it is a case of custodial violence and who has done it is also very clear,” the judge said.Mehmood Pracha, the counsel for Gujjar’s family, contended that the alleged gangster was being harassed by the jail officials as he was “unable to meet their regularly increasing demands for money” and was murdered “as a part of pre-planned conspiracy”. Pracha argued that the “police was not conducting investigation in proper format” as the digital video recorder of the CCTV installed in the jail was yet to be recovered and the aspect of extortion of money by jail officials was not being probed.Prosecution’s counsel Ranbir Kundu said the investigation by the local police was going on in a fair manner. He sought two weeks to give a complete report on the progress of the investigation.In its status report, the jail administration has stated that four officials, including the Deputy Superintendent, have been suspended and eight others have been shifted from Central Jail No.3 and ordered to report to the Superintendent, PHQ till further orders.Until his arrest in August 2020, Gujjar, 29, was one of western Uttar Pradesh’s most wanted person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gangters-death-in-tihar-cell-delhi-hc-says-nature-of-injures-point-to-custodial-violence-and-torture-101630607784235.html

On the other hand, the board of directors also decided to strike down the proposal seeking an increase in daily fares of PMPML buses for ordinary commuters. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol who attended the meeting said, “We made a representation seeking the slashing of pass rates and also striking down of the daily fare hike. Both our requests were agreed to by the PMPML authorities.”The meeting of the board of directors took place on Thursday and was attended by PMC mayor Mohol, PCMC mayor Mai Dhore, PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne, PCMC standing committee chairman Nitin Landge, PMPML president Laxminarayan Mishra, PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar, PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil, director Prakash Dhore and others.Mohol in his address said that the decision to give concessions to commuters was taken as a majority of citizens must use the PMPML bus transport facility for their daily inter-city and intra-city travel. “The decision has come as a major relief to the common man. While the work of strengthening the PMPML infrastructure is moving at a fast clip, at the same time, efforts are being made to provide relief to passengers. Taking into account the needs of commuters, the directors agreed to a reduction in the fare rate for passes and cancelled the fare hike,” he said.Mohol informed that the proposal for the fare hike was struck down even as solar energy projects will be developed on PMPML lands and sanction for the same has already been given. Also, the board of directors gave their approval for preparation of the ‘feasibility study report’ for the commercial development of PMPML properties and their utilisation for maximum benefit of the civic body. The PMPML board also gave its assent for the preparation of an official report on the issue of conversion of diesel buses operating over the last ten years into electric or CNG ones.Daily pass: Only in single corporation limit Rs40Both the corporations’ limit Rs50Outside corporation limits Rs70Monthly pass: Only in single corporation limit Rs900Both the corporations’ limit Rs1,200Outside corporation limits Rs1,400||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmpml-no-hike-in-fare-daily-and-monthly-passes-to-be-cheaper-101630607653507.html
03-09-2021||Delhi||Police probe in a Delhi riots case a ‘colossal waste of taxpayer’s money’: Court observes||A Delhi court on Thursday discharged three people in a vandalism case related to the February 2020 communal riots in north-east Delhi, saying it seems the police made no real effort to trace eye witnesses or the real accused persons and solved it “merely by filing the charge sheet”.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav, while dropping the charges against Shah Alam (26), Rashid Saifi (23) and Shadab (26) in connection with a case of loot and vandalism at a shop in Chand Bagh during the riots on February 25, said the “lack of supervision by the superior officers clearly depicts that the investigating agency has merely tried to pull the wool over the court’s eyes and nothing else”.The judge said the case was a colossal wastage of the hard-earned money of taxpayers as the investigating agency showed no intent to probe the matter. He said the police’s failure to conduct proper investigation will “torment the sentinels of democracy when the history will look back at the worst communal riots since partition in Delhi”.The court said the three accused were neither specifically named in the FIR, nor any specific role was assigned to them in the matter. It said the complainant, Harpreet Singh Anand, also did not specifically name or identify any of the accused persons either in his two written complaints registered on February 27 and March 1, 2020, or in his statement to the police that was recorded on March 3, 2020.“In my opinion, he has rightly done so, because when he was not present at the spot on the date and time of incident, therefore, there was no question of him having witnessed the incident,” the court said.The court noted that beat constable Gyan Singh never bothered to report about the incident/accused persons at Dayalpur police station, and it was only during the course of recording of his statement under Section 161 CrPC by the investigating officer on March 3, 2020 that for the first time he named the three accused in the matter.This, the court said, seems to give the impression that the constable was “planted” just to solve the case. “This silence and delay on the part of constable Gyan Singh is not only fatal to the case of investigating agency, but it also gives an impression that he has been planted or introduced to solve the case in hand,” the judge said. Terming it an “open and shut case”, judge Yadav slammed the police probe as “callous and indolent”.A senior officer who asked not to be named said charges were framed against the accused in 32 cases and they were discharged in only one among them. “There are 32 cases in which charges were framed by the courts against the arrested persons. Framing of charges in more than 20 of the 32 cases were done by the same court that today discharged three persons in the Dayalpur police station’s case,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-probe-in-a-delhi-riots-case-a-colossal-waste-of-taxpayer-s-money-delhi-court-observes-101630607537740.html

According to officials, they would purchase electronic goods from the e-commerce website and put in return requests claiming that they were defective. They made payments in both prepaid and cash on delivery modes, said police.“The suspects had joined hands with some delivery agents who used to take pictures of the products and show them to the management saying that the ‘customers’ returned the defective goods, when in fact they did not. The products were then sold in the open market,” said Vinod Kumar Pandey, investigating officer, Noida cyber police station.The suspects were nabbed from Hisar, Haryana, police said, adding that they recovered ₹26 lakh, six cellphones, some fake Aadhaar cards and several ATM cards from them.According to the officials, in March, a Meerut-based owner of an online goods pick-up agency had filed a complaint alleging that they had been duped of over ₹2 crore.“We probed the case and found that there were at least 20 others associated with the fraud. We are working on identifying them. Delivery agents associated with them and their buyers in Delhi’s wholesale markets will also be apprehended soon,” said Pandey.On July 26, the cyber police officials had arrested two persons in connection with the case.Police said that the suspects had opened 99 accounts on the website through multiple virtual numbers.

03-09-2021||Delhi||Steady uptick in flu cases sparks Covid fears in Delhi||Even as the Covid-19 caseloads continues to dip in the Capital, city doctors said they have reported an increase in the number of fever cases driven by seasonal influenza.These patients are tested for Covid-19, in accordance with central government guidelines, almost all of which return negative. Currently, doctors said, seven of 10 fever cases are caused by the flu.“Cases of Covid-19 have almost disappeared in the city. If someone comes to me with a fever at the moment, I would say they have seasonal flu. Out of 10 fever patients, seven have flu,” said Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of internal medicine at Max hospital in Saket.Dr Amitabh Parti, director of internal medicine at Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurugram, agreed. “There has been a 20-25% increase in cases of fever over the last two to three weeks; most of these are cases of seasonal flu. Other than that, we have started seeing cases of dengue and typhoid,” he said.He said the erratic weather in the National Capital Region — intense spells of rain, followed by rising heat and humidity — may be driving influenza cases up.Doctors said the flu this season is also, unusually, affecting entire families.“Entire families are coming down with flu together, just like we saw with Covid-19 during the second wave when the infectious delta variant was circulating. Most people are reporting high-grade fever (103°F to 104°F), sore throat, myalgia (body ache), head ache, and runny nose. Around 10% to 20% of the patients are reporting persistent coughing even after the fever goes down after four or five days,” said Dr Tickoo.The flu virus in circulation keep changing from season to season; experts from across the world predict the strains likely to circulate during a particular year based on which the flu shot is updated.Dr Parti added, “Almost all of the people are reporting upper respiratory tract symptoms; there is not much lower respiratory tract involvement such as pneumonia. There is a high awareness about fever and respiratory symptoms because of Covid-19 and hence more patients with flu are reporting to hospitals.”Dr Tickoo agreed that the numbers are definitely higher than last year as many people were not going to hospitals or getting themselves tested for conditions other than Covid-19.When to visit a doctor?Doctors suggest waiting for a few days for the fever to resolve on its own unless the symptoms aggravate. However, with the city still in the grip of a pandemic, they suggest that fevers not be ignored.“All fevers with respiratory tract infection must seek medical care. We are at a cusp of a third wave of Covid-19. In such a situation, fevers should not be ignored,” said Dr Parti.Fevers, especially those with comorbidities should not be ignored. “People who have comorbidities like diabetes, cancer, heart, liver, and kidney disease must consult a doctor if they have fever. Comorbidities not only increases the risk of death in Covid-19 patients, it can also increase the severity of flu,” said Dr BK Tripathii, professor in the department of medicine at Safdarjung hospital.“All the precautions observed for Covid-19, such as putting on masks, maintaining social distance, washing hands, avoiding crowded places helps in keeping seasonal flu at bay as well,” said Dr Tripathi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/steady-uptick-in-flu-cases-sparks-covid-fears-in-delhi-101630607234241.html
03-09-2021||Noida||Metro corridor to link Capital, Jewar airport||The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) on Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to prepare a feasibility report of a Metro corridor to provide direct connectivity between Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport and the upcoming Noida International Airport at Jewar, officials aware of the matter said.This proposed Metro corridor is expected to start in Delhi from the Shivaji Stadium Metro station on the DMRC’s airport express line. It is likely to pass through Greater Noida’s Pari Chowk to reach the airport in Jewar.Yeida has roped in DMRC to work on this project in two phases, the officials said. The memorandum of understanding was signed at Yeida’s Sector Omega-2 office in the presence of authority’s chief executive officer Arun Vir Singh and DMRC’s business development officer Pramit Garg.“We have asked DMRC to first prepare a detailed project report of the 35.64km Metro project from Greater Noida’s Pari Chowk to Jewar, where Noida international airport is being developed. DMRC has also been tasked to prepare a feasibility report for a Metro link between Pari Chowk in Greater Noida and Delhi’s Shivaji Stadium. This corridor will provide smooth connectivity between Delhi’s IGI airport via airport Metro’s airport express line,” said Arun Vir Singh CEO of the Yeida after signing the MoU.Yeida has asked DMRC to prepare the project report and the feasibility report in the next nine months.“The work on the 35.64km Metro project will begin after nine months. And after the feasibility report of the second phase between Greater Noida and Delhi, this link will also witness further progress,” said Singh.The Yamuna International airport Private Limited has already started construction work at the airport project that is expected to be ready by 2024. Yeida officials said they were aiming to ensure that the Metro link and the airport should be ready at the same time. They said the financial modalities will be finalised once the project report is ready.“We want to provide multi-model connectivity from Noida airport to rest of Delhi-NCR so that the passengers can travel comfortably. The Metro project will prove crucial for the new airport as it will immensely benefit the commuters,” said Singh.The airport is billed to be the largest in India, and will be the NCR’s third, after the IGI airport and the civilian terminal at Ghaziabad’s Hindon airport. In December 2020, the Uttar Pradesh government approved the design of the airport at Jewar. The new international airport is expected to share the increasing passenger load at the Delhi airport.Yamuna International airport Private Limited -- a special purpose vehicle set up to undertake the airport project -- has begun constructing boundary walls and levelling the land. The airport project is expected to be completed by 2024 and will entail an investment of around ₹20,000 crore.The authorities also plan to develop a smart city on 1,400 hectares of land near the airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/metro-corridor-to-connect-noida-airport-and-delhi-s-igia-101630607174187.html

Officials said that the second dose beneficiaries in these categories will be covered as the supply of vaccine gets streamlined.Commenting on the numbers, Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune, said that in January, HCWs faced the problem of registration. “Registration of HCWs was abruptly stopped on January 16 and later, there was no scope to register them. Also, so many HCWs were forced to take jabs along with the general population. Hence, these numbers are not getting reflected.”“Also, there were two new vaccines and so many people waited. As soon as the efficacy data for both the vaccines was released, many HCWs took the jab. In the beginning, HCWs were in a dilemma over which vaccine to take. There were many discussions internally. As soon as the efficacy rate was out however and vaccines were made available, HCWs took the vaccine on priority,” Dr Patil said.Dr Sachin Edke, district immunisation officer, said that many HCWs and FLWs have taken their first jab but may have to wait for the second jab as the supply is now being streamlined.“As the supply of both vaccines has been irregular, many beneficiaries are awaiting the second dose. “However, when the supply becomes regular, we will see many HCWs and FLWs taking their dose,” said Dr Edke.He said that so far, 79% HCWs have received their first dose in the Pune district with around 83% HCWs from Pune rural, 79% from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), and 74% from the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) having received their first dose. And after initial hesitation, 90% FLWs have now taken their first dose in Pune district with over 98% FLWs from Pune rural, 83% from PMC and 86% from PCMC having received their first dose.“On Thursday, a total of 130,970 doses of Covishield were delivered in the district: out of which, 50,000 were given to Pune rural; 48,000 to PMC; and 32,780 to PCMC. And a total of 9,920 doses of Covaxin were received by the district: out of which, 4,400 were received by Pune rural; 3,400 by PMC; and 2,120 by PCMC,” Dr Edke said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/62-hcws-67-flws-get-vaccine-jab-yet-101630606634087.html

Also in past speeches, he has given a clear indication that everything is over, ‘as Muslims you have no hope’,” Prasad told the court of additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sharjeel-imam-tried-to-instil-hopelessness-in-muslims-through-his-speeches-police-tell-delhi-court-101630605976330.html

There might be discrepancy regarding the width of the passage within the same compound or the exact place where the fire was set, but both sides agree that it is within one compound,” Prasad said.“It cannot be said that the incidents were separate or the offences different. As stated earlier, a perusal of the charge sheets filed in the respective FIRs show that they are more or less identical and the accused are also same,” he said.Police said they filed five separate FIRs because the complaints came from different members of the same family as the properties were distinct from one another. The police said the complainants have alleged that the arson and looting caused them a loss of articles worth ₹7-10 lakh.Atir, through his counsel Tara Narula, argued that consecutive FIRs could not be registered for the same offence as doing so would fly in the face of the principles laid down by the Supreme Court, which states that more than one FIR cannot be registered over a single offence.Delhi Police argued that the properties were distinct and the damages were suffered individually by residents and that the subject matter of each FIR is different from that of the others.But the court held that even if the properties were different or distinct from one another, they are located in the same compound. It also noted that most of the houses in the compound belong to the same family and were owned by different members of the family. “The entire incident took place when the mob entered the compound and set fire at different places within the same compound. Same truck bearing unique No.926225 came to the spot to douse the fire,” the judge said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-high-court-pulls-up-police-for-lodging-five-firs-on-one-incident-quashes-four-101630605614208.html

The suspect fled the crime scene after firing the shot.“We have registered a case of firing and attempt to murder against Sandeep. Our teams are conducting raids to nab him. He left behind his cellphone at home,” said deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parminder Singh.Police said Roshni lived with her son and granddaughter at their home in Mundka village. Sandeep’s wife, Ritu, who runs a beauty parlour, started living separately a few months ago after marital disputes made life together impossible, said police.“Sandeep used to blame his mother and daughter for his separation with Ritu. He often had arguments with his mother over it and also used to beat up his daughter,” said a police officer associated with the case.Around 8pm on Wednesday evening, the officer said, Sandeep tried to assault his daughter but Roshni intervened and locked her in the bathroom.

Four of our officers have been injured during clashes," the Metropolitan Police said, adding "this is unacceptable".The force had earlier tweeted that it was attending a demonstration outside the MHRA offices on Cabot Square in east London and "guarding the entrance to the building".Video posted on social media showed the protesters reaching the doors, with security guards on the other side.Seconds later, police pushed their way through the crowd and formed a cordon outside the building's entrance and scuffled with protesters trying to get in.The mask-free demonstrators shouted that they were there "to protect the next generation" as they rallied outside, a livestream showed.The protest came as Britain continues its successful mass vaccination drive, which has seen more than three-quarters of adults received two doses of approved jabs.An independent panel of experts on Friday recommended the government does not extend the programme to vaccinating all UK children aged 12 to 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-police-say-4-officers-hurt-in-clash-with-anti-vaccination-protesters-101630689092204.html

"By the grace of Allah Almighty, we are in control of entire Afghanistan. The troublemakers have defeated and Panjshir is now under our command," said one Taliban commander. However, Resistance leaders claimed that the fighting was still on.While the forces have been clashing sporadically for the past two weeks, an intense clash between the Taliban and the Resistance Front has been continuing for the last four days. On Thursday night, the fight escalated prompting former president Hamid Karzai to appeal to both the warring sides to stop clashing as more bloodshed is not of any service to Afghanistan and Afghan people. 
03-09-2021||World||Who is Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, set to lead new Afghanistan government?||Mullah Abdul Ghani, who is also known as Baradar (brother), is all set to be the leader of the new Afghanistan government. This is a last-minute development confirmed by international news agencies as Hibatullah Akhundzadam, who heads the Taliban since 2016, was supposed to be the supreme leader like it happened in 1996 when chief Mullah Mohammed Omar took charge of the government that the Taliban formed in Afghanistan for the first time.Why Hibatullah Akhundzadam is not taking chargeReports said that Hibatullah Akhundzadam who leads his life far away from diplomacy and the public will continue looking after the religious aspects of the group, while Baradar who is the public face of the Taliban will lead the country. Analysts consider Baradar as having a moderate image who appears as a political leader, not a military leader. His statements also seem reasonable, firm but non-confrontational, the Diplomat commented.Where was Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar all these years?After 2001, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar left Afghanistan and this August was the first time, he returned to his country. In 2010, he was arrested in Pakistan and was released after US intervention.Why is he called Baradar?This was what Mullah Mohammed Omar used to call him out of affection. Baradar is the only surviving Taliban leader who was personally appointed deputy by Mohammed Omar, which makes Baradar legendary. Baradar was also related to Mullah Omar by marriage relationsInternationally knownBaradar led the Taliban's negotiation team in Qatar which culminated in the2020 peace agreement. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar met Mike Pompeo, spoke with Donald Trump in the process of the deal. Baradar also met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.Baradar's first speech after Kabul takeover"It was never expected that we will have victory in Afghanistan. Now comes the test. We must meet the challenge of serving and securing our nation, and giving it a stable life going forward," he said after the Taliban captured Kabul.Between 1996 and 2001, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar played a crucial role as the deputy minister of defence. Reports say Baradar does not have a good relationship with Pakistan and apparently he still nurses much resentment against Pakistan for his imprisonment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-mullah-abdul-ghani-baradar-set-to-lead-new-afghanistan-government-101630687856211.html

Biden has been facing criticism from the international community over the hasty troops’ pullout from Afghanistan which led to a humanitarian crisis in the war-torn country following the Taliban’s lightning push to capture Kabul.In a Washington Post-ABC News poll, an overwhelming majority supported Biden’s decision to end the two decades of war in Afghanistan but disapproved of the manner in which the situation was handled. While 77% of respondents voiced support for the withdrawal, the chaotic evacuation including the deaths of 13 US service members hit the popular decision hard.Of the 77% who supported the American withdrawal from Afghanistan, 52% disapproved the handling. About 17% of respondents opposed the withdrawal while 6% had no opinion on the burning issue. Only 8% of the 1,006 adults involved in the survey thought US forces’ withdrawal from Afghanistan makes the United States safer from terrorism. While 44% opined that the pullout makes the US less safe, 45% of them said the decision makes no difference.Watch: Afghan withdrawal haunts Joe Biden; approval rating hits all-time lowAfter troops’ withdrawal and subsequent crisis in Afghanistan, the approval rating of the US president has hit a new low since he took the office in January. According to a new Marist National Poll with NPR and PBS Newshour, Biden's approval rating has fallen to 43 per cent. A large section of the populace has also termed the US' role in Afghanistan a "failure".Biden administration has been vehemently defending the withdrawal and said that the sole purpose of the US military was to eliminate al Qaeda and ensure Afghan soil is never used by terror groups to harm the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-disapprove-of-the-way-biden-handled-troops-withdrawal-in-afghanistan-101630686389612.html

They have said women's rights will be protected, but have yet to provide details.Women who work in justice have already been high profile targets. Two female Supreme Court justices were gunned down in January.Also Read| Afghan women forced into marriage at evacuation camps to flee Kabul: ReportNow, the Taliban have released prisoners across the country, which "really put the lives of women judges in danger," a high-level Afghan women judge who fled to Europe said from an undisclosed location.In Kabul, "four or five Taliban members came and asked people in my house: 'Where is this woman judge?' These were people who I had put in jail," she told Reuters in an interview, asking not to be identified.She was among a small group of Afghan women judges to have made it out in recent weeks with the help of a collective of human rights volunteers and foreign colleagues at the International Association of Women Judges (IAWJ).Since then she has been in touch with colleagues back home: "Their messages are of fear and complete terror. They tell me if they do not get rescued their lives are in direct danger."In addition to the judges, there are around a thousand other women human rights defenders who could also be in the Taliban's cross hairs, said Horia Mosadiq, an Afghan human rights activist.Freed prisoners "are calling with death threats to women judges, women prosecutors and women police officers, saying 'we will come after you'," she said.FearfulBritish Justice Minister Robert Buckland said last week London had evacuated nine female judges and was working to provide safe passage for more of the "very vulnerable people"."A lot of these judges were responsible for administering the rule of law and quite rightly they are fearful about the consequences that could now face them with the rise of the Taliban," he said.Human rights and legal activists said Western countries did not make the evacuation of women judges and human rights defenders a priority in the chaos after Kabul fell."Governments had zero interest in evacuating people that were not their own nationals," said Sarah Kay, a Belfast-based human rights lawyer and member of the Atlas Women network of international lawyers.Also Read| ‘Will raise our voice for Muslims in Kashmir’: Taliban spokesman Suhail ShaheenShe is working with an online group of volunteer veterans known as the "digital Dunkirk," named for the World War Two evacuation of British troops from Nazi-occupied France.

03-09-2021||World||‘Will raise our voice for Muslims in Kashmir’: Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen||A Taliban spokesman has said the group reserves the right to speak out in support of Muslims in Jammu and Kashmir, remarks that run counter to senior Taliban leader Anas Haqqani’s contention that the organisation would not interfere in Kashmir. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen was quoted by BBC Urdu, in a report published online on Thursday, as saying that the group does not have a policy of taking up arms against any country. In this context, he referred to the terms of the agreement signed by Taliban and the US in February 2020.However, Shaheen said that the Taliban, as Muslims, have the right to raise their voice for Muslims in Kashmir, India or any other country. “We will raise our voice and say that Muslims are your own people, your own citizens. They are entitled to equal rights under your laws,” he was quoted as saying. Shaheen’s remarks are completely contrary to the stance taken by Haqqani Network leader Anas Haqqani, a member of the Taliban’s 14-member negotiating team, in an interview aired by News18 channel on Wednesday. Haqqani had said in the interview that Kashmir was not an issue for Afghanistan. “We have a clear policy that when something is not an issue for our country, we cannot interfere in another country,” he had said, speaking in Urdu. He had also described reports about the Haqqani Network supporting Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which are active in Kashmir, as “propaganda”. There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Shaheen’s remarks. As reported by Hindustan Times, Haqqani has been engaged in an outreach towards India, along with senior Taliban leader Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai, who is expected to be given a senior position in the government to be formed by the Taliban. Haqqani had said in the interview that the Taliban have a policy of not interfering in the internal matters of other countries. “Our desire is that we don’t negatively interfere in internal problems. Our doors are open to the whole world for political relations and humanitarian aid, we want good relations with all countries,” he said. He contended that the Indian government had supported the Taliban’s opponents in Afghanistan for 20 years. He added, “But we don’t want to remember the past and we want good relations with all countries, including India.” People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the narrative being presented by Taliban leaders such as Shaheen and Anas Haqqani had to be seen in the context of the Taliban’s long-standing ties with Pakistan, and the channels of communication between India and the Taliban. “There is a constituency in Pakistan that the Taliban have to satisfy,” one of the people cited above said. On Tuesday, India’s ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, had met Stanekzai, the head of the Taliban’s political office, at the Indian embassy in Doha following a request from the Taliban side. In his interview with BBC Urdu, Shaheen claimed the “propaganda” against the Haqqani Network was based on “mere claims”. He said, “The Haqqanis are not a group. They are part of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.” Shaheen also raised the issue of the 1999 hijacking of Indian Airlines flight IC-814 from Kathmandu to Kandahar. The Taliban were then in power in Kabul and Indian officials have long contended that the Taliban had helped the Pakistani terrorists who hijacked the airliner to force India to release three terrorists, including Masood Azhar, who went on to create JeM. Shaheen contended the Taliban didn’t play a role in the hijacking and that the Indian government should be “grateful” for the help the group provided in Kandahar. The Indian side told the Taliban there was a shortage of fuel on the airliner and the group provided assistance for the release of the passengers, he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-raise-our-voice-for-muslims-in-kashmir-taliban-spokesman-suhail-shaheen-101630678459695.html

What is happening in Panjshir valley?||Days after the negotiation between the Taliban and the anti-Taliban forces failed, the two groups are reportedly clashing in the valley, while the Taliban are all set to announce their new cabinet, likely to be headed by Taliban co-founder Mullah Baradar. Former president Hamid Karzai who was part of the talks between the Taliban and the Afghan leadership on Friday appealed to both the Resistance and the Taliban to stop the war and he said the consequences of this was will not be of any interest to the country and the people. له بده مرغه په دې ورستیو ورځو کې د مصلحینو د هڅو سره سره په پنجشیر کې پوځي عملیات او جگړه پیل شوه چې د ژورې اندیښنې وړ ده او عواقب یې د هېواد او خلکو په گټه نه بولم. په همدې دلیل پر دواړو وروڼو خواوو ږغ کوم چې جگړه نه یوازې چې د حل لاره نده، بلکې د ټپي او دردېدلي افغانستان …What is happening in Panjshir valley?The valley still undefeated by the Taliban is putting up a strong resistance against the Taliban and both sides have witnessed casualties. The Taliban have recently claimed that they have the Shutul district of Panjshir under siege.The anti-Taliban force has denied the claim. The resistance forces also claim to have killed at least 350 members of the Islamic group while mutilated 290 others.Taliban, on the other hand, claimed that they have killed 34 members and captured 11 checkpoints in the Panjshir province.According to a CNN report, heavy clashes erupted on Thursday night while sporadic clashes were going on since last week.Why Taliban-Panjshir negotiation failedResistance leader Ahmad Massoud had earlier said that he believed in talks and he was ready for negotiation with the Taliban. But the Resistance force will not surrender to the Taliban. Taliban leaders on the other hand bargained for surrender in exchange for amnesty that the Taliban have declared for all soon after capturing Kabul."The Taliban are not as strong as many believe they are. The reason why they took the country was the weakness of the government and the leadership of the Afghan military. Unfortunately, former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani purged the army of generals and officers who knew how to fight the Taliban and who had the will and motivation to fight the enemy," Ahmad Massoud recently said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hamid-karzai-concerned-over-taliban-and-resistance-clash-what-is-happening-in-panjshir-valley-101630670702364.html
03-09-2021||World||EU and AstraZeneca settle dispute over shortfall in Covid-19 vaccine supply||The European Union and UK-based drugs giant AstraZeneca settled their dispute over a shortfall in coronavirus vaccine supplies on Friday, agreeing an extended delivery schedule.The European Commission went to court after the firm failed to deliver all of a promised 300 million doses by June 2021, but AstraZeneca will now have until the end of March next year to make up the number.The agreement ends the legal battle and AstraZeneca will not face any fines or penalty payments -- unless it falls short of its new target dates."I'm very pleased that we have been able to reach a common understanding which allows us to move forward and work in collaboration with the European Commission to help overcome the pandemic," said AstraZeneca's Ruud Dobber.Brussels was furious when the British-Swedish pharmaceutical outfit fell far short of its promises, undermining the early stages of the EU's Covid-19 vaccine rollout.Officials accused AstraZeneca of prioritising UK vaccine deliveries over the EU order and European Commission lawyers went to court to demand deliveries or see huge daily fines imposed for any ongoing shortfall.But the firm argued that its contract with the bloc only obliged it to make "best efforts" to meet its delivery target, and that production bottlenecks in its European plants had been unavoidable.In an interim ruling pending the final settlement of the case, the Brussels court imposed a new delivery schedule on AstraZeneca."Today's settlement agreement guarantees the delivery of the remaining 200 million Covid-19 vaccine doses by AstraZeneca to the EU," European health commissioner Stella Kyriakides said in a statement."While this week we reached the important milestone of 70 percent full vaccination of the EU's adult population, there are significant differences in vaccination rates between our member states, and the continued availability of vaccines, including AstraZeneca's, remain crucial."AstraZeneca manufactures vaccines designed at Britain's Oxford University and sells them on a non-profit basis -- its version is cheaper and easier to store than many competitors.No finesBut the European Union has become frustrated by the slow pace of supply and has made another vaccine produced by US giant Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech the workhorse of its buying programme.A European Commission statement said AstraZeneca had delivered 100 million doses in the first half of 2021, would send 135 million more by the end of the year and another 65 million doses by March 2022."This will bring the total number of doses delivered to 300 million doses as agreed under the contract," it said.AstraZeneca said it would be able to meet the revised delivery schedule imposed by the Belgian court in its interim judgment and is confident of respecting its new timetable.But if it fails, it will have to pay member states a rebate on the costs of the vaccine equivalent to 10 percent for one month of delay, 25 percent for two months or 40 percent for three months of delay or more.The agreement also assumes that the European Medicines Agency will approve two new European manufacturing sites for the AstraZeneca vaccine before the end of October.Because the AstraZeneca vaccine is cheaper and can be stored at much higher temperatures than the Pfizer-BioNTech and other rivals, it has been sought after in poorer and developing countries.Eastern European states had ordered large quantities of it under the EU scheme, and now both the firm and Brussels hope to use it in the UN-backed Covax international vaccine distribution scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-and-astrazeneca-settle-dispute-over-shortfall-in-covid-19-vaccine-supply-101630668775419.html

In the following reports, Ezmarai Ahmadi, a Kabul resident, said that 10 of his family members were wiped out in the strike, including six children.The airstrike was launched a day after an IS suicide bomber carried out a massive blast at the Kabul airport, where a huge crowd had gathered hoping to flee in evacuations flights. Nearly 100 Afghans and 13 US service members lost their lives in the attack.In the backdrop of the escalating crisis, analysts have warned that the risk of civilian casualties in Afghanistan during drone strikes will only grow now that the US no longer has any on-ground intelligence.However, speaking during the press briefing, Psaki pushed back against the idea, saying there are many countries where the US has no military presence on the ground, "but we can still prevent terrorist groups from metastasizing and posing threats," the AP reported.Afghanistan is under major turmoil after the US and NATO troops withdrew from the country, leading to the Taliban taking over the country after being ousted in 2001. The war-ravaged nation is now facing a severe economic crisis as western nations pulled out the financial support and political uncertainty.Meanwhile, the Taliban is set to announce their own government which will likely be led by its co-founder Mullah Baradar. Baradar, who heads the Taliban's political office, will be joined by Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the son of late Taliban founder Mullah Omar, and Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, in senior positions in the government, news agency Reuters reported citing sources.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/civilian-casualties-due-to-us-drone-strike-being-investigated-white-house-official-jen-psaki-101630664234087.html
03-09-2021||World||To escape Taliban, here is what Afghan women were forced into doing||In a desperate bid to flee the country, many Afghan women were forced into marriages inside the evacuation camps outside the Kabul airport so that they become easily eligible for evacuation, the US state department was alerted. According to a CNN report, the practice was brought to the notice of US diplomats who have also alerted the UAE over the issue. The report said some families even paid men eligible for evacuation in thousand of dollars. Some men were approached only to pose as husbands for women to flee, the CNN report said. This has triggered concern over the possibility of human trafficking flourishing around the evacuation from Kabul. The report said that since the issue has been brought to the notice of the diplomats and the extent of this practice is not really known, US diplomats in the UAE would provide guidance to identify potential victims of human trafficking.Also Read | From music to women's education in Afghanistan: What Taliban said so farWhere are these women now?As the evacuation process is now over and the Taliban are all set to announce their new government in Afghanistan, the evacuees are mostly in transit.

03-09-2021||World||Humanitarian flights in Afghanistan resume as fate hangs in balance||The fate of the United Nations political mission in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover is a source of grave concern within the global body, UN sources told AFP, as humanitarian flights resumed this week.The mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) was due to end on September 17, and it's extension is set to be debated on September 9 by the UN Security Council.The context of the potential renewal has changed dramatically, however, after the Taliban swept back into control mid-August, forcing a chaotic withdrawal of foreign governments, their troops, citizens and Afghan allies."The situation is so unclear" and it will be "a reasonable approach at this time" to implement a "technical rollover" of the mandate, a UN source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Also uncertain are the intentions of the new Taliban government, expected to be announced soon.For the United Nations and Western states, they "certainly would never want to lose certain aspects" of the current mandate, "and that includes human rights, protection of civilians" and coordination of international humanitarian aid, a UN source said.A top UN concern is over the treatment of women and girls under the hardline Islamist Taliban. Women's liberties were sharply curtailed during the Taliban's 1996-2001 rule in Afghanistan.For Ireland, which holds the Security Council presidency for September, the question of human rights under the Taliban is crucial -- and the group will be judged "by their actions, not by their words," said the country's UN envoy, Geraldine Byrne Nason.Unacceptable to Ireland would be the exclusion of women from key government posts, Nason told reporters this week."This won't stand for Ireland," she said, adding that Afghanistan is more in need of the UN and its humanitarian aid support than ever.'The world's eyes'In Afghanistan, 18 million people are staring down the barrel of humanitarian disaster, and another 18 million could quickly join them, the UN has warned, calling for international donations.On Thursday, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric announced humanitarian flights operated by the body's World Food Programme are "resuming... to enable 160 humanitarian organizations to continue their life-saving activities in Afghanistan's provinces."The flights link the Pakistani capital Islamabad with the Afghan cities of Mazar-i-Sharif in the north and Kandahar in the south. Three flights have already landed in Mazar-i-Sharif since August 29.Between 2002 and 2021, the UN Humanitarian Air Service served more than 20 locations in the country, Dujarric said, adding the goal was to return to that capacity "once security and funding permits."Since their lightning takeover, the Taliban have not indicated how they envisage the future of UNAMA, or even who might represent Afghanistan when world leaders gather at the annual UN General Assembly later this month in New York.What seems clear, a diplomatic source said, is that "they do want assistance going forward... both humanitarian and development," though the latter is not within the purview of the current UNAMA mandate.In a statement on Thursday, Human Rights Watch urged the Security Council to renew the mandate to "ensure that the mission and other UN agencies have the resources needed to deliver lifesaving aid and to fully monitor human rights" in Afghanistan."The Taliban have an abysmal track record on human rights and violating the rights of women and girls in particular, so the UN mission needs to be the world's eyes on the ground to publicly report on the situation in Afghanistan," said the organization's UN director, Louis Charbonneau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/humanitarian-flights-in-afghanistan-resume-as-fate-hangs-in-balance-101630653799090.html

03-09-2021||World||Taliban co-founder Mullah Baradar to lead new Afghanistan govt: Report||Taliban co-founder Mullah Baradar will lead a new Afghan government that could be announced soon, sources in the Islamist group said on Friday, as it battled rebel fighters while striving to ward off economic collapse.Baradar, who heads the Taliban's political office, will be joined by Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the son of late Taliban founder Mullah Omar, and Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, in senior positions in the government, three sources said."All the top leaders have arrived in Kabul, where preparations are in final stages to announce the new government," one Taliban official told Reuters, on condition of anonymity.The Taliban, which seized Kabul on Aug. 15 after sweeping across most of the country, have faced resistance in the Panjshir Valley, north of the capital, with reports of heavy fighting and casualties.Several thousand fighters of regional militias and remnants of the government's armed forces have massed in the rugged valley under the leadership of Ahmad Massoud, the son of former Mujahideen commander Ahmad Shah Massoud.Efforts to negotiate a settlement appear to have broken down, with each side blaming the other for the failure.HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHEThe government's legitimacy in the eyes of international donors and investors will be crucial for an economy grappling with drought and the ravages of a conflict that killed an estimated 240,000 Afghans.Humanitarian groups have warned of impending catastrophe and the economy, reliant for years on many millions of dollars of foreign aid, is close to collapse.Many Afghans were struggling to feed their families amid severe drought well before the Taliban took power and millions may now face starvation, aid agencies say."Since August 15, we have seen the crisis accelerate and magnify, with the imminent economic collapse that is coming this country's way," Mary-Ellen McGroarty, the director of the World Food Programme in Afghanistan, told Reuters from Kabul.The administration of US President Joe Biden has no plans to release billions in Afghan gold, investments and foreign currency reserves parked in the United States that it froze after the Taliban's takeover.In a positive development, a senior executive of Western Union Co said the firm was resuming money-transfer services to Afghanistan in line with a US push to keep up humanitarian work.RECOGNITIONThe Taliban enforced a radical form of sharia, or Islamic law, when it ruled from 1996 to 2001.But this time around, the movement has tried to present a more moderate face to the world, promising to protect human rights and refrain from reprisals against old enemies.The United States, the European Union and others have cast doubt on such assurances, saying formal recognition of the new government, and the resultant flow of economic aid, was contingent on action.The Taliban have promised safe passage out of the country for any foreigners or Afghans left behind by the huge airlift that ended when U.S. troops withdrew ahead of an Aug 31 deadline. But, with Kabul airport still closed, many were seeking to flee over land.Thousands of Afghans, some without documents, others with pending U.S. visa applications or whose families have mixed immigration status, also wait in "transit hubs" in third countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-co-founder-mullah-baradar-to-lead-new-afghanistan-govt-report-101630653115395.html
03-09-2021||World||Wary of Taliban diktats, Afghan media test limits of press freedom||Afghanistan's most popular private television network has voluntarily replaced its risque Turkish soap operas and music shows with tamer programs tailored to the country's new Taliban rulers, who have issued vague directives that media must not contradict Islamic laws or harm the national interest.Still, independent Afghan news stations are keeping female presenters on the air and testing the limits of media freedom under the group, whose militants have killed journalists in the past but have promised an open, inclusive system since coming to power in August.As the world watches intently for clues on how the Taliban will govern, their treatment of the media will be a key indicator, along with their policies toward women. When they ruled Afghanistan between 1996-2001, they enforced a harsh interpretation of Islam, barring girls and women from schools and public life, and brutally suppressing dissent.Since then, Afghanistan has seen a proliferation of media outlets, and women have made some strides within the restrictions of the deeply conservative society.In a first sign, the Taliban are trying to soften their extremist reputation, one of its officials unexpectedly walked into the studios of the privately owned Tolo News just two days after taking control of Kabul in mid-August. He sat down for an interview with the female anchor, Behishta Arghand.The 22-year-old anchor told The Associated Press that she was nervous when she saw him enter the studio, but his behavior and how he answered questions helped put her at ease a bit.“I just said to myself this is a good time to show for all the world, Afghan women don't want to go back. They want... to go forward,” she said.Arghand fled the country after the interview, unwilling to take any chances about the Taliban's promises of greater openness. She is temporarily in a compound in Qatar for Afghan refugees.She is among hundreds of journalists — many seen as the best in their field — who left the country after the Taliban takeover, part of an exodus of more than 100,000 Afghans.Yet her interview with the Taliban official marked a notable shift from the militants' first time in power when women had to cover themselves from head to toe and were stoned to death in public for adultery and other alleged offenses.This time, the Taliban shared a video of girls going to school in the provinces. They also have held news conferences after taking control of Kabul, fielding questions from local and international media.Saad Mohseni, the CEO, and chairman of Moby Group, which owns Tolo News, said he believes the Taliban are tolerating the media because they understand they have to win hearts and minds, convince the political establishment to play a role, and consolidate their rule.“The media is important to them, but what they do to the media in a month or two months' time remains to be seen,” he said from Dubai, where Moby Group has an office.Although the U.S. and its allies failed to create a stable democracy in Afghanistan, they did succeed in creating a thriving press, said Steven Butler, Asia program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. The U.S. government spent huge sums of money on the project as the foundation of democracy, he noted on CPJ's website.Initial U.S. grants helped launch Tolo, which began as a radio station in 2003 and rapidly expanded to television. The Pashto- and Dari-language broadcaster employs 500 people and is the most-viewed private network in Afghanistan.Known for its news and entertainment programming, Tolo decided on its own to remove music shows and soap operas from the airwaves because “we didn't think that they'd be acceptable to the new regime,” Mohseni said. The romance dramas have been replaced by a Turkish TV series set in the Ottoman era, with more modestly dressed actresses.Afghanistan's state broadcaster RTA pulled its female presenters off the air until further notice. The independent female-run Zan TV has ceased showing new programming.The privately run Ariana news channel, however, has kept its female anchors on the air. Tolo had a female host on its breakfast show Thursday and the network has one female news anchor and several female reporters.Since taking control, there have been reports of the Taliban beating and threatening journalists. In one known case, the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle said Taliban militants going door to door in a hunt for one of its journalists shot and killed a member of his family and seriously injured another.“We have to make sure that Afghan journalism stays alive because people will need it,” said Bilal Sarwary, a longtime journalist in Afghanistan whose work has appeared on the BBC, among others.Although he also has left Afghanistan with his family, he said a generation of citizen journalists are more empowered than ever.“If we can't go (back), it does not mean we will give up on Afghanistan. We will work on Afghanistan from wherever we are. ... Global connectivity is the new normal,” Sarwary said.Meanwhile, the Taliban are allowing journalists to enter Afghanistan from Pakistan and allowing media outlets to continue operating in Kabul, albeit under ominous guidelines. They have stipulated that news reports must not contradict Islamic values and should not challenge the national interest.Such vague rules are typical for authoritarian states across the Middle East and Central Asia, where they have been used to silence and prosecute journalists. In order to operate, local media may have to practice self-censorship to avoid repercussions.Afghanistan has long been dangerous for journalists. CPJ says 53 journalists have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001 and 33 of them since 2018.In July, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer from Reuters was killed covering clashes between the Taliban and Afghan security forces. In 2014, an Agence France-Presse journalist, his wife, and two children were among nine people killed by Taliban gunmen while dining at a hotel in Kabul.Nearly two years later in 2016, a Taliban suicide bomber targeted Tolo employees on a bus, killing seven of them and wounding at least 25 people. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, calling Tolo a tool of decadent Western influence.Mohseni said he was concerned when the Taliban overran Kabul and that he remains “not necessarily positive.”"But I'm just thinking: Well, let's just wait and see. Let's see how restrictive they will be,” he said. “There's no doubt they'll be restrictive. The question is how restrictive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wary-of-taliban-diktats-afghan-media-test-limits-of-press-freedom-101630652849070.html

"We will raise our voice and say that Muslims are your own people, your own citizens. They are entitled to equal rights under your laws," Shaheen told in an interview with BBC Urdu, Geo News reported.Shaheen, however, added that the group does not have the policy to raise arms against any country.

03-09-2021||World||As Suga steps down, here are potential candidates for Japan's next prime minister||Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga, his support ratings in tatters ahead of a general election, said on Friday he would step down, setting the stage for his replacement as premier.Here are details about the people who might become Japan's next prime minister.FUMIO KISHIDA, 64A former foreign minister, Kishida had been considered the likely heir of Shinzo Abe, who resigned last September, but the low-key lawmaker from Hiroshima typically ranks low in voter surveys. He came in second in last year's party leadership poll.Kishida hails from one of the LDP's more dovish factions and is seen as lukewarm about revising the pacifist constitution.Announcing his candidacy, Kishida called for reducing income disparities and pledged support to the economically vulnerable, such as workers in non-regular employment and women, in contrast with Suga, who has stressed self-reliance.This week, Kishida said an economic stimulus package worth "tens of trillions of yen" was needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic. He also said Japan must maintain ultra-low interest rates to support the pandemic-hit economy.He has said he was running to show the LDP "listens to the people and offers broad choices, and to protect our nation's democracy," a comment seen as a criticism of Suga's governing style.SANAE TAKAICHI, 60An Abe disciple and former internal affairs minister, Takaichi has made clear her desire to become Japan's first female premier, and said she would introduce policies to fend off China's technology threat and help strengthen the economy.Takaichi said she wanted to work on issues left unfinished by previous administrations, such as achieving 2% inflation and introducing legislation "that prevents the leakage of sensitive information to China".She said an extra budget needs to be compiled as soon as possible to bolster Japan's medical system, which is under strain because of the pandemic.A member of the party's most conservative wing, she often visits Yasukuni Shrine, a controversial memorial to Japan's war dead, and has opposed allowing married couples to keep separate surnames.However, it is not clear whether she will obtain the 20 lawmaker backers needed to run in the leadership election.TARO KONO, 58In charge of Japan's rocky vaccination rollout, Kono ranks high on the list of lawmakers voters want to see succeed Suga.Educated at Georgetown University and a fluent English speaker, the social media-savvy Kono has served as foreign and defence minister and holds the portfolio for administrative reform.Kono has a reputation as a maverick but toed the line on key Abe policies. He has differentiated his conservative stances from those of his father, former chief cabinet secretary Yohei Kono, who authored a landmark 1993 apology to "comfort women", a euphemism for women forced to work in Japan's wartime military brothels.A member of powerful Finance Minister Taro Aso's faction, Kono has not indicated whether he intends to run in the leadership race.SHIGERU ISHIBA, 64A former defence minister, Ishiba regularly ranks high in voter surveys but is less popular with party MPs.A soft-spoken security maven and rare LDP critic of Abe when the latter was in office, Ishiba has also held portfolios for agriculture and reviving local economies.He defeated Abe in the first round of a party poll in 2012 thanks to strong grassroots support, but lost in the second round when only MPs could vote. He has since lost two more times.Ishiba has criticised the Bank of Japan's ultra-low interest rates for hurting regional banks and called for higher public works spending to remedy growing inequality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-suga-steps-down-here-are-potential-candidates-for-japan-s-next-prime-minister-101630650230239.html
03-09-2021||World||3 Covid-19 vaccine doses may now become routine, enhance immunity: Fauci||White House chief medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci said on Thursday that three doses of the vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) may now become the standard regimen for most people. Fauci’s comments come even as medical experts who advise the US regulators on vaccine doses remain concerned over what they perceive as "political interference" by the Biden administration in the review process of booster shots for Covid-19 vaccines.Fauci, while speaking to reporters at a White House press briefing, said, "I must say from my own experience as an immunologist, I would not at all be surprised that the adequate full regimen for vaccination will likely be three doses."Notably, the Biden administration is preparing to distribute Covid-19 "booster shots" in the United States from the week beginning on September 20. Senior US officials, in a health plan outlined last month in this regard, pointed out that protection from vaccines against the coronavirus disease may decrease even after taking the second Covid-19 shot if several months have passed since that dose. For this purpose, the federal health authorities cited three new studies released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), that affirm their claims.The new plan aims to make third doses available to Americans eight months after they get their second shot of either the Pfizer or Moderna Covid-19 vaccines. However, the plan is being critiqued by those who say the White House is getting ahead of US public-health and drug authorities, who still have to give their go-ahead to the plan.Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, indicated on Thursday that he was in favour of the three-dose strategy. The top infectious diseases expert said that people taking an additional dose or the final dose of the Covid-19 vaccine months after the initial vaccination process will help make the immune system more 'mature'. He said that the final decision in this regard will rest with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after the data is presented to the regulatory body, but he added that it was "reasonable" to believe three doses would be made the standard.“If it is durable, then you’re going to have very likely a three-dose regimen being the routine regimen,” he said.In some of Asia’s Covid-19 hot spots, powerful and wealthier citizens are nabbing booster shots even as most people remain unvaccinated, undermining the inoculation strategies of nations struggling with the highly infectious Delta variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-covid-19-vaccine-doses-may-now-become-routine-enhance-immunity-fauci-101630645189639.html

"A violent extremist undertook a terrorist attack on innocent New Zealanders," Ardern told a briefing.The attacker was a Sri Lankan national who had been in New Zealand for 10 years and had been a "person of interest" for about five years, she said.The man was killed within 60 seconds of beginning the attack, she said, adding that he had been inspired by the Islamic State militant group."It was hateful, it was wrong. It was carried out by an individual, not a faith," Ardern said. "He alone carries the responsibility for these acts."A video posted on social media showed shoppers in the New Lynn supermarket shortly after the attacker struck."There's someone here with a knife ... he's got a knife," a woman can heard saying. "Somebody got stabbed."A guard asked people to leave the shopping mall shortly before about six shots rang out.Of the six wounded people, three were in critical condition, one in serious condition and another in moderate condition, the St John ambulance service said in a statement to Reuters.Witnesses told reporters outside the mall they had seen several people lying on the floor with stab wounds. Other said they heard gunshots as they ran out of the supermarket.Videos posted online earlier showed panicked shoppers running out of the mall and looking for cover.New Zealand has been on alert for attacks since a white supremacist gunman killed 51 people at two mosques in the city of Christchurch on March 15, 2019.In May, four people were stabbed in a supermarket in Dunedin on New Zealand's South Island.

In an interview published in an Italian newspaper on Thursday, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said that the group looks at China as the "most important partner" and will primarily be relying on financing from China."China represents a fundamental and extraordinary opportunity for us because it is ready to invest and rebuild our country," La Repubblica quoted Mujahid as saying.Mujahid also said that 'One Belt One Road', an infrastructure initiative by China to open trade routes, is "held in high regard by the Taliban." There are "rich copper mines in the country, which, thanks to the Chinese, can be put back into operation and modernised. In addition, China is our pass to markets all over the world," said Mujahid in the interview.Mujahid also confirmed that women will be allowed to continue studying at universities in future. He said women would be able to work as nurses, in the police or as assistants in ministries, but ruled out that there would be female ministers in the new government.Afghanistan plunged into turmoil after the United States and its Nato allies withdrew forces from the country, ending a two-decade-long war. Subsequently, the Taliban seized power and took over the capital city of Kabul as the US-supported government led by President Ashraf Ghani collapsed.Following the chaotic departure of foreign troops, mainly from the United States, western nations have severely restricted their aid payments, prompting fears of a major humanitarian crisis.Earlier this week, United Nations secretary general Antonio Guterres warned of a looming "humanitarian catastrophe" in Afghanistan as he urged countries to provide emergency funding. Guterres also expressed his "grave concern at the deepening humanitarian and economic crisis in the country," adding that basic services threatened to collapse "completely" in the war-torn country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-to-rely-on-funding-from-china-says-spokesperson-zabihullah-mujahid-101630646266922.html
03-09-2021||World||Another election in 18 months if there’s no majority this time, says PM Trudeau||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that if neither of the Liberals or the Conservatives secures a majority in the September 20 snap elections, the country could again go to polls in one and a half year’s time.The remark from the Liberal Party leader came during an unofficial debate on the network TVA. Conservative Party leader and PM hopeful Erin O’Toole, New Democratic Party’s (NDP) Jagmeet Singh, and Yves-François Blanchet of Bloc Quebecois took part in the discussion.In the pre-election debate dubbed “Face-a-face”, the other leaders slammed Trudeau for triggering elections amid the fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Blanchet accused the incumbent PM of holding pre-poll campaign events and taking selfies without respecting social distancing norms.Singh did not respond to questions over whether he could work with the Conservatives in case they formed a minority government or even in a coalition arrangement. In previous national elections, Singh had categorically rejected supporting the Conservatives.Two official debates will be held next week under the auspices of the Leaders’ Debates Commission.With a little over two weeks to go for the snap polls that Trudeau himself recently called in a bid to convert his minority government into a majority one, the PM now finds himself in a tight spot.Pre-poll surveys and estimates indicate that not only is he unlikely to secure a majority win, the Liberals risk conceding the position of the single-largest party to the main opposition Conservatives. The Nanos Daily Ballot Tracking for the new outlets CTV News and Globe and Mail found the Conservative Party widening its national lead with 34.2% support as against 30.5% for the ruling Liberal Party.The outlet CBC News put the chances of Trudeau forming a majority government at just 8%. His chances of forming another minority government - with fewer seats than the 157 he won in 2019 - are 45%. That is just 3% ahead of the Conservatives, who have nearly caught up with the Liberals, though other pre-election trackers such as 338 Canada actually place the latter ahead at this time.According to the non-profit Angus Reid Institute (ARI), most Canadians do not prefer seeing another Liberal government, whether in majority or minority. Of those surveyed, according to figures released on Thursday, 42% want to see the next government led by Conservative leader O’Toole, while only 31% want to see Trudeau back at the helm, with the rest looking at a third option, such as NDP.What may give Trudeau some relief is that there is a surprising difference between what voters want and what they expect. Around 49% expect another Liberal minority government with another 12% believing that it could even become a majority. In contrast, just 34% think the Conservatives will form a government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-election-in-18-months-if-there-s-no-majority-this-time-says-pm-trudeau-101630646058765.html
03-09-2021||World||Member of ISIS 'Beatles' cell pleads guilty to beheading American hostages||A British national admitted Thursday evening in a federal courtroom near the nation's capital that he played a leadership role in an Islamic State scheme to torture, hold for ransom, and eventually behead American hostages.Alexanda Anon Kotey, 37, pleaded guilty to all eight counts against him at a plea hearing in US District Court in Alexandria. The charges include hostage-taking resulting in death and providing material support to the Islamic State group from 2012 through 2015.He admitted guilt in connection with the deaths of four American hostages — journalist James Foley, journalist Steven Sotloff and aid workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller — as well as European and Japanese nationals who also were held captive.Kotey is one of four Islamic State members who were dubbed “the Beatles” by their captives because of their British accents. He and another man, El Shafee Elsheikh, were brought to the US last year to face charges after the U.S. assured Britain that neither man would face the death penalty.Elsheikh is still scheduled to go on trial in January. A third Beatle, Mohammed Emwazi, also known as “Jihadi John,” was killed in a 2015 drone strike. A fourth member is serving a prison sentence in Turkey.The plea deal sets a mandatory minimum sentence of life without parole. After 15 years, though, he would be eligible to be transferred to the United Kingdom to face any possible charges there.In the plea deal, he admits that life is an appropriate sentence in the United Kingdom as well. If he were to receive a sentence of less than living there, the deal requires that he serve the rest of his life sentence, either in the United Kingdom if that country will do so, or be transferred back to the U.S. to serve the life term.The deal also requires him to cooperate with authorities and answer questions about his time in the Islamic State group. He would not, though, be required to testify at Elsheikh's trial.The deal also requires him to meet with victims' families if they request it.Kotey gave a somewhat detailed account of his time in Islamic State when U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis asked him to explain in his own words what he had done.He said he traveled to Syria to “engage in a military fight against the Syrian forces of Bashar Assad” and that he eventually pledged allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.“I accept I will be perceived as a radical who holds extremist views,” he said.He acknowledged that he had participated in “capture-and-detain operations” to kidnap Foley and other Western hostages and that he led efforts to extract ransoms.He described the acts of violence that were inflicted on the hostages as a necessary part of keeping them in line and persuading Western governments to pay a ransom.In the years after the hostages had been killed, he said he filled multiple roles within the Islamic State, including as a sniper and as director of a special forces training camp.Prosecutor Dennis Fitzpatrick said at Thursday's hearing that Kotey, Elsheikh, and Emwazi were all friends at a young age in London, where they became radicalized.In a statement, Raj Parekh, acting US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who is also a member of the prosecution team on the Kotey and Elsheikh cases, said the case has always been focused on the victims and their families."Their resilience, courage, and perseverance have ensured that terror will never have the last word. The justice, fairness, and humanity that this defendant received in the United States stand in stark contrast to the cruelty, inhumanity, and indiscriminate violence touted by the terrorist organization he espoused,” Parekh said.Mueller also was raped by the Islamic State's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, according to the indictment. Al-Baghdadi was killed by US forces in Syria in 2019.Kotey and Elsheikh were captured in Syria in 2018 by the US-supported Syrian Democratic Forces while trying to escape to Turkey.Family members of all four victims attended Thursday's hearing and stood outside the courthouse afterward with prosecutors. They will have an opportunity to speak at Kotey's formal sentencing on March 4.James Foley's mother, Diane, said she was grateful for the conviction and praised prosecutors for obtaining a detailed account of Kotey's culpability.“This accountability is essential if our country wants to discourage hostage-taking," she said. Diane Foley also called on the US government to prioritize the return of all Americans being held abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/member-of-isis-beatles-cell-pleads-guilty-to-beheading-american-hostages-101630642967733.html
03-09-2021||World||Supreme authority, Iranian model: Taliban likely to announce government today||The Taliban are likely to announce a new administration after Friday afternoon prayers on the lines of the Iranian leadership with the group’s top spiritual leader Haibatullah Akhundzada as Afghanistan's supreme authority, according to reports. Bilal Karimi, a member of the group’s cultural commission, said on Thursday that the Taliban and other Afghan leaders have reached a “consensus” on the formation of a new government and cabinet under Akhundzada's leadership.“The consultations on forming an inclusive Afghan government within the Islamic Emirate’s leaders, with the leaders from the previous government and other influential leaders have officially ended,” Karimi was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. “They have reached a consensus. We’re about to announce a functioning cabinet and government in a few days, not weeks," he added.All eyes are on the Taliban whether Afghanistan's new rulers will keep their promise of a more "inclusive" government and be more accommodating than during their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001, which was notorious for its brutal and violent interpretation of Sharia, and its treatment of women. Women were not allowed to work and denied freedom of movement and girls were banned from school.Karimi said Haibatullah Akhundzada will be the top leader of any governing council, and Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, one of Akhundzada’s three deputies and the main public face of the Taliban, is likely to be in charge of the daily functioning of the government in Afghanistan. Senior Taliban leaders have said that Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada will monitor the government from Kandahar, the stronghold of the movement.Also read | With Taliban close to forming govt, Afghan women protest for their rightsThe Taliban government will follow the pattern of the Iranian leadership under which the supreme leader is the highest political and religious authority of the country, reported news agency PTI.

Samangani said the name of the new governance system, the national flag and the national anthem are yet to be finalised, he said.Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, the deputy leader of the Taliban political office in Doha, said that women and members from all tribes in Afghanistan will be part of the new government setup. Stanikzai also told BBC Pashto in an interview that while women could continue working, there "may not" be a place for them in the cabinet of any future government or any other top post.

The government has been considering holding the general election on Oct. 17.Suga was planning to reshuffle his cabinet and party executives, but those plans were no longer valid, two party sources told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.Fumio Kishida, a former foreign minister, is competing for the party leader post. On Thursday, Kishida criticised Suga's coronavirus response and urged a stimulus package to combat the pandemic.Unlike last year, grassroots LDP members will vote along with its members of parliament, which makes the outcome of the party leader race harder to predict.

"Officials must bear in mind that tightening epidemic prevention is the task of paramount importance which must not be loosened even a moment,” Kim said during a politburo meeting on Thursday, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Friday.While stressing the need for material and technical means of coronavirus prevention and increasing health workers' qualifications, Kim also called for “further rounding off our style epidemic prevention system,” KCNA said.Kim has earlier called for North Koreans to brace for prolonged Covid-19 restrictions, indicating the country's borders would stay closed despite worsening economic and food conditions. Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, North Korea has used tough quarantines and border closures to prevent outbreaks of the pandemic.On Tuesday, the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef), which procures and delivers vaccines on behalf of the COVAX distribution program, said North Korea proposed its allotment of about 3 million Sinovac shots be sent to severely affected nations instead. According to Unicef, North Korea’s health ministry has said it would continue to communicate with COVAX over future vaccines.Some experts believe that North Korea may want other vaccines while questioning the effectiveness of Sinovac and the rare blood clots seen in some recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Seoul’s Ewha Womans University, said North Korea is likely to receive more effective jabs from COVAX and then strategically allocate them domestically. “Pyongyang appears to have issues with COVAX involving legal responsibility and distribution reporting requirements. So it might procure vaccines from China to deliver to border regions and soldiers while allocating COVAX shots to less sensitive populations,” Easley said.“The Kim regime likely wants the most safe and effective vaccine for the elite, but administering Pfizer would require upgraded cold chain capability in Pyongyang and at least discreet discussions with the United States. The (Johnson & Johnson) option could also be useful to North Korea given that vaccine’s portability and one-shot regimen," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-orders-stricter-covid-19-steps-after-north-korea-shuns-vaccines-101630635972276.html

03-09-2021||World||Hurricane Ida: At least 44 dead as flash floods drown US states. 10 points||Hurricane Ida pummelled through at least four states in the northeast United States over the past day, triggering torrential rains and flash floods that swept away cars, submerged subway lines, and grounded airline flights from Virginia to New England. While it is difficult to zero in on an exact death toll, given the extent of the damages, most of the international news agencies reporting on the incident concur that at least 44 people have died so fa, including 13 in New York City, while many are still unaccounted for. Large swaths of the affected regions still remain waterlogged as officials struggle to provide an exact rundown of the situation.Hurricane Ida, one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to strike the US Gulf Coast, made landfall on Sunday in Louisiana, destroying entire communities.Here are the latest updates on the flash flood situation, triggered by Hurricane Ida, in the United States:1. At least 23 from New Jersey have perished in the massive flooding, according to the state's governor Phil Murphy. A victim at the Maplewood Township in New Jersey was swept away by the flash floods while he was apparently trying to remove debris from storm drains in the area, the police said.2. At least 13 people have lost their lives to Ida's remnant flooding in New York City, as per the Reuters news agency. Three of them were found dead in a basement at a borough in Queens, while four residents of Elizabeth, New Jersey, died at a public housing complex flooded by 8 feet (2.4m) of water.3. CNN estimates that the death toll from flooding had risen to 46, highlighting that "dozens" have died in at least six Eastern States -- Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia -- after the storm brought unprecedented rainfall to some areas. Deaths have also been reported from suburban Westchester County.4. Subway service in New York City remained "extremely limited," transit officials said, and commuter rail services to the suburbs were largely suspended. About 370 flights were canceled at New Jersey's Newark Liberty Airport.5. Emergencies were declared for New York state, New York City, and New Jersey. The governors of the respective states have urged residents to stay home as crews worked to clear roadways and restore service to subways and commuter rail lines serving millions of residents. In New York City alone, emergency responders have rescued hundreds of people from vehicles on flooded roads and hundreds of others from the submerged subway lines.6. Roadways were transformed into river-like torrents in minutes as the downpours struck on Wednesday night, trapping drivers in quickly rising floodwaters. In New York, nearly 500 vehicles were abandoned on flooded highways, garbage bobbed in streaming streets, and water cascaded into the city's subway tunnels, trapping at least 17 trains and disrupting service all day.7. Meanwhile, the National Weather Service said that two "tree-snapping tornadoes" struck Maryland on Wednesday, one in Annapolis and another in Baltimore. A 19-year-old was reported to have died after trying to rescue his mother from a flooded apartment in Rockville, reported the Washington Post.8. Hurricane Ida also made its presence felt in Philadelphia, where four people died as a result of the storm. A Connecticut state police sergeant, Brian Mohl, perished after his cruiser was swept away. Another death was reported in Maryland.9. Officials said at least five people died in Pennsylvania, including one killed by a falling tree and another who drowned in his car after helping his wife to escape. In Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia, the Schuylkill River inundated hotels, warehouses, and condominiums that line the river. Emergency squads were reported to be waiting for the waters to recede before starting evacuations of possibly hundreds of people who live in nearby apartments.10. Hurricane Ida's soggy remnants merged with a storm front and soaked the Interstate 95 corridor, meteorologists said. Similar weather has followed hurricanes before, but experts said it was slightly exacerbated by climate change — warmer air holds more rain — and urban settings, where expansive pavement prevents water from seeping into the ground.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-ida-at-least-44-dead-as-flash-floods-drown-us-states-10-points-101630631548272.html

He also wanted “pushing forward huge nature-remaking projects,” to mitigate damage caused by floods and typhoons, it said.The North Korean leader has issued rare warnings of economic struggles and food shortages in the past months, perhaps to prepare his people for hard times ahead. But Kim so far has shown no indication he’s willing to sit down for discussions with U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration on reducing his nuclear arsenal in return for economic incentives.North Korea is facing its worse food shortages in more than a decade, it said in a report to the United Nations a few months ago, giving the world notice Pyongyang is bracing for one of its biggest domestic challenges since Kim took power at the end of 2011. Kim told party leaders the dangers from what he called an abnormal climate have become higher in recent years. Food InsecurityNorth Korea’s perennial food shortages were made worse by typhoons in 2020 that wiped out crops and Kim’s decision to shut borders due to Covid, slamming the brakes on what little legal trade it has. According to the UN World Food Program, about 40% of North Korea’s population is undernourished, adding “food insecurity and malnutrition are widespread.”By making its problems public, Kim may be sending a signal to the Biden administration to allow more assistance through international organizations like the World Food Program. At the party meeting, Kim also called on officials to place “paramount importance” on tightening epidemic prevention, “given the further worsening worldwide health crisis,” KCNA said. Kim’s decision to shut borders at the start of the pandemic appears to have made North Korea’s food even more dire.North Korea says it has had no cases of Covid-19, but officials from the U.S., Japan and others highly doubt the claim. Kim meanwhile, has shunned offers of vaccines through the Covax program backed by the World Health Organization, apparently because it’s unwilling to follow the organization’s instructions and rules.North Korea most recently rejected Covax’s offer to provide around 3 million doses of Sinovac vaccines, according to NK News on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-warns-on-abnormal-climate-orders-land-overhaul-101630632771167.html

The deviation put the ship outside the air traffic control clearance area.The FAA is overseeing the probe; it's responsible for protecting the public during commercial launches and reentries. Crew safety, on the other hand, is outside its jurisdiction. Virgin Galactic insisted Thursday that Branson and everyone else on board were never in any added danger.“Virgin Galactic may not return the SpaceShipTwo vehicle to flight until the FAA approves the final mishap investigation report or determines the issues related to the mishap do not affect public safety,” the FAA said in a statement.Virgin Galactic acknowledged the space plane dropped below the protected airspace for one minute and 41 seconds. The spacecraft's free-flying portion of the up-and-down flight lasted about 15 minutes and reached an altitude of 53.5 miles (86 kilometers).Virgin Galactic said high-altitude wind caused the change in the flight path and insisted the two pilots “responded appropriately.” In a statement, the company said the flight was “a safe and successful test flight that adhered to our flight procedures and training protocols.”In another statement Thursday, Virgin Galactic added that “at no time did the ship travel above any population centers or cause a hazard to the public.” Virgin Galactic operates out of Spaceport America in the southern New Mexico desert.“We take this seriously and are currently addressing the causes of the issue and determining how to prevent this from occurring on future missions,” the company said.Branson ended up beating fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos — founder of Amazon as well as rocket company Blue Origin — into space by nine days. Bezos launched July 20 with three others from West Texas.Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin are vying to sell seats to tourists, scientists, and anyone else looking to experience a few minutes of weightlessness. Virgin Galactic's rocket ship is launched from an airplane, while Blue Origin's capsule is hoisted by a reusable New Shepard rocket.Virgin Galactic is aiming for late September or early October for its next flight, with two Italian Air Force officers, an engineer for the National Research Council of Italy, Virgin Galactic's chief astronaut instructor, and the rocketship's two pilots. It will be the company's first launch where researchers accompany their own experiments. The company plans to start flying ticket holders next year.Blue Origin has yet to announce a date for its next passenger flight, other than to say it will be soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-bans-virgin-galactic-spaceflights-while-probing-mishap-on-richard-branson-s-trip-101630631059330.html

According to a new Marist National Poll with NPR and PBS Newshour, US President Joe Biden's approval rating has fallen to a new low of 43 per cent, the lowest since he took office. The majority of Americans disapprove of the way Biden handles foreign policy, while a large section of the populace has also termed the United States' role in Afghanistan a "failure".Also Read | 'Maybe it’s because my deceased son': Biden on ending war in AfghanistanWhile Joe Biden's approval rating as the US president is currently at 43 per cent, about 56 per cent of Americans disapprove of his handling of foreign policy. Around 61 per cent of the populace is against the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, the data published by Marist Poll reveals. Although Americans are not sure about what exactly should have happened in Afghanistan, a large majority (around 71 per cent) say that United States' role was a "failure", the poll said.The 71 per cent of Americans who said so include 73 per cent of Republicans but also 66 per cent of Democrats, a large majority, hinting at a major dissent among Biden's own party colleagues. This section also includes around 75 per cent of independent politicians.A large majority of Americans or 61 per cent, however, seem to think Afghanistan "must determine its future without US involvement," while 29 per cent of the populace believe that it is the United States' "duty" to stay involved with the war-torn nation's affairs.When Americans were asked how the US ought to have handled the Afghanistan situation, opinions were varied and divided. While 37 per cent admit that all US troops should have been withdrawn, 38 per cent of the populace says that some troops should have been withdrawn and some left behind. Smaller proportions say no troops should have been withdrawn (10 per cent) or more troops should have been sent (5 per cent).Also Read | 'Not afraid, we are united': With Taliban close to forming govt, Afghan women protestFinally, the poll revealed that Americans do not think that the responsibility for the situation in Afghanistan rests solely on Biden. Overall, the largest section of all those who were polled, 36 per cent, ranked George W Bush as being the most responsible for the 'failure' of the military mission, followed by Joe Biden at 21 per cent, Barack Obama at 15 per cent, and Donald Trump at 12 per cent. Democrats, however, list Republicans Bush (53 per cent) and Trump (22 per cent) as their top two. Republicans list Democrats Biden (38 per cent) and Obama (34 per cent) as their top two.The Ashraf Ghani-led government in Afghanistan fell on August 15 following a Taliban blitzkrieg which saw the insurgents winning control of one province after another throughout the month, all while the United States continued to draw back its troops, ending its extended two-decade-long military mission in Afghanistan. The administration stuck to the August 31 deadline fixed by Joe Biden, even as critics raised concern over the deteriorating situation in the country in light of the Taliban offensive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-approval-rating-at-all-time-low-after-afghanistan-withdrawal-poll-shows-101630628681033.html
03-09-2021||World||'Not afraid, we are united': With Taliban close to forming govt, Afghan women protest||As many as 50 Afghan women in Afghanistan's western city of Herat protested on the streets in a rare, defiant protest for the right to work and over the lack of female participation in the new government to be formed by the Taliban, according to a report. The Taliban have said they were close to forming a new government as early as Friday, days after the US troops pulled out of Afghanistan amid chaos as desperate Afghans tried to flee the country.Basira Taheri, one of the organisers of the protest, told AFP she wanted the Taliban to include women in the new cabinet. "We want the Taliban to hold consultations with us. We don't see any women in their gatherings and meetings," Taheri said on Thursday."It is our right to have education, work and security. We are not afraid, we are united," the demonstrators said, according to an AFP journalist who witnessed the protest in the relatively cosmopolitan city, where girls have already returned to school.Also watch | How Afghan women hit the streets in Herat, refuse to bow down meekly to TalibanAFP reported citing two people familiar with the developments that the announcement of a cabinet may take place on Friday following afternoon prayers. All eyes are on whether the Taliban, who have pledged a softer brand of rule than during their brutal reign of 1996-2001, can keep their promise about women's participation and manage a war-torn economy.Also read | Taliban leaders keen to assess India’s stance towards groupSenior Taliban leader Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai has told BBC Pashto in an interview that while women could continue working, there "may not" be a place for them in the cabinet of any future government or any other top post.

"I want to say to the international community -- please do anything (you can) for Afghan women," Arghand, the former anchor for the Tolo News media group, said.During their first regime, the Taliban carried out brutal and violent interpretations of Islamic law and women were banned from school and work and denied freedom of movement. Any digression was handled with public floggings and even executions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-taliban-close-to-forming-govt-afghan-women-protest-for-their-rights-101630627220341.html
03-09-2021||World||Flights resume, some power restored in New Orleans after Hurricane Ida||Commercial flights resumed in New Orleans and power returned to parts of the business district Thursday, four days after Hurricane Ida slammed into the Gulf Coast, but electricity, drinking water and fuel remained scarce across much of a sweltering Louisiana.Meanwhile, the remnants of the system walloped parts of the Northeast, dumping record-breaking rain in a region that had not expected a serious blow and killing at least 45 people from Maryland to Connecticut. Eleven people in New York City drowned in basement apartments.New Orleans fared better than many other places because it was protected from catastrophic flooding by the levee system that was revamped after Hurricane Katrina. The power was back on before dawn in some downtown neighborhoods. Utility crews also restored electricity to several hospitals in Jefferson Parish and near Baton Rouge. Some streets were cleared of fallen trees and debris, and a few corner stores reopened.The city's main airport reopened to commercial flights for the first time since the hurricane. Delta was first airline to return, to be followed Friday by United Airlines and later by other carriers, officials said.Louisiana officials also reported a big drop late Thursday in the number of customers with no running water: 185,000, compared to more than 600,000 the day before.Still, the overwhelming majority of homes remained dark. In seven parishes, at least 95% of customers remained without power Thursday. Only 35,000 of the 405,000 homes and businesses in New Orleans and Jefferson Parish had power Thursday morning, according to the poweroutage.us website. Statewide, about 900,000 customers were without electricity, down from about 1.1 million at the height of the seventh named storm to hit Louisiana since the summer of 2020.“This isn’t our first rodeo, but it’s our worst rodeo,” Kirt LeBouef said as he wiped away tears while looking at damage to the Little Eagle restaurant in Golden Meadow, a 75-mile (120 kilometer) drive down a narrow highway from New Orleans toward the Gulf.LeBouef's family has owned the crawfish restaurant since 1920.Power should be restored to most customers around Baton Rouge area by Sept. 8. after workers finish assessing damage, Entergy Louisiana President Philip May said Thursday. Damage assessments are not as far along in the harder-hit regions, so Entergy said it has no timetable for getting service to those areas, which include New Orleans.Gasoline shortages were also a problem for people trying to run generators and waiting in drive-thru lines for food and water. The lines for gas stretched for blocks in many places from New Orleans to Baton Rouge.President Joe Biden also ordered the release of extra fuel from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ensure a steady supply. He said he would also provide utilities with satellite images to help restore power.“We know that there is much to be done in this response on our part,” said Biden, who was getting hourly updates on the recovery. “We need to get power restored. We need to get more food, fuel and water deployed.”Ida knocked out Port Fourchon, the primary hub to support offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and send that oil on its way to refineries. Port leaders said the damage to structures where the powerful eye came ashore was not as bad as feared.“The majority of them are still good, and we can get things back up and running,” said Chett Chiasson, executive director for the Greater Lafourche Port Commission, who did not give an exact estimate on reopening the facilities.The president was scheduled to visit Louisiana on Friday to survey the damage from Ida, which hit Sunday with 150 mph (230 kph) winds and was tied for the fifth-strongest hurricane ever to strike the mainland U.S.At least 13 deaths were blamed on the storm in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, including two 19-year-old utility employees who were electrocuted Tuesday as they were restoring power near Birmingham, Alabama. Authorities blamed several other deaths on carbon monoxide poisoning.The deaths of three Louisiana nursing home residents were classified Thursday as storm-related. Investigators from the Louisiana Department of Health were kicked off the property Tuesday, the agency said. Spokeswoman Aly Neel said officials had heard reports of deteriorating conditions at the site, including people lying on mattresses on the floor and not being fed or changed.Outside New Orleans, neighborhoods remained flooded and residents were still reeling. Lafourche Parish President Archie Chaisson said 25% of the homes in his parish of 100,00 people were gone or had catastrophic damage, and up to 40% more had severe damage from winds that blew at over 100 mph (160 kph) for 12 hours.“This storm is more than just a New Orleans event. Lafourche took the brunt of this storm,” Chaisson said at a briefing.Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses in the state were told to boil their water before using it.Evacuees considering returning home to Terrebonne Parish were warned by emergency officials on Twitter that “there are no shelters, no electricity, very limited resources for food, gasoline and supplies and absolutely no medical services.”Louisiana’s largest hospital system, Ochsner Health, was considering opening a field hospital somewhere in Terrebonne or Lafourche parish because the shuttering of most of the hospitals in the area removed about 250 to 300 beds.Declining numbers of Covid-19 patients and restoration of power at additional sites helped Ochsner Health recover, CEO Warner Thomas said during an online news conference. The Ochsner system’s Covid-19 patient count fell to 663 from 990 about a week ago, Thomas said. That coincides with the state’s overall declining case numbers.Hard-hit areas in southeast Louisiana were also under a heat advisory Thursday. Forecasters warned that combined heat and humidity could make some areas feel like 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flights-resume-some-power-restored-in-new-orleans-after-hurricane-ida-101630627629516.html
03-09-2021||World||Death toll tops 40 after remnants of hurricane Ida drowns Northeast US||A stunned US East Coast faced a rising death toll, surging rivers, tornado damage and continuing calls for rescue Thursday after the remnants of Hurricane Ida walloped the region with record-breaking rain, drowning more than 40 people in their homes and cars.In a region that had been warned about potentially deadly flash flooding but hadn't braced for such a blow from the no-longer-hurricane, the storm killed at least 45 people from Maryland to Connecticut on Wednesday night and Thursday morning.At least 23 people died in New Jersey, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said. At least 12 people in New York City, police said, one of them in a car and 11 in flooded basement apartments that often serve as relatively affordable homes in one of the nation’s most expensive housing markets. Suburban Westchester County reported three deaths.Officials said at least five in Pennsylvania, including one killed by a falling tree and another who drowned in his car after helping his wife to escape, according to authorities. A Connecticut state police sergeant, Brian Mohl, perished after his cruiser was swept away. Another death was reported in Maryland.In New York City, Sophy Liu said she tried using towels and garbage bags to stop the water coming into her first-floor apartment in Queens, but the flood rose up to her chest in just a half hour. She roused her son from bed and put him in a life jacket and inflatable swimming ring.The door stuck when she tried to open it, possibly from water pressure, she said. She called two friends who helped her jar it loose.“I was obviously scared, but I had to be strong for my son. I had to calm him down,” she recalled Thursday as medical examiners removed three bodies from a home down the street.In another part of Queens, water rapidly filled Deborah Torres' first-floor apartment to her knees as her landlord frantically urged her neighbors below — who included a baby — to get out, she said. But the water rushed in so strongly that she surmised they weren't able to open the door. The three residents died.“I have no words," she said. “How can something like this happen?”Ida's remnants maintained a soggy core, then merged with a storm front and soaked the Interstate 95 corridor, meteorologists said. Similar weather has followed hurricanes before, but experts said it was slightly exacerbated by climate change — warmer air holds more rain — and urban settings, where expansive pavement prevents water from seeping into the ground.The National Hurricane Center had warned since Tuesday of the potential for “significant and life-threatening flash flooding" and major river flooding in the mid-Atlantic region and New England.Still, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the storm's strength took them by surprise."We did not know that between 8:50 and 9:50 p.m. last night, that the heavens would literally open up and bring Niagara Falls level of water to the streets of New York,” said Hochul, a Democrat who became governor last week after former Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned.De Blasio, also a Democrat, said he'd gotten a forecast Wednesday of 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 cm) of rain for the day. The city's Central Park ended up getting 3.15 inches in just one hour, surpassing the previous one-hour high of 1.94 inches (5 cm) during Tropical Storm Henri on Aug. 21.Wednesday's storm ultimately dumped over 9 inches (23 cm) of rain in parts of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and nearly as much on New York City’s Staten Island.In Washington, President Joe Biden assured Northeast residents that federal first responders were on the ground to help clean up.In New York, some highways flooded, garbage bobbed in streaming streets and water cascaded into the city's subway tunnels, trapping at least 17 trains and halting service until early morning. Videos online showed riders standing on seats in swamped cars. All riders safely evacuated, officials said.At one Queens development, water filled the sunken patio of a basement apartment, then broke through a glass door, trapping a 48-year-old woman in 6 feet (2 meters) of water. Neighbors unsuccessfully tried for an hour to save her.“She was screaming, ‘Help me, help me, help me!’ We all came to her aid, trying to get her out," said the building’s assistant superintendent, Jayson Jordan, but "the thrust of the water was so strong.”Residents said they have complained for years about flooding on another Queens street, where a woman and her 22-year-old son died in a basement apartment. Her husband and the couple's other son were spared only because they stepped out to move a car, next-door neighbor Lisa Singh said.“No one should have to go this way. I feel like this was 100% avoidable,” she said.In Elizabeth, New Jersey, rain and river flooding in an apartment complex killed four people and forced 600 from their homes, Mayor J. Christian Bollwage said.Greg Turner, who lives elsewhere in the northern New Jersey city, said his 87-year-old mother started calling 911 at 8 p.m., when the water started rising in her apartment. High water kept him and his brother from getting to her.As midnight approached, the water reached her neck, he said. Rescuers finally cut through the floor of the apartment above and pulled her to safety.“She lost everything," Turner said as he headed to a bank for money to buy his mother clothes and shoes.In New Jersey's Milford Borough, authorities said they found a man’s body in a car buried up to its hood in dirt and rocks.The ferocious storm also spawned at least seven tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service. One split trees on Cape Cod, another tore off part of a high school roof in suburban Philadelphia and yet another splintered homes and toppled silos in Mullica Hill, New Jersey, south of Philadelphia."It just came through and ripped,” said resident Jeanine Zubrzycki, 33, who hid in her basement with her three children as their house shook and lights flickered.“And then you could just hear people crying,” said Zubrzycki, 33, whose home was damaged but liveable.Record flooding along the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania inundated homes, highways and commercial buildings, even as meteorologists warned that rivers likely won’t crest for a few more days. The riverside community of Manayunk remained largely under water.The Schuyilkill reached levels not seen in over 100 years in Philadelphia, where firefighters were still getting calls about minor building collapses and people stuck in flooded cars Thursday morning. The managers of a 941-unit apartment complex near the river ordered residents to evacuate, citing “deteriorating” conditions after water rushed into the parking garage and pool areas.In suburban Bucks County, several firefighters had to be rescued after rushing floodwaters pinned a rescue boat against a bridge pier, state emergency management director Randy Padfield said.Others were unable to escape the floods, including Donald Bauer, who was driving home to Perkiomenville with his wife after attending their daughter’s volleyball game at DeSales University, near Allentown.Their SUV stalled in the water and floated into a house, breaking the back windshield, said Darby Bauer, who was on the phone with his parents when the engine died. Donald Bauer helped his wife, Katherine, escape out the broken windshield and urged her to go, their son said.She clung to a tree and watched the rising waters carry the SUV out of sight, he said. She was rescued about an hour later and hospitalized.Donald Bauer, a 65-year-old retired school bus driver, “had one of the biggest hearts we knew,” his son said. “He was selfless down to his last act.”Authorities used boats to rescue people in places from North Kingstown, Rhode Island, to Frederick County, Maryland, where 10 children and a driver were pulled from a school bus caught in rising waters.On Sunday, Ida struck Louisiana as the fifth-strongest storm to ever hit the US mainland, leaving 1 million people without power, maybe for weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-tops-40-after-remnants-of-hurricane-ida-drowns-northeast-us-101630623442306.html

03-09-2021||World||‘Incorrect politics’, ‘effeminate styles’ banned from screens in China||China on Thursday broadened its crackdown on the entertainment industry, directing broadcasters to bar artistes with “immoral” records and “incorrect political positions”, and ban men who are “effeminate” in their performance styles.A “patriotic atmosphere” should be cultivated and propagated in entertainment shows, China’s National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) said in a notice published on its website on Thursday. It further said unhealthy content has to be regulated and television stars’ paychecks have to be capped.“Individuals with a wrong political stance, those who go against the country and the Communist Party of China (CPC), should not be employed by the industry. The same goes for those who violate Chinese laws or social moralities,” read an English translation of the NRTA notice as reported by The Global Times.The notice made a specific mention of banning what it called “abnormal aesthetics”, describing it as style propagated by “feminine men” on television.Entertainment involving “vulgar” internet celebrities, scandals and flaunting of wealth should be rejected, it added.The new rules come in the backdrop of a number of scandals - ranging from tax evasion and rape allegations - involving popular online and television actors. The stars involved have huge online following and are icons for several brands.Last week, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said it will crack down on the chaotic culture of online celebrity fan culture as part of the campaign to correct the internet sector.The CAC announced that it would clamp down on algorithms that encourage fans to spend large amounts of money in support of celebrities.The call for an end to stars who are seen as too “feminine” has been on the rise in China.Chinese news agency Xinhua, too, has denounced fan culture, arguing that fan loyalty “can turn blind and toxic, giving rise to online trolling, impulsive buying, rumour-mongering, cyberspace manhunts and other problems”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-broadens-crackdown-on-entertainment-industry-101630566850850.html
03-09-2021||India||Congress sets up panel on caste-census||Amid a growing chorus for caste-based census and sub-categorisation of castes in the country, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday set up a committee, headed by former Union minister Verappa Moily, to “study the matter”.According to a statement issued by Congress, the panel will comprise senior leaders Abhishek Singhvi, Salman Khurshid, Mohan Prakash, RPN Singh, PLPunia and Kuldeep Bishnoi.“The last publicised caste census was conducted during the British Raj, for the past many years, all political parties depended on manipulated figures of OBCs and make both political and economic programmes based on distorted figures. Even the Mandal Commission was based upon imaginary figures,” panel chairman Moily told HT.“As there was no data, UPA decided to have a socio-economic caste census to make its social and welfare programmes more fruitful. That’s how the SECC was ordered. A caste census is necessary as we are building a castle without foundation,” he added.On August 23, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar led an 11-member delegation and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to demand caste-wise enumeration of the Other Backward Classes in the census. The Centre had informed the Lok Sabha in July that it would not enumerate caste-wise population, except those for the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).The clamour for a caste-based census has also risen in the wake of the upcoming polls in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and other states in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-sets-up-panel-on-castecensus-101630693460442.html
03-09-2021||India||Odisha police detain editor of a web portal after Olympian Dutee Chand alleges harassment||Odisha Police on Friday detained the editor of a web-channel for questioning following harassment allegations levelled against him by Olympian Dutee Chand.Sudhansu Sekhar Rout, editor of web-channel Focus TV was picked up from his office at Jharpara in Bhubaneswar and taken to the Mahila Police Station for questioning.“Based on the complaint of athlete Dutee Chand at Mahila Police Station on Wednesday, a case was registered against Rout. Dutee has made serious allegations ranging from threats, defamation, sexual harassment insulting modesty and others against Sudhanshu Sekhar Rout,” Bhubaneswar DCP Umashankar Dash said.The sprinter had lodged a complaint with the Mahila Police Station against Rout, a reporter of the web channel Smruti Ranjan Behera and RTI activist Pradip Pradhan for allegedly publishing defamatory new stories against her during her participation at the recently held Tokyo Olympics 2020.A case was registered under multiple Sections of the IPC, including 292-2 (obscene and indecent publication), 354-A (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 506 (criminal intimidation), 385 (putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy).“I was mentally harassed and had to face character assassination.

On Friday, Kerala reported 29,322 new Covid-19 cases and 131 deaths, taking the state’s cumulative tally to 4,151,455. The toll in the state has reached 21,280. The test positivity rate – the number of samples that test positive – in the past week stands at 18.4%, while average of 29,307 cases per day were reported in the state in the last week.“There is an alarming situation in Kerala. With over 30,000 cases reported daily, the state alone accounts for nearly 70 per cent of cases reported in the country. Children of tender age cannot be exposed to any risk in this situation,” observed a bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Hrishikesh Roy and CT Ravikumar. The bench was hearing an appeal, filed by advocate A Rasoolshan, against the Kerala high court’s refusal to interfere with the state government’s decision on holding physical exams. In its order on August 27, the HC observed that conducting examination was a matter of government policy and no interference was warranted. Challenging the HC decision, the petitioner told the top court that holding physical exams was a huge risk since children have not yet been vaccinated. According to the petitioner, about 350,000 students are expected to take the examination. Acknowledging the petitioner’s concern, the top court bench said: “Prima facie, we find force in the submission made by the petitioner that the state government has not seriously considered the prevailing situation before deciding to conduct physical examination (for Class 11).” But the Kerala government, represented by advocate CK Sasi, said that the state has taken all precautions, asserting that Class 10 and 12 examinations in April were held without any problems.The bench then asked: “Is the TPR then in April and now the same?”. “Can you assure us that not a single child will be infected? Even if one case gets reported, we will hold you accountable,” it added. “I cannot give that assurance,” Sasi said in response.“As we could not get any satisfactory response from the state government, we grant interim relief staying the offline examination till the next date of hearing,” said the bench.“Kerala has one of the best medical infrastructures in the country. Despite this, the state has not been able to contain the number of cases (due to Covid),” the court observed, adding that it felt allowing unvaccinated children from different parts of the state to gather at an examination centre could be a potential “superspreader” event. The top court bench issued a notice on the petition to the Kerala government and put the examination on hold till September 13 -- the next date of hearing.This is not the first instance where Kerala has been hauled up by the top court for its decisions during the Covid-19 pandemic. In July, the state government’s decision to relax lockdown restrictions in view of Eid-ul-Zuha festivities was challenged before the top court. The court had then slammed the state’s decision as “extremely alarming” and said that if the decision of the state resulted in any untoward spread of Covid infection, any member of the public would be free to approach the Court after which action will be accordingly taken. As two days of restriction got over by the date when the order was passed, the state government decided not to continue with further relaxation of lockdown curbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apex-court-stays-offline-exams-in-kerala-amid-alarming-covid-spike-101630692086150.html

Kitex Garments sought a directive to the Kerala government to allow it to administer the second dose of Covishield to its workers before the completion of the 84-day dose gap.Also Read| Covid vaccine drive to speed up further in September; 240 mn to be inoculatedKitex Garments said in its petition that over 5,000 of its workers already received the first vaccine dose and it is arranging for the second dose for nearly ₹93 lakhs, but the garment company is unable to administer it because of the dose gap restriction. Advocate Blaze K Jose, appearing for Kitex, told news agency PTI on Tuesday that he argued before the Kerala high court that the Union govt can impose the mandatory 84-day gap between the doses if people were availing the vaccine through them.However, if people are paying it from their pocket, they should be allowed to take the dose after four weeks, which is the minimum prescribed gap between the Covishield doses, advocate Jose further told the court.On Friday, the Union govt’s affidavit said India’s vaccination drive is built on “scientific and epidemiological evidence” and the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) guidelines and global best practices. It said the dose interval underwent revisions based on available and emerging scientific evidence mentioned above with the overall guidance of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration (NEGVAC’s) for Covid-19.“This is based on the technical opinion that the duration of 84 days between 1st and 2nd doses of Covishield is providing the best protection against Covid-19, ” the Union govt’s affidavit read and said the grounds advanced by Kitex Garments in its petition were false and frivolous and deserve to be dismissed.However, the Union govt told the high court that it had allowed administering the second dose before the prescribed time period of 12-16 weeks in certain cases. These included people who are seeking to travel abroad for education, employment or were a part of the Indian contingent to the Tokyo Olympics 2020. “As per the evidence available, the immunity provided by two doses of the Covishield vaccine with intervals less than 12-16 weeks would be better than partial vaccination,” the Union govt’s petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/84day-gap-between-covishield-doses-provides-best-protection-govt-to-kerala-hc-101630688020918.html

Former Congress leader Priyanka Chaturvedi took exception to the adjectives as slammed Manish Tewari for "rubbishing a woman's sexual assault.""Today I got to know that Tarun Tejpal was ‘honorably exonerated’ and ‘politically persecuted’. To rubbish a woman’s sexual assault by this cosy club, smacks of their sick mindset. They believe they can behave as they wish around women and laugh off the serious crime. Shameful," Priyanka Chaturvedi wrote. To this, Manish Tewari said as a lawyer he knows how to read a judgment and cited the verdict in which Tarun Tejpal was found innocent. "Goa Government has gone to High Court.If you have a problem say what you have too in the High Court of Mumbai & Goa," Tewari wrote.Chaturvedi gave it back to Tewari as she said Twitter is a free platform and if the Congress leader has the right to "pat the back of an alleged rapist", she also has the right to an opinion. Unlike you @manishtewari just being a lawyer and ability to read a judgement does not put you on a higher plain. Also this is a free platform I have a right to opinion as much as you have a right to pat the back of an alleged rapist. https://t.co/ACv2RAIc8c"Please do not cross the line of libel & defamation.I would be anguished to take a fellow MP & former Colleague to Court," Manish Tewari replied.As several Twitter users joined the exchange of barbs, Tewari replied to many of them and also dug out a screenshot of Priyanka Chaturvedi extending birthday wishes to Suhel Seth who was accused of sexual misconduct.
03-09-2021||India||Veerappa Moily to head Congress panel on caste census||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday set up a committee headed by former Union minister Veerappa Moily to look into the issue of caste census, after many parties have demanded a caste-based census and sub-categorisation of castes in the country, though the Centre has remained non-committal on the sensitive issue. The panel will also have Abhishek Singhvi, Salman Khurshid, Mohan Prakash, RPN Singh, PL Punia and Kuldeep Bishnoi, a Congress release said. The communication from the party said the committee will “study the matter related to caste-census”. Panel chairman Moily told HT, the last publicized caste census was done during the British Raj, for the past many years, all political parties depended on manipulated figures of OBCs and made both political and economic programmes based on distorted figures. Even the Mandal Commission was based on imaginary figures. “As there was no data, the UPA decided to have a socio-economic caste census to make its social and welfare programmes more fruitful. That’s how the SECC was ordered. A caste census is necessary as we are building a castle without foundation,” said Moily. On August 23, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar led an 11-member delegation and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to demand caste-wise enumeration of OBCs in the census. The Centre had informed the Lok Sabha in July that it would not enumerate caste-wise population, except those for the SCs and STs. The clamour for a caste-based census has also risen in the wake of the upcoming polls in UP, Punjab and other states in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/veerappa-moily-to-head-congress-panel-on-caste-census-101630683380000.html

The rapid response teams/ward level committees, neighbourhood clusters and the concerned officials of police, revenue health and local self-government departments shall be responsible for ensuring the same,” a state government order read.The order added that the above agencies should also help in providing home delivery of essential items to the quarantined people, in case they face any difficulties. “Action shall be taken against the persons, violating the norms of quarantine, invoking the provisions of DM act, Kerala state epidemic act and other legal provisions in force,” it further said.Kerala government issues order stating that strict action will be taken against those violating the norms of quarantine.

The members should also not use utensils or any other objects of the patient, she added.After recording over 30,000 cases for the past few days, Kerala’s daily tally of Covid-19 saw a fall on Friday as 29,322 new cases were recorded, pushing the caseload to over 4.15 million.

03-09-2021||India||A reflection on UP cops, says SC after Delhi Police trace missing girl in 24 hrs||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday chided the Uttar Pradesh Police for its lackadaisical attitude in handling a case involving a minor girl missing for almost two months after the Delhi Police traced her in less than 24 hours of the top court’s directions.The bench told the Delhi Police to find the missing girl on Wednesday on a petition filed by her mother, who worked as a domestic help in the national capital. She said the family was visiting their native village in Gorakhpur in July when the girl went missing and a complaint was lodged by the family at Gorakhpur police station on July 9. But the Uttar Pradesh police, she complained, hadn’t acted on crucial call detail records of her 13-year old daughter and the accused.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) RS Suri, appearing for the Delhi Police, submitted that a police team flew to Kolkata on Wednesday and recovered the girl who is since in the safe custody of the police and is expected to arrive in Delhi soon. The man, who her parents suspected to be the abductor, was also arrested.Happy over the prompt action by Delhi Police, the bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Hrishikesh Roy, and CT Ravikumar said, “This is certainly a reflection on the Uttar Pradesh police of what they could not do for two months.”The bench told advocate Vinod Diwakar appearing for the UP Police, “The case involves a 13-year old girl. Our only anxiety was that a lot of other things could have happened. Without realising the seriousness of the case and the urgency of the situation, you (UP Police) requested two months additional time. This should not have been the response of the state police.”The court directed the Delhi Police to conduct the medical examination of the girl and provide any necessary psychological counseling to her. After completing all required formalities, the court said the girl should be handed back to her parents.Advocate Amit Pai who appeared for the girl’s mother urged the court to consider issuing guidelines for the police to act in such a situation where a person is reported missing. In her petition, the mother apprehended that her daughter may have been sexually assaulted or traded for prostitution as the accused person had criminal antecedents. The bench said that would not be needed as the police are expected to rescue victims in such situations.Earlier, on Wednesday, the court questioned the UP Police for not acting upon the call detail records as it said, “For the victim’s mother, every hour is precious. You must understand their anxiety in such a case.” While handing over further probe of the case to the Delhi Police, the court had asked the UP Police to continue with the investigation and extend full cooperation to the Delhi Police. A direction was also issued to transfer the case records as well. The bench directed the Delhi Police to file a compliance report by September 7, the next date of hearing, when the court will decide whether to transfer the probe to Delhi Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-reflection-on-up-cops-says-sc-after-delhi-police-trace-missing-girl-in-24-hrs-101630681700071.html

In a virtual address at the plenary session of the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF) being held in Vladivostok, Modi said the friendship between India and Russia has “stood the test of time”, as reflected by recent cooperation during the Covid-19 pandemic, including in the field of vaccines. EEF is an international meet held annually in Vladivostok to encourage foreign investments in Russia’s resource-rich but underdeveloped Far East. Russia has actively wooed India to invest in the region, and Modi had announced a $1-billion line of credit for the Far East while speaking as the chief guest at the last EEF meet in 2019. “Energy is another major pillar of our strategic partnership. India-Russia energy partnership can help bring stability to the global energy market,” Modi said in his address. Noting that petroleum and natural gas minister Hardeep Puri is in Vladivostok to represent India at EEF, Modi said Indian workers were participating in gas projects in the “Amur region, from Yamal to Vladivostok and onward to Chennai”. He added, “We envisage an energy and trade bridge. I am happy that the Chennai-Vladivostok maritime corridor is making headway. This connectivity project, along with the International North-South [Transport] Corridor will bring India and Russia physically closer to each other.” Modi said state-run Mazagon Docks Limited, one of India’s largest shipyards, will partner with the Russian ship-building facility at Zvezda to build “some of the most important commercial ships in the world”. India and Russia are partners in space exploration through the Gaganyaan programme, and the two sides will also partner in opening the Northern Sea Route for international trade, he said. Lauding President Vladimir Putin’s vision for developing the Far East, Modi reiterated India’s commitment to act as a reliable partner for Russia as part of the “Act East” policy. Modi stressed the importance of greater economic and commercial engagement between the two countries in line with their special and privileged strategic partnership. He highlighted the health and pharmaceutical sectors as important areas of collaboration that emerged during the pandemic, and referred to other potential areas of economic cooperation such as diamonds, coking coal and rare earth minerals. Puri is leading a delegation that includes representatives of leading Indian oil and gas companies to attend the India-Russia business dialogue within the EEF framework. A virtual meeting between Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani and the governor of Russia’s Sakha-Yakutia province was held on Thursday on the margins of EEF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-russia-can-bring-stability-to-energy-market-pm-modi-at-eastern-economic-forum-101630681159923.html
03-09-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: September 4, 1948 — State-ownership of Reserve Bank; Nationalization Bill passed||New Delhi- Sitting beyond scheduled time, Parliament this evening passed the Bill to nationalize the Reserve Bank of India and the Bill to amend the Indian Cotton Cess Act. The clause most hotly disputed in the Reserve Bank Bill was the one relating to compensation. Prof. K T Shah moved an amendment suggesting that the Government should pay to shareholders only Rs. 114 for each 100-rupee share instead of Rs. 118/10 as provided for in the Bill. The shareholders, he declared, had done nothing to earn the bonus which was proposed to be given to them. Neither they nor the Directors had raised their little finger during the period when Indian gold was being drained away by foreigners. Those opposed to the amendment based their arguments on two factors. One was that the Government having promised this rate of compensation, it would be impolitic and even harmful to go back on it. The other consideration was that the shareholders were mainly people of small means and should not be grudged what they had begun to expect. The Finance Minister, Mr Neogy, explained that shareholders had been receiving 4 per cent as dividend instead of 5. Moreover, the figure as provided for in the Bill had been arrived at after careful consideration, and the Government would not therefore accept the amendment. The amendment was defeated. The Bill was passed amidst applause, with a few amendments, some of them have been sponsored by the Finance Minister himself. Consideration of the Cotton Cess Bill was unexpectedly prolonged mainly because of a 20-minute speech by a back bencher, Mr Satish Chandra, who criticized both the membership and working of the Cess Committee. His complaint was that the Committee did not represent the interests of either the industry or the growers. Mr Sidhwa said that the Committee should conduct research to grow finer varieties of cotton. The Agriculture Minister, Mr Jairamdas Daulatram, promised to give favourable consideration to all the suggestions. He said that if any member in the Committee did not represent the real interests of the growers of the trade, he would be removed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-september-4-1948-state-ownership-of-reserve-bank-nationalization-bill-passed-101630680500527.html
03-09-2021||India||'What has Rajiv Gandhi…': BJP MP advocates renaming Nagarhole National Park after KM Cariappa||A member of Parliament from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday advocated renaming the 'Rajiv Gandhi Nagarhole National Park' after Field Marshal KM Cariappa, the first Indian commander-in-chief of the Indian Army. BJP MP Pratap Simha argued that the name of a city, place, or road should have some significance and the local people should relate to it.“What has Rajiv Gandhi got to do with Nagarhole National Park? I have suggested the name of Field Marshal Cariappa. He was the most celebrated Army officer,” the lawmaker from Karnataka told news agency ANI.Earlier this week, Simha had requested Karnataka's forest minister Umesh V Katti to rename the national park to 'FM KM Cariappa Nagarhole National Park & Tiger Reserve' as a “fitting tribute to remarkable service rendered by him while serving in Army." In a letter dated August 30, Simha said that three national parks are named after Rajiv Gandhi and several others are named after the Gandhi-Nehru family, claiming it was an attempt to wrongfully appropriate inheritance of the Central government’s projects aimed at biodiversity conservation.Highlighting the achievement of Field Marshal Cariappa, the BJP MP said that the first commander-in-chief is credited to have laid the foundation for transforming the Indian Army as one of the most disciplined and battle-hardy units to ensure national security and national unity. He further stated that Kodagu has the rare distinction of 20 serving Major Generals and four Air Marshals, making it a “Land of Generals.”“Field Marshal Cariappa was the 1st Indian Commander-in-Chief (of Indian Army). He was proud son of Kodagu, after his retirement he came back to Kodagu & died there. He had so much love for Kodagu...What's the need to name everything after Gandhi-Nehru family?,” ANI quoted Simha as saying.During Tokyo Olympics, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his decision to rechristen Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award, the highest sporting honour in the country, after Major Dhyan Chand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-has-rajiv-gandhi-bjp-mp-advocates-renaming-nagarhole-national-park-after-km-cariappa-101630676887977.html
03-09-2021||India||Delhi Police chargesheet reads like ‘Family Man' script: Umar Khalid’s lawyer to court||Former JNU student Umar Khalid's lawyer senior advocate Trideep Pais on Friday sought bail for Khalid in the Delhi riots case and said the chargesheet filed by the Delhi Police reads like a script of Amazon Prime's 'Family Man', Livelaw reported. The chargesheet used rhetorics like 'veteran of sedition' (referring to Umar Khalid) and reads like "a 9pm news script of one of those shouting news channels," the lawyer said adding that the investigating officer has "fertile imagination"."Please understand, he's not writing the script of Family Man. He is writing a chargesheet... This is the kind of stuff which is read and peddled, the creation of public opinion in order to substitute the lack of evidence to carry out your objective of unfairly prosecute people when you have no material to do so," Pais argued.In framing the chargesheet, the Delhi Police largely relied on the 2016 chargesheet against Umar Khalid in JNU sedition case. "What happened in 2016 was that there was a poetry session. It was later termed as sedition. Nowhere was it ever alleged that 'Bharat tere tukde honge' was ever said by Umar Khalid," the advocate submitted before additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat.Pais could not complete his argument and the court will now hear the case again on Monday.The argument made by Umar Khalid's lawyer revolved around the point that the Delhi Police has lent a communal colour in its chargesheet to project Umar Khalid communal in front of the public. "If you are saying CAA is bad, it means you believe in this country and secularism. But Delhi Police chargesheet paints anti-CAA protesters as communal," he submitted.Khalid, along with several others accused of being the mastermind of the February 2020 violence, was booked under the UAPA. In April, Umar Khalid was granted bail in one of the riot cases, saying that he was not present at the scene of the crime. But he continued to be in jail in connection with the case in which UAPA has been invoked against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-chargesheet-reads-like-family-man-script-umar-khalid-s-lawyer-to-court-101630673815212.html

The court had granted Centre six weeks then to fix the amount of ex-gratia. This period was further extended by four weeks on August 16.Appearing for the Centre, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had sought another week to file the government’s response. The bench of justices MR Shah and Aniruddha Bose said, “By the time you will take steps, even the third wave (of Covid-19 pandemic) will be over. Our orders directing correction of death certificates was passed long back. You had agreed to file a response on our directions by today. We will now grant you a last opportunity.”The court asked for the affidavit to be filed by September 11 and posted the matter for hearing on September 13.Also Read | SC puts interim stay on Kerala’s decision to hold Class 11 exam from Sep 6Advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal, who filed the public interest litigation (PIL) resulting in the June 30 order, said, “It is unfortunate that the Centre is delaying compliance,” Bansal said.An intervention application filed by persons seeking benefit of ex-gratia payment for Covid deaths informed the court that the last date for framing the ex-gratia scheme was September 8. The bench said, “As regards ex-gratia, we extended time on the last occasion. It is up to the Centre to comply with our orders.”The June 30 judgment held that the kin of persons who died due to Covid will be entitled for ex-gratia compensation under Section 12(iii) of the DMA 2005 since Covid-19 was declared a notified disaster under the 2005 Act. Although persons killed in a notified disaster are entitled to a sum of ₹4 lakh as ex-gratia, according to a letter of April 8, 2015 issued by the Ministry of home affairs, the court did not fix the quantum of compensation but left it to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to consider the same.Two major directions by the court included issuance of simplified guidelines for certificate stating the exact cause of death as “Death due to Covid-19”. Such guidelines, according to the court, were to also consider persons who died within two to three months of being found Covid-positive. The court also directed the Centre to provide a mechanism for the families of those whose death certificates had already been issued to get the same corrected. The court also directed the Centre to take appropriate steps in line with the recommendations of the Fifteenth Finance Commission providing for a National Insurance Scheme for disaster-related deaths. As per the finance commission, such a scheme could work as a Social Protection Scheme without increasing the financial burden on the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-gives-govt-till-sept-11-for-guidelines-on-issuing-covid-death-certificates-101630672099524.html

They also lag in infrastructure development.Also Read | Rural economy kept steady during CovidAbout 11.2 million or 38% of all households in regions of the country deemed Japanese-encephalitis endemic have access to clean piped water critical to improving health outcomes, up from about 2.9% in 2019, an official said, requesting anonymity.Under the flagship Mission, another 11.8 million households, or 35% of the total, have been provided with tap water connection in the aspirational districts, up from 7.9% in 2019, the latest data show.Under the Jal Jeevan Mission-Har Ghar Jal scheme, every rural household is to be provided with a functional tap water connection by 2024. Over 120 million households in India lack access to clean water near their homes, the highest in the world, according to a UN Water report of 2014.India has 189 million rural households, according to Census data. Across India, slightly over 80 million or 42.5% of total rural households have been covered under the piped drinking water mission so far, official data show.The country has had several public programmes to bring clean water to rural residences, such as the National Drinking Water Mission launched in 1986. But the goal of providing piped drinking water to every household entered a “mission mode” with the Har Ghar Jal programme (water for every home) under the Jal Jeevan Mission.Also Read | Fortified rice not enough to tackle malnutrition: ExpertsPoor-quality water causes diseases such as diarrhoea, the third leading cause of childhood mortality in India, according to researchers Subitha Lakshminarayanan and Ramakrishnan Jayalakshmy, who work at Puducherry’s Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research and Indira Gandhi Medical College.The Gajendra Shekhawat-led Jal Shakti ministry oversees the implementation of the rural household water mission.“As per the very design of the scheme, aspirational districts have a priority when comes to laying water infrastructure. Similarly, priority is also accorded to areas with Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes population. This has led to a faster rate of implementation in priority areas,” a second official said, requesting anonymity.The Union budget allotted ₹10,001 crore in 2019-20 for the national rural drinking water mission. In 2020-21, ₹11,500 crore were provided. The Union budget 2021-22 allotted ₹50,000 crore for the Mission.Experts say a key challenge is to maintain the sustainability of water supply sources. In previous attempts to provide drinking water supply, villages connected with water sources fell back to “no-water” status after a few years due to the non-availability of water.Maintaining sustainability will require work on different aspects altogether. These include groundwater recharge, water conservation and, critically, cutting down the overuse of water in agriculture, which hogs 90% of available supply, mainly because farming is not efficient.“Agriculture’s demand for water is disproportionately huge. One of the reasons is free electricity and a lot of incentives for crops such as paddy. India has to bring down its farm-water use to optimal levels for greater sustainability of groundwater,” said Alok Nath, a former water specialist at the Indian Council for Agricultural Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/record-80m-rural-households-have-piped-drinking-water-under-jal-jeevan-mission-101630670479382.html

However, Dey claimed he forwarded his resignation via WhatsApp.“I have resigned from my post. But I have not left the Congress party,” he confirmed. Dey’s resignation came soon after his photo with Union minister of state for social empowerment Pratima Bhowmik went viral on social media.Dey met the minister during a meeting with All India Congress Committee member and former minister Bibhu Kumari Devi on Wednesday. Devi also happens to be the ‘Rajmata’ or ‘regent queen’ of Tripura’s Manikya dynasty.In his resignation addressed to Biswas, Dey said the photograph was seen out of context as he was only visiting Bibhu Devi and the Union minister happened to be there. “It was pure coincidence that the Union minister Madam Pratima Bhowmik suddenly materialised there to pay obeisance to ‘Rajmata’ and we just exchanged pleasantries and there was discussion on some development projects of the people of our state and there were no political talk,” the letter reads. “.....I take this occasion to inform you that I am resigning from all posts of the PCC that I currently hold except the primary membership of the party and if you want I can also resign the party membership of the party, “ the letter continued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-congress-vice-president-resigns-from-post-101630669759306.html

Here's what senior doctor at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital has to say||In what possibly points to a decline in cases of mucormycosis, Dr Ajay Swaroop, who heads the ENT department at Delhi's Sir Ganga Hospital said on Friday the hospital was not getting active cases of the infection commonly known as black fungus. Speaking to news agency ANI, Dr Swaroop said that currently, only those who had mucormycosis previously were coming to the hospital.“We're not getting any active cases. What we are seeing now is old cases that either have residual disease, or patients who had a disease which was treated and now they’ve developed mucormycosis,” the senior doctor said about the infection, which has also emerged as common complication among those who have recovered from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).  We're not getting any active cases of mucormycosis.

After suffering a lot, they moved out because transportation is now much easier. Fortunately, not a single case is active,” he added.Dr Swaroop then listed three reasons due to which, he believed, black fungus patients were coming back. “This could be because they’ve not taken full medicinal course, or because they didn’t return for post-operative follow-ups which resulted in the fungus growing up again. It is also possible that from the nose or sinuses, the infection has shifted or moved to other sides,” he explained. The reason why patients are coming back can be - 1) they've not taken full course of medicine, 2) they've not come for post-operative follow-ups & slightest amount of fungus started growing again, 3) from nose or sinuses, it has shifted or skipped to other sides: Dr Ajay Swaroop pic.twitter.com/ZL6qB0xgswMucormycosis, caused by fungi known as mucormycetes, has affected thousands of people across the country.

A 2-judge bench, comprising Justice MR Shah and Justice Aniruddha Bose, directed the Union government to file a compliance report by September 11.Also Read | Death within 2-3 months of testing positive to be counted as Covid death: SC“We passed the order long time back, and have already extended the time once. By the time you frame the guidelines, the third phase will be over as well,” the bench observed. It was referring to its June 30 order directing the appropriate authority to simplify the guidelines to issue death certificates which, it had said, should state the exact cause of death as “death due to Covid-19” to enable those who depended on the deceased to avail benefits of welfare schemes.Appearing for the central government, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta assured the top court that “everything is under consideration.” However, advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal, who is one of the petitioners, argued that under the pretext of consideration, things should not be delayed further as the Centre was already granted a 4-week extension on August 16, but is now seeking further extension.Advocate Sumeer Sodhi, who appeared for some other applicants, argued that the extension for the first direction, passed on June 30, was ending on September 8.On this, the bench said it was adjourning the matter only for compliance with other directions. “Put up on September 13 as the Solicitor General seeks time to enable the Union of India to comply with the earlier order and place on record the compliance report of other directions placed by this court on June 30, 2021, on or before September 11,” it said.The apex court’s primary instructions in the said order were for the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to come up with guidelines, within six weeks, for ex-gratia assistance of family members of those who died due to Covid-19. The Centre, however, sought and received extension on the grounds that the NDMA’s consideration in this regard was at an “advanced stage” but required some more in-depth examination.Also Read | SC grants Centre 6 weeks to fix ex-gratia for deaths due to Covid-19It was this “extension” that the advocates referred to in the latest hearing in the Supreme Court.The court's order was on two separate petitions, one each by Bansal and Reepak Kansal.

The former minister also called it a move that would lead to cartelisation as the assets were going to go to a select two or three industrialists. Chidambaram was addressing a press conference in Mumbai as part of the Congress’s national outreach programme against NMP. Criticising the Modi government, Chidambaram said there was no criterion set for NMP and it was introduced without consultation with anyone. He also raised 20 questions over the policy.The former Union minister asked about the criteria applied for the choice of the assets for monetisation. “For roads and railways, there is PPP model in place, what is the difference between it and the proposed monetisation? If these assents are leased out for 50 years, would they not be depreciated over the years, worth nothing on their return? Will there be provision to avoid asset stripping by the lessee? What steps are being taken to avoid monopolies or duopolies? Has the Modi government decided that the Railways is no longer be considered a strategic sector? Has the government examined the impact of the policy on prices of goods and services in the sectors concerned?” he asked.Also Read | China-Pakistan-Taliban ‘axis’ is India’s cause for worry, warns ChidambaramChidambaram has also questioned that if the government expects the revenue of ₹600,000 crore in the next four years from monetisation, why was it not revealing the total capital investment in the identified assets. “They should also reveal the current revenue from the assets for the people the understand the difference between the two. How is the revenue of ₹6 lakh crore be sufficient to fund the ₹100 lakh crore infrastructure programme announced by the Prime Minister in his Independence Day speech?” he said.When asked about the disinvestment during UPA government, Chidambaram said that the Congress-led government sold loss making units and they had certain criteria for it. “The Congress sold non-core and non-strategic assets. They were chronically loss-making units. Ministerial market shares in PSUs were sold in case the private players in dominating in the sector. Here is they are selling of everything from Railways to airports and sea ports,” he said.BJP legislator Atul Bhatkhalkar said the Congress should first speak about their decision of liberalisation of the economy in early 1990s and the sale of the PSUs in the past. “The economy of the country was going through dire conditions, forcing the then Congress-led government to go for the liberation. Many government entities were sold, Mumbai and Delhi airports were given on lease when Chidambaram was the finance minister in Manmohan Singh government...The funds received from monetisation will be used for infrastructure projects . Congress and P Chidambaram are not able to accept the development the programme is going to bring,” he said.The Centre is yet to react to Chidambaram’s allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monetisation-plan-a-daylight-robbery-says-chidambaram-101630661479032.html

Closer collaboration between Indian and Norwegian companies can deﬁnitely accelerate our steps towards a common low-emission future,” Bru added. Norway was the partner country for Friday’s summit.Also Read | The costs of a net zero emission targetModi has set the country a target of 2047 — when India would celebrate its 100th Independence day — to achieve self-reliance in energy production through a mix of electric mobility, gas-based economy, doping ethanol in petrol to make the country a hub for hydrogen production.Minister of state (independent charge) for earth sciences and science & technology, Jitendra Singh India stressed the urgency to address climate challenges through consolidated approach and timely interventions while emphasising on shifting to cleaner options like green hydrogen as a potential energy source for a more sustainable future."Our undivided energies should be invested to attain our aim of minimising emission and that is only possible if we adopt a proactive approach. Green hydrogen will not only enable us to reduce emissions but also help India across several verticals and align with Prime Minister Modi's vision of our nation being self-reliant. It's about time that we collectively work towards making India a Green Hydrogen Hub, not just for ourselves but for the bigger picture where we are considerate of the world as a whole. We have the capability and the capacity to facilitate clean hydrogen energy for the world; this is the appropriate time to get into action and create a world worth thriving in,” the minister said.Jitendra Singh chose the occasion to launch the National Hydrogen Portal - www.greenhydrogen-India.com. It is a platform that will now become a one-stop information source for research, production, storage, transportation, and application of hydrogen across the country and technology.Meanwhile, Union environment minister Ashwini Chaubey stressed the need for creating a sustainable platform for clean energy.“We intend to achieve 40% of non-fossil usage by 2030, making a significant stride towards improving the current state of the country and establishing a green hydrogen ecosystem to smoothen the path to responsible living,” he said.The environment minister said the time has come to redirect our attention towards creating and sustaining an alternate source of energy and mandating it for developing and developed nations alike to take the onus to nurture the health and wellbeing of each one of us on this planet.Reliance Industries managing director Mukesh Ambani delivered the keynote address next in which he said that India is determined to achieve 'Azaadi' (freedom) from dependence on fossil energy and become 'Aatmanirbhar' (self-reliance) in new and renewable energy. ”Since climate change is undoubtedly the most daunting challenge facing human civilisation today, we should rapidly transition to a new era of clean, green, and renewable energy,” Ambani said.He stressed that by investing in smart microgrids, efficient storage solutions, and smart meters, we can enable individuals, neighbourhoods, and communities to become both consumers and producers of energy.

He recalled how his mother, Sonia Gandhi, would be worried every time his father flew a plane. “...she would be worried, and she would be transferring that worry,” he said in the over five-minute video shot at the Rajiv Gandhi Photo Exhibition the Indian Youth Congress organised last month.Rahul Gandhi remembered how he would fly with his father on early morning flights. He spoke about his uncle Sanjay Gandhi’s plane crash. Rahul Gandhi added Rajiv Gandhi had warned his younger brother against flying the plane that crashed and killed Sanjay Gandhi in New Delhi in June 1980.“My uncle was flying a particular type of plane; it was a Pitts. It was a very aggressive plane. My father told him that you know, do not do this. My uncle really did not have the experience. My uncle had similar (flying) hours to what I have about 300-350 hours. And, he should not have been flying that plane. And he flew it. And that is what happens when you do not have the experience and you fly. It is easy to kill yourself.”Also Read | ‘Political vendetta for former PM’: Cong MP from Assam on renaming of parkRahul Gandhi also spoke about how training as a pilot helps one become a leader. “If you lose track of details in the cockpit, you run into trouble. And if you lose track of the 30,000-foot picture you run into trouble. So, a pilot, and I am one, we move from these two spaces very seamlessly and very quickly.” He added roads, railway lines do not block their imagination when pilots fly. Rahul Gandhi said their imagination is at 30,000 feet and that gives them the ability to see large systems. “And this is what really helped my father. I could see this process taking place where he would go and meet people, get into their details, understand their details...”Rahul Gandhi said his father would put him in the cockpit whenever they flew on a plane or helicopter together. “What he would do is he would ask me about all the instruments, ask me questions and we would do the flight check together,” he said. He added he later learnt to fly when he was in college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-shares-video-talks-about-passion-for-flying-he-shared-with-his-dad-101630658059454.html

Himachal Pradesh, which has covered 99.6% of its population with the first dose, topped the list of states. Uttarakhand has covered 81.19% of its population while Kerala 80.14%, Gujarat 71.85% and Madhya Pradesh 70.69%. West Bengal has been able to vaccinate 41.16% of its total eligible population of around 70 million. To date, 30.3 million people in the state have received the first jab. Jharkhand has been able to provide 42.23% of its population with the first dose followed by Uttar Pradesh with 42.25%.The second dose in West Bengal has been given to 11.8 million people, which is around 39% of those who received the first jab. States such as Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala, which ranked higher in administering the first dose, lag behind in terms of the second. In Himachal Pradesh, only around 32% of the people have been given the second dose followed by Gujarat and Kerala with 34% and 36%.Also Read | Retired Calcutta high court CJ to head SIT probe Bengal post-poll violenceAccording to the 2011 census, West Bengal was the fourth most populous state with a population of 91.3 million while Karnataka (61.1 million) was the ninth and Gujarat (60.4 million) 10th.An official pointed out when it comes to vaccine doses, the Centre’s allotment is not proportional to the population. He added West Bengal has administered over 42.2 million doses, Gujarat 47.8 and Karnataka 44 million. “Most of the doses were provided to the states by the Centre.”A second West Bengal official said some states may have given the first dose to cover the maximum population without thinking about the second shot. “In West Bengal, we have moved in a more scientific manner. We have kept parity between the first and second doses. We first chose some groups who could act as super-spreaders such as transport workers, jail inmates and sex workers for immunisation.”Some experts said another reason behind the low coverage of the first dose in Bengal could be hesitancy. “This could exist in some pockets but not in general. If you see there has been a huge turnout at vaccination centres leading to near stampede in some areas. Can this be a sign of reluctance?” asked the third official.West Bengal received over 10 million doses in August, the highest since the vaccination drive started in January. It has been promised another 13 million doses in September, officials said.The state administration has started to ramp up the vaccination drive. It has achieved the target of administering nearly 1.3 million doses per day up from 50,00,00. Bengal has managed to vaccinate 70-80% of the population in cities. It is now stepping up the vaccination drive in the rest of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-41-population-receiving-1st-jab-of-vaccine-bengal-ranks-last-in-states-101630653258674.html
03-09-2021||India||SC denies bail to Delhi Sikh riots convict and ex-Congress leader Sajjan Kumar||The Supreme Court on Friday rejected the bail plea of Delhi Sikh riots convict and former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar after noting that his medical condition is stable and improving. The top court on August 24 directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to verify the medical condition of Kumar, who is serving life imprisonment in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case and is seeking interim bail on health grounds.A bench of Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice Hrishikesh Roy issued a notice to the CBI on Kumar’s plea and asked it to file an affidavit within a week after verifying his medical condition, reports PTI.Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for the complainant in the matter, said that Kumar got anticipatory bail from the Delhi High Court in 2010 and he was sent to jail only after his conviction. “This is shocking,” he informed the bench, adding that people were slaughtered during the riots. “I have serious reservation about private hospitals and these powerful accused,” Dave said, adding that the top court in September last year dismissed Kumar's plea seeking interim bail on health grounds.The Delhi High Court reversed the acquittal of Kumar by the trial court in 2013 in the case related to the killings of five Sikhs in the Raj Nagar Part-I area in Palam Colony in southwest Delhi on November 1-2, 1984, and the burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar Part-II. The riots broke out after the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984, by her two Sikh bodyguards.In its verdict, the high court convicted and sentenced Kumar to imprisonment for the "remainder of his natural life" in the case, saying the riots were a "crime against humanity" perpetrated by those who enjoyed "political patronage" and aided by an "indifferent" law enforcement agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-denies-bail-to-delhi-sikh-riots-convict-and-ex-congress-leader-sajjan-kumar-101630647104098.html

Police said no major incident of violence has been reported even as there were some stone-throwing incidents in old Srinagar. Additional troops were deployed on Friday. A police spokesperson said the restrictions and internet shutdown will continue and that a review of the situation will take place on Friday afternoon to decide how long the clampdown will continue.Geelani, the face of separatism in Kashmir for over three decades, died on Wednesday after a prolonged illness at 91. The separatist leader, who spent around two decades in jail, was largely confined to his residence because of ill-health since 2010. Geelani was on Thursday buried in a quiet funeral at a graveyard near his residence in Srinagar’s Hyderpora around 4.30am with his family alleging that the police forcibly took away his body.The police action was likely prompted to avoid a mass gathering, which may have turned restive or violent.Also Read | 89 new Covid cases, no deaths in J&KAs soon as the news of Geelani’s death broke, authorities enhanced security across the Valley. Hundreds of security personnel patrolled streets, put up barricades, and sealed key roads to restrict the movement of people in the clampdown similar to the one imposed after the nullification of the region’s semi-autonomous status in 2019. Shops and businesses were shuttered while the movement of vehicles was restricted. Internet connections and mobile networks were snapped and even journalists were prevented from covering the funeral. Only the post-paid mobiles of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited were working.Paramilitary forces were deployed across Kashmir and all the roads leading to Hyderpora were sealed.

03-09-2021||India||Curbs relaxed, August logged better international air traffic||The government has extended the suspension on scheduled international commercial flight services by another month, to September 30. While this may have brought India’s international traffic down by almost 95%, some international air traffic is on the rise because of the flights operating under special arrangements with over 24-odd countries as well as special chartered services. Last month also saw an uptick in the overseas air traffic owing to student travel.While the scheduled international operations are yet to start, the ministry of civil aviation has permitted international operations under Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) and Air Transport Bubbles (ATB).According to an estimate by rating agency- ICRA, the outbound passenger traffic under VBM for August 2021 rose by 218% compared to July 2021. “One of the reasons could be student outbound travel, given the autumn fall for universities and colleges internationally starts from September,” said Kinjal Shah, vice president and Co-Group Head, corporate ratings, ICRA Limited. Also Read | Negative RT-PCR report must for tourists visiting India from these nations; check detailed listThe passenger traffic under VBM has been growing sequentially since June 2021 after a dip in May 2021 due to the second Covid wave. According to ICRA, international passenger traffic for the Indian carriers stood at around 4.2 million till Aug 31, 2021. “Compared to May, traffic growth stood at 4% in June 2021, 43% in July 2021 and 47% in August 2021. Apart from student travellers, the sequential growth is attributed to relaxations by foreign nations to travel to their countries post a decline in Covid cases in India from June 2021, as well as the rising pace of vaccination,” ICRA said.According to Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA), passenger traffic between India and Dubai is seeing a steady increase after UAE recently lifted travel restrictions. According to the August data report by the Airports Authority of India, Mumbai, Kochi and Calicut were the top airports for international traffic during July. The New Delhi airport registered 266,533 international passengers in July, up from 193,007 in the same month a year ago, while Mumbai airport recorded 101,203 international passengers during the month, up from 65,930 during the same period in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/curbs-relaxed-august-logged-better-international-air-traffic-101630648398372.html
03-09-2021||India||EXCLUSIVE | India’s 1st N-missile tracking ship Dhruv to be launched on Sept 10||National Security Advisor Ajit Doval is expected to commission India’s first satellite and ballistic missile tracking ship Dhruv from Visakhapatnam on September 10. Built by Hindustan Shipyard in collaboration with Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO), INS Dhruv has the capability to also map ocean beds for research and detection of enemy submarines.It is understood that the Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh and NTRO Chairman Anil Dasmana will be present at the launch ceremony along with senior DRDO and Navy officials. The nuclear missile tracking ship will be manned by Indian Navy personnel with the Strategic Forces Command (SFC). Such ships are operated by France, the US, the UK, Russia, and China only.The 10,000-tonne ship, which is part of a classified project, will be at the heart of India’s future anti-ballistic missile capability as it will act as an early warning system for enemy missiles headed towards Indian cities and military establishments. The ship will be a vital key to maritime domain awareness in the Indo-Pacific and is being commissioned at the time when the era of underwater armed and surveillance drones has dawned.With both China and Pakistan having nuclear ballistic missile capability and land disputes with India, the INS Dhruv will act as a major force multiplier to India’s maritime security architecture as well add to the capability to understand the true missile capability of the adversary when they test their ballistic missiles.INS Dhruv is equipped with DRDO developed state of the art active scanned array radar or AESA with the ability to scan various spectrums to monitor spy satellites watching over India as well as monitor missile tests in the entire region. This will add to the Indian Navy’s capability to monitor the region from the Gulf of Aden to the ingress routes to the South China Sea via Malacca, Sunda, Lombok, Ombai and Wetar straits.INS Dhruv by mapping the Indian Ocean bed will also help the Indian Navy plan better military operations in all three dimensions—sub-surface, surface and aerial. Given that China has moved to sea-based military doctrine with huge investments in long-range aircraft carriers, warships and submarines, the latest Indian ship will help India’s electronic intelligence-gathering spy agency, the NTRO, to project threat to India in real-time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-1st-n-missile-tracking-ship-dhruv-to-be-launched-on-sept-10-101630647404445.html

03-09-2021||India||Madhya Pradesh govt directs hiring as per 27% OBC quota||The Madhya Pradesh government on Thursday directed the implementation of an enhanced 27% Other Backward Classes (OBC) quota for recruitments in all departments, except for school education, health, and medical education. Its General Administration Department (GAD) issued an order in this regard a day after the high court refused to vacate a stay on the hiring of 29,000 teachers for which the quota was applied. The court is likely to pronounce its verdict on petitions challenging the enhanced quota on September 20.The GAD issued the order after seeking advocate general Purushendra Kaurav’s opinion. Kaurav pointed out the high court had not stayed the increase of the quota to 27% from 14% through an ordinance in March 2019.“Some petitions have been filed in the court to challenge it (the ordinance) but advocate general, who gave a legal opinion in the court on August 25, clearly said that barring three departments, the increased reservation can be implemented in all the direct recruitments and examinations,” said the GAD order.Also Read | MP: Thousands who lost one parent left out of Covid relief after tweakState minister Bhupendra Singh said the high court only stayed the admission to post-graduate courses in medical colleges, the appointment of medical officers and teachers as per the increased quota. “There is no stay on the ordinance...” Singh called the government’s order for recruitments a historic decision.Lawyer Rameshwar Singh Thakur, who represents petitioners who have challenged the stay on implementation of reservation in the teachers’ recruitment, said he has maintained the state government was misinterpreting the court’s order.Aditya Sanghi, another lawyer, said the implementation of the enhanced quota will mean the reservation crosses the 50% cap which is not allowed as per a Supreme Court order. “It is very evident that if the court has stayed appointment and admission as per increased reservation, it means it is a stay on all exams and recruitment. As of now, 70 petitions have been filed to challenge this order.”Congress leader JP Dhanopia said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government cheated OBC by not implementing the increased reservation. “After Congress leaders mounted pressure on the government and roped in two Supreme Court lawyers... they realised their mistake and rectified it. They should also apologise.”BJP leader Rajneesh Agrawal blamed Congress for misinterpreting the court’s order. “In 2019, it was then Congress-led government which misguided the people on the court stay. After taking legal opinion, the state government implemented it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-govt-directs-hiring-as-per-27-obcquota-101630644259475.html

The tally of active cases fell to 50,607 as 4,755 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours. The state also saw 55 Covid casualties, taking the toll to 137,551. Ahmednagar reported the highest toll with 14 deaths.

Children are definitely suffering from mental health issues and nutrition and thus schools should be reopened, but in a safe environment. To ensure the same, we have recommended that teaching and non-teaching staff of schools should be vaccinated; there must be proper seating arrangements in the class and one bench should be reserved for one student only.“Schools should divide students in two batches and they should be called for physical classes on alternate days. For example, half the students can be called today and the rest tomorrow and at the same time online classes can also be continued. Sports activities which require close contact should be avoided. Schools can also be started in a staggered manner by allowing some classes now and increasing them later based on the situation and if in case any rise is observed they can be stopped immediately,” he said.Most importantly, classes should be sanitised and there must be a monitoring system in place in all the schools. The school staff should also be trained to deal in case of a medical emergency, added Dr Parekh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-records-4-342-fresh-covid-cases-state-mulls-reopening-of-schools-101630639757743.html

With scheduled international passenger flights to and from India remaining suspended since March last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, New Delhi has entered into air bubble arrangements with various countries, including Bangladesh, for operating flights. The pact with Bangladesh, which came into effect on October 28, 2020, was valid till March 27, 2021, wherein Indian and Bangladeshi carriers were permitted to operate services between the two nations.India has an air bubble agreement with 28 countries, which include Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Canada, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, the Maldives, Nepal, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Rwanda, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Ukraine, the UAE, the United Kingdom, Uzbekistan and the United States.

Policymakers, regulators, industry leaders, experts, and scientists from across the globe are going to be a part of the climate summit. Union ministers Bhupendra Yadav and Jitendra Singh, NITI Aayog member Dr VK Saraswat and Sturle Harald Pedersen, chairperson of Greenstat India, Norway are some of the eminent participants.Also Read | India and UK announce plan to jointly push green growthSpeaking about the International Climate Summit 2021, Dr Ashish Kishore Lele, the director of the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), said that the key conference on Friday is especially significant for India and by extension, the rest of the world since it will mark the future mitigation strategies of climate change. He stressed the need to adopt these alternative strategies, highlighting the problems that arose due to dependence on conventional fuels.Hydrogen power, one such 'alternative' strategy for India's energy signature, has been in the headlines ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech on August 15 announced a 'National Hydrogen Mission' for the country. Green hydrogen, which is produced by splitting the water molecule into its hydrogen and oxygen constituents using an electrolyzer powered by renewable energy resources, is expected to be a game-changer for India in meeting its annual energy needs. The country, which currently imports 85 per cent of its oil and 53 per cent of its gas demands, has been reported to spend around ₹12 trillion annually on energy requirements.Also Read | By switching on the sun, Railways can prevent 7mn tonnes of carbon emissionsPrime Minister Modi, while announcing the hydrogen policy, said that India aims to become a global hub for green hydrogen production and exports.

So that every party has a few months to prepare in those assembly segments so that there is a better chance of success,” he said. The NCP’s lone MLA Churchill Alemão said the party intended to seek eight seats for the party as part of any pre-poll alliance including the seat he currently represents apart from others.When asked if the party was willing go separate ways despite being in an alliance in neighbouring Maharasthra, Patel said his party was already talking to other regional parties. “Nobody is helpless. I have met leaders of other parties also... There are a good number of people who are willing to explore other options if there is no decision (from the Congress). You clap with two hands, not with one hand,” Patel said.“I have met Vijai Sardesai (leader of the Goa Forward Party) and he has also told me that he is also waiting to hear from the Congress party. Let us see now what happens. I do not want to comment beyond this. It is important that all political forces who are like-minded should come together as soon as possible in the interest of the state and politics of Goa,” Patel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nobody-is-helpless-praful-patel-nudges-cong-to-decide-on-goa-poll-alliance-101630612634785.html
03-09-2021||India||In Bihar’s East Champaran, turbulent river damages 15 houses, school in 2 days||Nearly 15 houses and a government school have been damaged in the past two days due to the erosion caused by the turbulent Gandak River at Sakhawa Tok village in Areraj, officials said on Thursday. Pawan Kumar Jha, circle officer (CO), Areraj, said the exact number of the houses which have collapsed due to erosion would only be known after the water level recedes. “As per the information available with us, approximately 15 houses and parts of a primary school at Sakhawa Tok have collapsed between August 31 and September 1,” said Jha. “No loss of lives has been reported so far. The villagers were shifted to safer places after they were alerted by the district administration,” the CO said. A village resident, identified as Yogindar Yadav (60), said, “The way the erosion happened, we knew that collapse was imminent. Therefore, we left the house about ten days back with whatever household articles we could take.” He has taken shelter in a makeshift tent on an embankment in neighbouring Bhartoli village under Danapur panchayat in Gopalganj. Kamendra Mani Tiwari, the former village head and representative of village chief Anisha Devi, said this has put the total number of houses that have collapsed between 40 and 50. “Villagers have been facing the threat of displacement since the 1990s because of regular flooding. Several families have been displaced since a village called Sakhawa was engulfed by Gandak in 2005,” said Tiwari. When contacted, Sanjay Kumar, district education officer (DEO), East Champaran confirmed that parts of Rajkiya Prathamik Vidyalaya at Sakhawa Tok had collapsed. “We will get the condition of the school examined after the floods,” said the DEO. As many as 83,000 people dwelling in low lying areas of East Champaran and 6,000 people in Gopalganj are still affected by floods. “We are running eight community kitchens in the district,” said Dr Nawal Kishor Choudhary, district magistrate (DM), Gopalganj district. “People living in parts of Sangrampur, Kesariya, Areraj, Sagauli, Chirraiya and Banjariya in East Champaran have been affected by the flood. Six community kitchens have been set up for them,” said Anil Kumar, additional district magistrate (ADM) and in charge of disaster management. Bhaskar, CO at Nautan in West Champaran described the situation as under control. “Water has receded fast,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bihar-s-east-champaran-turbulent-river-damages-15-houses-school-in-2-days-101630611974550.html

State general education minister V Sivankutty announced this in the capital city adding that experts favoured opening of all schools. The minister’s latest announcement has raised eyebrows in the state.Kerala reported 32,907 fresh Covid-19 cases on Thursday with a test positivity rate of 18.41% after 174301 samples were tested, said the state health ministry. It also reported 188 deaths taking total fatalities to 21,149. The active caseload also climbed to 2,40,186, and after May this is the first time the active load has crossed 2.40 lakh.The minister said the experts’ meeting convened by the government on Wednesday favoured re-opening of schools and a final decision would be taken by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan after recommendations of the new committee. Earlier, the state government said schools will be reopened only after vaccinating all children but it had second thoughts after neighbouring Tamil Nadu opened its schools. Besides TN, at least six other states have opened schools after cases dipped drastically--- the number of cases has dipped in many parts of the country except Kerala.“The education department will constitute a panel to study whether the situation in the state is conducive for opening schools. It will also prepare a project detailing which classes can be opened initially. A final decision will be taken by the CM,” he said. In the last two academic years, classes were conducted virtually in the state.In the experts’ meeting many said since hospitalization has not increased significantly it was a clear indication that the current surge in disease transmission is not out of control. So the state can think of opening up socio-economic sectors. But a section of experts opposed the plan to re-open schools. “This is not the right time. We have no idea how the minister arrived at a conclusion like this,” said public health activist Dr S S Lal, who earlier served with the World Health Organisation.Experts like him said the current pandemic condition will prevail in the state till mid-September and the government should wait till then. The alarming hike and its consistent prevalence forced many experts to link it with a possible beginning of a third wave. This week the state’s accumulated share of Covid-19 cases was above 70 per cent.This is the third day in a row that Kerala has been reporting over 30,000 cases. On Monday, new cases came down but it was due to low testing. On Wednesday, it reported 32,803 with a TPR of 18.73 per cent. At least three districts reported over 3000 cases-- Thrissur 4434, Ernakulam 3768 and Kozhikode 3531. Only north Kerala district Kasaragod clocked less than 1000 cases (555), statistics show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-alarming-covid-19-surge-kerala-mulls-opening-of-schools-101630610414398.html

He barred them from cremating the dead and even stopped women from wearing bangles, Bhol said.The senior police officer said most people hadn’t complained against him as his victims were already poor and marginalised. With the lawyer and his son behind bars, police expect more people will come forward.Satyabrata Nayak, the man who was murdered on August 1, was once a member of his organsiation but had started to move away. “On August 1 morning, a meeting was organised by some leaders of the organisation where Nayak was thrashed brutally… as he could not explain why his brother-in-law did not attend a meeting in another village. The next day, Nayak’s nephew Basant was called to the neighbouring village of Karadagadia where his body was kept on the funeral pyre in a burial ground. Basant was then forced to light the funeral pyre of his uncle,” the IG said.Das and his son also face charges in a second case in which an old man and his son were dragged out of their house and beaten mercilessly for not joining his organisation.“His people literally forced people to follow his weird diktats and if anyone protested they were either ostracised or thrashed,” said the IG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-lawyer-son-held-for-murder-their-outfit-also-under-scanner-cops-101630608674289.html

All of them were carefully approved.” He added that the original memorial remains untouched and has not been modified in any way.Criticising the revamp, senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet on Tuesday: “Such an insult to the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh can only be done by those who do not know the meaning of martyrdom. I am the son of a martyr - I will not tolerate the insult of martyrs at any cost.” A culture ministry official countered the criticism. “There are many people criticising the renovations but they are forgetting that the process was carefully completed and not mindlessly done,” a culture ministry official said on the condition of anonymity.Many across the spectrum slammed the government for overhauling the memorial by installing murals and conducting a sound and light show. “A light has been installed inside the well to help keep it clean,” the ministry official said. “There used to be a sound and light earlier as well but it became defunct.

03-09-2021||India||NGT does not have suo motu powers: Centre to SC||New Delhi: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) does not possess suo motu powers but it can act on letters or communication addressed to it raising environmental concerns, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Thursday. The submission was made by additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) during a hearing of a bunch of appeals, seeking the court’s decision on whether the tribunal has the power to directly take up issues on the basis on news reports or at the instance of any letter or communication. “The NGT does not enjoy any suo motu powers. But this cannot be stretched to the extent to suggest that a letter or application cannot be entertained by it. The tribunal cannot be tied up in procedural law for exercising power which is amply available to it under the Act. Once the tribunal receives any communication, it is duty bound to take cognisance of that,” ASG Bhati said, conveying the government’s point of view. A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Hrishikesh Roy and CT Ravikumar responded that the ASG’s submission is “crucial” to the case since MoEFCC was the ministry which piloted the bill constituting the NGT through Parliament. Bhati said that the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, was enacted with the purpose of protecting the environment, and the only objection of the Centre was with regard to vesting suo motu powers to the tribunal and its members through which they can initiate action on their own. The bench said that the problem arises by using the generic term “suo motu”. “Even we are not using the term suo motu. But when a communication in the form of a letter or a sworn affidavit is received, should the Tribunal ignore it or will it be duty-bound to consider it?” The court agreed that procedural law requires the tribunal to act on an application or appeal filed before it. However, the judges wondered if this formal step could be substituted by converting a letter or a news report into an application and taking the process forward by issuance of notices to the authors of the new report and to the alleged defaulters or authorities concerned. The Centre said that often it is seen that environmental issues are the last concern of citizens. “Nobody has argued that there is lack of power with the tribunal to consider issues falling within the laws where the NGT exercises jurisdiction,” he said. These include legislations such as Environment Protection Act, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, the Forest (Conservation) Act, and Biological Diversity Act. “We are seeing it from the point of view that environment is of paramount consideration. Environment, unfortunately, ends up being nobody’s baby. Any view taken by the court must not undo the good work achieved so far by the Tribunal,” Bhati said. The ministry so far filed a one-page affidavit denying suo motu power to NGT. The ASG said she will supplement it with a written note explaining the stand of the Centre. The court-appointed amicus curiae (friend of Court), senior advocate Anand Grover, supported the view of the Centre. Having taken a stand earlier that no suo motu power is permissible under NGT Act, Grover told the bench: “What is meant by suo motu is that the Tribunal or its members cannot initiate action or trigger the process on basis of reading a newspaper report.” However, he added, “it can be triggered on an application received by the Tribunal which need not be in the form prescribed under the NGT Act or Rules.” Grover will continue his submissions on Tuesday. In appeals being heard by the apex court about the powers of NGT, two cases stand out. One relates to Kerala, where NGT took up a letter written by a group of residents who wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi complaining against the pollution caused by the presence of stone quarries in their vicinity. A copy of the letter was also marked to NGT. The letter was registered as an application, and orders were passed restricting stone quarries from operating within 200 metres from the nearest residential house.The other case relates to orders passed by NGT on solid waste management in Mumbai based on a newspaper report. The green panel imposed a cost of ₹5 crore on the municipal body for its failure to set up sewage treatment plants.In the first case, the appeals are by granite manufacturers, owners of stone quarries, and the Kerala government, and in the other case, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai has approached the top court. The top court said that once the question of suo motu power of NGT is decided, the orders under challenge will either remain or cease to exist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngt-does-not-have-suo-motu-powers-centre-to-sc-101630608074324.html

When we call ourselves as the temple of democracy, constitutional decorum should be maintained as it gives a wider message to the country and its people,” said Birla.In 2001, then Lok Sabha speaker GMC Balayogi had called an all-India conference of presiding officers, chief ministers, ministers of parliamentary affairs, leaders and whips of parties on “discipline and decorum in Parliament and legislatures of states and union territories”. Held on November 25, 2001, the conference adopted a resolution encompassing a code of conduct for members of all legislative bodies in India. Balayogi had observed that “the image of Parliament and its credibility as a representative institution largely depend on the role and functions of its members”.To be sure, it brought little change in disruptions in Parliament. At least three sessions in the last 15 years have been washed out, and several members have been suspended from the House. The last session of Parliament witnessed such unruly scenes that the Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu is contemplating action against at least 12 lawmakers.Birla, at least on two occasions, stayed away from the chair in frustration when disrupting MPs refused to listen to him.He said on Thursday, “We have to relook into the issue of maintaining decorum and how to make Parliament and assemblies accountable to the people of India. Differences between parties are a healthy sign in politics but dialogue and discussion must also take place,” he said.Birla’s observations come after Vice President and Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday proposed naming and shaming of disruptive MPs even as he called on the 5,000-odd lawmakers in India to adhere to House norms.Delivering the Pranab Mukherjee memorial lecture, Naidu suggested that the public should launch a social media campaign, write letters to newspapers and question disruptive lawmakers and even consider the elected representative’s parliamentary conduct as a key factor for voting in elections.Birla, when asked about Naidu’s suggestions, said, “This is his opinion. He is entitled to his own opinion. I think dialogue and discussion is the best way. We have discussed the issue of decorum at the presiding officers’ conference and agreed even as there would be dispute, debate and differences between the Opposition and treasury benches, we have to maintain the decorum of the House.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/speaker-seeks-meet-on-house-decorum-101630608014577.html
03-09-2021||India||Karnataka: Cop arrested for forcing Dalit man to drink urine||The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of Karnataka Police on Wednesday arrested a police sub-inspector for allegedly forcing a Dalit man to drink urine, while the latter was in custody in May, police said. Arjun Horakeri, a sub-inspector of police posted with Gonibeedu police station, was produced before a court in Chikkamagaluru on Thursday, and an additional district and sessions judge remanded him to 14 days judicial custody, said Chikkamagaluru police. Earlier, the police officer’s plea for anticipatory bail was rejected by the Karnataka high court on June 2. The incident took place on May 10 at Gonibeedu police station in Mudigere taluk of the district. An inquiry was ordered after the man lodged a complaint with the Chikkamagaluru superintendent of police (SP). In his complaint, the victim alleged that Gonibeedu police took him into custody on May 10 based on an oral complaint by a group of villagers accusing him of creating discord between a couple in the village. The man said no written complaint was filed against him, but he was kept in the police station from 11 am to 10.30 pm. “Policemen beat me up for a couple of hours. Then they asked another man who was in the lockup to urinate on me. He refused, but he was forced to do it. After that, they made me lick the urine on the floor,” he told HT on May 22. Chikkamagaluru police registered a case against the sub-inspector under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act on May 21 and on May 24 the case was handed over to the CID for a fair probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-cop-arrested-for-forcing-dalit-man-to-drink-urine-101630607955474.html
03-09-2021||India||Covid vaccine drive falls behind in Karnataka rural areas: Data||Even as the Karnataka government on Thursday said that it had administered 12,04,402 vaccine doses on the first day of its ‘lasika utsava’ or vaccination festival, which kicked-off from Wednesday, exceeding its own earlier set targets, data from CoWin app shows that most of Karnataka’s targets have been fueled by the largest cities in the state, leaving rural areas far behind. “Thanks to the voluntary participation of citizens and effective work of all the staff of the health department, we could administer 12,04,402 doses, out of which 1,85,488 doses were administered in BBMP limits. Belagavi stood first with 99,973 doses,” Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said on Thursday. However, a closer look at the data reveals that most of the shots as well as the highest coverage has been in the five largest cities of the state, leaving behind smaller districts with very poor coverage in comparison. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) area has so far administered nearly 10 million doses as against the coffee growing region of Kodagu, about 225 kms from India’s IT capital, which has so far managed just under 405,000, data from CoWin shows. Kodagu is one of two districts in the state where restrictions which were imposed over two months ago remain in force due to the high positivity rate in the region allegedly due to its proximity with Kerala. Locals have complained about the frequently sighted “no stock” boards on the health centres in Kodagu, forcing many to remain indoors. The situation is similar in districts like Bidar, Yadgir, Gadag and Chamarajanagar where, officials said, vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise. The district administration of Chamarajanagar was forced to retract its ‘no-vaccine, no- ration’ policy order on Wednesday after a huge public outcry. However, places like Bengaluru, whioch falls under BBMP, has continued with its inoculation drive with paid vaccination, administered by private hospitals, accounting for more than half of the city’s total. “BBMP is intensifying the vaccination drive to ensure every eligible adult in the city is protected against Covid-19,” Gaurav Gupta, the chief commissioner of the BBMP said in a post on Twitter. He said that Bengaluru can easily administer over 100,000 vaccines per day and that on Wednesday it had administered 185,000 doses. The BBMP is now planning to extend the timings of some of its health centres till 9 pm or over 12 hours as against six to eight hours in other rural districts of the state, depending on availability of stock. Gupta on Thursday said that the BBMP is willing to even go door-to-door with vaccines but guidelines prevent them from doing so. He also said that the BBMP will set up vaccination camps close to slums and other high-density localities. In rural areas, most people are expected to travel long distances to visit public health centres which does not guarantee the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccine-drive-falls-behind-in-karnataka-rural-areas-data-101630607902882.html
03-09-2021||India||Chandan Mitra: A stalwart of journalism who also left a mark on the world of politics||Former editor, commentator, parliamentarian, and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-turned-Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader, Chandan Mitra, passed away late on Wednesday after prolonged illness. He was 65.Mitra, who was editor-in-chief and former managing director of The Pioneer, had also been executive editor of Hindustan Times. He was a two-term Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament (MP), first as a nominated member (2003-2009) and then as a BJP member from Madhya Pradesh (2010-2016).President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed sorrow, with the President tweeting, “Chandan Mitra was an outstanding journalist and his stint as a parliamentarian added to his reputation. His understanding of Hindi heartland and its history was profound. His demise leaves a void in Indian journalism.”PM Modi said that Mitra would be remembered for “his intellect and insights”, and tweeted, “He distinguished himself in the world of media as well as politics. Anguished by his demise.”Among other political tributes, two personal tributes, reflecting Mitra’s educational background, came from leaders at opposing ends of the political spectrum. Rajya Sabha MP and BJP leader, Swapan Dasgupta, said he had lost his closest friend. Posting a photo from a school trip in 1972, he tweeted, “We were together as students of La Martiniere & went on to St Stephen’s & Oxford. We joined journalism at the same time & shared the excitement of Ayodhya & the saffron wave.”Congress MP Shashi Tharoor recalled their days together in Delhi’s St Stephen’s College, where Mitra was Tharoor’s campaign manager in the election for college president.After a brief teaching stint in Delhi University, Mitra did his doctorate on political mobilisation and the nationalism movement in India, with a focus on eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, from Oxford in 1984. He returned to India to begin a life in journalism with The Statesman, before moving to The Times of India, and then The Sunday Observer. He then joined Hindustan Times where he served in senior editorial leadership roles, including as executive editor. Mitra left HT to join The Pioneer as editor, and eventually bought control of the newspaper in 1998.Mitra acquired a political profile with his proximity to the BJP and its leadership. At a time when the party had a limited number of articulate English-speaking spokespersons, Mitra filled a void in communicating the BJP’s message to an urban audience as news television picked up. He maintained links across party lines.But Mitra’s foray into electoral politics — he failed to win the 2014 Lok Sabha election as a BJP candidate from Hooghly in his home state, West Bengal — was unsuccessful. And he did not get significant organisational or political responsibilities.A BJP leader, who did not wish to be named, said, “His contribution to the party is important, but he failed to make the transition from the old BJP of (LK) Advani to the new BJP of Modi and Amit Shah.” Eventually, amid reports that he was unhappy at not being given a third Rajya Sabha term, Mitra moved to the TMC in 2018. But by then, he had begun battling ill health and retreated partly from public life.Mitra is survived by his wife and two sons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chandan-mitra-a-stalwart-of-journalism-who-also-left-a-mark-on-the-world-of-politics-101630607901268.html
03-09-2021||India||34 nursing students test Covid positive in Bengaluru||As many as 34 students at a private nursing college in Bengaluru have tested positive for Covid-19 since August 28, making it the biggest coronavirus disease cluster in the city, which has seen fresh infection cases ebb in the past few weeks. Officials of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) Maharadevapura zone confirmed that 34 students, including 22 girls and 12 boys, have tested positive for Covid-19 at Christian Nursing College in Bengaluru’s Horamavu area. Most of those infected came to Bengaluru from Kerala early last month, officials said. “The infected students are currently undergoing treatment at a Covid care centre and none of them has any serious symptoms. All of them have received at least the first of the vaccine,” a civic official said, requesting anonymity. BBMC officials said that all students arrived at the nursing college in Bengaluru on August 5 and they carried RT-PCR negative test results with them on arrival. It is likely that one of them contracted the virus in Bengaluru itself, an official said. The first case in the cluster came to light when three students who shared a room in the girls’ hostel showed symptoms of Covid-19. On August 28, at least 10 students tested positive for the infection, officials said. While testing the primary and secondary contacts of these students in the girls’ hostel, 12 more tested positive for Covid-19 on August 30. “A day later we also tested occupants of the boys’ hostel and other building nearby, including teaching and non-teaching staff in the college. During these tests, 12 more students tested positive,” a BBMP official said, adding that they learnt that students had ordered food online and also visited local stores. The college and hostel buildings have been sealed and marked as containment zone, officials said, adding that offline classes have been suspended. The local police station has been informed about the containment zone, which has now been barricaded, said BBMP officials. This comes after 32 students tested positive for Covid-19 at a private college in Kolar Gold Field on Wednesday. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Thursday said strict monitoring has been ordered on state’s borders with Kerala. “We have already started a special drive. We are vaccinating (people) within 20 km of the border, inside Karnataka. We are conducting tests at every village and checks are being conducted at different locations, such as bus and railway stations. For students, especially nursing students coming from Kerala, we have asked them to quarantine for a week and get RT-PCR test done (before starting classes),” said Bommai. Karnataka on Thursday clocked 1,240 fresh COVID-19 cases, taking the caseload to 29.52 lakh, while 22 deaths pushed the death toll to 37,361. The day also saw 1,252 people being discharged, taking the total number of recoveries to 28,96,079. Active cases stood at 18,378, a health department bulletin said. Bengaluru Urban accounted for the maximum number of 319 cases and four fatalities, it said. Dakshina Kannada district bordering Kerala remained a major COVID-19 hotspot with 264 fresh infections and five fatalities.So far, 44,000,960 beneficiaries have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine in the state, including 9,743,583 in Bengaluru. On Monday, Karnataka announced fresh travel restrictions for those coming from Kerala, which has been witnessing highest daily caseload in the country for the past several weeks. In its order, the government has made institutional quarantine mandatory for students and employees entering the state from Kerala. Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar told reporters on Thursday that quarantine arrangements must be made or paid for by the respective educational institutions and companies, firms, or offices of these students and employees. He added that the home quarantine of these individuals cannot be allowed under any circumstances. “The students and employees must produce a negative RT-PCR test of not over 72 hours if they want to enter the state, irrespective of their vaccination status,” the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/34-nursing-students-test-covid-positive-in-bengaluru-101630607898856.html
03-09-2021||India||Canadian city to celebrate Gauri Lankesh day on September 5||Burnaby, a city in Canada, has declared September 5 as Gauri Lankesh Day, commemorating the slain activist’s life on her death anniversary. The decision was taken during the Burnaby City Council meeting on August 30 and a proclamation, signed by city mayor Mike Hurley, was published on the official website subsequently. Gauri Lankesh, a journalist-turned-activist, was shot dead outside her home in Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Bengaluru, by unidentified men on September 5, 2017. The 55-year-old was an open critic of the Hindutva politics in the state. The proclamation hails Gauri as a courageous Indian journalist who stood up for truth and justice. “Gauri Lankesh, through her work, encouraged her readers to adopt scientistic temperament and reject religious fanaticism, caste-based discrimination and bigotry,” read the proclamation uploaded on the city website. In April 2020, the city of Burnaby proclaimed April 14 as ‘Dr BR Ambedkar Day of Equality’. Also, the city declared a day dedicated to civil rights activist Jaswant Singh Khalra and Sikh Heritage. Filmmaker and Gauri’s sister, Kavitha Lankesh said that she is happy that a city in Canada has recognised her sister’s work. “I’m very happy to hear that. I didn’t know about this until someone informed me. I’m very happy that Gauri’s work is being recognised internationally, even though no such recognition has been provided by the government here. I’m glad that her message is spreading across the world,” said Kavitha. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court on September 8 is expected to hear the plea filed by Gauri’s sister Kavita Lankesh, challenging the dropping of charges under the Karnataka Control of Organized Crime Act 2000 (KCOCA) against one of the accused in the murder case. The bench, led by Justice AM Khanwilkar, had issued notice to Karnataka on the petition filed by Kavitha, in which she appealed against the state high court’s decision in April to quash charges under KCOCA against Mohan Nayak. KCOCA is a law enacted by Karnataka in 2000 to combat organised crime and terrorism. The Act was modelled on the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (MCOCA). According to police, if the charges of KCOCA are dropped against Nayak, it could set precedence for the charges to be dropped against other accused in the case as well. A senior home department official, in the know of the developments, said that the SIT had approached the government to file an appeal against the Karnataka high court decision. However, the government didn’t act on it. The home minister didn’t respond to HT’s call for a comment regarding this allegation. As per the charge sheet, Nayak is accused of providing accommodation to the killers on the outskirts of Bengaluru. He was arrested on July 19, 2018. Nayak was arrested after the main suspects in the case, including the shooter Parashuram Waghmore and mastermind of the crime Amol Kale, were taken into custody. According to the petition filed through advocate Aparna Bhat, Nayak was also involved in arranging logistics for the killers, both before and after the crime. It stated that the high court erred in setting aside the order of the Bengaluru police commissioner passed in August 2018 invoking KCOCA against Nayak and the subsequent supplementary charge sheet filed by the Special Investigation Team under provisions of KCOCA. The SIT filed an additional charge sheet in November 2018, in which Nayak was named. According to the charge sheet, Nayak took weapons training as well. On April 22, the Karnataka high court dropped the organised crimes charges against Nayak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/canadian-city-to-celebrate-gauri-lankesh-day-on-september-5-101630607835563.html

He was then dragged by the river, ripped off his clothes and threatened for his life. His mobile phone along with JCB keys were taken by Assam Police.This is considered to be a setback towards the initiatives for peace,” the letter read.Lalthlangliana also urged Assam officials to return the items allegedly taken away by Assam police to the earth excavator operator at the earliest.“I urge for your immediate intervention as district magistrate into the situation and to take necessary action towards these perpetrators...I look forward to your positive response and also request your kind cooperation to maintain peace and order at the interstate border.”Refuting the allegations, Hailakandi district superintendent of police (SP) Gaurav Upadhyay said: “Our police officials did not harm anyone and there is no question of kidnapping any Mizo citizen at gunpoint. Mizoram is trying to mislead by spreading lies. I think they should stop acting this way at such a crucial time when people are angry and upset.” Accusing Mizoram of constructing camps on the former’s land since August 26, the SP said repeated letters to the Kolashib administration in this regard elicited no response, prompting the police to use force to stop the work.“On August 26, we noticed two camps constructed by Mizoram on our land at Dholakhal area under Bilaipur Police station. Along with me, DC and forest officials of Hailakandi wrote letters to Kolashib district administration of Mizoram, but no response came. They again started constructing new camps using a JCB excavator which we the stopped because it was happening on our land,” he said.Last week, Assam Police had objected to the construction of a bridge, by Mizoram, in Hailakandi district and forcefully stopped the work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-accuses-assam-police-of-abducting-worker-fresh-row-erupts-101630607782629.html

03-09-2021||India||Tamil Nadu to bring legislation for NEET exemption, says health minister Subramanian||Tamil Nadu will soon bring legislation seeking exemption from the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission into undergraduate medical colleges and send it to President Ram Nath Kovind for his assent, the health department said on Thursday. Presenting the department’s policy note, health minister M Subramanian, said a committee of secretaries, headed by the chief secretary Irai Anbu, has suggested promulgating an act indicating the need for elimination of NEET in medical education. “This will ensure social justice and protect all vulnerable student communities from being discriminated against in admission to medical education programmes,” he said. Tamil Nadu has been consistently opposing NEET for admission to medical courses. Recalling that the government constituted a high-level committee under the chairmanship of retired Justice A K Rajan, to study the impact of NEET on socially and economically backward students, the minister said the committee submitted the report to the government in July, and the majority of stakeholders had opposed the exam. NEET is an emotive issue in Tamil Nadu, with more than a dozen cases of students from poor and rural backgrounds dying by suicide related to the exam. The issue has also gone through several legal and political wrangles. The AIADMK government, in 2017, passed two bills seeking exemption from NEET but was rejected by the Centre. The minister also announced 11 new government medical colleges to be established in Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar, Nilgiris, Dindigul, Tiruppur, Namakkal, Nagapattinam, Krishnagiri, Tiruvallur, Kallakurichi and Ariyalur with an intake of 150 MBBS seats each. “Administrative and financial sanctions have been accorded for construction of buildings and creation of new posts as per the National Medical Commission norms. Now, the construction of buildings is in progress,” he said.The minister went into detail on how the state managed Covid-19 during the second wave when the DMK government took over in May. “Present thrust is on vaccination and localised containment and active surveillance..” he said. “With the vaccine drive and continued vigil, it is hoped that the impact of Covid-19 will come down further in the coming days.” As hospital and oxygen support infrastructure is being augmented, he added that currently, Tamil Nadu has a storage capacity of around 1794.75 mt of Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-to-bring-legislation-for-neet-exemption-says-health-minister-subramanian-101630607595389.html
03-09-2021||India||Use only native bulls in Jallikattu: Madras HC||The Madras high court on Thursday directed the Tamil Nadu government to ensure that only native breeds of bulls are allowed to participate in Jallikattu, prohibiting the use of imported, hybrid or crossbreeds for the sport. In 2014, the Supreme Court had banned the event following an appeal by the Animal Welfare Board of India and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). But political parties and sections of people in the state rallied behind the sport, saying that Jallikattu is part of Tamil Nadu’s tradition and culture and it should continue. In 2017, huge protests erupted across the state for the ban against Jallikattu to be lifted. The Tamil Nadu government unanimously enacted legislation to amend the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, to preserve the cultural heritage and ensure survival and continuance of native breeds of bulls. Citing that the very purpose of the legislation was to persevere heritage and culture, for which western breeds shouldn’t be used, public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in 2019 in the Madras high court seeking only native bulls be used and groomed as Jallikattu is played in Tamil Nadu since the Sangam era. A bench of justices N Kirubakaran (since retired) and P Velmurugan on August 18 passed an order to this effect with five directions for the conduct of Jallikattu, and the order copies circulated on Thursday. “The intention of the Act is to preserve and protect the native breeds of bulls,” the court said. “The adjective ‘native’ identifies and classifies distinctly indigenous breeds of bulls only and it excludes other types of bulls like hybrid and imported bulls. Hence, the provision of law should be strictly interpreted giving restrictive meaning to ‘native breeds of bulls’.”The court further directed the concerned authorities to get a certificate from veterinary doctors to certify and ensure that the participating bulls are native breeds only. They shall encourage bull owners and farmers to groom native breeds by way of subsidy or incentives. The court also pointed out that native breeds of bulls alone have got the hump, which is a necessity for a bull to participate so that the tamer can either cling or embrace the animal by holding on to the hump for 30 seconds or run with the bull for 15 meters or sustain three jumps of the bull. Jallikattu is usually played during the harvest festival of Pongal in Tamil Nadu in January and earlier this year the state government permitted it by following Covid-19 protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-only-native-bulls-in-jallikattumadrashc-101630607594229.html
03-09-2021||India||Hyd police arrest scam-hit Karvy’s CEO, CFO in ₹137 crore loan default case||The Hyderabad police on Thursday arrested the chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO) of scam-hit Karvy Stock Broking Pvt Ltd in connection with the ₹137 crores loan default case. Rajiv Ranjan Singh (52), CEO, and G. Krishna Hari (63), CFO, were taken into custody by officials of the Central Crime Station (CCS) of the Hyderabad police. Before this, C Parthasarathy, the chairman of the company was arrested on August 19 on charges of defaulting ₹137 crore loan to IndusInd Bank.The arrests were made after the vice-president of IndusInd Bank, Hyderabad, lodged a complaint with the police, alleging that Karvy availed credit facilities to the tune of ₹137 crores from the bank by pledging securities/shares and personal guarantee of its chairman and managing director Parthasarathi. The bank alleged that Karvy officials suppressed facts that the securities belonging to clients were pledged without their consent. In 2019, the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) also barred Karvy from taking new clients after it was found that the brokerage firm allegedly misused clients’ securities worth over ₹2,000 crores. However, this is not the only case in which Karvy officials have been booked. On August 25, the Cyberabad police (separate commissionerate covering Hyderabad’s IT hub of Hitec City) also registered a case against Karvy Stock Broking Pvt Ltd for allegedly duping ICICI Bank of ₹563 crores. On Thursday, the Hyderabad police, in a press release, said that the accused company became a “defaulter” by diverting funds into its own, and connected businesses entities. “The complaint bank was left with no collateral, and thereby KSBL defaulted in repayments of about ₹137 crores as on 31.03.2021,” it added. According to Avinash Mohanty, joint commissioner of police (detective department), Rajiv Ranjan Singh, who is in charge of trading and broking, executed trading accounts of nine companies from 2014 to 2019, and Krishna Hari diverted funds, which was raised from banks by pledging client securities as collateral to nine shell companies on verbal instructions of Parthasarathi. It was allegedly done to show a huge turnover and market share of Karvy in the stock market, and it also caused a huge loss of ₹300 crores, which was shown as book debts. “Further, several criminal cases were registered at CCS DD Hyderabad against the accused company and others,” said the police. The aforementioned persons were arrested and produced before a local court for judicial remand. They have been booked under sections 406, 420, 409, 421, 422, 120(B) R/w (read with) 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). M. Yugandhar Rao, the co-founder of Karvy group, who is also an accused in the case, is yet to be arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyd-police-arrest-scam-hit-karvy-s-ceo-cfo-in-137-crore-loan-default-case-101630607534345.html

On Thursday, the state reported 32,907 fresh Covid cases with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 18.41% after testing 174,301 samples and 188 deaths, the state health ministry said. For the first time since May, the active caseload has crossed the 240k mark as fresh cases raised the total tally to 240,186.Sivankutty defended the government’s plans to reopen schools, saying that the experts’ meeting convened by the government on Wednesday favoured the decision and a final call will be taken by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan after recommendations of the new committee. Earlier, the state government said schools will be opened only after vaccinating all children, but had second thoughts after neighbouring state Tamil Nadu reopened schools. Besides TN, at least six other states have reopened schools after the case tally dropped drastically.“The education department will constitute a panel to study whether the situation in the state is feasible to reopen schools. It will also prepare a project detailing which classes can be opened initially. A final decision will be taken by the CM,” he said. For the last two academic years, classes are conducted virtually in the state.In the experts’ meeting, many said since hospitalisation was not increased significantly, it was a clear indication that the current surge in disease transmission is not out of control. So, the state can think of reopening socio-economic sectors. A section of the experts, not present in Wednesday’s meeting, opposed the plan to re-open schools. “This is not the right time. We have no idea how the minister concluded this,” said public health activist Dr S S Lal, who earlier served with the World Health Organisation.Experts like Lal said the current pandemic condition will prevail in the state till mid-September and the government should wait till then. The alarming hike and its consistent prevalence forced many experts to link it with a possible beginning of a third wave. The opposition parties in the state are yet to react to the government’s latest plan. This week, the state’s accumulated share of cases was above 70 per cent. This is the third day in a row the state is reporting over 30,000 cases, Monday being an exception due to low testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-considers-reopening-of-schools-amid-alarming-spike-in-covid-19-cases-101630607475752.html
03-09-2021||India||Six arrested in Telangana for killing three of a family: Police||The Warangal district police on Thursday arrested six persons in connection with the murder of three people belonging to the same family. The arrests were made a day after Mohd. Shafi, the main accused, barged into the house of his elder brother Chand Pasha, and murdered him and two others over a business dispute, police said. The murder took place in the LB Nagar area of Warangal town on September 1. The crime was committed by Shafi after he sought ₹1.2 crores from Chand Pasha to clear some debt. Both the brothers were engaged in the cattle trade. They would purchase the animals from rural areas and sell them to slaughterhouses in Hyderabad, the district police said.“There are three brothers actually, and the elder (Chand Pasa) and the second (Shafi) were in the cattle business together. There were differences between them over sharing of profits, and the accused said that his elder brother had bought properties and was not giving him money to clear his debt,” said Warangal district commissioner of police Tarun Joshi, quoting the accused. On Wednesday, Shafi and five others barged into Pasha’s house, killing him, his wife Sabera (42) and Sabera’s brother Khaleel (40). Chand Pasha’s sons Fahad (20) and Samad (24) were injured in the attack.The other five accused have been identified as Boini Venkanna, Md. Said, R. Vijender, Md. Akbar and Md. Pasha. “All five of them are known to Shafi through the cattle business he was running. They used a long knife to commit the murder, which was procured from Hyderabad,” said Joshi. All of the six accused have been arrested and sent to judicial remand, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-arrested-in-telangana-for-killing-three-of-a-familypolice-101630607474349.html
03-09-2021||India||T’gana fails to get more share of Krishna water during 14th KRMB meeting||Telangana’s bid to share water on a 50:50 ratio from the Krishna river basin with Andhra Pradesh was unsuccessful as both sides refused to yield even one bit during the 14th Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) meeting which was held on 1 September. The meeting witnessed heated discussions from both sides, with officials from Telangana’s irrigation department even walking out once during the meeting on Wednesday, which went on for nearly 10 hours after starting at 11 a.m. The current water sharing ratio of 66:34 (AP-TS) ratio will continue for this year, which senior irrigation department officials from both states confirmed. Telangana, which was bifurcated from AP in 2014, was allocated 299 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of water, while AP was given 512 TMC from the total 811 TMC which the erstwhile joint state of Andhra Pradesh had. Based on an agreement signed in1976 to distribute the roughly 2060 TMC feet of Krishna river water, Maharashtra was allocated about 560 TMC feet, Karnataka 700 TMC feet, and 811 TMC feet was allocated for (erstwhile) Andhra Pradesh. The Krishna river now runs across the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, AP and Telangana.“We were unable to convince the board to get a higher share of water from the Krishna river. The arguments from both sides nearly resulted in a fight,” said an official from Telangana’s Irrigation department, who did not want to be quoted. Telangana has been seeking a higher share of water from the Krishna river citing higher irrigation and drinking water needs since 2018. The issue of Telangana seeking a higher share of Krishna water is currently pending before the Krishna River Water Disputes Tribunal - 2 (KWDT-2).“The issue is that unfortunately in a 2015 meeting with the Ministry of Jal Shakthi, the current 66:34 ration was agreed upon, which has been recorded in the minutes of the meeting as well. So AP cites that,” the Telangana official informed.When contacted, a senior irrigation department official from AP who did not want to be quoted said, “We put forth our arguments as well. The same issue (Telangana seeking higher share from Krishna river) is also pending with the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-2, so we pointed that out as well. The meeting went in our favour.”Officials from both the Telugu states on Wednesday evening also met for a meeting of the Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) to discuss water sharing and other issues as well. The Godavari river is however devoid of any common projects between both Telugu states. It has about 2,000 TMC of water, which is shared on a 50:50 basis. On Wednesday, the meeting of the KRMB and GRMB also discussed modalities and issues concerning the Centre taking over all of the projects under the Krishna and Godavari rivers. A gazette notification for the same was passed by the Centre on July 15. It stated that the KRMB and GRMB will take control fully from October 14. Officials from both states said that a roadmap is being prepared for the same. “The river management boards will not take over fully because we can’t let it run smaller irrigation and drinking water projects. There will be people from both states on the board, so hopefully it will function smoothly,” said the official from Telangana. Among other things, Telangana has also opposed AP from diverting water from Godavari river basin into the Krishna river’s basin for its projects. As per a bifurcation agreement, the KRMB also has to shift to Andhra, while the GRMB will permanently be in Telangana. As of now, the KRMB is in Hyderabad given that it is still the joint capital of both states till 2024. It is learnt that the AP government wants to shift it to Visakhapatnam (about 550 kms away from the river basin), but Telangana officials want the KRMB office to be closer to the basin.In the KRMB meeting, other items that were discussed in the 10-hour long meeting were: providing funds to the board, filling up vacant posts, utilising water during surplus years, jurisdiction of the board, power generation problems, minor irrigation projects etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tgana-fails-to-get-more-share-of-krishna-water-during-14th-krmb-meeting-101630607416106.html
03-09-2021||India||Tamil Nadu CM Stalin announces memorial for Vanniyar agitation victims||Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Thursday announced that a ₹4-crore memorial for 21 people who died in police firing during the Vanniyar quota agitation in 1987 would be constructed in Villupuram district, marking the state’s stance on social justice.“I made this commitment to honour the sacrifice of those who struggled for social justice during the by-elections for Vikravandi (assembly constituency in Villupuram in 2019),” said Stalin, adding that his family, too, belongs to a socially backward community.The agitation paralysed the entire state for at least a week, when Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK), later AIADMK, founder MG Ramachandran (MGR) was the chief minister. The agitations were quelled when the DMK came back to power in 1989, and M Karunanidhi created 20% reservation for MBCs, and Vanniyars were among the 108 caste groups in the list. But the community said that their representation and access to opportunities were still abysmal.Recently, the DMK government passed a government order to implement the 10.5% reservation for the Vanniyar community, introduced by the previous AIADMK regime earlier this February, to appease its ally the PMK (Pattali Makkal Katchi), a Vanniyar caste-based party, whose founder S Ramadoss was in the forefront of the agitation in the 1980s.The announcement for the memorial comes ahead of the local body polls in the state. The DMK’s principal ally, the Congress’ floor leader K Selvaperunthagai went a step ahead by asking the PMK to reconsider its alliance status-quo. Since the 1990s, PMK has oscillated between the DMK and AIADMK in assembly and parliamentary elections. In 2016, for the first time, PMK went alone, projecting former Union minister Anbumani Ramadoss as its chief ministerial candidate, but were unsuccessful.Selvaperunthagai recalled that PMK founder Ramadoss had organised a social justice conference in 1989 thanking Karunanidhi for providing the 20% reservation to MBCs. The Congress leader then said that in 2019, when PMK joined the AIADMK-led NDA alliance for the parliamentary elections, he had asked them how they can align with a party that shot down the 21 people “like pigeons”. He added, “Now, the DMK government, which has been protecting your community is ruling the state. I appeal to the PMK founder to ponder over who had stood by you and your people all through.”However, the PMK leaders present in the House did not respond but released a statement welcoming the announcement.In the late 1970s, Ramadoss forged a coalition of Vanniyar community groups, which later came under the umbrella of the Vanniyar Sangam (Federation of Vanniyars). It continues to be the parent body of the PMK. In the 1980s, the Sangam was carrying out protests demanding MBC status for Vanniyars. MGR, at that time, was hospitalised in the US and held discussions with the group on his return, but he soon passed away in 1987.Last year, ahead of the assembly elections, the PMK revived this decades-old demand and threatened to walk out of the alliance with AIADMK if their reservation demands weren’t met. In December 2020, the PMK cadre, who were on a state-wide protest for the reservation, pelted stones on a train, brought traffic to a standstill as the Chennai police sealed its borders to restrict them from entering the city. Subsequently, then chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami ordered a statewide caste-based data, and before the model code of conduct came into effect, passed the 10.5% reservation bill for Vanniyars in jobs and education. Political experts do not see Stalin as extending an olive branch to the PMK but rather to wipe them out completely by catering to the larger Vanniyar community. “By staying with the 10.5% reservation and announcing the memorial, Stalin is taking a pro-Vanniyar stance to neutralise Ramadoss’s position,” said political commentator Raveendran Duraisamy.Karunanidhi had built up a solid Vanniyar presence within the DMK to counter Ramadoss’ rise. “But Stalin is playing it differently,” he said, adding that he is doing what late J Jayalalithaa did by giving importance to leaders and people of the Vanniyar community but she took an anti-PMK stand. “Stalin is in a profitable alliance so he doesn’t need to appease the PMK when he can win over the community at large. He also wants to dilute the AIADMK-PMK combination,” said Duraisamy. At least seven districts in Tamil Nadu have a dominant Vanniyar presence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-cm-stalin-announces-memorial-for-vanniyar-agitation-victims-101630607414756.html
03-09-2021||India||Taliban leaders keen to assess India’s stance towards group||As the Taliban move closer to the formation of a government in Afghanistan, senior leaders Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai and Anas Haqqani have been engaged in discreet efforts to gauge the thinking in New Delhi towards the group.Both Stanekzai, the deputy head of Taliban’s political office in Qatar, and Haqqani, a member of the group’s negotiating team, have also been part of an outreach towards India over the past week. This has resulted in them being seen as the main contactpersons for any Taliban contacts with the Indian side in the coming days.Haqqani, the youngest son of Haqqani Network founder Jalaluddin Haqqani and brother of Taliban deputy leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, has been in contact with intermediaries in Kabul and New Delhi to assess the latest thinking on the Indian side regarding the Taliban, people familiar with the developments said on condition of anonymity.During these contacts, Haqqani indicated a clearer picture regarding any sort of formal engagement with India would emerge only by the end of September, the people said. This was because the immediate task of the Taliban is forming a government and consolidating its position across Afghanistan.Haqqani also indicated during these contacts that if the Indian side had conditions for any engagement with the Taliban, his group too would have certain conditions, the people said.The overtures from Stanekzai, who trained for several years at the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun in the early 1980s, didn’t cause as much surprise in New Delhi as the outreach from Haqqani, whose family still heads the Haqqani Network, linked to some of the most brazen attacks on Indian interests in Afghanistan.Former ambassador Amar Sinha, who served as India’s envoy in Kabul, said the Haqqani Network would have a “special problem” in living down its long-standing connections with Pakistan.“We can listen to this charm offensive but we also have to put them to the test. There has been credible evidence linking the Haqqani Network to attacks on Indian interests,” he said.The Haqqani Network was famously described in 2011 by Admiral Mike Mullen, then chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, as a “veritable arm of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence”. Recent reports have suggested that the Haqqani Network will seek to control the intelligence set-up and interior and defence ministries in the new set-up.Indian, Afghan and US officials have said over the years that there was strong evidence the Haqqani Network was behind the July 2008 suicide car bombing at the gate of the Indian embassy in Kabul, which resulted in the death of nearly 60 people, including defence attaché Brig Ravi Datt Mehta and diplomat V Venkateswara Rao.There have also been reports of the Haqqani Network working closely with Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) fighters in Afghanistan.Both Stanekzai and Haqqani have in recent days made public remarks that appear to be aimed at assuaging Indian concerns regarding the Taliban and its reported ties with Pakistan’s military establishment.In a video statement issued last week, Stanekzai said the Taliban wants to continue Afghanistan’s political, economic and cultural ties with India.Haqqani, in an interview with the News18 channel, even went to the extent of saying there is “nothing like the Haqqani Network, but only the emirate” of the Taliban, which wants good and positive relations with all countries, including India. He added that though the Indian government had supported the Taliban’s opponents in Afghanistan for 20 years, the group didn’t want to remember the past as it wants good relations with all nations.The Taliban, Haqqani said, wouldn’t interfere in the Kashmir issue, even as he dismissed reports about links between the Haqqani Network and the Pakistani security set-up as “propaganda”.Gautam Mukhopadhaya, who served as India’s envoy to Afghanistan, Syria and Myanmar, said there is a need to ask hard questions about the outreach to India by Taliban leaders.“While these assurances are welcome and should not be dismissed, we should ask hard questions about the motives of their outreach, which is mainly to get legitimacy from the one historically important country for Afghanistan – India, what the trade-offs would be in terms of our friends, what security guarantees are worth taking into account the Kabul airport attacks, and how they could protect anyone from the machinations of the ISI, with which they have close ties,” he said.Mukhopadhaya, also a senior visiting fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, added, “India has had some sort of working arrangement for security and the departure of its nationals but it has not granted legitimacy to the Taliban set-up. Once that is granted, we would have lost everything and have no bargaining chip. We would also betray the principles on which the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was founded or whatever resistance may appear.”He said India shouldn’t give in to the current trend of recognising the Taliban because of the uncertainty about Afghanistan’s future, which “could range from a good case scenario of an inclusive transitional administration to a resistance and civil war, to an Iraq-Syria scenario”. But he advocated maintaining a window to continue people-to-people contacts and humanitarian aid, which should be routed through the UN or international organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-leaders-keen-to-assess-india-s-stance-towards-group-101630607359536.html
03-09-2021||India||I pray to Waheguru daily that the mistrust ends: Harish Rawat amid Punjab crisis||The Congress in-charge for Punjab, Harish Rawat, spoke to Ramesh Vinayak and Navneet Sharma about the tussle between chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and the party’s state chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. Edited excerpts:Who will lead the Congress in the 2022 polls – Captain Amarinder or Sidhu?The Congress has some established norms that are applicable to all states. Where we are in government, both the CM and the PCC president are there. The PCC chief represents the AICC. The CM runs the government and people want to see how you have governed the state. This is the standard practice. After the elections, MLAs sit together and almost always they resolve to leave the decision of selecting the leader to the Congress president. Therefore, who will be the face of the party is not an issue.But, the party had named Capt Amarinder Singh as its CM face before the 2017 polls.We were not in the government then. Amarinder Singh Ji was PCC president at that time. He was named the chief ministerial candidate to boost the prospects. At present, we are in the government... Both situations cannot be equated. Both are very important people and have their role and responsibilities.What about your statement last week that the party will go into the polls under Capt Amarinder’s leadership?My complete statement was not reported. I had made mention of the Congress tradition in this regard, but it was left out. It was unfortunate that some of my colleagues made it an issue of public debate. Instead of talking to the media, they should have called and spoken to me.When the Congress high command made Sidhu the PCC chief, it was expected that it would solve the issue between the leaders, but it hasn’t, and the party still has two centres of power.We were also hoping that with greater responsibility and a bigger platform under his feet, he will be able to resolve contradictions. I think he will learn by experience. We will have to understand one thing that Sidhu’s politics is based on anti-incumbency. When Sidhu was in BJP, he was criticising the SAD even though the two parties were in alliance. The issues he raised were also taken up by the Congress, but they are not so simple that you can resolve them by pressing a button. I know how the chief minister has to walk on a razor’s edge on several issues. He has to ensure that there is no social or communal backlash.But Sidhu is emerging as the biggest critic of his own government.There is difference in the way we look at it. On PPAs, electricity bill, bus permits, etc, I am as vocal as Sidhu is. Should I be seen as my own government’s critic?Why can’t the CM convince Sidhu about all this?Sidhu is convinced. To certain extent, I will like him to stick on these issues. After all, I have to see everything with electoral angle also. We will find a solution to all these issues if not today, then tomorrow.If that’s so, what is behind the tussle between Sidhu and CM?I pray to Waheguru with folded hands daily that mistrust between the two should end. You have to deal with psychology of human beings. The CM has his own experience and Sidhu has his own style. When you have such people, it is difficult to make them bond... it takes time.What is the root cause of this mistrust, temperamentally they are different or there is no chemistry?There are many things – background, personality and approach. These cannot be rectified in one day. I am quite hopeful that we will solve this problem before the elections, and everything will be in order.Isn’t the Congress losing out in the battle of perception?We are fortunate that our competitors are like lost gamblers otherwise we would have faced problems. I have no hesitation in admitting this.There is strong perception that Sidhu’s elevation and 18-point agenda have eroded Capt Amarinder’s authority.We are an old party and I have been a chief minister myself. Do you think I do not understand that if the CM’s authority is eroded whom will it hurt? Circumstances were such that we needed to take a decision. Unfortunately, the CM took a public stand. I had advised him against taking a stand in public. If any decision was taken against his stand, it was not eroding his authority. In democracy, nobody is the last word. Sometimes, the Congress president’s decisions are changed by the working committee.You once said that Sidhu is like a Rafale. Is he in control or gone out of control?Rafale is always in control. Its control system is excellent. I have not wasted my 55 years in politics. You should have some faith in my art. Our Rafale will hit the opposition. At this moment, we are refining its weaponry system||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-pray-to-waheguru-daily-that-the-mistrust-ends-rawat-amid-punjab-crisis-101630607114162.html
03-09-2021||India||50 farmers, 7 cops injured in clashes near Badal rally in Punjab’s Moga||Moga police on Thursday used batons and a water cannon to disperse a group of protesting farmers who allegedly tried to disrupt a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) rally led by party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, people familiar with the development said.Around 50 farmers and at least seven policemen were injured in the clashes which erupted after protesters allegedly broke barricades to enter the rally venue at the grain market on Moga-Ferozepur road around 1pm, DSP (City) Jashandeep Singh Gill said.Around 40 farmers were detained and several cases under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, National Highway Act and The Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act were registered against unknown persons at City Police Station, Moga, police said. Seventeen named people have also been booked in this regard, they added.The police action on the cultivators came nearly a week after several protesters were lathi-charged while heading towards Karnal to protest against a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) meeting. Around 10 farmers were injured in the incident. On Wednesday, the Haryana government transferred Karnal sub-divisional magistrate (SDM-civil) Ayush Sinha, who was caught on camera directing police to hit protesting farmers in Karnal in their heads if they breached the security cordon.Badal, who began a 100-day “yatra” across 100 assembly constituencies in Punjab ahead of the polls next year, alleged the protesters were “not farmers but owed allegiance to the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party”.Some of the protesters, police claimed, hurled stones in a bid to force their way inside the venue, prompting security personnel to resort to water cannons and a cane charge on the crowd. More than 10 vehicles were also damaged in the incident.“The police have repeatedly urged farm unions to exercise their democratic right to protest in a peaceful manner. But the protesting farmers broke the police barricading with tractors, scuffled and pelted stones at cops. The mob also vandalised vehicles of police and the general public. Gurdeep Singh, deputy superintendent of police, Moga, was hit in the head with a stone and presently, he and other six cops are undergoing treatment in the hospital,” Moga senior superintendent of police Dhruman H Nimbale said.The protesting farmers, however, claimed that they were trying to peacefully enter the rally venue when police used force on them.“The administration and police department promised a meeting with Badal as we wanted to ask some questions. But they did not organise a meeting for us with him. Upset over this, the farmers were peacefully trying to march towards the rally side when police used water cannons and cane-charged us. At least 10 to 20 famers were received major injuries while over 40 received minor injuries,” Baldev Singh Zira, general secretary of Bharti Kisan Union, Krantikari, said.Condemning the clashes, SAD leader Bikram Singh Singh Majithia said, “The attempts to disrupt the massive Akali gatherings being organised as part of the party’s ‘Gal Punjab Di’ campaign were part of a deep-rooted conspiracy of the Congress in conjunction with the Centre to disturb the hard-won peace in Punjab and impose president’s rule in the state.”(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-farmers-7-cops-injured-in-clashes-near-badal-rally-in-punjab-s-moga-101630606996042.html

03-09-2021||India||Mizoram schools to admit Myanmar refugee children||The Mizoram government has requested all district education officers to admit the children of Myanmar refugees in state-run schools on humanitarian grounds, months after hundreds of families fleeing a military coup in the neighbouring nation entered India.Mizoram shares a 400-km border with Myanmar, where the military junta in February this year toppled the elected Aung San Suu Kyi-led government and put several political leaders under house arrest.“I am to state that Chapter 2(4) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009 (RTE Act-2009) mentioned that children aged between 6 and 14 years belonging to disadvantaged communities have the right to be admitted to school in a class appropriate to his or her age for completing elementary education,” the state’s director of school education James Lalrinchhanda said in an August 31 letter to education officers in districts and sub-districts.“I, therefore request you to take necessary action on admission to migrant/refugee children in your jurisdiction to school so that they can continue their schooling,” he said.The order did not specifically mention children of Myanmar refugees, but Mizoram minister for school education Lalchhandama Ralte told HT that the directions were largely meant for the children of Myanmar nationals who entered Mizoram following the military coup earlier this year.“The decision was taken by the department on compassionate and humanitarian grounds. Even the RTE Act mentions the right of children to receive education,” he said over the telephone from Aizawl.“There are nearly 400 children of Myanmar refugees who fall in the age group of six to 14 years. Most of them are in Champhai and Aizawl districts. They will be admitted to government schools from September itself,” Lalchhandama added.Since March this year, thousands of Myanmar nationals -- including politicians, parliamentarians, government officials, policemen and their families -- have crossed over to Mizoram.Most of these refugees, who came from the Chin province of Myanmar are currently based in the bordering Champhai district in Mizoram. Over a thousand others are believed to be in Aizawl.Mizoram Police’s criminal investigation department said in June that 9,247 refugees had entered the state from Myanmar and were spread out in 10 districts with over 4,000 in Champhai and over 1,600 in Aizawl, according to a Press Trust of India report.Earlier in March, the central government directed four states that share a land border with Myanmar — Mizoram, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur — to stop illegal migrants and deport them back to Myanmar.Following that directive, Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 18 and said the order was “not acceptable” to the state.“I understand that there are certain foreign policy issues where India needs to proceed cautiously. However, we can’t ignore this humanitarian crisis,” the CM, who also pointed out the ethnic ties between the Chin people and the Mizos, had said.“Mizoram cannot just remain indifferent to their sufferings. India cannot turn a blind eye to this humanitarian crisis unfolding right in front of us in our own backyard,” Zoramthanga had written.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-schools-to-admit-myanmar-refugee-children-101630606873521.html
03-09-2021||India||Supreme Court airs concern over spread of fake and ‘communal’ news||The Supreme Court on Thursday expressed concern over the proliferation of fake news and the communalisation of reportage and asked the Centre if it is “really serious” about fixing accountability on web portals and other media to check the menace. The court observed that communalisation of news gives the country a “bad name”.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, lamented that there were several web portals and YouTube channels maligning judges and the judiciary that do not care to respond when questioned about the basis of their reports.“There seems to be no control on web portals. They can publish anything they like. If you go to YouTube, how much fake news and distortions take place there? There is no control. Anybody can start any channel, any TV and report anything,” observed the bench, also including justices Surya Kant and AS Bopanna.The court was hearing a clutch of petitions, led by Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, seeking directions to the Union government to stop the dissemination of fake news and take strict action against a section of the media for spreading communal hatred and bigotry through their reportage.Representing the Centre, solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed the bench that the new information technology rules that came into force this year seek to address several of the issues highlighted by the court by striking a balance between self-regulation and statutory control. He added that the government is committed to ensuring the flow of “unadulterated news” to the audience while being mindful of the freedom of the press.The bench, however, responded: “You have a regulatory regime for TV and newspapers but are you suggesting these web portals and YouTube channels require no regulation? Are you really serious about the regulatory regime? The problem is that everything in this country is shown from a communal angle. That’s a very serious problem. Ultimately the country is going to get a bad name.”Mehta replied that the 2021 IT Rules have brought about a regulatory regime to also cover digital news portals. “These rules have been challenged in various high courts. One high court has passed an interim order staying a part of the rules. We have filed a transfer petition before this court so that the issues are finally dealt with by the Supreme Court,” added the S-G.The CJI said: “I have never come across any web portal that responds. They never respond. They have given a bad name to the institution and when they are asked questions, they say it is our right to carry anything.”Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, representing one of the petitioners, said he is himself a victim of this phenomenon as microblogging website Twitter removed him from the platform and also objected to his filing a writ petition before the Delhi high court against the removal.The CJI retorted: “They hear voices of only powerful people. They don’t hear voices of common man like judges, etc., and write anything against the institution without any accountability.” The bench further observed: “Let us have a meaningful and full debate on all these issues.”The court accepted Hegde’s request to amend his petition in the backdrop of the new IT and cable TV rules that have been notified and certain provisions of the new rules that he sought to challenge. The court asked all the counsel, including the S-G, to file their response and rejoinder affidavits to the amended petitions and listed the matter after six weeks.Acceding to S-G’s plea, the bench said the transfer petitions filed by the Centre for bringing different cases pending before various high courts against the new rules to the top court for an authoritative pronouncement will be heard together with the present batch of cases.On July 9, the Kerala high court restrained the Centre from taking any coercive action against members of the News Broadcasters Association (NBA), which challenged the new IT Rules on the ground that they give government authorities “excessive powers” to “unreasonably and impermissibly restrict” the media’s freedom of speech and expression. The NBA is a consortium of 78 private TV news and current affairs broadcasters, including the country’s leading 25 news channels.The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021 were introduced in February this year. The new rules applied to digital news media platforms, social media intermediaries and OTT platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-airs-concern-over-spread-of-fake-and-communal-news-101630606816789.html
03-09-2021||India||Don’t attend mass events unless fully vaccinated: Govt||The Union health ministry reiterated on Thursday that all mass gatherings should be discouraged ahead of the country’s upcoming festive season, and if attending such events is absolutely essential for someone, then full vaccination must be treated a prerequisite.The second Covid-19 wave is “not yet over” in the country, and spike in cases has always been observed as soon as festive seasons get wrapped up, senior officials health ministry officials warned on Thursday.While nationally the positivity rate continues to show an overall declining trend since the week ending May 10, several districts still have very high positivity rates, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said during the government’s Covid-19 press briefing. A total of 39 districts reported a positivity rate of over 10% in the past week, while another 38 districts had a positivity rate of 5-10%, he added.Government experts urged people to get both their vaccine shots as soon as possible and to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour in the coming weeks.Till Thursday night, around 700 million doses of the vaccine were administered to 514.6 million people, with 155.2 million people fully vaccinated and 359.4 million people receiving one shot, according to government data. When seen alongside the country’s projected adult population of 940 million (according to the Census of India’s National Commission on Population), this means that while 54.7% of India’s adults have received jabs, only 16.5% of those above the age of 18 are fully vaccinated.Several festivals across nearly all faiths such as Ganesh Chaturthi, Dussehra, Eid Milad un-Nabi, Diwali, along with holidays such as Gandhi Jayanti, are lined up in the coming 8-10 weeks. Covid infections saw a major spike in Kerala in the past two weeks – a phenomenon experts have attributed to Onam festivities and the laxity of restrictions on social movement through the festival.“The key message we wish to convey to everyone is that we must be careful particularly in the context of the festive season. Therefore, we make a very strong plea even as we accelerate the vaccination programme… our precautions must continue. The time has not yet come to live life without wearing a mask. Like last year, this year also festivals need to be celebrated in a modified way. We will have to wait for celebrating festivals such as Ganesh Chaturthi, Navratri, Eid etc. with great fervour,” said VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.“It is best to celebrate within [your] family, and avoid crowding at places and stepping out unnecessarily. Shopping at market places must be done very carefully without overcrowding. The wave seems to be stabilising even though it is not over yet… virus mutations can still turn this tide against us,” said Paul.Apart from celebrating at home, senior government experts stressed on the continuous importance of people being careful about ensuring Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed. They also urged that people should embrace vaccination as availability of doses is increasing.Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), underlined measures that he stressed are absolutely essential to stop new Covid-19 waves: wearing masks even after vaccination, avoiding gatherings and getting fully vaccinated.“I have a few points to make: it is absolutely essential to wear a mask even after vaccination; mass gatherings should be discouraged, particularly in the upcoming festival season because we still have few districts which are having the problem; and full vaccination should be a prerequisite if it is absolutely essential or it becomes critical to have a gathering of some people,” he said.Bhushan, while sharing data, also urged people to not drop their guard as the second wave was not over yet. There are still 42 districts in the country that are reporting at least 100 new Covid-19 cases each day, he said.As for weekly positivity, 39 districts are reporting weekly positivity rate of 10% or more, while another 38 districts currently have weekly positivity rate between 5% and 10%. Centre has asked states to monitor districts reporting higher than 5% case positivity rate to get to the cause of increased disease transmission, and taking immediate containment measures have been suggested for those districts that are reporting higher than 10% case positivity.It is also a matter of concern that the weekly case positivity rate that had dropped under 2% around the end of July and first week of August has again seen a slight increase – the weekly positivity rate in India currently stands at 2.62%.Experts also emphasise the need for avoiding crowded places for now.“Some things are basic when we talk about fighting an infectious disease that is as transmissible as Covid-19. Gatherings should be avoided and wearing a mask is mandatory. Vaccination is important and should be taken as it is proved that vaccines currently in use help the progression of disease to severe levels, and these certainly reduce deaths to a large extent.The vaccines also work against variants in circulation; therefore, people should take these,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonary department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-attend-mass-events-unless-fully-vaccinated-govt-101630606813417.html
03-09-2021||India||Terror from Afghan soil key concern, says India||India stressed on Thursday that its main concern on Afghanistan was the use of Afghan soil for terrorism or “anti-India activities”, and said that it was too early to discuss any possible recognition of the new Taliban regime now in control in the country.New Delhi’s position was outlined by external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi two days after India officially acknowledged a meeting with the Taliban in Doha. India is also focused on the evacuation of its nationals who are still in Afghanistan, Bagchi said.Tuesday’s meeting between India’s envoy to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, and Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai, head of the Taliban’s political office in Doha, has given rise to questions on whether New Delhi has softened its position on the Taliban and could be considering the recognition of any new set-up created by the group in Kabul.At a regular news briefing, Bagchi ducked all questions on whether India still perceives the Taliban as a terror group and on recognising any government formed by the group, and said: “Our main concern, one of the primary, immediate concerns is that Afghan soil should not be used for anti-Indian activities or terrorism against India. That is one of our main issues.”India’s focus is not on whether the Taliban is a terror organisation, and “the focus, let me reiterate, is that Afghan soil should not be used for terrorist activities of any kind or [for] anti-India activities and we will try to focus on that element”, Bagchi said.The Indian side has seen reports about the formation of a government by the Taliban, but has no details regarding the nature of this dispensation, Bagchi said. He said there was “no update” on any invitation being extended to India to participate in the inauguration of such a government.Setting aside questions about recognising a Taliban government, he said, “Let’s just treat the Doha meeting for what it is – it is just a meeting and I think these are still very early days.”India used the meeting in Doha as an opportunity to convey its concerns, including evacuation of its nationals and terrorism, and “received a positive response” from the Taliban side, he added.In response to a question on why the Taliban had not publicly acknowledged the Doha meeting, which was held at the group’s request, and why there were no photographs of the interaction, Bagchi said: “I think it just didn’t happen, it’s just a meeting, it wasn’t really that kind of an event where photos are taken. I don’t think there’s any thought behind it [that] we don’t have a photo of it. I think neither side took a photo.”Bagchi sidestepped a query on whether India has a road map for further engagements with the Taliban by saying: “We wouldn’t have done anything without giving it some thought. Let’s see how things move.”As reported by HT, the Indian side opened channels of communication with specific Taliban factions and leaders, including Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, last year. However, Tuesday’s meeting in Doha was the first time New Delhi has officially acknowledged an interaction with the Taliban.The triumphant return of the Taliban has triggered concerns that the group’s victory could re-energise jihadi groups across South Asia, particularly anti-India terror organisations based in Pakistan, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. In a message congratulating the Taliban, al-Qaeda has called for the “liberation” of Kashmir.India has not spelt out its position on the Taliban since the group assumed power in Kabul on August 15, following the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. Over the past few days, Stanekzai and senior Taliban leader Anas Haqqani have been engaged in an outreach towards India.The US completed the drawdown of its forces from Afghanistan on August 30, though secretary of state Antony Blinken has said Washington will remain focused on counter-terrorism and holding the Taliban accountable to its commitments in this regard.Bagchi also said India is prioritising the evacuation of Indian nationals and some Afghans, though this issue is linked to the resumption of operations at Kabul airport. “We will have to revisit this issue when the airport is operational, we will have to wait for that. There is no clarity now,” he said.He declined to give a number for the Indian nationals still in Afghanistan, but said the “vast majority” of citizens who wanted to leave had already returned home. “There are very few Indians left, we are in touch with them,” he said.Asked about the status of Afghan nationals coming to India, he said the emergency e-visas being issued since August 16 were valid for six months. Other Afghans who were already in India had had their visas automatically extended during the pandemic, and internal discussions were ongoing on other “specific issues”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terror-from-afghan-soil-key-concern-says-india-101630606753392.html
03-09-2021||India||National Green tribunal does not have suo motu powers: Centre to Supreme Court||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) does not possess suo motu powers but it can act on letters or communication addressed to it raising environmental concerns, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Thursday.The submission was made by additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) during a hearing of a bunch of appeals, seeking the court’s decision on whether the tribunal has the power to directly take up issues on the basis on news reports or at the instance of any letter or communication.“The NGT does not enjoy any suo motu powers. But this cannot be stretched to the extent to suggest that a letter or application cannot be entertained by it. The tribunal cannot be tied up in procedural law for exercising power which is amply available to it under the Act. Once the tribunal receives any communication, it is duty bound to take cognisance of that,” ASG Bhati said, conveying the government’s point of view.A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Hrishikesh Roy and CT Ravikumar responded that the ASG’s submission is “crucial” to the case since MoEFCC was the ministry which piloted the bill constituting the NGT through Parliament.Bhati said that the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, was enacted with the purpose of protecting the environment, and the only objection of the Centre was with regard to vesting suo motu powers to the tribunal and its members through which they can initiate action on their own.The bench said that the problem arises by using the generic term “suo motu”. “Even we are not using the term suo motu. But when a communication in the form of a letter or a sworn affidavit is received, should the Tribunal ignore it or will it be duty-bound to consider it?” The court agreed that procedural law requires the tribunal to act on an application or appeal filed before it. However, the judges wondered if this formal step could be substituted by converting a letter or a news report into an application and taking the process forward by issuance of notices to the authors of the new report and to the alleged defaulters or authorities concerned.The court-appointed amicus curiae (friend of Court), senior advocate Anand Grover, supported Centre’s view. Grover said: “What is meant by suo motu is that the Tribunal or its members cannot initiate action or trigger the process on basis of reading a newspaper report.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngt-can-act-on-letters-communication-but-not-on-news-reports-centre-tells-sc-101630596253070.html
03-09-2021||India||Kashmir locked down as Syed Ali Shah Geelani gets quiet burial||Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani was on Thursday buried in a quiet funeral at a graveyard near his residence in Srinagar’s Hyderpora amid a clampdown on movement and communications in Kashmir. The burial took place around 4.30am with Geelani’s family alleging that the police forcibly took away his body.Geelani’s son, Nayeem, said police officers told the family the burial would have to happen at the local graveyard before dawn. “We told the police that he desired to be buried at Eidgah (in old Srinagar), and that we wanted to bury him there in the morning... The officer in charge... told us that there is pressure from higher officials to bury him at night,” he said.He added that the police forcibly took away the body at 3am. “The body was taken to a local mosque and later buried after religious formalities. They asked us to attend the funeral, which we refused.” He also claimed the family requested the police to wait till the morning so that other relatives could gather but that this request wasn’t accepted. Nayeem said the family visited the grave in the morning.The police action was likely prompted by a desire to avoid a mass gathering, which may have turned restive or violent. Inspector general of police (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar refused to comment on Nayeem’s allegations.Nayeem said even after his death, authorities were fearful of his father. “They (government) thought that this death could trigger an upheaval.” Nayeem said his father developed a breathing problem at 9:30pm on Wednesday. “We put him on the oxygen support, but he passed away around 10pm.”Geelani, the face of separatism in Kashmir for over three decades, died after a prolonged illness at 91. The separatist leader, who spent around two decades in jail, was largely confined to his residence because of ill-health since 2010.As soon as the news of Geelani’s death broke, authorities enhanced security across the Valley. Hundreds of security personnel patrolled streets, put up barricades, and sealed key roads to restrict the movement of people in a clampdown similar to the one imposed after the nullification of the region’s semi-autonomous status in 2019. Shops and businesses were shuttered while the movement of vehicles was restricted. Internet connections and mobile networks were snapped and even journalists were prevented from covering the funeral. Only the post-paid mobiles of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited were working in Kashmir.Forces were deployed across Kashmir and all the roads leading to Hyderpora were sealed. Officials said additional troops were deployed, especially in Srinagar’s old city and north Kashmir including Geelani’s hometown Sopore.News agency Press Trust of India reported that Geelani’s family was asked to carry out the burial at night as a precautionary measure because of intelligence reports that suggested some “anti-national elements” could use the opportunity to create a law-and-order situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/geelanis-family-alleges-forced-burial-at-night-amid-clampdown-in-kashmir-101630587012385.html

03-09-2021||India||Wet spell over northwest India, including Delhi may hit 4-day pause: Met||The wet spell over northwest India, including Delhi, is likely to abate for the next three to four days, continuing the trend seen in this monsoon season of intense rains interspersed with relatively dry spells, but will resume from early next week, the India Meteorological Department said.However, in the same period, rains will increase over peninsular India and the west coast, the Met said.A low-pressure area is likely to develop over Bay of Bengal on September 6; it is likely to travel westwards and bring widespread rains over central and parts of northwest India.“A wet spell is just ending with widespread rains over northwest and west India. Another wet spell is likely to begin from September 6 in association with the likely development of a low-pressure area,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.“The remnant of a low pressure system is still bringing widespread rains over Gujarat and the Kutch region. The same system was bringing widespread and intense rain over Delhi and other parts of northwest India till Thursday. The system has now weakened but a western disturbance is also impacting the region. Now, with the development of a low-pressure area around September 6, we can expect an active spell, especially over central India,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.The extended rain forecast of IMD indicates there will be widespread rains over central and east India at least till September 16, and fairly widespread rains over parts of east and northwest India till September 23.The normal date for commencement of monsoon withdrawal from northwest India is September 17. The withdrawal may be further delayed this time, IMD said.“We do not have a forecast for monsoon withdrawal but our long-range forecast is showing good rains at least till September 16 so we have to monitor conditions closely,” said Mohapatra.According to IMD, widespread rainfall with isolated very heavy rain is very likely over Saurashtra and Kutch during the next 24 hours, and isolated heavy rain is also very likely over Gujarat and the Saurashtra and Kutch regions on Friday.Rainfall activity over south peninsular India is likely to increase from September 4, with widespread rainfall and isolated heavy rain very likely over Konkan, Goa, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu between September 4 and 6; Karnataka, Kerala, Mahe and Marathwada on September 5 and 6; and over Madhya Maharashtra on September 6.Rainfall over Central India is also likely to increase from September 5. with widespread and heavy rain over Chhattisgarh till September 6; Vidarbha and Madhya Pradesh are also likely to record heavy rain.Meanwhile, scattered rain is likely to continue over east and northeast India including Assam, Meghalaya, sub-Himalayan West Bengal for the next couple of days.There is 9% deficiency in rain since June 1 across the country with 13% deficiency each over northwest and central India, 8% over east and northeast India, and an 8% excess over the southern peninsula.IMD expects the monsoon in September to be 110% of the long period average, which will reduce some of the deficit, although overall rainfall in the June-September season will still be at the “lower end of the normal category”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-to-reduce-over-northwest-india-another-wet-spell-likely-after-sept-6-101630583172079.html
