The move comes only weeks after the ministry of education (MoE) directed all centrally funded higher education institutes to fill up vacant reserved posts on a mission mode. In a letter issued on August 23, MoE directed all centrally funded higher education institutes such as IITs, Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and National Institutes of Technology (NITs) to fill vacant faculty positions, especially in the Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC) and economically weaker sections (EWS) categories, by September 2022. From this month on, institutes will have to send a monthly report on the actions taken to fill vacant positions. V Ramgopal Rao, director, IIT-Delhi, said, “In the last board of governors meeting, we have discussed the matter. We are planning a special recruitment drive for faculty as well as postdoctoral fellowships.” Details for the drive are yet to be chalked out. A senior official from IIT-Bombay said that the institute, too, is planning a special recruitment drive following directives from MoE. However, details are not clear yet. “We will have a mission mode drive soon (for faculty recruitment). Wait for a while,” said Subhasis Chaudhuri, director, IIT-Bombay. On Monday, IIT-Banaras Hindu University (BHU), issued a public advertisement for the special recruitment drive and called for applications to fill posts reserved for SC, ST, OBC, EWS and disabled candidates. The drive is for posts at assistant, associate and professor levels. The portal for recruitment is now live. IIT-Kharagpur, too, issued a similar public notice on September 1. The special recruitment drives are a consequence of last month’s letter from Amit Khare, secretary, department of higher education, MoE. “I am writing in connection with the faculty positions that are lying vacant, especially in SC, ST, OBC and EWS category in the central higher education institutions (CHEls) functioning under the administrative control of the ministry of education. In order to clear this backlog, it has been decided that all CHEls should fill these vacancies in a mission mode within a period of one year starting from September 5, 2021 to September 4, 2022 and to report about the action taken and progress made in this regard,” he said in the letter. As directed by MoE, institutes will now have to include a separate chapter in their annual report depicting the status of filling up of backlog vacancies in tabular format during the year. They will also have to include an agenda item in every finance committee / board of governors/ board of management meeting, apprising the committees and boards of the status of filling up of backlog vacancies. Government of India mandates a reservation of 27% in faculty positions for candidates from OBC category, 15% for SC and 7.5% for ST candidates. However, HT had earlier reported that none of the 22 IITs in the country have more than six teachers from ST category, and 18 of them have 10 or less candidates from SC category on their faculty rolls. Seven IITs had 10 or less faculty from OBC category, HT has reported earlier based on responses received under RTI. Of the 23 IITs in India, data for IIT-Mandi was unavailable. Pawan Goenka, retired managing director and chief executive officer of Mahindra Group and chairperson of the board of governors of IIT-Bombay and Madras, had earlier told HT, “The board of governors of IIT-Bombay and Madras is well aware of the gaps in diversity with respect to reserved categories and gender. But we also know that it is not for lack of trying. These IITs are taking proactive steps to address these gaps while going through the recruitment process as per the prescribed norms. I am sure other IITs are doing the same.” Meanwhile, relatively newer IITs such as Palakkad and Goa have been conducting special recruitment drives every year, ahead of the directives of MoE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iits-launch-special-recruitment-drives-to-fill-reserved-faculty-posts-following-moe-order-101631384830235.html
11-09-2021||Mumbai||Covid and surgery: Doctors tweak process, adopt methods to minimise risk of infection||Early this year, when a 65-year-old Covid positive woman admitted to a hospital in Nagothane suffered from a sudden heart blockage, she was rushed to the Fortis Hospital in Vashi for an emergency intervention. Her heart rate had fallen to 30, much below the normal range of 60 to 100. Doctors took her into the hospital’s fifth-floor catheterisation laboratory to implant a pacemaker, a small device that sends electrical impulses to the heart muscle. But a surgical procedure on a patient with an active Covid-19 infection would mean risking the medical staff with the infection too. To minimise the risk, the medical team decided to limit the use of cautery- an electrosurgical machine commonly used to burn and seal a bleeding blood vessel, that produces smoke during the process. This surgical smoke could potentially be carrying the virus and thus be a huge threat to the medical staff in closed operation theatre. “To fit in the pacemaker in the chest wall, we needed an incision of about the breadth of four fingers,” said interventional cardiologist Dr Brajesh Kanwar. “We opted for other techniques like pressing the bleed with gauze and using mosquito forceps- a type of forceps used to control bleeding. But eventually, we had to give in to the cautery machine to burn one bleeder that wouldn’t stop easily,” he said. As the pandemic unfolded in March 2020, surgical procedures came to a complete halt except for emergencies like the case of this 65-year-old woman. When doctors set out to operate on such special cases, they introduced some tweaks and changes on the operation table to reduce the risk of infection inside the theatre. While surgical work has now resumed to a large extent, doctors have stuck to these techniques as a precaution amidst the fear of breakthrough infections and reinfections. “Every patient can be infective at any given point of time,” said Kanwar. “The infection control norms and the personal protection norms are here to stay for a long time. Certain shortcuts that can save time in the operation theatre are also going to be widely used. For instance, a surgeon may opt to use a stapler instead of a suture to save time and limit the exposure in the theatre, especially if the patient has an active infection. Instead of cutting the tissue, doctors may opt for dissecting with the use of closed forceps. This reduces bleeding and in turn, reduces the use of smoke-producing cautery machine. These decisions have to be balanced with the kind of case one is handling,” said Kanwar who has carried out nearly 20 pacemaker implantations and over 150 angioplasties in active Covid patients since last year. Doctors opt to delay the invasive interventions by at least two weeks if patients have active Covid infection and if the surgery can wait. “But there are some cases in which waiting is not an option at all,” said Dr Manmohan Kamat, head of general and minimal invasive surgery at the Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital. He cited an example of a 64-year-old Covid positive woman who was shifted from a nursing home with acute abdominal pain. Investigations revealed that she had bowel gangrene which had to be operated out immediately before the infection spread. However, such a surgery would involve heavy spillage of digestive chyme- the partially digested food and secretions of the gastrointestinal tract- which may be highly contagious. “The procedure involved making a cut on the abdomen and removing at least five feet of the small intestine,” said Kamat who has operated on nearly 15 patients with an active Covid infection. “We managed to minimise the spillage by using a stapler cutting method, instead of a clamp and cut method,” he said adding that he preferred carrying out open surgeries on such patients instead of laparoscopic procedures. Among the surgical emergencies, gynaecologists were perhaps the first to jump in the operation theatres amidst the raging pandemic to conduct normal deliveries and cesarean sections of Covid positive women. The Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital in Sion has carried out nearly 500 deliveries of Covid positive women, more than half of them are C-sections. In the process, the gynaecology department adopted several protocols including the use of a knife to cut open the lower abdomen instead of using the cutting probe in the cautery machine, which cuts and helps reduce the bleeding, but produces excessive smoke. “To control bleeding, we opted for ligating the blood vessel by suturing,” said Dr Arun Nayak, the head of the gynaecology department. “The ligating process takes longer time, but we have stuck to it. In cases where use cautery was unavoidable, we used a suction machine to trap the smoke,” he said. According to Nayak, they have also started using an acrylic box while intubating a patient and administering anaesthesia. “The acrylic box creates a transparent barrier between the patient and the anaesthetist and reduces the direct flow of aerosols from patient’s breath or cough on the doctor,” he said. Protocols outside the operation theatre include micro- coordination in terms of sanitising the trail of Covid patients when they are brought into the hospital and moved from one department to another within the premises for investigations. Interventional cardiologist Kanwar said that Fortis Hospital, Vashi has a mic system that announces the movement of Covid patients so that the staff can promptly follow the trail and spray the area with disinfectant as a precaution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-and-surgery-doctors-tweak-process-adopt-methods-to-minimise-risk-of-infection-101631384828393.html

Aiming to improve the ranking, Krishan Kumar, secretary school education, Punjab, recently set guidelines related to the aims and strategies of NAS for all school heads and principals during an online training session.The school heads and principals shared their preparation strategy with the secretary. Schools including GSSS Rajewal, Khanna block, GSSS Lalton Kalan, GMS Manglitanda, GHS Sihan Daud, Dehlon-2; also came up with posters to encourage students to perform well in the survey. With around two months left for the survey, the education department is conducting weekly tests and has prepared special modules including, educational videos for NAS that are shown to students in all schools.The strategies to achieve the target include dissemination of assignments to students based on learning outcomes, conducting weekly quizzes, questionnaires on each subject and topic, projector classes for better preparations, NAS training sessions for teachers and lecturers along with school heads and principals; sharing NAS notes modules and solved material from the 2017 examination.Davinder Singh Chhina, nodal officer and principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Shahpur, Ludhiana, said, “Last time, Punjab’s performance was dismal, but this time, our students are prepared to bag the first spot. We are conducting a series of mock tests. A mock drill for NAS is expected to be organised in the first week of November. It will help students excel in the final exams”.Meanwhile, Lakhvir Singh Samra, district education officer, secondary, said NAS aims to help to improve the level of learning among students and develop their overall personality.‘Not child centric but target centric’A few school heads, on the condition of anonymity, termed the ongoing preparations as ‘target-centric’.“The students are mugging up the concepts to be covered under NAS. These preparations are not child centric but target centric. Due to upcoming elections in Punjab, the education department is focused on achieving 100% results which are not possible in reality. Moreover, students are not being able to focus on the mainstream studies and examinations as they are only getting classes for NAS”, voiced a school head.

I used to tell people that one day they will get to see on the same screen, people laughed at me including family members.” Telling more about his journey the UPite says, “During my school days I took part in a few plays. After clearing intermediate I joined theatre. A year later my father passed away that incident made me more adamant to prove myself. Initially, I was into mimicry and started going to places within the state for acts. So, from my town to Kanpur then Lucknow, Delhi and finally I reached Mumbai. Theatre was not paying me well but when I joined event companies. I was doing commercial plays and stand-up acts which gave me better money.” He has been part of crime shows made for an UP-based channel. “I tried my hand in acting and production with the short film Sorry Mom (2017) which was based on de-addiction. It ran widely at de-addiction and rehabilitation centre. Then I got to shoot Rock Band Party with Govind Namdev ji but unfortunately it got shelved. Meanwhile, I launched my start-up which helped me sustain in the city. Now I believe that additional income is must to realise one’s acting dreams. It’s a very tough world out there.” Besides acting in the film Sitapur…he also donned the hat of an executive producer. “I will be next seen in Sagar Pathak’s movie Cypher. Besides, I am shooting for Ek Nashebaaz and its second schedule will be shot in Mumbai from mid-September. Gabriel Vast is the director as well as the lead with Geetanjali Sharma and Govind Namdev. I am associated with the project Kaand... which will be shot in Lucknow,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/additional-income-is-a-must-to-realise-one-s-acting-dreams-shiva-shukla-101631384528350.html

11-09-2021||Delhi||J&K leader found dead in west Delhi flat: Police say one suspect held a grudge over eviction from Jammu gurdwara committee||New Delhi: The police team investigating the murder of Tarlochan Singh Wazir, the 67-year-old former member of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) legislative council and a senior National Conference leader from Jammu whose body was found in a west Delhi flat, has found that one of the two absconding suspects nursed a grudge against Wazir over his eviction from the management committee of a gurdwara in Jammu.Police said Harmeet Singh, who was removed from the committee a year ago, reportedly on Wazir’s behest, expressed his anger against the J&K leader before some people, said a senior police officer associated with the probe. Police are also looking for other motives to link the prime suspect, Harpreet Singh, who was close to Wazir and had reportedly rented the flat in Basai Darapur near Moti Nagar in west Delhi, where Wazir’s body was found in a semi-decomposed state on Thursday morning.“As of now, we really don’t know the exact motive behind Wazir’s murder. We are working on two-three probable theories, one of which is related to Harmeet’s eviction from the gurdwara management committee on Wazir’s suggestions. The actual reason will be known only when we catch Harmeet and Harpreet,” the officer added.Initial autopsy report shows that Wazir died of a bullet injury in his head and the time of his death was sometime on September 2, another police officer privy to the development in the case said.The Jammu & Kashmir police were already searching for Wazir as he was supposed to reach Canada on September 3 to attend a family function. The family had tried to contact Wazir on his cellphone but the call was answered by Harpreet, who informed that he had already board the flight but had forgot to take his mobile phone with him. Before turning off Wazir’s mobile phone on September 4, Harpreet had called Wazir’s brother in Jammu and confessed to killing him, along with Harmeet. The brother alerted the Jammu & Kashmir Police and the search operation began, the police said.“We have learnt that Wazir frequently visited Harpreet’s flat in west Delhi. On August 15, Wazir had come to attend Harpreet’s birthday party that he had organised at the flat. Another visit was in the last week of August. We are trying to find out what went wrong between Wazir and Harpreet,” the second officer added.Police said many people known to the two suspects are being questioned in the case while multiple teams are conducting raids in Jammu, Punjab and Delhi-NCR to catch them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jkleader-found-dead-in-west-delhi-flat-police-say-one-suspect-held-a-grudge-over-eviction-from-jammu-gurdwara-committee-101631383507915.html

11-09-2021||Noida||G Noida: Woman files fake complaint of car robbery||A 25-year-old woman lodged a fake complaint of car loot, alleging that two people robbed her of car at gunpoint in Dadri on Saturday morning, which was later recovered from another society, said police. The woman, identified as Sonu (single name), a resident of Amka Road in Dadri, works in a private company in Greater Noida. In her complaint registered with the police, Sonu alleged she left for work around 7:20am on Saturday. “I hardly travelled 100m in my car when two armed criminals forced me to stop the vehicle at gun point. They snatched my car and fled the spot,” she said. Pradeep Tripathi, station house officer of Dadri police station, said a case was registered against unknown persons under Section 392 (robbery) of the IPC. “We launched an investigation and recovered the car from another society. Preliminary investigation shows she lodged a fake complaint,” said Tripathi. Police said they are trying to ascertain why the woman filed a fake complaint. “Prima facie investigation shows the car was financed. It appears the woman made up the story to evade car loan payment,” said Tripathi. Police are questioning the woman and also investigating the CCTV footage in the nearby areas to see whether someone else was also involved in her plan. Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, also said the woman faked the loot case. “We are investigating the matter from all angles. We are not in a position to share more details right now, but we can confirm that this was not a loot case,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/g-noida-woman-files-fake-complaint-of-car-robbery-101631383028639.html
11-09-2021||Noida||Lotus Boulevard case: Security agency may lose licence||Noida police have recommended cancelling the licence of security agency, CISS Bureau, days after a handful of guards of the agency deployed at Lotus Boulevard in Sector 100 allegedly assaulted a resident of the society on September 8. The society’s Apartment Owners Association (AOA) has also ended its contract with the agency and is now looking for a replacement. Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said prima facie, investigation shows the security guards were not adequately trained. “The security agency also did not comply with the rules laid down in the Private Security Agencies (Regulation) Act, 2005. Noida police have submitted a report to the ADG law and order, Uttar Pradesh, seeking for the cancellation of the agency’s licence,” said the DCP. Suresh Kumar Singh (55), a resident of Tower 28 in Lotus Boulevard, said on September 8, he had asked for the key to the building’s shaft from a security guard as he was installing broadband connection at his home, for which the technician needed access to the shaft. “The security guard refused saying I needed fresh permission from the management. I had sought permission a day before. After a heated argument with the guard, I took the key and got the work done,” he said. Singh said when he reached the ground floor, some 15-20 security guards attacked him with canes, iron rods and cricket bats. The incident was captured in camera and was widely circulated on social media. A case was registered against five named and 15 unnamed persons under Section 147 (rioting), Section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), Section 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC at Sector 39 police station. Singh also named the AOA president Tej Prakash in his complaint. Prakash said he had no connection with the incident. “I have not talked to that man (Singh) for over a year. We condemn the incident and resolve to ensure the safety of residents. The same day (September 8), we called a residents’ meeting and decided to replace the security agency. The society has nearly 3,000 flats and 10,000 residents. We are looking for a suitable agency,” he said.Meanwhile, the security agency said the security guards were provoked. Sandeep Kumar, regional manager of CISS Bureau, said Singh first called the security guard from his flat demanding for the keys to the shaft and then abused him. “He then reached the ground floor, abused and slapped the guard. The guard then informed about the incident to other security guards, which led to the unpleasant incident,” he said. Kumar said the security agency had taken charge in May this year and that these guards were hired from the previous company, which was in charge of the society’s security. There are around 119 security guards in the society. The security agency alleged they approached Noida police for a counter FIR but their application was not accepted.On September 9, the police had arrested eight security guards while one more was arrested on Friday. All the suspects are currently in judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/lotus-boulevard-case-security-agency-may-lose-licence-101631382787344.html
11-09-2021||Noida||Commuters suffer as rain lashes Noida, Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad was in a “watery” mess on Saturday as roads got inundated, residents grappled to flush out water from their homes, commuters struggled to push their broken-down vehicles through waterlogged stretches and long traffic jams dominated major roads as the city received one of the heaviest showers this monsoon. Noida too received its fair share of high rainfall on Saturday, that left several roads waterlogged. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Ghaziabad district recorded 26.6mm rainfall on Saturday against the estimated normal precipitation of 2.4mmfor September 11. So far, since June 1, the district has received total 267.7mm rain against the normal of 491.9mm. Noida received 31mm rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Saturday, taking the city’s overall rainfall to 187mm against the average precipitation of 491.7 mm. R K Jenamani, a senior scientist at IMD said, “The region may see another spell of rainfall on Sunday... but later, the intensity will drop. There is a low pressure area over eastern Rajasthan that is causing the rainfall in the region. It’s effect will eventually wear out. However, the low intensity sporadic light rains may continue beyond Sunday.” According to weather experts, monsoon will remain active in the region as another low pressure area is also developing. “There is a fresh low pressure area developing in north-east Bay of Bengal and this is likely to reach Odisha by tomorrow (Sunday). This will lead to further rains in central and north-west India from September 16 onwards,” Dr M Mohapatra, director general of meteorology, IMD.Meanwhile, the high intensity rainfall in both the regions led to water logging, traffic snarls and jams at several places.Vinay Gautam, who lives in a ground-floor house in Valmiki Kunj near Patel Nagar II in Ghaziabad, watchedhelplesslyas rainwater started entering his house since early morning. “There was one-and-a-half foot water in my home. I and my family members watched in despair as water entered our home and damaged our belongings. We couldn’t even flush out the water since the roads were already waterlogged. Last week, when it rained heavily, it took two days for the water levels to recede,” said Gautam. Heavy rain, coupled with a road cave-in near Shipra Shrishti high-rise in Indirapuram, forced most residents to stay indoors. “There was heavy waterlogging near Shipra Sun City, Ahimsa Khand II, Vaibhav Khand and other areas. Moreover, there was a major road cave-in near Shipra Shrishti high-rise, that was more than 10-12ft wide. We informed the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) but no one responded till 10am,” said Alok Kumar, a resident of Arihant Harmony in Ahimsa Khand II, Indirapuram. A K Chaudhary, executive engineer from GDA, said several teams were deployed in Indirapuram. “We also roped in jetting machines to flush out water. The caved-in road was barricaded, and repair will start once rain stops,” said Chaudhary. As heavy rainfall lashed Ghaziabad till Saturday evening, dozens of vehicles broke down on major roads like the Link Road, GT Road and Meerut Road due to heavy waterlogging. Vijay Nagar resident Pradeep Kumar took about an hour to cover a distance of about 7km from Crossings Republik to Kavi Nagar. “There was more than 1ft water at Lal Kuan intersection. When I tried passing through the industrial areas, they too were heavily waterlogged. Besides, many vehicles broke down and that compounded traffic,” said Kumar. The situation was no different in Vaishali, where there was heavy waterlogging in Sectors 2, 4 and 5. “I postponed my travel in the morning due to heavy waterlogging. When it rained previously, my car broke down and I had to shell out a heft amount for its repairs,” said Mohit Sharma, a resident of Vaishali’s Sector 1. “We had to deploy all of our eight towing vans since early morning to tow the vehicles which broke down at Bhopra, Mohan Nagar, Arthala, Meerut tri-junction and other places. Our personnel were on the roads throughout the day to streamline traffic and remove snarls,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic). Officials of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation said their teams were deployed in all five zones. “Due to heavy rain, we implemented the plan we rolled out in August to tackle waterlogging in different areas. Different teams headed by our officers were deployed across the city to flush out water from waterlogged stretches. The volume of rainwater was exceptionally high on Saturday, and it will take some time for the water levels to recede,” said Ghaziabad municipal commissioner M S Tanwar. In Noida, the worst affected areas were Labour Chowk, the underpass at Mamura metro bridge in Sector 61, parts of Sectors 51, 62, 72, 75, 76, Barola and the underpass at Sector 18. “The traffic was moving very slowly due to heavy rainfall and waterlogging. The worst affected area was the stretch from Said Temple to Parthala Chowk, from where we had to reroute vehicles through Gadhi road. Traffic was also affected at Kulesara in Greater Noida, Labour Chowk in Noida and the underpass after Mamura ,” said an official from the Noida traffic police department.“We installed pumps and deployed workers to flush out water from inundated roads. By evening, most of such waterlogged areas were cleared,” said an official from the Noida authority, requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, residents said there was no improvement in the authority’s approach to solve the perennial issue of waterlogging. Manoj Chandel, a resident of Sector 76, said, “The underpass at Sector 18 was heavily waterlogged in the morning when I was leaving for work. When I returned in the evening, the water from underpasses was flushed out but the road above still had water on the sides.” Amit Gupta, a resident of Noida’s Sector 77 and a social worker said, “The Noida authority takes up works that requires digging at roadside. At Sector 77, there are big craters, which have been dug to maintain pipes, which have been left open and are filled with water.” Man struck by lightning dies A 22-year-old man, identified as Guddu, a resident of Yaseen Garhi in Dasna, died after lightning struck him at a pond in Ghaziabad’s Dasna around 2pm on Saturday. “The man had gone fishing at a pond, when lightning struck him. He suffered severe burn injuries and died on the spot,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of rural police. He added his friends Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Salim also suffered burns, but they were discharged after primary treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/commuters-suffer-as-rain-lashes-noida-ghaziabad-101631382667525.html

11-09-2021||Chandigarh||First hate crime victim in US after 9/11: Respecting diversity will be big honour to Balbir, says brother||Sikhs have always stood up for justice for everyone and respecting people of different colour, creed and gender will be a big honour to Balbir Singh Sodhi, the first victim of hate following the 9/11 terror attacks, according to his brother. As the world marks the 20th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks in which nearly 3,000 people from over 90 countries were killed, Rana Singh Sodhi recalled the tragedy that struck his family just days after the terror attacks in the US when Sikh people began to be targeted because of their appearance. “My brother, who believed in Sikhism, had a beard and turban on his head. The person thought he looked more like a Talib. He associated our turban with those Taliban and shot and killed my brother,” he said in a video message issued by the National Sikh Campaign. In a tribute, the Sikh Coalition said that on September 15, 2001, Sodhi “was planting flowers outside his gas station in Mesa when he was shot and killed by a man supposedly seeking retribution for the terrorist attacks four days earlier”. Sodhi’s death marked the first recorded deadly post-9/11 hate crime, it said. Sodhi’s killer Frank Roque is serving life in prison. In the video, Rana Singh Sodhi recalls receiving a phone call from his brother on the day of the terror attacks on the World Trade Centre, asking him to turn on the TV and see the news. “Our country got attacked here. Same day, I think they started showing (Osama) bin Laden images on the TV,” he said, adding that before 9/11 he was never concerned about his security. But after the terror attacks, people started “yelling to us ‘Go back to your country” and using expletives, he said. The day his brother was shot, Rana Singh Sodhi said he got a call from one of the employees about a shooting. “And I called my brother and he didn’t answer and then I learned he got shot,” he said. He said his family got justice as the killer was caught within 24 hours and put behind bars. “That justice makes a lot of difference. What we have as Sikh values and American values, they are very equal and well connected to each other. America will always stand for justice and we have a history as Sikhs that if you see injustice right in front of your eyes, you should stand up,” he said. Rana Singh Sodhi said: “We all humans are equal — colour, creed and gender. To honour my brother, if you love your neighbours, if you respect people with different colour, creed and gender, it will be a big honour to my brother”. Rana Singh Sodhi said that every year on the day they lost Balbir , his family members have been gathering at the gas station where he was killed to remember and honour him. This year, they will welcome a wider group of people on this important anniversary, “so that we can pay tribute to all those who have been hurt by hate and also share the love and support that my family has felt for 20 years with the nationwide sangat,” he was quoted as saying in the statement issued by the Sikh Coalition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/first-hate-crime-victim-in-us-after-9-11-respecting-diversity-will-be-big-honour-to-balbir-says-brother-101631381777790.html
11-09-2021||Gurugram||Four, including wife, booked for abetting suicide of Farrukhnagar resident||The city police booked four persons, including the wife and in-laws of a Farrukhnagar resident, for allegedly abetting his suicide. A case was registered against the four persons under sections 306 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code at the Farrukhnagar police station on Friday, based on a complaint registered by the victim’s father, the police said. According to the police, the complainant alleged that his daughter-in-law, her mother and two other relatives were responsible for leading him to take the extreme step on August 25. In his complaint to the police, the father, a resident of Kheda Jhanjrola in Farrukhnagar block, told the police that his son had consumed a poisonous substance and he died at a private hospital. He told police that at the time of the incident, he was not aware of the reason for the suicide but that later, while cleaning the room of his late son, the family found a diary in which he had written a suicide note.

11-09-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram rain leaves roads waterlogged, commuters stranded||Residents woke up to a heavy spell of rain on Saturday morning, with 34.8mm of rainfall leaving several stretches heavily waterlogged and commuters stranded. Many also took to social media to highlight their plight, despite there being fewer vehicles on roads on account of it being a weekend. Heavy waterlogging was reported from the Galleria market Road, at Khandsa on National Highway 48, Narsinghpur Chowk, parts of Dundhahera and interior roads of Palam Vihar, among other stretches, including parts of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. Traffic movement was affected at a few points of NH-48 between Dhaula Kuan and Gurugram, near Galleria Market, Khandsa, New Colony Road in Sector 7 and parts of Sector 52. A small part of a road also caved in near Manesar on Saturday morning, following a spell of heavy rain. “All our personnel were on alert and on specific spots where traffic congestions were reported to facilitate the traffic flow. Traffic snarls started being reported in the second half of the day but, heavy traffic jams were not reported as such,” a senior official of the traffic department, requesting not to be named, said. Residents took to social media to report that a security camera near Sushant Estate in Sector 52 broke down due to heavy rain, which could eventually lead to accidents. Meanwhile, officials from the infrastructure-II division of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority said that waterlogging was relatively lower on Saturday as the city did not receive heavy rain in a short span of time. “Gurugram received heavy rain once in the morning and late afternoon, but mostly throughout the day, it was drizzling. Due to this, water did not accumulate at one particular point for long and could flow into the stormwater drains easily. This time, water receded quickly from one of our regular spots, Medanta underpass, where water accumulates every time (it rains). Water receded quickly from most roads today (Saturday) as it drizzled mostly,” the official said, requesting anonymity. Explaining reasons behind the decrease in waterlogging this time, the GMDA official said that during repair work after the first spell of rain this monsoon, GMDA found that walls were built in stormwater drains due to which flow was affected. “We had sent cameras down the manhole near Medanta, when we found that almost three walls had been created due to accumulation of dirt and waste, which affected flow of stormwater. We also made sure that on-ground teams clean fallen leaves and other materials blocking the openings of drains beside the roads immediately,” the official said. Besides these measures, super-sucker machines and dewatering pump sets were also used. In 2019, the GMDA had placed eight dewatering pump sets, four tractor-mounted suction pumps, one earthmover, two super-sucker machines, and 5,000 gunny bags at a flood control room in Sector 53. About 10 people worked there round-the-clock, in shifts, to serve as a control room to handle waterlogging problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-rain-leaves-roads-waterlogged-commuters-stranded-101631381710903.html
11-09-2021||Gurugram||Emerald Hills residents protest over lack of access road||Residents of Emerald Hills condominium in Sector 65 on Saturday held a sit-in protest outside their society to protest against the lack of an access road and lack of corrective measures after a temporary access road caved in last month.Residents said that they have approached the developer, Emaar, and the government authorities but there has been no resolution. They said that the Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) had also inspected the area and directed the developer to repair the road.Satyanand Shukla, a member of the residents’ welfare association (RWA) said that more than 100 residents took part in the protest on Saturday. “We plan to fight until the developer provides us with three 24-metre access roads and repairs the caved-in road on priority,” he said.The protesters also threatened to block the Golf Course Extension Road and the deputy commissioner’s office at the Mini Secretariat if their issues are not resolved.The developer, however, said that the construction of 24-metre roads to the condominium falls under the jurisdiction of local authorities. “This matter has been followed up regularly with authorities at various levels. Repeated attempts have made been to repair and restore but all such sincere efforts and attempts have, time and again, been stalled by locals. Concerned authorities have been apprised of the issues involved, and we await their intervention in order to resolve the matter,” a spokesperson for Emaar said.A senior official of the DTCP, when asked about the matter said that this issue is under consideration of the department.”We are aware of this matter and will resolve it soon,” the official said.Protesters said that around 3,000 residents of the condominium are suffering for the past month since the road caved in. They also alleged that there has been no action on the ground on complaints to DTCP and CM Window. They alleged that authorities continue to shift the blame among one another and the developer, despite residents having paid external development charges for basic infrastructure.“Despite being just 200 metres away from the Golf course Extension Road, it takes a five-kilometre detour and 30 additional minutes to reach the main road (from the society).The world seems to be so out of bound for us, especially ladies and Kids,” Swati Wilton, a resident, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/emerald-hills-residents-protest-over-lack-of-access-road-101631381709780.html

11-09-2021||Other||Rahul Gandhi’s references a cold comfort for Kashmiri Pandits: BJP||“Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Kashmiri Pandit’ references during his two-day tour of Jammu are a cold comfort for the Kashmiri Pandits, who have all along been the victims of the Congress’ appeasement policy in Jammu and Kashmir,” senior BJP and KP leader Ashwani Kumar Chrungoo said on Saturday.He was reacting to Rahul’s statements during his visit to Jammu and Kashmir during which he had identified himself as a Kashmiri Pandit.“It needs to be clarified that the Kashmiri Pandits have no ‘Gandhi’ surname. A fake narrative that Gandhis are Kashmiri Pandits is rejected ab initio. The Kashmir policy of the Congress party under Nehru and Gandhis is the progenitor of the Kashmir problem right since 1947. Kashmiri Pandits were the worst victims of the Congress’s Kashmir policy,” Chrungoo said.In 1989-90, when terrorism overwhelmed the socio-political scenario in Kashmir, there was a coalition government of National Conference and Congress in J&K under the leadership of Farooq Abdullah, he said.“Genocide, ethnic cleansing and mass exodus of the Kashmiri Pandits took place during the same period in 1989-90. Congress is equally responsible for what was done to the Kashmiri Pandits,” he said.“Moreover, when reports after reports were sent to the central government right from 1984 to 1989 regarding the emerging security situation and terrorism in Kashmir, it virtually sat on those reports and allowed the situation to go out of hands. The result was that the communalism, separatism and terrorism ruled the roost in the Valley and the miniscule community of Kashmiri Pandits became the victims of the failures of the then Congress government at the Centre,” Chrungoo said.Even after the forced mass exodus of the KP community, Congress in league with its the then associates played politics with the Kashmiri Pandits and made unsuccessful attempts to blame former governor Jagmohan for the mass exodus.“The party did never come to the rescue of the Pandits during its struggle in exile. It was RSS, BJP, Shiv Sena and VHP which helped the cause of the Pandits,” he added.“After paying visit and obeisance at Mata Vaishno Devi shrine, it is time for the Congress leadership to do some soul-searching and recognise its blunders on the J&K situation as to where it went wrong in the past. Mere rhetoric are not going to bring any solace to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and especially the displaced KPs,” he said.Pandits’ body welcomes Rahul’s statementThe Reconciliation, Return and Rehabilitation of Migrant Kashmiri Pandits (RRRM) Saturday welcomed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s statement in which he said that he will do something for Kashmiri Pandits. “We, the KP community, appreciate Rahul’s concerns about his own community brethren. Rahul is a Kashmiri Pandit, grandson of Indira Gandhi, whom the community admired and wholeheartedly always voted for in Kashmir. Reinforcing his KP identity has given a new energy to the beleaguered community. Rahul is community’s leader,” said RRRM chairman Satish Mahaldar in a statement issued here.“He has promised the KP community, which is his own, to help them. We hope that he takes up his own community’s cause and helps in getting justice which has been eluding KPs for the past three decades,” said Mahaldar.“We hope and pray that the bond that existed between the KP community, the Congress and the Nehru-Gandhi family will continue. The early nineties was a very bad phase for the community, J&K and the country. We hope that Rahul Gandhi as a leader of the community takes the cause of the Kashmiris, KPs in particular, to help bring peace and harmony in the Valley,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rahul-gandhi-s-references-a-cold-comfort-for-kashmiri-pandits-bjp-101631381168776.html

11-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 3,075 new Covid-19 cases, lowest in 214 days||Even as the state authorities are anticipating a potential rise in the number of Covid-19 cases amid the ongoing Ganesh Festival, Maharashtra on Saturday recorded 3,075 Covid-19 new cases, which is the lowest number after 214 days. The last lowest figure was on February 9, when 2,515 new cases were recorded. Though the cases have come down, the state government is wary about the possible increase in the cases in the state after the Ganesh festival.The low number of cases on Saturday can be attributed to the less number of tests conducted in the last 24 hours —1,33,479 — which is one of the lowest ones in recent months. The testing number is less due to the first day of the Ganesh Festival.The average testing per day in the past 11 days this month has been 169,020, while the average testing in August was 193,848 per day.Amid the crowding at the public places, including markets, Ganesh pandals and people visiting their relatives’ houses, the authorities feel that there could be a rise in the cases in the next two weeks.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said festivals tend to result in a surge of cases.“We have been observing that the cases tend to increase after the festivals. Citizens tend to flout basic rules like wearing masks or maintaining social distance,” said Dr Awate. He cited the recent example of the Onam festival in Kerala, where the cases shot up exponentially after the festival.Currently, Maharashtra ranks second in terms of active cases next to Kerala. There are 37,774 active cases in Maharashtra, of which, five districts Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Satara and Ahmednagar account for 75.85% as the number 37,774 cases.However, on the ground, there are still eight districts that have positivity rates more than the state average of 2.67% according to the weekly report released on Tuesday. Of this Pune (6.33%), Sangli (5.59%) and Ahmednagar (5.39%) has a positivity rate of more than 5%, which indicates that Covid-19 is still not under control.Awate said that the state government has served advisories to all the districts in the state and have especially asked these five districts to ensure all caution. “We have asked them to ramp up the testing facilities as well as ensure that the patients are isolated and started their medication,” said Awate.Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretary-general, Organised Medicine Academic Guild said the entire scenario is very confusing. “We feel that the variants are causing havoc and not allowing the numbers to come down. In addition, the vaccination drive is not consistent across all districts due to the Central-State tussle,” said Dr Gilada.“On one hand, the government is asking people to celebrate low key Ganeshotsav, and on the other hand, thousands of buses are arranged to transport people to the Konkan region. How can we control the virus in such a scenario,” said Gilada.The state has also speeded up the vaccination drive as 935,575 citizens were administered their vaccine doses on Saturday. The total number of doses administered to date from January, when the drive started, has now reached 67,664,505 of which 18,560,050 citizens have been fully vaccinated. Mumbai, on Saturday, recorded 361 new cases with four deaths.The state’s death toll has reached 138,096, while the caseload stands at 6,494,254. The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 49,796, of which Pune tops with 12,949 patients followed by Thane with 7823 active patients and Satara with 5584.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-3-075-new-covid-19-cases-lowest-in-212-days-101631379189910.html
11-09-2021||Chandigarh||HC fines Punjab man who sought protection after second marriage||A Muslim man belonging to Punjab’s Malerkotla district, who along with his purported second wife moved the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking protection, has been slapped with ₹1-lakh fine. The court imposed the fine after finding discrepancies in documents submitted by him, relating to his divorce with the first wife and marriage with the second one. The fine collected from the petitioner will be paid to his first wife.The man and his purported second wife had moved court for protection, apprehending threat to their life and liberty at the hands of the former’s first wife and latter’s relatives. While passing the order, the high court (HC) bench of justice Arvind Sangwan observed that it cannot ignore the fact that the man is not only claiming to have divorced his first wife but has also refused to maintain and take care of the upbringing of his two minor daughters, aged two and four.“On the face of it, the present petition is nothing but a ploy to seek a seal of this court regarding the lustful and adulterous life of petitioner No. 2 (the man) with petitioner No.1 (second wife) and the court cannot be a party to the same,” the bench observed. On the man’s argument that he has a right to perform a second marriage under the Muslim Personal Law, the bench called it “misconceived”, adding that “the court instead of taking an academic view is more concerned about the welfare of two minor girls, as it is clear that petitioner No.2 (the man) has intentionally failed to maintain his first wife and two minor daughters”. Earlier, one of the lawyers had told court that the divorce was one-sided as the document did not carry the first wife’s signatures. It also came to light that the second marriage, performed on August 20, was not according to the Muslim Personal Law. The lawyer had pointed out that while taking up this petition, a coordinate bench had asked the man that how much amount was he ready to give to his first wife for maintenance. Even after two hearings in the case, no such proposal ha come, it was noted.Given the facts of the case, the court dismissed the plea even without adjudicating on the issue of protection to life. However, a division bench, subsequently acting on an appeal against this order, directed the Malerkotla senior superintendent of police to take into consideration the representation for protection, and if any substance is found, take appropriate steps to ensure the couple’s life and liberty. However, the division bench did not interfere with the condition of cost imposed on the man.“This direction shall not be construed in any manner to restrain the official respondents (police) to proceed against the appellants in case there is some criminal case registered against them,” the division bench observed, steering clear of the controversy and validity of the marriage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-fines-punjab-man-who-sought-protection-after-second-marriage-101631379007607.html

More than 4,000 tonnes of municipal wastes have been accumulated on the sides of Gandhi Maidan, Boring Road, Bailey Road, Dak Bangalow, Frazer Road, Langar Toli, Ashok Rajpath, Mithapur, Station Road, besides other prominent localities due to the strike. The stench emanating from the carcasses of animals is adding to the miseries of the people.Around 40,000 employees of 258 urban local bodies (ULBs) in the state have been holding protests since September 7 under the banner of Bihar Local Bodies Employees Sanyukt Sangharsh Morcha, seeking 12-pointer demand, including regularisation of services of all contractual workers, equal pay for equal work and compassionate jobs.Chandra Prakash Singh, president of the association, said, “Talks with UDD remained inconclusive today. We will not call off the strike unless we get assurance for regularisation of daily wage workers. It is unfair to deprive Dalits and backward communities of government jobs in the name of outsourcing despite working with the civic body for over a decade.”However, later in the day, the principal secretary of UDD, Anand Kishor, said that he reviewed the demands of striking staff and appealed to them to call off their strike, considering the public interest. He said, “The department is compassionately considering the demands of the protestors and a suitable decision will be taken soon. A committee has been constituted to review demands of sanitation staff.” UDD has scheduled the second round of talks with representatives of striking staff on Sunday.Meanwhile, the PMC has roped in outsourced staff for keeping the city clean. Harshita, public relations officer of PMC, said, “Our efforts are on to maintain cleanliness in the city. Actions are being taken against those sanitation inspectors who refuse to cooperate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/capital-city-stinks-as-sanitation-workers-strike-continues-101631378649144.html

Ruling out the CM’s participation in the rally, JD(U) national president and Lok Sabha MP from Munger, Rajiv Ranjan alias Lallan Singh, said, “Nitish Kumar will not take part in Devi Lal’s anniversary function on September 25 due to floods, and to review measures taken to combat the probable third wave of Covid-19 pandemic.” Singh, who was talking to media persons at the party office, however, confirmed that the CM was invited. On Friday, the JD(U) president said that he was not aware of Kumar’s participation in the rally.The rally has been organized with a larger motive of exploring the possibility of a Third Front ahead of Lok Sabha elections in 2024. CM Kumar had met Chautala at his residence in Gurgaon on August. Chautala had said ahead of the meeting,“I will reach out to all Opposition parties. My aim is to unite all political forces opposed to this corrupt government at the Centre and stitch a robust third front. I will visit all states in the next one month.” Chautala has extended invites for the same to several prominent leaders including Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, former Prime Minister and JDS leader HD Deve Gowda, SAD supremo Prakash Singh Badal, National Conference’s Farooq Abdullah, TDP leader and former Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-to-skip-inld-rally-on-sept-25-101631378167892.html

I urge you to declare their birth or death anniversaries as state functions and also install their life-size statues,” Yadav said. Meanwhile, Tejashwi’s demand for life-size statues of LJP’s founder Ram Vilas Paswan and Raghuvansh indicates the growing proximity between him and LJP leader Chirag Paswan, who recently invited Tejashwi for an event to be organised on September 12 to mark Ram Vilas Paswan’s first death anniversary. Singh, who died on September 13, 2020, due to Covid-related complications, had released a series of letters expressing his reservations over dynastic politics in the RJD and eventually resigned from the party even though the RJD chief Lalu Prasad rejected it. Ram Vilas Paswan died in October last year after he underwent heart surgery.

11-09-2021||Patna||Failed medicos interrupt OPD at Bihar’s PMCH, demand re-evaluation||Some MBBS second-year students of the 2019 batch forced the closure of the outdoor patient departments (OPDs) at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) on Saturday as a mark of protest, demanding re-evaluation of answer sheets of the MBBS first professional examination, conducted by the Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU) in March. As many as 423 of the 1,140 MBBS students (37.10%) who appeared in the exams across nine medical colleges in Bihar have failed the first university examinations, in what was the worst performance by medicos since the inception of the AKU in 2010, university officials said. Students, who accessed copies of their answer sheets through the Right to Information Act, claimed that some of their correct answers remained unmarked during evaluation. The agitating students, who staged a protest near the principal’s office, forced closure of the OPD by 10.30 am, two hours after the services began on Saturday. They also met the principal and gave him a representation, addressed to the AKU vice-chancellor, demanding re-evaluation of answer sheets. The students said they would continue to agitate and allow only emergency services to function at the hospital if their demands were not met. PMCH principal Dr Vidyapati Choudhary sympathised with the students whose correct answers remained unmarked, while some had failed narrowly. “There were around 5-6 students who were not awarded marks for answers evaluated to be correct. I spoke to the registrar of the university and have forwarded their application for consideration. A few students have failed by just one or two marks. Still, our result has been better than most other medical colleges, as 19 out of the 172 students who appeared in the examination had failed,” said Dr Choudhary. The principal said the undergraduate students, for the first time, interrupted OPD services twice during the day, but he got the services restored within an hour or two. The medicos had earlier demanded that the failed students be promoted based on their internal marks, obtained in the first and second semester exams, conducted by the respective medical colleges. The National Medical Commission, which governs the medical curriculum, however, does not allow it, said university officials. The AKU stand so far has been that medicos who have flunked the exams should appear in the supplementary exams to be held from September 27. Medicos of Patna’s Nalanda Medical College Hospital had protested on the AKU campus on September 1, after the university declared the results on August 30. Protests were also reported earlier at the Vardhaman Institute of Medical Sciences in Pawapuri and the Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College Hospital, Gaya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/failed-medicos-interrupt-opd-at-bihar-s-pmch-demand-reevaluation-101631377807683.html

The pilot project of eHealthSystems Technologies LLP, initiated on September 1, will provide a set of essential diagnostic services free of cost to all the residents, using the mobile laboratory units and fully automatic laboratory units, said Dr Ambarish Darak, director of eHealthSystems. “We will conduct investigations on 76 parameters, including blood serum, urine and ECG tests, and talk to people to know about their medical case history. The digital health records will be stored on a cloud server system and can be accessed on eHealthSystem mobile application for the mobile users, on a personal health card to non-mobile users and through wrist-band for children,” he added. Subsequently, it can also be integrated with the hospital management information system to access data stored on the central server. The pilot project proposes to offer a central dashboard for the district and health authorities to facilitate better healthcare outcomes, said Dr Darak. Besides benefiting patients, who will not be required to carry their previous test reports, doctors’ summary or narrate their medical case history in case of emergency, it will help the government in early tracking and treatment of disease. At the same time, it will help create a database, which the government can use for analytics, identifying disease prevalence, tracking chronic diseases, etc., Dr Darak added. Additionally, in case of emergency, the resident can click the ‘help’ button and immediately send GPS location to five pre-added emergency contacts in the mobile app. They can alternatively, call the local police or ambulance during an emergency. Women can use the emergency ‘help’ button in case of an attack or emergency. The mobile app for the eHealthSystem products can be downloaded from the Google Play Store. “We have already got the permission to execute the project in all 30 districts of Odisha. We hope to complete our pilot project at Kalyanbigha this month itself and showcase our work to the health department so that we can replicate it in all 38 districts of Bihar,” said Dr Darak. Nalanda civil surgeon Dr Sunil Kumar said, “We have completed taking samples and digitising records of 1,000 out of the target group population of 10,000. We target those coming to our district hospital, sub-divisional hospital, referral hospitals and selected primary health centres. Patients are given a unique identification number and their health status with medical records will be uploaded on a server for easy accessibility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-launches-pilot-project-to-digitise-health-records-101631377687611.html

However, devotees who immerse their Ganesh idols one-and-a-half day into the festival faced a lot of inconvenience as neither the mobile immersion tanks nor the idol donation centres set up by the corporation were operational till noon on Saturday. It was only after complaints started pouring in that mayor Murlidhar Mohol instructed municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar to make the said facilities operational immediately. Kumar in turn instructed the ward offices and the facilities were activated post noon, with elected members posting directions to the mobile tanks and donation centres on their social media handles.The PMC started the mobile immersion facility to avoid crowding in the wake of Covid-19 and this is the second straight year that the PMC has not erected any tanks for Ganesh visarjan. There are four mobile immersion tanks in each of the 15 ward offices under the PMC while idol donation centres have been set up near schools and health centres.

The residents claim that the lack of action by the anti-encroachment squad has further emboldened hawkers and squatters, who are continuing with their business unabated and without fear. After massive action was ordered against them last year, they are back with a bang, the residents said.The hawker menace is especially visible in areas such as Sherbetwallah chowk, Poona College main gate, Azam campus entrance gate, Aurora towers, Fashion street, Babajan Dargah chowk, Justice K B Hidaytullah road, Solapur bazar road, East street, MG road and other prominent locations of the cantonment area.Farham Mazda, a resident of East street, said, “Over the past one year, no action has been taken against the illegal establishments that have cropped up all over the cantonment area. The hawkers are occupying public spaces and not paying taxes. The board must immediately take action and remove the hawkers from the entire cantonment area.”Meanwhile, organisations of hawkers-cum-vendors have demanded that a street vending committee be constituted to ensure their right to a livelihood. They said that the process will finally provide clarity on the rules guiding them, with the union government recently notifying amendments to the Street Vendors’ (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014. The PCB administration too has initiated the process of setting up a town vending committee (TVC) with regard to the directions of the central government.Once formed, TVCs will not only be responsible for enforcing policy but also for making decisions. According to the act, the government will constitute a TVC under each municipal corporation and cantonment board jurisdiction. The validity of a hawker’s certificate will be for a specified period from the date of issue after which he or she will have to submit a fresh application to the TVC for renewal while rentals from the vendors will be collected by the civic bodies. The new act will streamline the entire street vending system as there will be a concrete list of registered vendors. The TVCs will also be responsible for enforcement namely, keeping a check on illegal vendors. Most importantly, the rules are expected to remove any kind of bribery from the street vending system.The TVCs are in the process of being constituted and once formed, they will first conduct surveys to prepare a final list of street vendors. For registration, a vendor will have to provide a photo identification card along with other documents as per procedure.Notwithstanding, PCB CEO Amit Kumar said, “Strict action will be taken against unauthorised hawkers and the board has been conducting regular drives to keep the roads free of hawkers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/residents-furious-about-hawker-menace-in-pcb-area-101631376546902.html

The commissionerate of animal husbandry has sent the required vaccine doses to Pune which produces over 4.5 million litre of milk daily, and is one of the highest milk producers in the state. Vaccine doses have also been sent to Ahmednagar and Beed. According to experts, though FMD is not a zoonotic disease, it can majorly affect the cattle population and meat exports with Pune being one of the largest dairy producers in the state.Dr Shitalkumar Mukane, district deputy commissioner of the animal husbandry department, said, “This is the second round since the FMD vaccination programme started in the district. This is a completely central government-funded nationwide programme. Last year despite Covid-19, we vaccinated the entire cattle population (1,057,000) including cows, buffaloes and bulls. From Thursday, we have started vaccinating the entire bovine population and it will now be a regular vaccination programme which is free-of-cost for farmers with only Re1 as registration fee. Each dose costs about Rs35.”“It is crucial to get cattle vaccinated for FMD because if they are infected with FMD, there is a huge loss in milk production in those animals and the animal becomes unproductive. If a cow is infected, it becomes very difficult for the animal to conceive and it may soon become infertile. In case of bulls, their strength is affected besides the animal becoming infertile. It is not a zoonotic disease but the spread of FMD can majorly hamper even meat exports because no country will buy such infected animals,” Mukane said.Pune handles more than 25 lakh litre milk and produces 45 lakh litre milk every day which is among the highest production in the country. The central government has sent 1,439,692 doses to Ahmednagar which is the largest milk-producing district in the state; followed 1,030,404 doses to Pune; and 679,327 doses to Beed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bovine-vaccination-for-foot-and-mouth-disease-to-begin-from-thursday-in-pune-district-101631375826842.html

11-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC allows virtual registration of marriages||Delhi high court lent its support to virtual appearance for marriage registration citing that web portals and video conferencing have almost become the norm. Justice Rekha Palli said the Registering Authority is refusing to recognise this current reality while exercising its power and jurisdiction under the Registration Order.Justice Palli highlighted that if the judicial system did not switch to video conferencing it would come to a grinding halt in an apparent reference to the Covid-19 pandemic that led to the suspension of physical hearings in all courts across the country. “If not for the acceptance of video conferencing as the norm, this court and the judicial system in this country would have come to a grinding halt, and would not have been able to function at a time when there was the greatest need for the citizens of this country to have access to justice,” Justice Palli said, according to a report by news agency PTI.“ These aspects appear to have been simply overlooked by the Registering Authority, who's continuing to insist that the parties must remain present physically before him,” the court said.The court said that at a time when technology aids in uninterrupted communication along with dissemination of information and smooth functioning of society, it cannot be rigid in its interpretation of the statute which will prevent citizens from exercising their rights. It said that insistence of physical appearance at a time when the personal appearance of parties can be secured through video conferencing will make it cumbersome for them to come forward for registration of their marriages.“I cannot also overlook the fact that The Delhi (Compulsory Registration of Marriage) Order, 2014 is welfare legislation, promulgated at the instance of the Supreme Court to encourage registration of marriages,” Justice Rekha Palli further said.“The insistence of physical appearance even when their personal appearance can be easily secured through video conferencing will definitely make it more cumbersome for parties to come forward for registration of marriages. This will negate the very purpose of enactment of the Registration Order and cannot be permitted,” the Delhi high court said.The court said that welfare legislation should be interpreted in a way that the objective for which the statute was put into effect is fulfilled and there must be no unnecessary obstacle to the beneficiaries when it comes to receiving the benefits of the statute. “Keeping in view the fact that the issuance of the registration order is to promote the registration of marriages, I am of the considered view that Clause 4 must be interpreted in such a manner that encourages parties to easily get their marriages registered,” the court observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-allows-virtual-registration-of-marriages-101631374902138.html

The court had earlier raised serious concerns about recurring instances in which suspects managed to flee during police raids.Issuing the directions for mandatory two-hour physical training of all unfit and overweight personnel from September 13, Moga SSP Dhruman H Nimbale said the three-month camp will save cops from diseases and make them fit and healthy. To identify the overweight and unfit cops, medical checkup of all personnel will be conducted under the supervision of DSP (headquarters) Ravinder Singh. While SP (headquarters) Gurdeep Singh will supervise the fitness camp to be held from 6am to 8am daily, DSPs, station house officers and in-charges have been told to ensure participation of all overweight cops.The exercise and fitness classes will include races, jogging, push-ups, squats and yoga.

He said no one should aspire for posts and tickets like ‘other parties’.The Delhi chief minister said that citizens of the country should not recognise the party in the same way they recognise the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress. He said that people in the country feel that AAP is the only hope because of the way the Delhi government is run.The chief minister said after seeing the way the party is running the government in Delhi, people across the country have started feeling that "the AAP is the only hope". “If you come to me asking for posts, it means you are not deserving of it and you have to demand it. You should work in such a manner that I have to say that you should hold the post,” Kejriwal was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The AAP is concentrating on expanding across the nation and is focusing on poll-bound states Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat.Kejriwal also asked party members to make sure that factionalism should not enter the Aam Aadmi Party. He said any infighting and factionalism will lead to erosion of trust among people and the party’s supporters.“We see what transpires in other parties. Dozens of people fight for one seat, parties breakaway, factions are formed. We don't want that to happen with our party. If something like that happens, the faith and trust stored in our party will cease to exist forever,” Kejriwal said.Kejriwal also said that the AAP party answered its detractors who earlier claimed that the party will cease to exist in the future. He also said that critics wrote them off saying that after coming to power they will only remain in power for a single term. “When we came into power in Delhi, back then people would say they had one term and their party would finish after that.

Soliha Yousuf, 26, the first and only woman to captain and coach the Jammu and Kashmir women’s rugby team for over a decade, never had it easy. From losing her father at the age of 10 to trailblazing into a sport less known, Yousuf remained steadfast as she faced new challenges in life.“I was about 14 or 15 years old when J&K rugby officials came hunting for talent in schools in 2008. I had never seen a rugby ball before that. I was fascinated with it from the very start,” says the 26-year-old who has also dabbled with athletics, kho kho and cricket in her early years.Within the next three years, she reached her first international rugby camp. In 2010, she was selected to participate in the Asian Championship in Pune.“I was the only girl from Kashmir among 30 girls selected for the camp across the country,” she says. Immediately after the camp, she was selected for Level-1 coaching, which she cleared and started coaching the girls in Kashmir. “There were two of us from Kashmir. But I am the one who is still continuing. Till then, no one had been selected for international matches or Level- 1 coaching,” she says.When the going gets tough, the tough get goingShe says the period between 2008 and 2010 was the most challenging. “We used to play on a shared patch at Polo Ground where we had to fight with male footballers and cricketers for space. Many girls were shy to come while the parents of some would not allow them to play,” she says. Yousuf, however, adds things have started to change.One of the most challenging coaching tasks for her came in 2012 when she was asked to train the senior boys’ rugby team for a North Zone match. She had hardly turned 19 at the time and most boys in the team were twice her age. “Initially, they didn’t take me seriously but then I got strict and punished them by making them do rounds of the ground. Eventually they saw that I was not going to budge and they yielded,” she says, adding that the team went on to win the North Zone match.By 2015, J&K Women’s Rugby Team qualified for national games, in which only seven teams of the country can participate. In 2017, the team won gold in Snow Nationals at Gulmarg. “It became memorable for us because for the first time, matches were taking place in Kashmir at such a high-level and in front of our home crowd. Many misconceptions vanished and the local audience boosted us,” she says.The many other hats she donsEncouraged by her mother, Yousuf pursued M.Tech in computer sciences in 2018. Most of her income comes from academic research projects, giving coding lessons and her job as a gym instructor. “There is barely any money from sports though I have been playing and coaching for over a decade now,” she says. She wants the sports council to take the livelihood of coaches seriously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/emblems-of-empowerment-the-obstacles-could-never-stop-her-from-reaching-her-goals-101631371927275.html

But he had to step down before he could keep his word.Also Read | Uttarakhand Char Dham priests to launch state wide protest against shrine board"The chief minister assured us that our rights will remain intact. We will get representation in the high-powered committee looking into the Devasthanam Board issue and our concerns will be addressed," Gangotri Mandir Samiti president and Char Dham mahapanchayat convenor Suresh Semwal said after a delegation of priests met Dhami."On an assurance from him that a solution to the issue will be found by October 30, we have decided to suspend our stir till then," he said.Dhami said the government will take a decision that is in the interest of the state after the high-powered committee headed by Manohar Kant Dhyani submits its report.He said he hoped that the committee will listen to the priests and come up with a solution to the issue."Dhyani ji has worked among priests all his life. The only purpose of constituting the committee is to listen to the priests," the chief minister said.Dhami said the infrastructural development of Char Dham is the responsibility of the state government. Starting the Char Dham Yatra is also a priority.Char Dham mahapanchayat member Umesh Sati said the priests will decide their future course of action on the basis of the outcome of the government's efforts."We have high expectations from the young chief minister...

Taking care of him is my duty. On the last two occasions, I got the ticket allotted to him. This time again, his adjustment will be ensured according to his stature,” said Bajwa, who toured the constituency on Saturday. Sekhri was not available for comment.Besides visiting houses of his supporters, Bajwa also hosted a lunch for mediapersons while launching his political activities in Batala.Raising the issue of granting district status to Batala, Bajwa said: “I wrote a letter to the Punjab CM on August 11, and he is considering this demand sincerely. Captain Amarinder Singh is a very progressive CM, and he will surely correct the historic blunder committed by British rulers by not forming Batala as a district, which holds a lot of religious, historical, industrial and cultural importance.”Bajwa also held a small meeting at Ghasitpur village, which is near Batala but falls under the Fatehgarh Churian assembly constituency. It is the home turf of cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, who is backing Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu in the tussle with the CM, while Partap is supporting the latter. However, Partap Singh Bajwa made it clear that he has no plan of contesting the elections from Fatehgarh Churian, as Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa is his “elder brother” and had already announced his candidature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-partap-singh-bajwa-begins-poll-activities-in-batala-101631369647159.html

11-09-2021||Chandigarh||Rain damages imported dry fruit stored at Attari check post||Incessant rain for the past two days has damaged dry fruit stored at the godown of the integrated check post (ICP), Attari, which facilitates India’s cross-border trade with Afghanistan and Pakistan. While the ICP management claimed it to be a “minor damage”, traders have alleged losses worth ₹40 crore. Accusing the Land Port Authority of India (LPAI), which manages the ICP’s affairs, of paying “no attention” towards stored goods during rains, traders have demanded compensation from the central government and action against the officials concerned.Despite the Taliban’s takeover in Afghanistan, around three dozen trucks have been importing dry fruit, including dry dates, fig, walnuts, pistachio and raisin, throught the ICP daily. The demand in India is at peak nowadays due to the festival season ahead. Also read: Heavy rain floods Amritsar, throws life out of gear“Goods brought by around 50 trucks were stored at the ICP’s godown. These goods were damaged by rainwater leaking through the broken roof. We have suffered a loss of nearly ₹40 crore because of the negligence of ICP authorities,” said Anil Mehra, president, Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Association, adding that they have been facing the same problem every monsoon.According to traders, each truck contains dry fruit worth ₹70-80 lakh. They pay ₹4 per one tonne as storage charges on the first day, which increases to ₹10 on the second day, and to ₹50-150 thereon. “Despite paying a heavy fee to the LPAI, we have no assurance of safety of our imported goods. Sometimes, customs officials give clearance for loading the goods from the godown after one day, and sometimes the process takes three to five days,” said Mehra. Customs has increased vigil at borderSources said after the Taliban’s takeover in Afghanistan, the customs department has increased vigil at the border, and every truck importing goods from the war-hit country is being examined thoroughly. Another Amritsar-based trader, who didn’t wish to be named, said: “Our trade with Afghanistan has been running on mutual trust. As banks in Afghanistan have been closed due to the Taliban takeover, we are getting dry fruit from our counterparts in the crisis-hit country on credit basis. We are already worried that trade with Afghanistan could be stopped anytime. The ICP authorities should also consider gravity of the situation.”ICP manager Sukhdev Singh said: “We are installing solar panels on the godown roof. Due to the ongoing work, some water had leaked through the roof two days ago. However, the situation is under control and there was only a minor damage to the stored goods.”The ICP is only witnessing import from Afghanistan for the past two years. Pakistan had stopped all trade relations through the transit route with India after New Delhi’s action to abrogate Article 370. Pakistan is not even allowing India to export goods to Afghanistan through the route.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rain-damages-imported-dry-fruit-stored-at-attari-check-post-101631367070452.html

The bus was headed to Mathura in Uttar Pradesh and got stuck at the underpass of Palam flyover, according to officials.At 11.30am, the DFS received a call seeking assistance with the trapped bus. “Two fire tenders were rushed to the spot and all the passengers were rescued safely,” Garg was quoted as saying by PTI.Widespread rain lashed the national capital on Saturday, resulting in waterlogged situations in several parts of the city. The Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport was also flooded with people taking to Twitter to post pictures and videos of the nearly inundated tarmac. “Due to heavy downpour, passengers encountered waterlogging for a short while. The on-ground team was immediately mobilised and the operations are back to normal since 9am,” Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) tweeted earlier in the day.Waterlogging was also reported in RK Puram, Madhu Vihar, Hari Nagar, Vikas Marg, Munirka, and Badarpur, among other areas in the Capital. The Public Works Department (PWD) said that it has deployed its staff to pump out rainwater from the streets.According to the latest alerts issued by the Delhi Traffic Police between 2pm and 4pm, Rani Khera underpass, Dwarka-Sector 20 road number 226, and GTK Road are to be avoided as these areas are still waterlogged.Water logging at Rani khera underpass.

11-09-2021||Other||Tourists to pay green tax to cross Himachal’s Rohtang Tunnel||The Himachal Pradesh government started charging green tax from tourist vehicles entering Atal Tunnel at Rohtang Pass from September 10. Two-wheeler riders will be charged ₹50, while ₹200 will be taken from cars, ₹300 from SUVs and MUVs and ₹500 from buses and trucks. Not only Lahaul but vehicles going to Kishtwar and Pangi will also need to pay the tax. Vehicles entering Lahaul on a regular basis will be exempt from paying the tax but will need to carry a pass. The tax will be collected at the barrier set up at Sissu in Lahaul by the Special Area Development Authority. Preserving heritage, fragile ecology The amount collected will be spent on developing infrastructure for tourists along the national highway that connects Manali with Leh. Villages in the vicinity of the highway will also be developed. The influx of tourists after Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated the tunnel to the nation last October has thrown new challenges, prompting calls for tighter controls to preserve the cultural heritage and fragile ecology of one of Himachal Pradesh’s remotest regions. Limited infrastructure a challenge With limited infrastructure, it is becoming a challenge to check littering by tourists along the stretch between Manali and Keylong. “Littering is one of the major problems that emerged after the Rohtang tunnel was thrown open. We have lots of tourists coming in the valley. The garbage is lifted by the agencies outside the valley,” said Lahaul and Spiti deputy commissioner Neeraj Kumar. Since there are no dustbins on the route and the garbage on the roadside slides down the hills with rain, polluting the rivers. In the absence of toilets, travellers and truckers defecate in the open. Last year, as a first step, the Sissu panchayat near the north portal of the tunnel imposed a fine of ₹1,000 for littering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tourists-to-pay-green-tax-to-cross-himachal-s-rohtang-tunnel-101631363108811.html
11-09-2021||Mumbai||Local body polls in Maharashtra: BJP’s army of 3 million at work||Determined to retain its hold over municipal and district bodies and wrest those with the ruling coalition, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is readying a massive election machinery in the state. According to party leaders involved in the preparation process, BJP is preparing an army of 3 million workers under its Samarth Booth Abhiyan – the outreach programme for the ensuing local body elections. With more than two-third local bodies slated to face elections early next year, the party has set the ball rolling by preparing on three fronts. The party has also started informing the Central government and local bodies’ performance to the people. Its top leadership is concentrating on handpicking of right candidates, for the later stage, as the elections come closer. Twenty-three of the 27 municipal corporations in the state, 27 of the 36 district councils, over 300 out of 362 nagar panchayats and municipal councils and more than 290 panchayat samitis are scheduled to go to polls in the first half of next year. The elections are touted as mini-Assembly polls as they would show which party is in a better position and likely to set the tone for the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls to be held two years later. BJP currently holds the highest local bodies in the state. Of the 2,736 corporators in 27 municipal corporations, BJP has 1099; of 2,000 members in 36 district councils, the party has the highest, 526, sitting members. In 362 municipal councils and nagar panchayats, the party has 1944 sitting members out of total strength of 7,493 of these bodies. Samarth Booth Abhiyan According to party leaders, the person-to-person contact, developed way ahead of the elections, has been strength of the party. Strengthening it further, the party has launched the Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Samarth Booth Abhiyan for the local body polls. The outreach programme will see a head appointed for each of the 96,605 polling booths the state has. Below them, 31 panna pramukhs or head of electoral roll page – which has about 30 voters – will be shouldered with the responsibility of getting in touch with each of the voters multiple times till the day of voting. Five booths will have a Shakti Kendra Pramukh. The booth-level workers have been given orientation, training and introduced with the use of technology. BJP legislative Council member Ramdas Ambatkar, convenor of the Samarth Booth Abhiyan drive, said that the more than 3 million party workers are being roped in for the drive, which kicked off on July 6, and will be completed on September 17. “We have completed appointments of booth and page heads on 80,000 booths and the remaining ones will be completed in the next few days. Every booth has around 30 pages of voters and each page covers around 12 families. We already have roped in 2.4 million workers and the number is expected to cross 3 million in the next few days. We expect our page head to get in touch with the families from time-to-time to take the programmes of the party to them and establish contacts,” he said. The party workers heading the booths are shouldered with the responsibility of upgrading the performance. “We have categorised booths in A, B and C categories based on the votes polled by the party candidates last time. The booth workers are expected to upgrade the performance by continuously being in contacts with the voters. The workers help the families in solving issues related to civic problems and employment on a regular basis and get them attached to the party,” Ambatkar said. The drive has the backup of the war rooms which have been set up in each district and in turn all the war rooms connected with state-level war room. “The war rooms work on three levels – handling of social media, establishing communications till booth-level workers and creating contents which are distributed among voters. The war rooms take feedback and cross verifies if the information provided from the lower level is correct and working. At the same time, it also provides the content based on the programmes and schemes implemented for the people at various levels,” said a party functionary. The two programmes undertaken by party’s two top state leaders – leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and state unit chief Chandrakant Patil – in the past two days indicate how utmost importance is given to the outreach programme. On Wednesday, Fadnavis had visited 23 booth pramukhs at their homes from his constituency in Nagpur. Patil on Tuesday had addressed more than 100,000 party workers and leaders, including booth pramukhs and shakti kendra pramukhs, in a virtual meeting. Batting on Central schemes The party aims to bat on the schemes and programmes launched by the Narendra Modi government. The district-level war rooms are engaged in creating the content related to the schemes and benefits extended to public through various central schemes including Pradhan Mantri (PM) Awas Yoajana, PM-Kisan and Ujjwala Yojana, among others. As part of the outreach programme, the state unit is felicitating the beneficiaries of these schemes to set examples before other voters. “The Jan Ashirwad Yatra by our newly inducted Union ministers was another such attempt to reach out to the people to take our work to them, understand their issues and establish contacts. Similarly, we have been taking development works in the local bodies held by us to the people. It is presented to them in such a manner that people themselves compare our performance with that of the earlier parties such as the Congress,” said party core committee member and former minister Sudhir Mungantiwar. As part of the party strategy of taking the performance to the people, state leaders inaugurated developmental projects in Pune and Nagpur. In Mumbai, the party will attack Shiv Sena for the alleged corruption during its three-decade stint in the civic body and poor development of the city. “The party plank in BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) election will be development of Mumbai. We will try to convince the voters about how important it is to elect BJP to power in BMC for the development of the city and its infrastructure,” said a former city unit chief of the party. Picking right candidates The state unit of the party learnt lessons after the legislative Council elections last December, wherein it lost four out of six seats, including two in its citadels Pune and Nagpur. The conclusion drawn during the introspection by the leadership was faulty selection of candidates. The lessons were learnt immediately, and party put its strategy in the right perspective during the Pandharpur bypoll in May. “In the bypolls, we were swimming against the tide. It was Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) traditional seat, the sympathy wave was in their favour because the son of the sitting legislator was named the candidate after his father’s demise and the three ruling parties (Sena, NCP and Congress) were unitedly standing against us. All stalwart leaders from the three parties campaigned against us. But the right strategy helped us in adding a legislator in the lower house. It has given us a confidence that it is possible to fight against the three,” said another leader. The party has already started tapping the right candidates for the local body elections. The leadership has identified potential candidates from other parties with high possibility of winning over its own probable candidates. “The experiment of importing leaders from other parties worked well during the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in 2019. We do not have our base in many districts where we will have to depend on the strong local leaders from other parties. Ultimately, winability matters in the polls. There will be an influx of leaders from other parties in Mumbai and other cities,” the leader said. Party leaders also feel that induction of leaders like Kripa Shankar Singh and elevation of Narayan Rane as Union minister will help them in these elections. They claimed that more such leaders from other parties are being tapped for induction in BJP. Fighting without power A section of BJP state unit firmly believes that retaining the existing strength in local bodies is a herculean task before them. “The jump from fourth to top position in terms of members in the corporations, district councils and nagar panchayats could be possible because of the power we had in state until 2019. Power at state level helps in managing government machinery for the benefit of the ruling parties during the polls. Many local leaders from other parties were detained by digging out old cases against them during the Kalyan Dombivli civic polls in 2017. It naturally helped us in winning sizable seats in the civic body. We do not have that advantage this time,” said another leader. Secondly, its three vs one for BJP across the state as the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners are likely to fight the polls in alliance. BJP’s state general secretary Shrikant Bharatiya said they see it as an opportunity and 50% of the political space is available for them. “We could grab the half of the space in Pandharpur bypoll. The strength does not get multiply for the three ruling parties even if they fight unitedly as the psyche of the Indian voter recognises political parties as either the ruling party or the one sitting in opposition. In that sense, the three ruling parties will be treated as a ruling unit. The workers of Shiv Sena and NCP cannot work together at local level even if the parties decide to fight polls together. They have been traditional opponents for years, while our fight is against the three parties who have failed on all fronts as ruling parties. As such, we have an equal opportunity against them,” he said. He added that the Shiv Sena would face major loss in these elections for obvious reasons. “In Mumbai, Sena will face double anti-incumbency for three decades of power in BMC as well as because of the state government’s poor performance. Besides, voters believing in a certain ideology have not liked Sena’s decision of joining hands with NCP and Congress by ditching us,” he said. Political analyst Hemant Desai said BJP has been ahead of all other parties in term of their preparations. “Be in power or out of it, the party takes all elections very seriously and makes preparations at micro level. While ruling parties look to be quiet on that front, BJP has been holding constant meetings with workers and leaders. The party had won maximum local bodies when they were in power. It may be a tough task to retain those civic bodies, but they are giving 100% of their efforts to retain them.” Change in guard ahead of polls? Though a section of party’s central leadership believe that the change in the guard in state and Mumbai unit of the party was required, it is unlikely to be done ahead of the polls. Party insiders firmly believe that Mumbai polls cannot be contested under the leadership of its incumbent chief Mangal Prabha Lodha. They also feel the need for change of leadership at state level too. “Being a developer, Lodha cannot raise issues related to corruption in civic body and or take the opponent leaders head on. He may keep talking about larger national issues and pull on religious line, but it would not help us in BMC polls. But instead of changing the leadership, the party may decide to give decision-making power to other leaders such as Fadnavis, Patil, Ashish Shelar among others. Similarly, the change in state leadership may not be done anytime soon,” the leader said. Mungantiwar, however, said, “The core team takes a collective responsibility in any election the party faces.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/local-body-polls-in-maharashtra-bjp-s-army-of-3-million-at-work-101631361609484.html
11-09-2021||Pune||Startup mantra: BatteryPool aims to solve charging conundrum for EV fleets||PUNE Electric is the future of mobility,” say experts. Users of electric vehicles (EV) are presently concerned about the lack of charging infrastructure. One of the popular solutions being adopted by the industry is that of “battery swapping”. However, not all EV manufacturers have common battery specifications. The Pune-based BatteryPool startup, founded by Ashwin Shankar, is solving challenges around battery swapping that can lead to downtime of EVs via its flagship product, internet of things (IoT) based, intelligent battery-swapping station for fleets and commercial electric vehicles.In the beginningAfter his schooling at Loyola High School, Shankar earned a Bachelor of Science and Master’s degree in electrical engineering from Purdue University and from Stanford University, respectively. Shankar then moved back to India in 2015. For a year, he was working at a technology policy think-tank, the Centre for Technology, Innovation and Economic Research (CTIER), where he explored technology and innovation in the automotive industry. During the same period, there was an increase in the awareness about EVs following the Government of India’s announcement to go all-electric by 2030. Says Shankar, “We were looking at the technology policy in the Indian context. Being in Pune we were looking at the automotive industry in terms of innovation and technological progress. With all the learnings, experiences and skill-sets that I had gathered over the years, EVs seemed an interesting space. I was thinking about entrepreneurship and decided to build my own startup company. BatteryPool was founded in January 2018.” Lessons from the fleet BatteryPool was initially funded through the Entrepreneurs-in- Residence (EIR) programme under the National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovations (NIDHI) programme launched by Department of Science and Technology for nurturing ideas and innovations – knowledge-based and technology-driven – into successful startups.Says Shankar, “While I was working at the policy think-tank, I had a chance to interact with NCL Venture Centre. I was subscribed to an email list and I got to know about the fellowship through them. It seemed like an interesting arrangement as there are not too many programmes that let you do that.”After the DST fellowship, BatteryPool also got some other grants that allowed Shankar and his team to experiment. He says, “These grants helped us understand the EV space. We realised that in India the adoption of EVs is going to happen for commercial and fleet operations. We wanted to understand the challenges fleet operators faced. So, I put in my own money into a fleet of 20 EV two-wheelers. We gave those EVs to delivery professionals and small businesses in Pune.”“Running this fleet for a year, we identified the problems first hand. From vehicles running out of charge in the middle of deliveries to drivers not being able to locate charge points when they wanted to recharge their battery packs, there were existing bottlenecks. At the backend we were building hardware and software products that helped us address these operational challenges,” he recalls. Pivoting to tech-first Within months of starting up, Shankar realised that the fleet business was operationally heavy. It was financially intensive, managing people and vehicles. So, around June 2020, Shankar decided to pivot. Says Shankar, “During our fleet operations we learnt that delivery professionals can’t afford downtime. They always need to be on the move. One important realisation was that for fleet operators there is no standard battery pack. Every vehicle manufacturer has his own battery standard and so it doesn’t make sense to have a swapping solution where you are forcing a battery pack on an end user. We also noticed that fleet operators were have their own applications. Hence, going for an Application Programming Interface first (API) made a lot more sense than pushing an app on the end user. We had realised that we had a market for swap solutions. Fleets were also coming up in other parts of the country.”Charging solutionsSays Shankar, “We are developing charging solutions for fleets and commercial vehicle applications. Delivery professionals can’t afford to wait three to four hours in the day for a battery recharge. Our flagship product for this segment is our battery swapping station where drivers can exchange their battery packs in a matter of seconds. What is unique about the battery swapping station is that we are battery-agnostic. We don’t push any battery pack on to the customer. We work around their battery pack specifications.”“We typically work with large fleet customers or large battery operators. Ours is a software-first hardware product which means that these fleet operators or existing battery swapping operators can just attach an application onto the swapping station. They don’t have to download separate applications. They can use their existing API to get access to the station,” Shankar said.Battery agnostic… but not inter-operable“Being battery agnostic does not mean that people can take any battery to any station for recharge. It is more that hardware and software can be used across different types of batteries,” explains Shankar. He adds, “Traditional battery swapping operators in today’s market have a certain battery standard which they try to push to end customers. Fleet operators have to retrofit their vehicles and make sure that the vehicle is compatible with battery packs. Our business model and hardware is able to cater to different types of battery packs. Our hardware and software, the entire technology stack, is compatible with customer batteries. It is not interoperable, but it is agnostic in a sense that our hardware can work with any batteries.”“Also, fleet operators have their own applications for drivers. Our swapping station ties into their application. The delivery professional uses their existing last-mile delivery application to access the station,” he added. Software developmentSays Shankar, “In the initial days, we were building the hardware first, but we knew that there has to be a software as it can’t be just a hardware kind of mechanism. From the swap station diagnostics standpoint, we wanted to know the health of the station. Whether batteries being deposited are in good health or not? So we needed software to talk to the batteries. This software would then determine which door should open and close and which battery should be accepted. The hardware communicates with battery ensuring a non-compatible battery is not being deposited.”“It took us a year for us to come to a state to take our product to customers. The software development came quickly in two month. Iterations are happening till date and new versions of our software are coming up based on ground feedback and how the entire EV ecosystem is developing.”Market and deploymentsDelhi NCR is the biggest market for BatteryPool, claims Shankar. “Recently, we have signed large contracts/POs with one of India’s largest e-rickshaw fleets. We are also planning to introduce Smart Plug-In chargers for fleet/commercial EVs without swappable battery packs in the near future,” he stated. “Commercial EVs are picking up in the last mile delivery, shared mobility, e-rickshaw segment in Delhi region. In Pune we are seeing a demand in the two-wheeler segment for last-mile delivery applications. Bengaluru is also an important market for us which will soon witness some deployments,” Shankar said. “We have deployments in east Africa countries as well. In fact, our first customer is from Kenya. A large EV company there was looking for setting up swapping stations and we got their order.”Challenges in deploymentSays Shankar, “From the product side, it’s everything about how the user interacts with the swapping station. Indian consumers interact very differently compared to the West. There are problems of low network coverage, power cuts. Considering these challenges, we had to build lot of things at the swapping stations on the hardware and software side. We realised the magnitude of this problem when we deployed some stations.”“We need internet (IoT based-devices) to access intelligence to the swapping solution. We had cases of no good coverage even within cities, thereby impeding the network application. We tried to locally reduce the dependence on internet connectivity. So we did computing on EDGE which means a lot of intelligence happens on the hardware itself instead of relying on the internet.”If power goes off in middle of a swap, what happens? Shankar says, “As of now we don’t have any solution for this. As an alternative solution, we record the swap, but there is no backup for station. We are planning to give a small battery backup where it will at least open the doors and give access to batteries, if not charge them. There is manual way of opening the swap station doors. We also give training to the operators and a super-admin access to the operators. We have a Standard Operating Procedure about how to install the station and check whether the station is working properly after deployment.”Investor quote“The EV ecosystem in India is evolving rapidly. The use case of going electric is well-known as running costs for fleet operators’ contract. By 2030, the fleet and commercial vehicle charging market size is set to reach $2.7 billion, as these will become electrified. BatteryPool is walking on a path to capture a huge opportunity with India witnessing a rapid shift to electric mobility in the 2&3 wheeler segment, which is where EV adoption will see tremendous velocity. We will offer our proprietary software & hardware solutions and embrace a collaborative platform as we build on our partnerships with OEMs and fleet operators.” -Arjun Seth, Lead Investor at Indian Angel Network||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-batterypool-aims-to-solve-charging-conundrum-for-ev-fleets-101631361186954.html
11-09-2021||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh to get NaMo garden in each block to celebrate PM’s birthday||The Bharatiya Janata Party in Madhya Pradesh will develop 1,070 Narendra Modi (NaMo) parks on government land across the state to celebrate Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birth anniversary, a senior BJP functionary said.“At a state-level meeting of BJP leaders led by state president VD Sharma, the decision has been taken to develop NaMo Udyan in 1070 mandals to plant at least 71 saplings in one garden,” said Jitu Jirati, BJP’s vice-president for Madhya Pradesh.PM Modi turns 71 on September 17 and from that day the BJP, across India, would conduct several events till October 7, when the PM took over as Gujarat chief minister 20 years ago. In Madhya Pradesh, the BJP will plant 75,970 saplings on September 29, 30 and October 1 across 52 districts. The saplings would be provided by the MP forest department which will also guide the BJP workers in the plantation drive. “We have requested the administration of all the districts to provide barren land in every mandal which can be developed as a covered garden. We will spend money on boundary walls and tree guards. If we don’t get land, we will develop gardens, which are in dilapidated condition,” said Jirati.“Simply developing the garden is not our purpose. Seventy BJP workers would be dedicated to each garden to ensure the saplings grow into a full grown-up tree,” he added.Describing the prime minister as India’s pride, state horticulture minister Bharat Singh Kushwaha, said the state government will help the BJP workers in the task.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi is above any party and community. He is a pride of our nation and we are not handing any land to open some office. BJP workers want to develop barren land through plantations and it is good for the environment. We will not only help them but also participate in the plantation drive,” Kushwaha said.Opposition Congress accused the BJP of trying to encroach public land.“Can state government provide any land to any person for the development of a garden? If it is so easy, we will also demand land to develop gardens. This is nothing but the state government’s aim to give land to BJP workers who will encroach upon the land and later RSS will hold shakhas in the garden,” said JP Dhanopia, spokesperson, MP Congress Committee.Countering Congress’ argument, BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “Congress leaders should understand one thing that our purpose is to plant trees for the purification of the environment. It is impossible to develop such a huge garden having 71 trees on private land. We will develop barren land and garden, which are in poor condition. The trees will give oxygen so Congress leaders shouldn’t do politics on everything.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/madhya-pradesh-to-get-namo-garden-in-each-block-to-celebrate-pm-s-birthday-101631360947426.html

Insensitive @BJP4India 1st declared Goa as Open Defecation Free, Later announced Goa is connected with Tap Water in every Household. Lies continue…,” Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat tweeted on Saturday. “We Challenge @GovtofGoa and CM to prove this bogus claim of 100% Vaccination in Goa. There are many people in Goa who have not taken their first dose,” Amarnath Panjikar, another Congress leader, said. On Friday, the chief minister announced that with more than 11.80 lakh doses being administered - which, according to the voter’s list that the health authorities have been relying on, is around 30,000 more than the total registered voters in the state - the state has completed 100% vaccination of first dose. The declaration meant that Goa became the second state after Himachal Pradesh to have completed 100% vaccination of the first dose. “I congratulate our Doctors, Nurses and Healthcare Workers for administering the first dose of #COVID19 vaccines to 100% eligible population in Goa. I thank the people of Goa for their support in making this drive a huge success. We shall continue to march ahead with the same energy to ensure that we also complete the second dose,” Sawant said. Several BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have congratulated the state on completing the milestone. “Well done Goa! Great effort, powered by a collective spirit and the prowess of our doctors as well as innovators,” the Prime Minister tweeted.Goa had initially set a target of completing 100% vaccination of the first dose by July 31 but missed it. The chief Minister has now announced that the target to complete the second dose of vaccination will be achieved by October 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pack-of-lies-opposition-questions-goa-govt-s-claim-of-100-vaccination-coverage-101631360648110.html

The accused used to be her friend earlier, but they had a fight a few months ago following which she registered a case of harassment against him at Panvel city police station.Smita Jadhav, senior inspector of Kamothe police station said, “On Wednesday night when the survivor was returning from work in a taxi, the accused accosted her at Kamothe and then forcefully took her to his car. He then took her to a lodge and then forced himself on her. He also threatened her with dire consequences if she approached the police, and then fled the spot. Prima facie it appears that the accused was trying to take revenge since the harassment case was registered against him.”The survivor was too scared to approach the police. On Friday she mustered courage and registered an FIR against the accused at APMC police station. The case was later transferred to Kamothe police as she was kidnapped from their jurisdiction.“The accused has been booked under sections 376, 363 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). We are now looking for him and hope to arrest him soon,” Jadhav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/man-booked-for-kidnapping-raping-orchestra-bar-singer-in-navi-mumbai-101631359910114.html

11-09-2021||Delhi||Miranda House ranked #1: Eminent alumni elated, reminisce good ol’ days||It was a day of celebration for students and alumni of Delhi University’s Miranda House for retaining first rank for the fifth year in a row in the college wise NIRF rankings 2021. Eminent graduates from the college take a trip down the memory lane and remember their good ol’ days from alma mater. Here’s what they have to say: Urvashi Butalia, writer and publisherI am not surprised that Miranda House has ranked at top. Even at the time, in early ‘70’s, it was very open, had students from various backgrounds, range of subjects which many other women colleges didn’t have. I think Miranda was also the first women college to join DUSU, many other women colleges stayed away from it - they saw it as too political. From what I remember, it was culturally very rich in theatre and music. And my special connection was that my mother was an early Mirandian. When the college didn’t have courses but a hostel where working women could stay - they were there during the partition violence. After that, it turned into an actual college. Anuja Chauhan, authorI wasn’t in a position to choose the college due to my poor marks but I was good at extra curricular activities so I managed to get into Miranda House. It was a safe haven. Girls were not just mere spectators. I never thought of having a political opinion until I started studying here. There was a lot of awakening - be it political, fashion or feminism.”Chauhan also points out how girls used to swoon over guys back in those days. She shares, “The only way boys used to enter our college was when there were fests and girls used to go gaga!”Minissha Lamba, actorI barely made it to the cut off list if I remember correctly. There was an essay that needed to be submitted with an application form, that would have been it ... I don’t quite remember if that was the case though. I studied English, and it was a such a wonderful subject to be a part of that going to college was a pleasure. No more equations and mathematics and formulas... But thoughts, opinions, views, and that wasn’t a view that was wrong. Everything could be argued. And if argued well and with logic, that was the first breath of freshness or freedom that a young adult aspires towards.Shovana Narayan, Kathak exponentI have fond memories. In those days [1960s] there were limited colleges so I didn’t not have too much options to choose from. I only took admission at Miranda House because of the best faculty and reputation of the college. Our classes used to happen at Physics faculty of Delhi but my classmates were hostellers so I used to spend time with them at the college either in their rooms or cafeteria, during our free periods. I was not a part of any society but they used to call me to perform at functions!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/miranda-house-ranked-1-eminent-alumni-elated-reminisce-good-ol-days-101631350265738.html

11-09-2021||Mumbai||75-year-old cab driver sentenced to 3 years jail for touching minor inappropriately||A seventy-five-year-old taxi driver was convicted by a Special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) Court and sentenced to three years of imprisonment with a fine of ₹10,000 for touching a minor girl inappropriately, officials said.The accused inappropriately touched the eleven-year-old girl, who was the passenger in his taxi, while she was returning from school. The court, while pronouncing the order, said the driver’s act of inappropriate touching created fear in her mind and she jumped out of the moving taxi, hence it thinks no leniency should be shown towards such acts.On September 6, 2016, the minor had taken a taxi after her classes in South Mumbai. The eleven-year-old sat in the rear seat, however, the taxi driver asked her to sit in front. After the minor sat in the front seat, the accused touched her inappropriately.The minor got terrified and asked the driver to stop the vehicle, which he refused, after which she jumped from the cab. The girl had suffered injuries on her both knees and was later taken by her parents to a local doctor.They had also registered a case in the matter against the taxi driver under section 354 of the Indian Penal Code and section 8 of the POCSO Act for punishment for sexual assault.The counsel for the accused, Sachin Godase, told the court that the accused was identified via CCTV, however, it is not given on record to the court. “When the taxi was being driven at a speed of 30-40 km per hour, how could the minor girl jump just adjacent to the school? The owner of the taxi was not examined by the prosecution. He could have rented his taxi to the accused to drive as well as to many others,” Godase said. However, Special Judge, Jayshri R Pulate, observed that the victim had properly identified the accused and there was no reason for the CCTV footage to be given on record. Special Public Prosecutor Sanjana Sharma submitted that the speed of the taxi was moderate. The act of running away from the spot by the taxi driver was the subsequent conduct of the accused and thus it can be inferred that he committed the act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/75yearold-cab-driver-sentenced-to-3-years-jail-for-touching-minor-inappropriately-101631347446273.html

Our staff is present round the clock to monitor the situation," a PWD official said, according to news agency PTI.The Delhi Traffic Police also posted tweets informing people about the stretches where they are expected to witness waterlogging. "Traffic Alert. Traffic is heavy due to water logging at GGR/PDR. Kindly Avoid the Stretch," it said in a tweet around 11 am. "Traffic Alert. Water logging near WHO on Ring Road. Kindly Avoid the Stretch," it said in another tweet.The India Meteorological Department, which issued an orange alert for Delhi on Friday, said more rain is expected. “Thunderstorm with heavy to very heavy intensity rain would occur over and adjoining areas of few places of Delhi( Akshardham, Shahadra, Preet Vihar), NCR (Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad, Loni Dehat, Hindon AF, Indirapuram, Chapraula ),” it tweeted at 12:10pm.Rohtak, Gohana, jind, and Thunderstorm with light to moderate intensity rain would occur over and adjoining areas of isolated places of Delhi (Mundka, Jafarpur), NCR (Gurugram, Faridabad, Ballabhgarh ) Karnal, Assandh, Safidon, Panipat, Sonipat, Charkhi Dadri, Kosali, Rewari,The IMD said on Saturday that the highly unusual monsoon season this year has yielded 1,100mm of rainfall in Delhi so far, the highest in 46 years, and almost double the precipitation recorded last year.

11-09-2021||Patna||Residents of Kaimur district headquarters suffer due to indefinite strike of sanitation workers||Rotting filth and garbage are piling inside Kaimur district headquarters in Bihar’s Bhabua as the indefinite strike of Nagar Parishad (local urban body) sanitation workers continued for the fifth day on Saturday, officials said.People are suffering a lot due to foul smell and other hygiene problems as garbage was not picked from lanes and roads. They are fearing the spread of diseases with mosquitoes, flies and insects multiplying.The sanitation workers were on an indefinite dharna in front of the Nagar Parishad office for four days. They raised slogans against the state government and drew a protest march through the main thoroughfares of the town on Saturday. They called the people to support their 11-point charter of demands, including permanent jobs and payment of minimum wages.Rashtriya mahadalit sangh’s state president Vijay Kumar Rawat, who led the agitation, said, most of the sanitation workers from mahadalit community were working with the urban body since their forefathers. But they were kept on daily wages through middlemen and were not paid even the minimum wages as per the Minimum Wages Act.The poor people had been working in unhygienic and inhuman conditions but the middlemen removed them after the latter demanded minimum wages and better work conditions, Rawat said.“We are demanding ₹18,000 to ₹21,000 monthly salary provided under the act, making the service permanent of the workers who completed 10 years of service as well as hygienic and humane work conditions. The strike would be continued till the fulfilment of demands,” Rawat said.Nagar Parishad chairman Jainendra Kumar Arya said that 80-85 sanitation workers had been kept and paid ₹393 daily as per the directions of the state’s urban development department. The urban body was bound to follow the department’s directions and had no role in the process. The body was trying to maintain the sanitation services in the town with the help of 105 sanitation workers provided by an outsourcing agency for door-to-door garbage collection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/residents-of-kaimur-district-headquarters-suffer-due-to-indefinite-strike-of-sanitation-workers-101631342587017.html

11-09-2021||Patna||Ward member’s post becomes coveted for wannabe politicos in Bihar panchayat polls||Unlike the last several panchayat polls, it’s the post of ward member in the gram panchayats which is drawing huge nominations from aspiring candidates in Bihar in comparison to other coveted posts like Mukhiya and Sarpanch in the ongoing nomination process for the three-tier rural local bodies polls. The election will kickstart on September 24. As per the data of the State Election Commission (SEC), a total of 8,611 nominations have been filed by candidates for 2,233 ward members posts in gram panchayats of 12 blocks spread over 10 districts, going to polls in the first phase. In total, 15,238 nominations have been filed for 4,955 posts in three-tier local bodies in the first phase. The nomination for 151 posts of Mukhiya in the first phase has drawn only 1,294 nominations while for Sarpanch only 772 nominations have been filed. For 2,233 posts of gram kutchery pancha (equivalent to ward members at gram kutchery level), only 3,225 nominations have been filed. In the second phase of the ongoing nominations, the same trend is visible. Till September 9, the total number of nomination for the second phase of polling stands at 25868 of which 14779 nominations have been filed for the post of ward member. There are a total of 1,13307 posts of ward members out of 2,55,022 in the three-tier rural local bodies and gram kutcheries.The palpable change in preference for holding ward member posts at the gram panchayat level – the bottom tier of three-tier local bodies- by those taking a plunge in politics at the grass-root level is attributed to the new administrative and financial powers given by the state government in 2018 and introduction of new schemes like Jal Nal yojana and Gali, Nali Pakkikaran yojana to be implemented by ward members. “In last few years, we have delegated huge powers for implementation and monitoring of rural schemes at the village level to the ward members which was not there previously. The ward members are getting certain honorariums and allowances, which is another incentive. There are few more proposals in the pipeline to expand the powers and duties of ward members after panchayat polls,” said panchayati raj minister, Samrat Choudhary. People familiar with the matter said, in 2018, the government’s decision to constitute a ward implementation management committee (WIMC), in which every ward member is an ex-officio chairman, has broadened their powers from supervisory to administrative with certain financial powers attached with it. The ward members now can issue cheques and also take important calls in the implementation of key schemes under seven resolves as well as centrally sponsored schemes like MGNREGA, PMAY(G) and other schemes of irrigation, education. Before the constitution of WIMC, ward members had limited powers and had to work directly under the mukhiya who had the overall financial powers and administrative powers. “Every gram panchayat gets ₹5-6 crore for five years which means annually, they have at their disposal ₹1-1.25 crore for the implementation of welfare schemes at the rural level. This is big public money, which has to be spent and monitored at the level of ward members and mukhiyas. This is one reason, why ward member’s post has now become quite coveted,” said another senior officer, who was engaged with the implementation of rural schemes at the panchayati raj department till recently. Under the 15 finance commission, sixth pay commission and allocations under MGNREGA, PMAY(G), the funds are transferred to the gram panchayats directly. Incidentally, till the last panchayat polls, it was the post of Mukhiya (head of gram panchayat) that drew the highest number of nominations ostensibly for the reason that the post comes with a lot of financial and administrative powers under the Bihar panchayat act. “After the 2011 and 2016 panchayat polls, there was a large number of resignations of ward members for which by-elections had to be held. The apparent reason why people resigned from the post was the lack of any financial or administrative powers with the posts. But now, things seem to be changing,” said an SEC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/ward-member-s-post-becomes-coveted-for-wannabe-politicos-in-bihar-panchayat-polls-101631337426399.html
11-09-2021||Patna||AAP looking for panchayat polls to bolster presence in Bihar||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is eyeing the panchayat elections, starting September 24, to strengthen its organisation in Bihar and bolster its prospects for the next assembly elections, officials said. The frequent visits of the party in-charge of Bihar, Sanjiv Jha, also an MLA of Borari area of Delhi, and his attempts to get in touch with panchayat-level activists are clear indications that AAP will strive to give a viable alternative to the people during the next assembly elections, said a senior functionary of the party in Bihar.Jha, who originally hail from Madhubani district in Bihar, said that the party would intensify its drive to raise a network of committed workers after the crucial Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) elections in March-April next year. “Although the rural body elections are not held on the party symbols, we are supporting individual candidates in each panchayat to ensure the party’s role in the development of rural Bihar,” he said. “The party has focussed its attention towards Bihar, particularly due to growing rift in the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the likelihood of a mid-term poll,” said Jha, who concluded his last visit to the state on Wednesday.A senior functionary of the party said that the exercise to reconstitute the state unit would begin once Jha completed his interactions with party workers at the district levels. “So far, Jha has visited as many as 23 districts till his third visit since he was made the in-charge. He will visit nine other districts during his next visit slated for September 27-28,” said Rajesh Sinha, who joined the AAP after quitting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) last year.Another leader said that the party was also looking to induct disgruntled leaders of mass support from all parties and who fit into AAP’s ideology of serving the society. He said that grassroots-level workers of the party were disappointed when the party decided not to contest the assembly election at the last moment.“This time, we are working in a very professional and organised way so that the APP could fulfil the space of Congress and the JD(U), which have lost their credibility among the masses. We hope to give a new state committee by December. A state executive committee is likely to be held in Bihar, which would be attended by party’s seniors like Manish Sisodia, Raghav Chaddha, etc,” said Sinha, adding that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal would be invited after the conclusion assembly polls in four states - Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa - where the party has a lot on the stake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/aap-looking-for-panchayat-polls-to-bolster-presence-in-bihar-101631334125974.html
11-09-2021||Delhi||'Like 9/11': Delhi's IGI airport on alert after threat call to 'blow up' Air India flight||The Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport in New Delhi went on a state of alert late on Friday night after security officials received a bomb threat call for a London-bound Air India flight. The Delhi Police said that the caller threatened to blow up the Air India flight to London on the lines of the 9/11 attacks in the United States.According to the police, the bomb threat call was received by the Ranhola police station in outer Delhi on Thursday night, following which the security at the IGI airport was alerted.“We received a bomb threat call about a flight going to London,” the ANI news agency quoted Delhi Police officials familiar with the development as saying. “At 10.30 pm on Thursday, a phone call came on the landline number of the Ranhola police station in Outer Delhi. The caller said that on the lines of 9/11 attacks in the US, an Air India flight to London will be blown up.”The Delhi Police had also received a separate threat call on Friday, which warned that unnamed miscreants were intending to seize the Delhi airport. The cops have launched an investigation into the matter and are currently trying to trace the numbers, the news agency reported.Meanwhile, the Delhi Police requested passengers to start early if they are to catch a flight from the IGI airport in the national capital. Since there is a security alert around, officials will be checking vehicles and several parts of the airport compound for any potential threats, which may lead to an unwanted delay for passengers.“Travel alert due to SFJ's call to seize the airport, checking of vehicles will be done going to the airport,” tweeted DCP south-west Pratap Singh. “Those who have to board a flight from IGI are requested to start early to avoid any delays.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/like-9-11-delhi-s-igi-airport-on-alert-after-threat-call-to-blow-up-air-india-flight-101631328554042.html
11-09-2021||Delhi||Cops, jail staff, doctors lax in Tihar murder||Delhi Police, jail authorities, and prison doctors, all allegedly violated rules at every level in the case of gangster Ankit Gujjar’s alleged murder inside Tihar, and interventions from all three were either delayed or in violation of prescribed procedure, according to case papers seen by HT.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is probing Gujjar’s death after the Delhi high court on Wednesday transferred the case to the agency while calling the incident a “serious offence, which required in-depth investigation”. The case was earlier with Delhi Police.Gujjar, 29, one of western Uttar Pradesh’s most wanted men who had at least 13 cases in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh against him, was, according to a complaint by his family, beaten to death by prison officers inside Tihar’s jail 3 on August 3. The prison department have said Gujjar and two others were injured in a scuffle that broke out after jail officers confiscated a cell phone, data cable, and a knife inside Gujjar’s cell.HT has accessed copies of the FIR, the status report filed by the police and jail authorities, and the prison’s inquiry report, which show how authorities appeared to cover up Gujjar’s murder, and the Delhi Police failed to intervene in time.Here, according to official documents, are how each of the branches acted, and how they fell short of taking measures that could have saved the life of the prisoner, who was facing trial in at least five cases registered across police stations in the Capital.Delhi PoliceGujjar’s family made 16 distress calls to the Delhi Police control room informing them that Gujjar had been beaten inside the jail, according to a status reportprepared by the police and submitted to the high court. The first call was made at 10.55pm on August 3, within three to four hours of the initial scuffle inside the jail, when Gujjar was still alive.The family was first informed by another prisoner, who came out on bail on the evening of August 3, and called Gujjar’s house in Baghpat. The man claimed to have seen jail officers beating Gujjar. Despite the 16 calls, Delhi Police entered the jail only after learning about Gujjar’s death the following day.The FIR related to Gujjar’s murder shows that a police officer visited the jail office after the distress call, but did not go inside the cells where the alleged scuffle took place, or where Gujjar was lodged after the incident.Neither the FIR nor the police’s status report mentions a visit by any officer to Gujjar’s cell.When police did not directly check on Gujjar on the night of August 3, Gujjar’s family, who live in Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh, reached the Hari Nagar police station at 4am on August 4 and asked the police to intervene. The distance from Baghpat to Hari Nagar police station in Delhi is about 50km.The case papers also show that police officers met the prime suspect in the case, deputy superintendent of police Narendra Meena, at the Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) hospital at 11.11pm (August 3). Two hours later, at 1.10 am (August 4), Delhi Police filed an FIR against Gujjar, in which the prison officers alleged that Gujjar had beaten the jailors.The case against Gujjar, FIR number 434/2021 was registered under sections of 186,332,353 and 34 (related to assaulting public servant on duty), but police did not file any case against the jail officers. A case of murder against the jail officers was registered only on August 9, on the directions of a city court. This FIR, under Section 302 (murder), named deputy superintendent Meena.Gujjar’s lawyer Mehmood Pracha accused the Delhi Police of trying to cover up the jail officers’ crime.“The victim’s family made a distress call to save his life, but the police conveniently met the accused people instead of the victims. The police only met accused jail officer in hospital, but did not meet Gujjar. They also agreed to the jail officer’s version of events. Should they not meet the victim first and verify the facts?”Experts said that the Delhi Police should have entered the prison cell and checked on Gujjar. Vikram Singh, former director general of the Uttar Pradesh police, said if there is a distress call, police have every right to enter the prison.“It is a distress call -- somebody made a call for help. Normally when there is an inspection or a visit, police or other agencies inform and coordinate with the prison department. But if there is a distress call, and a complaint has been filed, police have every right to enter the jail. I remember an episode in 2008 at UP’s Sultanpur jail, when police entered the prison and helped stop a riot. Police are trained to deal with different situations.”Delhi Police did not comment on questions about the force’s handling of the case, and DCP (west district) Urvija Goel did not respond to messages and phone calls.A senior Delhi Police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it will not be appropriate to comment at this stage because the case is being investigated by the CBI.Tihar jail authoritiesDelhi Police, in their statement in the case FIR, filed on August 9, have noted that one of their officers, assistant sub inspector Ram Avtar, visited jail number 3 of Tihar after receiving a 10.55pm distress call from Gujjar’s family. Police accused the jail officers of not allowing them to enter the jail. The FIR mentions that when ASI Avtar visited jail 3, deputy superintendent Vinay Thakur informed him about a scuffle between prisoners and the jail staff.Thakur, according to the FIR, told the police officer to “come later in the day” because “treatment had been provided to Ankit Gujjar”. The FIR also mentions that the jail officers told police Gujjar suffered “minor injuries” after a “minor scuffle”.A statement to the police by a witness, prisoner Vikas alias Veeru, seen by HT, says that during the scuffle, deputy superintendent Meena requested the jail superintendent to blow the siren and sound an emergency. Vikas has alleged that the superintendent did not give permission to blow the siren.To be sure, the siren inside the jail is sounded when an incident requires intervention of the topmost officials, who have to visit the prison cells immediately and take necessary action.Vikas’s statement is important because he was not just an inmate but was also a “sewadar” who helped jail officers at the control room. Sewadars are prisoners chosen to help jail officers manage the prison. Vikas, who claimed to be part of the search team that inspected Gujjar’s cell, alleged in his statement related to the FIR registered against jail officers, that the prison authorities ordered the CCTVs be turned off during the scuffle, after which around “50 jailers with dandas” assaulted Gujjar.HT on September 4 reported how the CCTV cameras, which could have recorded the scuffle and the events thereafter, were switched off because of “maintenance work”. The Delhi high court on Wednesday also asked the state government and prison director general asking them for “immediate remedial” action to ensure that “unscruplous officers do not take advantage of the knowledge of non working of CCTVs” and get away by doing “any illegal act/ offences”.Also, while Delhi Police was unable to enter the jail, Gujjar’s family, who reached the Hari Nagar police station, sent an email to the superintendent informing them about the incident. There was no response.The high court on Wednesday also directed the prison department to set in place a mechanism, by which “immediate entry is provided to the police on receipt of information of a cognisable offence”.A senior Tihar jail officer said, “Four jail officers including the alleged accused were suspended immediately. Eight others including the jail’s superintendent were transferred to ensure a fair probe. The departmental inquiry has found some other prison officers of jail 3, who were negligent in their duty. Appropriate action will be taken against them too. The prison headquarters is cooperating with the investigating agency and will assist in all forms to aid the investigation.”Jail doctorsThe Delhi high court on Wednesday also noted that when Gujjar was injured, his life could have been saved if proper medical treatment was provided. The high court has also asked CBI to probe the role of jail doctors in this regard.Papers seen by HT show how the doctors failed to provide treatment to Gujjar.After the scuffle inside jail 3, Gujjar was shifted from his cell in ward 5 to ward 1A. The post-mortem report conducted by a medical board at All India Institute of Medical Sciences shows he suffered 12 grievous injuries on his neck, eyes, chest, abdomen, hands, back, knees, and collar bone among other parts of his body.But the jail doctors, who visited Gujjar at 1.10 am (August 4), gave him a painkiller, according to the prison’s inquiry report. Meanwhile, the prime suspect Meena, on the advice of the doctors, checked himself into the DDU hospital. The prison doctors in their statement to police have claimed that “Gujjar refused treatment”.On the morning of August 4, during the roll call of inmates, Gujjar was found dead inside cell 1A of Tihar jail 3.The high court has also asked the CBI to probe the role of the jail doctors.Gujjar’s counsel Mehmood Pracha said every branch of the government worked together to ensure no case was filed because Gujjar’s death “exposed an extortion racket inside the prison”.He said, “We have also submitted proof in the form of bank statements about money Gujjar’s family paid the jail officers. We urged for a CBI investigation because this is not just a murder but a case that exposes the extortion inside Tihar by senior officers. There is no reason why doctors would just administer painkillers. It is convenient for them to say Gujjar refused treatment. The Delhi Police did not register a case and was forced to do so only on the court’s orders. Instead, they met the jail officers and file case against the deceased.”Prisons expert, advocate Ajay Verma, convener of the National Forum for Prison Reforms, a group of lawyers that works to implement reforms across prisons in the country, said, “The high court found merit in the allegations of the family and has ordered a CBI inquiry. So what if the man is an alleged gangster? He also has rights guaranteed by the Constitution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cops-jail-staff-doctors-lax-in-tihar-murder-101631301354674.html
11-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Once upon a chai stall||His world has reduced. Stacked against a showroom’s glass wall, Jaiveer Singh’s pavement kiosk in Gurugram’s Roshanpura has lost its joy. This afternoon, the stall seems barely alive. A man is asleep beside it. While Mr Singh is unhurriedly preparing a fresh round of chai in a chipped pan.“Dhanda manda hain (business is slow),” he says gloomily, shaking his head. It is impossible to relate this Mr Singh to the Mr Singh of the pre-pandemic era. He used to be so cheery then, always chatting and laughing. Forever busy carrying trays of chai to the surrounding shops, he would be a happy bubble that continually bobbed along the crowded lanes. His stall’s decline set in with the coronavirus, he says. “Earlier I would end up using 15 liters of milk daily, today it is barely 5 litres.”The stall’s most remarkable aspect was Mr Singh’s handwritten bahikhata, his account book. Pages after pages scrawled in blue link, the precious bahikhata listed the names of his daily customers, which included shopkeepers, labourers, rickshaw pullers, vegetable sellers and “courier wale”—each name marked with the number of times that person had chai at any given day. The account book was an archive into the daily life of a place. It consisted of thick sheaves of pages sewed along one side, exactly the way poet Emily Dickinson would famously sew her handwritten poems into little booklets.And today the bahikhata is nowhere to be seen. “I no longer need it, I get too few orders.” Mr Singh is not clear about what he did with the bahikhata, and isn’t bothered about it. “So many people disappeared from the bazaar,” he says, explaining that a great number of labourers and shop assistants returned to their villages during the worst days of the pandemic and haven’t yet returned. “Those were my customers.”Today it is difficult to comprehend that Mr Singh’s stall was the epicentre of the area’s social ecosystem. Here, traders gossiped about the bazaar. Here, disputes were allowed to run their full course. Every third passerby stopped to exchange a word with Mr Singh. He was like a hyperlocal Homeric bard who would be asked—many times over—to recount the exact details of every street squabble that would unfold.Those times are gone, Mr Singh mutters resignedly. Even so, one thing has remained the same that connects this day to the pre-pandemic days. Mr Singh’s adrak-flavoured chai is as delicious.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-once-upon-a-chai-stall-101631320954217.html
11-09-2021||Chandigarh||HC issues notices to Centre, state over landslides along NHs in Himachal||The Himachal Pradesh High Court has issued notices to the central and state governments and the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) in a matter seeking directions to the authorities concerned to take necessary action for preventing frequent landslides along the national highways in the state. A division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Ravi Malimath and Justice Jyotsna Rewal Dua passed these orders on a petition filed by Namita Manikatala, which was taken up by the court as a public interest litigation (PIL). The petitioner has alleged that many areas of Himachal having fragile geologies are prone to the landslides and almost every year, the state witnesses massive landslides, which cause loss of lives and property. The residents of the state as well as the tourists visiting Himachal have a fundamental right to life and it is the duty of the sate to take all those precautionary measures, which can prevent the landslides and stop any further loss to life and property of the citizens, she asserted. The petitioner said the experts have recommended some remedial measures to prevent landslides in various reports such as ‘Landslide Hazard Risk Management Report, 2015’, report of study conducted by AK Mahajan, professor (environmental sciences), report of Geological Survey of India with respect to the road cave-in at Kali Dhank area on Paonta Sahib-Shillai road and the report of the Abhay Shukla Committee constituted by the high court to study the impact of establishment of hydroelectric projects of mountain ecosystems. ‘State, NHAI are not taking into account expert suggestions’But, the Himachal government and NHAI are not taking into account these expert suggestions while undertaking massive development projects in the state, especially highways involving large-scale excavation of hills.Manikatala prayed to direct the state to inform the court about the implementation of the measures suggested by the experts in the aforesaid reports and to engage the services of the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Dehradun, which is the “leading expert institution in the field”, to conduct study on all such landslide vulnerable zones and suggest the measures to be taken for preventing such landslides. She also prayed that the state may be directed to install landslides predicting devices as have been developed by IIT, Mandi and other such similar devices in all the landslide-prone areas. She also sought the court to direct the National Highway Authority of India and Himachal Pradesh public works department to implement all the measures so suggested by the experts for prevention of landslides along all national and state highways.The court posted the matter after four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-issues-notices-to-centre-state-over-landslides-along-nhs-in-himachal-101631313843546.html

With a score of 49.38, it is ranked 36th in the top-100 pharmacy institutes against the last year’s 39th rank.Himachal Pradesh University (HPU), Shimla, the oldest university in the state, failed to make the cut and is not even on the list of top-200. Last year, HPU was ranked 169th.The NIRF outlines a methodology to rank institutions across the country. The methodology draws from the overall recommendations of broad understanding arrived at by a core committee set up by MHRD to identify the parameters for ranking various universities and institutions.The parameters broadly cover “Teaching, Learning and Resources,” “Research and Professional Practices,” “Graduation Outcomes,” “Outreach and Inclusivity,” and “Perception”.The first NIRF ratings were released in 2016. Usually announced in April, the ranking this year was delayed by the pandemic.For participation in rankings, the institutes are asked to register and submit their required data. Physical check is done by NIRF to ensure its authenticity.If any institute submits false data, it is debarred from participating in the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-institutes-slip-in-nirf-grading-101631313603472.html

The other suspect, Harmeet Singh, is Harpreet’s friend, senior officers said.Officials in the crime branch, to whom the case has been transferred from the West district police, confirmed that the call was made, but said the motive of the alleged murder is still unclear.To be sure, no senior police officer authorised to speak to the media was on record to confirm that the two are the prime suspects, and it was not clear why the call was made.Officials privy to the investigation said that the two suspects turned their phone off after confessing to the crime, and it has been switched off since thenWazir’s body has been transferred to Lady Hardinge hospital and a medical panel has been set up to conduct a post-mortem examination.Police recovered Wazir’s body from the Moti Nagar flat on Thursday morning after they were informed by the J&K Police that he had not been responding to his family’s phone calls since September 1.His family members in Jammu flew to Delhi on Thursday after they were informed about his death.Police said that there is a possibility that the suspects lived alongside the body for a few days and to avoid the stench, locked the body inside the washroom.Police have learnt that Wazir was supposed to leave for Canada on September 3.“Initially, Harpreet had told the family members that Wazir was not taking calls because he was in a 72-hour quarantine at Frankfurt in Germany. On Friday he called the family saying he and Harmeet murdered Wazir, and then disconnected the call,” an investigating officer, who asked not to be named, said.Police said a post mortem report is yet to be submitted.

11-09-2021||Delhi||Decision on paying rent for poor in 2 weeks: Delhi Govt to HC||The Delhi government on Friday informed the Delhi high court that its July 22 verdict, asking the state to decide on implementing chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s promise that if a poor tenant was unable to pay rent during the Covid-19 pandemic, the state would pay it, is under consideration.Delhi government’s counsel Gautam Narayan told justice Rekha Palli, who was hearing a plea alleging wilful disobedience of the court’s order directing a decision be taken in the matter in six weeks, that the decision will be taken within two weeks.On July 22, the court had ruled that a chief minister’s promise to citizens was enforceable and directed the AAP government to decide within six weeks on Kejriwal’s announcement that the state would pay rent on behalf of a poor tenant who is unable to do so on account of Covid-19.The petitioners, who said they were daily wage workers sought to enforce the promise made by Kejriwal during a press conference on March 29 last year, stated in their application that the failure of the authorities in taking a decision in terms of the order impinged upon their right to shelter.“The 6 weeks expired on 02.09.2021. However, GNCTD has not yet complied with the above direction. Requests dated 29.08.2021 and 30.08.2021 made by Najma (P1), Karan Singh (P4) and Rehana Bibi (P5) have not been responded,” the petition filed through advocate Gaurav Jain said. “By wilfully disobeying the judgment/direction of this Court, respondents have also entered the territory of “Contempt of Court,” it is asserted.In the order, justice Prathiba M Singh opined that against the backdrop of a commitment made by the chief minister, a lack of decision making or indecision was contrary to law.“A statement given in a consciously held press conference, in the background of the lockdown announced due to the pandemic and the mass exodus of migrant labourers, cannot be simply overlooked. Proper governance requires the government to take a decision on the assurance given by the CM, and inaction on the same cannot be the answer,” the court said in its 89-page verdict.It said the assurance was not a “political promise”, as was sought to be canvassed as it was not made as a part of an election rally but was the statement made by the Delhi chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/decision-on-paying-rent-for-poor-in-2-weeks-delhi-govt-to-hc-101631304989958.html

11-09-2021||Chandigarh||J&K Police find links between 4 journalists & mastermind of blog||J&K Police said the four journalists who were questioned by them had links with the mastermind behind the blog on kashmirfight@wordpress.com that had been running a slender campaign against political workers, activists and journalists in Kashmir. A police spokesperson said in a statement that during the course of investigation of the case registered at the Kothibagh police station, credible evidence was found which linked Mir Hilal of Bemina (journalist, TRTworld), Mohammad Shah Abbas of Anantnag (freelance journalist), Azhar Qadri of Bemina (journalist) and Showkat Motta of Lal Bazaar (former editor-in-chief of The Narrator and currently working at a wholesale shop) with the mastermind who is behind the blog kashmirfight@wordpress.com. “On the basis of the evidence collected, searches were conducted at four different places after obtaining proper search warrants from the competent court of law. During the searches, some mobile phones, laptops and other gadgets were seized,” the statement said. The spokesperson further said for the purpose of investigation, they (journalists) were called for questioning and allowed to go in the evening and have been directed to present themselves tomorrow again. “The investigation is in progress and the scrutiny of electronic gadgets is also going on. So far various numbers of Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi have been found. They have been found to be in contact with various virtual numbers as well.” The spokesperson, while quoting Inspector General of Police (IGP) Vijay Kumar, denied it to be an issue of harassment of journalists. A due process of law is being followed while investigating a sensitive case and the media fraternity has been advised not to spread false news or narrative which may amount to unnecessary interference in investigation of the case, the spokesperson added. “The involved persons would be arrested in this case as and when the evidence is collected,” the spokesperson further said. The police had on Wednesday carried out raids at the houses of four journalists in different parts of the city, raising concerns over the press freedom in Kashmir.

11-09-2021||Chandigarh||Cops on toes as suspicious men visit house of Bargari sacrilege accused||Three suspicious persons on Friday visited the residence of Bargari sacrilege accused and Dera Sacha Sauda follower Shakti Singh at Daggo Romana village in Faridkot district, enquiring about his whereabouts and left soon after coming to know that he was not around. Faridkot senior superintendent of police (SSP) Swarndeep Singh said they have started investigation into the matter. “We are checking CCTV footage to identify the men who visited Shakti’s house,” he added. Shakti, who is out on bail in the Bargari sacrilege and the derogatory poster cases, is facing three FIRs in connection with the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib. In June, the Moga police had claimed that the banned Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) was planning to kill him. Upon checking the CCTV footage, it was found that three unidentified persons in a Mahindra TUV are seen coming towards Shakti’s house, another police official said. “One of them came out of the car at some distance, walked towards the house and rang the bell. The others also joined him in the meantime. Someone from the family opened the door and the first man enquired about Shakti’s whereabouts, saying Baljit Singh (another accused in the Bargari sacrilege case) had sent them. When family members told them that Shakti was not home, they left without disclosing their identity. When contacted, Baljit told them that he had not sent anyone,” the official added. The special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 sacrilege cases had arrested Shakti along with other accused on May 16. The alleged plan to eliminate Shakti came to the fore during the interrogation of two KTF operatives who allegedly killed a prominent dera follower in Bathinda last year. They were arrested by the Moga police on May 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cops-on-toes-as-suspicious-men-visit-house-of-bargari-sacrilege-accused-101631309043340.html

The assistant professor has alleged that Tajinder Singh Sidhu, director of Shaheed Bhagat Singh State University, Ferozepur, sexually harassed her by promising her to regularise her job as she is working on contractual basis. The state department has forwarded the Union ministry’s direction to the district programme officer (DPO), Gurdaspur, and asked to submit action taken report to the ministry. “Take an immediate action on the applicant’s complaint and submit a copy of the action taken directly to the ministry with intimation to this department,” the directions further read. The complainant alleged that she had lodged a number of complaints with the state authorities, but nobody took action against the director due to his political influence. She also claimed to have audio clips and recordings of the incidents to substantiate her allegations. Tajinder Singh Sidhu said, “She is making baseless allegations. These are tactics to get regularised. She had lodged a complaint with the police that found her allegations baseless.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-directs-punjab-government-to-take-action-on-assistant-professor-s-harassment-complaint-101631308982731.html
11-09-2021||Chandigarh||7-8 protests a day, CM Amarinder’s home turf turns into hub of agitators||With the Punjab assembly polls just five months away, the Patiala residents are having a harrowing time as chief minister Amarinder Singh’s hometown has turned into protest capital of the state. According to police records, an average 7-8 protests were held in the city daily in the last 5 months with as many as 1,153 agitations from April 1 to August 31. With massive protests being staged in the city, the residents are facing traffic jams, road blockades and traffic diversions due to police barricading on a daily basis. The situation has turned serious for the residents of colonies situated near the residence of CM Amarinder.At present, the protestors have blocked main Passi and Fountain Chowk roads, thus restricting the traffic coming from the interiors of the city. A group of protestors is also sitting at the bus stop opposite Gurdwara Dukhniwarn Sahib. Abhishek Garg, a resident of New Lal Bagh locality, said the roads are always blocked near the CM residence and the police barricading adds to their problems.“Most of the time, it takes 40-45 minutes to cover 2-km distance,” he said.Bhupinder Singh, a local resident, said it has become really difficult to move on the city roads which are blocked from all sides due to ongoing protests and construction works.“We have to take longer routes to reach our destination,” he said.Also, the construction of an overbridge near the new bus stand is causing inconvenience to those travelling on the Patiala-Rajpura road as the administration has diverted the main route through the main city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/78-protests-a-day-cm-amarinder-s-home-turf-turns-into-hub-of-agitators-101631308505499.html
11-09-2021||Chandigarh||Suspend campaign till Punjab polls announced: Samyukt Kisan Morcha to political parties||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of nearly 40 farmer unions protesting against the Centre’s three contentious laws, on Friday appealed to the political parties in Punjab to defer their poll campaign till the assembly election schedule is announced for the state. The farmer unions said the election rallies were adversely impacting their agitation. Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) president Balbir Singh Rajewal, who presided over a meeting of farmer unions in Chandigarh with leaders of political parties, said, “If a party insists on running campaign before the poll dates are declared, it will face the music as the move will be considered anti-farmer.” The parties included the Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), SAD (Sanyukt), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Lok Insaaf Party. The Congress, SAD and AAP lost no time in expressing their disagreement. The Akalis were the most direct in disagreeing with the diktat. Punjab Congress working president Kuljit Singh Nagra, who attended the meeting along with the state chief Navjot Sidhu, said they would approach the party high command and discuss the suggestions and then take a decision. AAP’s kisan wing head and MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan also asked the SKM to reconsider its decision. “There should be one yardstick for every party. If the Congress and SAD go ahead with their campaign rallies, it will not be fair,” he said. SAD leader Prem Singh Chadumajra said political activities were not restricted due to the farmers’ protest anywhere in the country. “Going to the people is as much your right as ours and this should not be curbed,” he said. Party’s Rajya Sabha MP Balwinder Singh Bhundar said the SKM should retain the national character of the agitation by not imposing restrictions on political activities. The meeting was crucial in the backdrop of protesting farmers disrupting political rallies and programmes in the state. Though leaders of all parties have been at the receiving end of protests by farmers, the Akalis have faced the brunt the most. Addressing a press conference after the meeting, Rajewal said the parties were free to hold small functions. “I think a gathering of up to 300 persons is fine for an event by a political party or the government. Even the chief minister will also face opposition if holds public rallies,” he said.The BKU leader also asked the Congress government to withdraw cases registered against the farmers and not to force them to submit ‘fards’ (land record) for grain procurement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/suspend-campaign-till-punjab-polls-announced-samyukt-kisan-morcha-to-political-parties-101631308146819.html
11-09-2021||Chandigarh||2015 firing: 2 months on, SIT yet to get date from Gujarat lab for lie-detector test on suspended IG Umranangal||The Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT) is still waiting for a date from the forensic science laboratory (FSL) at Gandhinagar in Gujarat for conducting a lie-detector test on suspended inspector general (IG) Paramraj Singh Umranangal even as it been two months since it got consent from the official for the test. In June, the SIT got sought permission to conduct lie-detector test on former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini, former Moga senior superintendent of police (SSP) Charanjit Singh Sharma besides Umranangal in connection with the 2015 Kotkapura firing case. While Saini and Sharma had refused to undergo the test, Umranangal had agreed for it, provided the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court are followed. The SIT had sought a date from the Gandhinagar laboratory after Umranangal requested not to get the test conducted at the FSL in New Delhi, claiming the facility was under the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. Umranangal recently submitted his fresh medical test reports that will be sent to FSL to ascertain if he is medically fit to undergo a lie-detector test, an official privy to the development said. Since a person has to stay at the lab for 10 days for a lie-detector test, it is likely to take longer to get an appointment from the Gandhinagar facility which currently is conducting only two tests a month, it is learnt. The delay in getting the date for the lie-detector test may further hold up filing of the chargesheet in the court. After Saini and Sharma refused to undergo lie-detector test, the SIT last week had sought their voice samples for layered voice analysis (LVA) used for helping detect stress and other emotions. But both failed to appear at the CFSL, New Delhi, to give voice samples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-firing-2-months-on-sit-yet-to-get-date-from-gujarat-lab-for-lie-detector-test-on-suspended-igumranangal-101631308142553.html

However, when the issue was not resolved for 20 days, irate Atam Nagar residents moved in with the municipal authorities at their Zone D office armed with their own toothbrushes, buckets and carpets to boot! On Thursday morning, the MC office had found itself unexpectedly hosting a resolute bunch of unannounced guests who insisted on taking a bath and brushing their teeth at the MC office. They refused to be escorted to their own homes, saying that they could hardly use the stinking water that was being sent to their taps. Having performed their morning rituals at the government office, the quirky protesters decided to camp at the MC office at night as well. They laid down their carpets at the entrance and settled in for the night. The protesters that were led by former youth Congress president Gurjeet Singh Shinh refused to budge on Friday morning as well, but were finally convinced to return to their respective homes when deputy mayor Sarvjit Kaur’s husband Jarnail Shimlapuri intervened. The MC officials also assured the protesters that potable water was being supplied to the area and that regular inspections will be conducted to ensure that sewer waste does not contaminate the water supply. Shinh said, “The issue has been recurring for two years. Each time authorities make temporary arrangements whenever a complaint is submitted, but the problem continues to persist. When our complaint was not resolved for 20 days, we had to raise a round-the-clock agitation on the MC premises to get authorities’ attention. After all, how can we sleep at our houses without potable water supply?”Superintending engineer Ravinder Garg said, “The problem has been resolved and teams are inspecting water supply and sewer lines in the area to check for any leakages, which may recontaminate the water.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/protesting-contaminated-water-supply-ludhiana-residents-make-themselves-at-home-at-mc-office-101631305983055.html

11-09-2021||Chandigarh||LIT reserve price row: Congress alleges ‘2016 land allotment scam’||In a counter attack on the Bhartiya Janata Party, Congress leaders on Friday alleged that the saffron party had bought 1,000 square yards for its office in Model Town Extension for merely ₹4,375 per square yard during the tenure of the SAD-BJP government in 2016.Seeking a probe, former councillor and officer on special duty to the mayor, Parminder Mehta, said BJP leader Subhash Verma had been the chairman of the Ludhiana Improvement Trust at the time when the land was allotted to the BJP at concessional rates. “The market value of the land is around ₹50,000 per square yard, but the land was allotted for merely ₹4375 per sq yard.”“The land recently auctioned by the LIT in Model Town extension has been sold for over ₹56,000 per square yard. The BJP’s allegations are baseless. When the BJP bought the land at a throwaway price, was the BJP not concerned about the loss to the public exchequer? Will the BJP seek cancellation of the allotted land now?” he asked. Meanwhile, the BJP refuted the allegations saying that the land was allotted as per the rules. District BJP president Pushpinder Singal said, “The land was allotted to us in 2007, but the payment was made in 2016. After the BJP highlighted the Congress’ multi-crore scam, their leaders are levelling baseless allegations to divert the public’s attention.” “If the allotment was not done as per norms, then why no action has been taken against it till now? The land was allotted at concessional rates as it was allotted for establishing the office of a political party, not a commercial establishment. Even the Congress was offered the land, but they refused to take it at the time,” said Singal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lit-reserve-price-row-congress-alleges-2016-land-allotment-scam-101631304603052.html

11-09-2021||Chandigarh||LIT reserve price row: Take action within 10 days or face stir, says SAD||Training their guns at Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, SAD leaders have claimed that the multi-crore Ludhiana Improvement Trust e-auction scam had been carried out at the behest of the Congress leader and have demanded that the culprits be brought to book within 10 days. SAD leaders, including district president Ranjit Dhillon, Harish Rai Dhanda and Kamal Chatly, said that a number of high-ranking people, including the personal assistant of the LIT chairman to the Cabinet minister himself were involved in the scam and that they had lodged a complaint with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and Enforcement Directorate (ED), and the chief secretary. On the Cabinet minister’s recommendation that the scam be cancelled, Dhanda said Ashu made the recommendation only after we demanded a probe. “A copy of the complaint has also been forwarded to the director general of police and commissioner of police,” he said. “It has been seen that the LIT has cancelled auctions even the bids were 30% higher as compared to the reserve price of the plots or shops-cum-offices on grounds that the trust could earn more revenue. However, in this case, the auction was allowed even though the bid was less than 1% higher than the reserve price,” said Dhanda. Pointing out that the prime land could fetch as much as ₹400 crore, Chatly said, “If no action is taken against leaders involved in the scam within 10 days, SAD will move court and also raise an agitation.” BJP seeks FIR against minister, chairmanThe BJP has contended that Ashu’s recommendation to cancel the auction indicates that a scam had taken place. BJP district resident Pushpinder Singal and state executive committee member Bikram Sidhu demanded an FIR against the minister, LIT chairman and all those involved in the scam. The leaders said that it was only after the BJP raised the issue and locked the main gate of LIT office in protest on Thursday, was the minister was forced to recommend cancellation. Sidhu said they have already submitted a complaint with the Union government, deputy commissioner and commissioner of police and an FIR should be lodged against the minister, chairman and others involved in the scam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/litreserve-price-row-take-action-within-10-days-or-face-stir-says-sad-101631304303292.html
11-09-2021||Delhi||No response from cops on plea seeking digital evidence: JNU students||Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, accused in the conspiracy case related to the Delhi riots, on Friday informed a Delhi court that the police are yet to respond to their plea seeking electronic evidence filed five months ago.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat was informed by the counsels for the Pinjra Tod members that they have been accused of delaying the trial, but they have been waiting for a reply from the police for five months.“We moved this application in April. Five months have passed. We haven’t received a reply yet.”Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad told the court that a large amount of data had to be analysed, and there was also the question of privacy involved in this matter.“What they are asking for is all the digital data that has been seized. What has happened is, during the course of investigation, the agency called various people and they were interrogated. Volume of data that has come out is huge. That data contains personal data of people whose equipment is seized. I will infringe upon their privacy.“It contains their financial data and their personal data…..For me to say that I will give to X and not Y, I need to have a basis for that. We need to do analysis before filing a reply. I need to come to a conclusion that these are the data, these are the equipment etc. That is the reason it is going to take time. There is no shortcut method,” the SPP submitted.The two students were released from jail on June 17, along with Asif Iqbal Tanha, another student activist. They were held for allegedly instigating the February 2020 Delhi riots -- charges they deny.Following arguments, the court asked the prosecution to file its reply.During the hearing, United Against Hate (UAH) member Khalid Saifi, another accused in the case, said that he would have to stop saying the greeting “As-salamu alaykum”, in case it is illegal.Saifi’s remarks came days after the police said JNU student Sharjeel Imam, who is also an accused in the case, began one of his alleged inflammatory speeches with “As-salamu alaykum”, which shows it was addressed to a particular community and not the public at large.“I always greet my friends with salaam. I think I will have to stop it in case it is illegal. Is it a law or presumption of the prosecution team?” Saifi asked the court.His query impelled ASJ Rawat to clarify that it was the prosecution’s argument and not the word of the court. The exchange took place through video conference.On September 1, Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad read out a January 16, 2020 speech given by Sharjeel Imam in Aligarh and said: “He (Sharjeel Imam) begins this speech by saying As-salamu alaykum, which shows that it is only subjected to one community”.Furthermore, Saifi said that whenever he gets a bail, he will file a case in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) against the police for wasting two million of precious papers on charge sheet in the conspiracy case.He, along with several others, has been booked under the anti-terror law in the case. They are accused of being the “masterminds” of the February 2020 violence, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured.Apart from him, former JNU student leader Umar Khalid, JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain and several others have also been booked under the stringent law in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-response-from-cops-on-plea-seeking-digital-evidence-jnu-students-101631301076821.html

11-09-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana Improvement Trust reserve price row: Auction cancelled, probe marked||Amid allegations that the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) had auctioned off prime commercial land in the Model Town Extension at “throwaway prices,” the local bodies department scrapped the questionable deal on Friday.The trust had auctioned off 3.79 acres (16,344 square yards) of prime land for around ₹98.38 crore, the Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) have said, alleging that the land is worth approximately ₹350 crore.Local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra said the auction had been cancelled because there had been a discrepancy in the statements issued by LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam and deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Sharma pertaining to the reserve price of the auctioned land. “The auction has not been cancelled due to allegations of a scam,” the minister clarified.The auction was nullified hours after Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu also recommended that the auction proceedings be cancelled. However, the development is being viewed as a setback for the Congress-ruled state government as the auction was cancelled after the Opposition demanded a probe from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and Enforcement Directorate (ED) among other departments, alleging that a multi-crore scam had been committed.The Opposition says that the land was auctioned to close aides of the Cabinet minister way below the market price. Meanwhile, the LIT chairman had come under fire after deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Sharma denied fixing the reserve price at ₹91.86 crore , while the chairman claimed that the rate had been fixed by a panel led by Sharma.Breaking his silence on the growing controversy on Friday, Ashu had said that the Opposition’s allegations were “baseless, frivolous and motivated.”“I request the Punjab government to cancel the e-auction of the said land and issue fresh dates, so that any person willing to offer a better price is able to participate,” he tweeted. However, he could not be reached for a comment after the auction was cancelled. The LIT chairman maintained that everything had been done fairly and transparently. “The opposition has no proof to substantiate these allegations. They are levelling these allegations to gain political mileage and malign our image.”Mohindra said, “The auction has been cancelled to clear the facts and not due to the allegations of a scam. The matter will be thoroughly probed. A report has been sought from the deputy commissioner.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-improvement-trust-reserve-price-row-auction-cancelled-probe-marked-101631303822693.html
11-09-2021||Chandigarh||32-kilometre greenfield alignment project in Mohali: NHAI agrees to enhance relief for landowners||After a strong protest by farmers over inadequate compensation for land being acquired to construct the 32-km greenfield alignment to decongest Airport Road in Mohali, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has agreed to increase the rates. NHAI’s ₹700 crore project had been brought to a halt after farmers pressed demand for enhanced compensation.Earlier, the authority was to pay between ₹24 lakh and ₹4.12 crore per acre, depending on the location. Now, those who were to get ₹24 lakh per acre will get between ₹1 crore and ₹1.12 crore. Mohali district revenue officer Gurjinder Singh Benipal said they had conducted a meeting with NHAI officials, who agreed to the enhanced rates. “We will be sending them the final awards, and hopefully, these will be cleared in a week’s time,” he said. NHAI had earlier released ₹450 crore to acquire 450 acres in 66 villages to construct the 32-km road, but affected landowners in Nagiari, Devi Nagar and other villages objected to the low acquisition rates. Gurdial Singh, district coordinator of the farmers’ body, Road Sangrash Committee, said earlier, they were given compensation under Section 26 of the Land Acquisition Act. “But now, they have agreed to give compensation under Section 28/7, which means, they will make cluster of 10 villages and high compensation in any village will be applicable to all villages,” he said.A greenfield road is built in an area that has never been developed. The planned road from IT Chowk near the Chandigarh International Airport to the Kurali-Chandigarh Road will provide an alternative route to traffic moving between the Delhi side and parts of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir. Ashoka Buildcon Limited has been finalised to carry out the project. NHAI had come up with this project after scrapping the project to widen the 40-km Kharar-Banur-Tepla road in July 2019, owing to its high cost. Even member of Parliament Manish Tewari had taken up the need for an alternative route with Union minister Nitin Gadkari in February 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/32kilometre-greenfield-alignment-project-in-mohali-nhai-agrees-to-enhance-relief-for-landowners-101631303708027.html

11-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Experts to assess impact of Smart City projects||To comprehensively assess the effectiveness of the multi-crore infrastructural projects being implemented by the Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL), a dedicated impact assessment cell (IAC) will soon be created within it. “Unless we conduct an impact assessment of the projects, we don’t get to know how they have influenced lives of residents,” said Anindita Mitra, chief executive officer of the CSCL.Stating that every project should be comprehensively looked at during different stages of its planning and implementation, Mitra said, “We will bring in people whose core competency is analysing projects’ impact. They will measure them on fixed parameters, which will differ from project to project. These experts will conduct the study on scientific lines.”The impact assessment will be conducted for both ongoing projects and those which are yet to be implemented. “It will be a continuous process. There are different stages in a project life cycle and their affect will be assessed in the immediate, medium and long term,” said Mitra.Projects worth more than ₹2,000-crore are planned under the Smart City Mission and CSCL has started implementing works worth ₹1,225-crore till now. Of the 37 projects under CSCL’s ambit, five have been completed while 20 are in the implementation stage. For most of these, the capital expenditure is to be made by the CSCL, while the maintenance costs will be borne by the municipal corporation.Some of the major projects that have taken off recently include the ₹700-crore upgradation of five sewage treatment plants (STPs), ₹34-crore augmentation of water storage capacity at Sector 39 water works, ₹33-crore legacy waste mining, public bicycle sharing project and construction of Integrated Command Control Centre in Sector 17. The ₹591 crore pan city 24x7 water supply project is likely to start at the beginning of the next year.CSCL working under scannerCSCL’s working has come under scanner, with project implementation getting off to a slow start. The city was even put in the list of 20 worst smart cities in the Union urban affairs ministry’s assessment. It failed to achieve the ₹6,724-crore investment target committed to the ministry in 2016.A major setback for the smart city mission was when the UT forest department refused to hand over land for one of CSCL’s largest projects – a ₹4,000-crore commercial hub in Sector 43 under the public-private partnership model. Failing to get the land from UT, the CSCL board scrapped the project in 2019. It also approached the central government multiple times requesting to revise its smart city plan from around ₹6,724 crore to ₹2,900 crore.Social projects on agendaThe CSCL will also move to diversify its activities from merely infrastructure projects to social projects. “Currently, we are working on infrastructural projects only. In addition to these, we also need to work on projects which have a wider impact on the quality of life of people,” said Mitra.One such social project may include creation of a digital library. “A digital library, particularly during the Covid pandemic, can benefit the residents, particularly students and children. It will have books on all major subjects. For its creation, we will undertake feasibility study and prepare a model for its implementation,” said Mitra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-experts-to-assess-impact-of-smart-city-projects-101631302926113.html

He was speaking during the inaugural session of 25 different blood donation camps which were being organised simultaneously across north India to mark the birthday of Chandigarh BJP state president and social worker Sanjay Tandon on Friday.Competent Foundation, of which Tandon is the president, with the help of various blood banks and organisations collected a total of 1,641 units of blood by organising camps at eight locations in Chandigarh, five each in Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh and one each in UP and Delhi.After the inaugural session, Tandon said he had donated blood for the first time on his 18th birthday on the request of his father late Balramji Das Tandon, after which continued with his spree.

11-09-2021||Chandigarh||Pvt hospitals in Chandigarh to consider installation of oxygen plants||Private hospitals in Chandigarh sought 15 days to think about installing oxygen plants during a meeting with UT health secretary Yashpal Garg on Friday. “The response from private hospitals was quite encouraging and they requested for clarification on whether PSA oxygen plants can be installed at the rooftop or within the campus and what permissions will be required from different departments. They also requested for 15 days to think over it,” said Garg. Only those private hospitals or clinical establishments with a capacity of more than 50 beds can install an oxygen plant . The move came after several states and UTs complained of oxygen shortage in government and private hospitals during the peak of the second Covid wave.“As per guidelines from the central government, a private hospital should install a PSA oxygen plant if they are catering to more than 50 Covid patients at one time. We have asked large hospitals to reserve at least one-third of their beds as oxygen beds, which can further be connected with ventilators. The UT administration will not provide financial help to them in setting up the plants, but we will help them in training their personnel to use the equipment,” the health secretary said. Garg added that the private hospitals didn’t talk about increasing the bed rates for the Covid-19 treatment.It was decided that another meeting will be held next month to take the initiative ahead and further encourage the hospitals to set up their own PSA oxygen plants so that there is no issue of shortage in case of any crisis, he added. However, the hospitals have been given six months to set up the oxygen plants.In addition to the director health and medical superintendent of Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, representatives from 13 private hospitals also attended the meeting. These included Chaitanya Hospital, Eden Critical Care Hospital, Happy Family Hospital, Healing Hospital and Institute of Paramedical Sciences, Kapoor’s Kidney and Urostone Centre, Landmark Hospital, Mukat Hospital + Heat Institute (A unit of City Clinic), Shri Dhanwantry Hospital (Run by Shri Dhanwantry Educational), Kids Clinic, Homeopathic Medical College 26, ARV Orthopaedics Hospital, Indira IVF Hospital Private Limited and Chandigarh City Hospital. A presentation about the PSA Oxygen technology was given by Dr Manjit Singh, medical officer, GMSH 16, about working of Oxygen Plants and tentative cost for different sizes of PSA plants. ‘Space, finances are concerns’“Most private hospitals in Chandigarh lack space to set up a plant on their hospital campus. A minimum of five-square meters of vacant space is necessary. We are willing to install the plant if administration helps us by easing some rules”, said HS Sehgal, administrator of Healing Hospital Chandigarh.“Besides space constraints, hospitals complained of high expenses in setting up the oxygen plants. The price range of installation varies between ₹20 to ₹80 lakh and hospitals were told to choose the plant, as per their capacity and choice of expenses. Since these plants are assets for the hospitals, most of them are willing to set up the facility, if the administration helps out,” said Dinesh Chopra, CEO of Chaitanya Hospital.Hospitals with less than 50 beds were asked to increase their capacity, so that they can also help out in case of a third Covid wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pvt-hospitals-in-chandigarh-to-consider-installation-of-oxygen-plants-101631302562219.html
11-09-2021||Chandigarh||First dose of Covid vaccine: After achieving 100% target, Panchkula to start house-to-house survey||With over 100% of the target population having received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine, the Panchkula health department has now started a door-to-door survey to ensure every left-out citizen is vaccinated.This week, Panchkula became the third district in Haryana to achieve 100% vaccination of its target population for the first dose. Gurugram and Ambala are the first two districts.The total target, as per national guidelines in every district, was supposed to be 60% of the total population. Panchkula’s target population is 3.8 lakh of which, 102% of the beneficiaries (3.9 lakh) have been administered the first dose and 65% have been fully vaccinated.This 100%, however, doesn’t mean that every city resident has received the first dose: many people from other states were also jabbed in Panchkula. “Currently, we are providing vaccination in every health centre and urban dispensaries. This week we have assigned ASHA workers the task of door-to-door survey, wherein they will visit every house in villages and ask people to get jabbed. Then they will wait in their areas for those who want to get the shot,” said Dr Sasan.Since the beginning of the vaccination process in Panchkula on January 16, Dr Meenu Sasan said it was not a smooth drive: Rumors, vaccination shortage, reaching out to difficult areas and vaccinating those with no identity cards were a few challenges.At present, 38 centres are inoculating an average of 4,000 persons every day. “We are organising a mega camp on September 13 and 14,” said Sasan, adding: “One of the issues that we are facing is that those who got the first shot during the drive are not turning up for the second one, most of them from other states.”Over 400 persons with no ID cards have been vaccinated including beggars and the homeless, citizens of Nepal and others. Also, 769 persons living in slums were vaccinated using mobile vans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/first-dose-of-covid-vaccine-after-achieving-100-target-panchkula-to-start-house-to-house-survey-101631302442073.html

The product is aimed at being used as a preventive remedy to tackle the coronavirus infection.Director of NIPER, professor Dulal Panda, said, “We will be applying for the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) licence and we are hopeful of getting it by October end. Then we will be launching it in the market in collaboration with a tea company.”Panda further said that the best part about the tea is there is no added sugar, which is helpful for diabetic people. The tea can be had three times a day, even by children and senior citizens without any problem. It is soothing on the throat and can help the body fight seasonal flu problems as well. He added that the tea is an in-house preparation using herbs collected/procured from within the NIPER medicinal plant garden on campus.Six locally available herbs, possessing potent immune-modulatory activity, have been used to make the tea. These include Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), Giloe (Tinospora cordifolia), Mulethi (Glycyrrhiza glabra), two species of Tulsi (Ocimum species) and Green Tea (Camellia sinensis).These herbs are mixed in carefully selected proportions keeping in mind their action as an immunity enhancer, sensory appeal, ease of preparation and acceptable palatability. The formula has been designed in such a way to achieve the maximum immune-boosting effect, said Jachak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/immunity-booster-tea-to-be-launched-by-niper-mohali-by-december-101631302142334.html
11-09-2021||Chandigarh||Panchkula residents under yoke of bad roads||Despite tall promises by politicians year after year, Panchkula still has roads with potholes, patch work, broken dividers, damaged roundabouts and uneven footpaths.While residents have become tired of writing to the municipal corporation officials as well as the mayor, it seems that authorities have also gotten used to the complaints.President of Citizen Welfare Association, SK Nayar, along with other members recently held a meeting with mayor Kulbhushan Goyal and apprised him about the problems being faced due to broken roads. “After months long delay, they have finally repaired the dividing road of Sector 17/18. Reason being, it is a VIP road and has many government offices on the stretch,” said Nayar.He added that in their Sector (15), there were 8-inch deep potholes: “The roads leading to Sectors 16, 15, 10 and 9 roundabouts are in a bad shape. One has to drive very carefully and God is your only saviour if you are driving on inner roads.”The condition of roads in Industrial Area, Phases 1 and 2, are equally battered and similar is the situation in Sector 20.KK Jindal, president of Sector-20 resident welfare association, said that he had written to the mayor twice, apprising him of the poor condition of roads. “They don’t make the roads properly, but only recarpet them. Because of that, the level of roads has increased by one foot, which results in rainwater entering the houses in Sector 20,” he said.Jindal said that dividers in front of Sector 8A and the one from where the road leads to the graveyard and another village were broken, which led to many accidents.The residents said that the quality of raw material used to recarpet roads was so poor that within three to four monsoons, the roads get damaged.MC commissioner Dharamvir agreed that the condition of roads was dilapidated and they had made an extensive plan for which the work would start soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-residents-under-yoke-of-bad-roads-101631302082290.html

However, later in August, he refused to form any political party or contest elections after a meeting in Karnal, but unlike other senior SKM leaders, he has not rejected the idea since then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/charunis-mission-2022-punjab-farmers-to-join-karnal-protests-101631301661344.html

When the informant (brother of the deceased) went to the police station, he was not allowed to meet his brother and the next morning (February 12, 2021), he was informed that his brother (Pujari) had died.Thereafter, a case was registered against the accused police officers under Sections 302 (murder) and other sections of Indian Penal Code at Baksa police station. On the other hand, police claimed that the youth was apprehended while he was driving a motorcycle which fell due to which he received injuries and the public beat him up.As per the police version, when he (the detained youth) was sent for first aid along with a sub inspector and two constables, the doctor at the community health centre referred him to district hospital, Jaunpur, and by the time they reached the district hospital, he had died.Due to the alleged custodial death, a judicial inquiry was set up in the matter under chief judicial magistrate (CJM), Jaunpur, and it recorded the statements of 16 witnesses. However, it did not reach any conclusion.After going through the record of the case, the court observed, “The entire effort of the police is to somehow give clean chit to the accused and for this purpose important evidence are being left and some pieces of evidence are being created and manipulated. But presently we do not want to comment any more since a fair investigation is yet to be carried out by an independent and impartial agency.” Consequently, transferring the probe to the CBI, the court posted the matter as fresh for further hearing on September 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jaunpur-custodial-death-hc-transfers-probe-to-cbi-101631301542041.html

Citing “exceptional circumstances”, the Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) bench of justice Arvind Sangwan observed that multiple cases registered against Saini could be a “political ploy” in the wake of upcoming state assembly elections.Not only this order gives relief to the former director general of police (DGP), it also stalls investigation into the 2015 sacrilege violence cases, said a senior lawyer associated with those cases. “Prosecution has all along termed him a major link in police firing cases. If his role is not to be probed, how will the Punjab Police fix role of others? ” the lawyer said.The HC has ordered that there will be a clear stay on Saini’s arrest in all cases, pending or likely to be registered, except the one that is pending before the Supreme Court. The court even stayed investigations against him, observing that attempts have been made to arrest him. The order also bars police from pursuing any other case and probe by any commission appointed by the state government till February 2022. The former DGP has also been exempted from personal appearance in an ongoing trial in any court. However, he has been asked to not leave the country.The HC order has come on Saini’s plea moved in 2018, wherein he sought a blanket bail and directions to the Punjab government that FIRs registered or likely to be registered against him be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation. Saini had claimed in the plea that the Congress government was acting out of vengeance against him as he had “become an eye sore” for chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and his associates after he investigated cases against them when he was the vigilance department head in the state. ‘... dare shown by Punjab Police officials...’In its 46-page judgment, the court took note of proceedings and various other developments in criminal cases against Saini, especially on August 19 when an HC bench had termed his arrest illegal and ordered his release.“I am also conspicuous of the dare shown by the Punjab Police officials in trying to overreach the court... which is also a circumstance to be considered about the nature and quality of investigation being conducted by the Punjab Police in the FIRs,” the bench further said. At a time when court was in the middle of hearing petitions related to the former DGP on August 19, a DSP-level officer had purportedly written to the chief justice and the judge concerned alleging “ undue hurry” being shown by the bench in dealing with Saini’s case.Saini’s counsel, senior advocate APS Deol, had also submitted that a fresh FIR has been registered on September 3, wherein a head constable is alleging that he was assaulted for leaking a video about Saini’s arrest on social media. He could be arrested in that case as well, as and when he goes to join probe in some other case, Deol submitted. Giving relief to the former DGP, the bench started its judgment by referring to a Panchatantra story, in which an entire village gangs up to shunt out a monkey, but the sarpanch intervenes and says he won’t allow it without a plausible reason. “This is how the legal system in India works, where the court follows the principal of audi alteram partem, ie nobody should be condemned unheard. The plight of the petitioner appears to be similar to the story as this court protected the right of the petitioner by passing various orders,” observed the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabhc-stays-all-probes-against-ex-dgp-saini-till-feb-2022-101631301062539.html
11-09-2021||Delhi||Covid giving rise anxiety, depression in people, communication is key: Doctors||The unexpected death of a loved one, loss of livelihood or difficulties in coping with the day-to-day stresses brought about by Covid-19 and related restrictions have led to an increase in anxiety and depression among people, said experts on World Suicide Prevention Day. But compassion for persons undergoing such problems can go a long way in alleviating their anxiety and keeping them from thoughts of self-harm, doctors said.Suicides are preventable, the doctors said. “Various factors such as loss of jobs and increased intake of alcohol and drugs during the lockdown period influenced the mental well-being of people. Add to that, people also lost out on their social nets such as friends and family because of Covid induced restrictions,” Dr Smita Deshpande, professor of psychiatry, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. “Those with good resilience will recover with time, but a significant number of people affected by such issues need psychiatric help. The problem is that such help is not easily accessible and the stigma attached to mental health makes people wary of reaching out,” she said. Doctors still do not know the exact impact of Covid-19 on death by suicides, with data being very difficult to collate. “We do not yet know whether the number of death by suicides has increased over the past two years; such cases are usually underreported. There are some reports that suggest that the number hasn’t increased, but that is also cause for concern— what it means is that the number of suicides did not dip despite people being restricted to homes and remaining in the constant company of family members, thereby reducing the opportunities to attempt a suicide,” said Dr Rajesh Sagar, professor in the department of psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences. He further said, “Stress, anxiety, and depression have increased in not only those who contracted Covid-19 but also everyone else around. Given the size of the pandemic, the magnitude of mental health problems is likely to be much higher.” Studies from National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (Nimhans) and Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research show that men with Covid-19 were at a higher risk of attempting suicide. “ During the Covid-19 lockdown, suicide risk among housewives and the unemployed went up,” said the study from Nimhans. A survey conducted by Dr Sameer Malhotra, director of department of mental health and behavioural sciences, Max Hospital-Saket, shows that there was an increase in suicidal thoughts and self-harm during the pandemic in both adults and children. “We conducted a survey of both children and adults and found that there was a definite increase in thoughts of self-harm and suicide among both groups. About 27% adults reported having such thoughts at least once and a little less than 3% said that they had frequent thoughts of self-harm and suicide,” said Dr Malhotra. “We also saw significant problems in sleep-wake pattern because of altered schedules.” Suicides are preventable, say experts. But in order to help a person, one needs to be aware of certain warning signs, they said. Doctors suggested looking out for behavioural changes, the person isolating himself/herself, not showing much interest in usual activities, constantly planning for death or talking about death, and/or losing hope or being too pessimistic as identifiers of someone at risk of suicide. “Showing them compassion, communicating with them, and urging them to seek help can prevent them from resorting to the extreme step,” said Dr Sameer Parikh, director, Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences, Fortis Healthcare.“People need to look out for changes in behaviour— a person becoming irritable, avoiding other people, feeling sad and hopeless, losing all desire, feeling worthless, and talking about death often. Those around such a person must show the person compassion, make him/her feel connected, help him/her with problem solving, and urge him/her to reach out to a doctor, not necessarily a psychiatrist. All these can help prevent a suicide. Mental health needs to be integrated in all levels of health-care,” he said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pandemic-giving-rise-anxiety-depression-in-people-communication-is-key-say-doctors-101631300822392.html

11-09-2021||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath leads tributes as UP celebrates birth anniversary of first CM Govind Ballabh Pant||The Uttar Pradesh (UP) government celebrated the birth anniversary of the state’s first chief minister (CM)Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant in all districts on Friday and chief minister Yogi Adityanath paid rich tributes to him on the occasion.He said the present government had resolved to make “the state of Pantji” the top economy in the country.”Pant headed the Congress government in Uttar Pradesh from January 26, 1950 to December 1954. When the state was known as United Province, Pant was the chief minister from July 1937 to November 1939 and then again from April 1946 to January 25, 1950.Yogi Adityanath first offered flowers at Pant’s portrait near the late leader’s statue at Lok Bhavan, which houses the Uttar Pradesh chief minister’s secretariat, and then viewed a photo exhibition on his life.The statewide celebrations of Pant’s birth anniversary were held under the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. Yogi said the mahotsav was a great initiative by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to enliven the memories of great freedom fighters.Born in Almora, Pant was a prominent freedom fighter who pursued higher education in Prayagraj, Adityanath said. During his student days in Prayagraj, Pant made the freedom movement the mission of his life, the chief minister added.“When the British government made India participate in World War 2, Pant resigned from the chief ministership. Later, in 1947, he again became the chief minister. During Pantji’s tenure as chief minister, the state’s per capita income was at par with India’s but after that the per capita income of the state fell. Till 2015-16, the state was not among the top five economies in the country,” he said.“Now, under the present government, the state has become the second-biggest economy in the country. The present government has resolved to make “the state of Pant ji” the top economy in the country,” Yogi said.Yogi Adityanath said that the present emblem of the state was given by Pant. The emblem has the Ganga, the Yamuna, and Prayagraj’s Sangam, besides the bow and arrow of Lord Ram. It was in Pant’s time that the state was named Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-leads-tributes-as-up-celebrates-birth-anniversary-of-first-cm-govind-ballabh-pant-101631300523632.html
11-09-2021||Bhopal||MP to enact law to seize assets of gangsters, give them to the poor: Minister||BHOPAL: The Madhya Pradesh government will soon introduce a law to curb organised crime with stringent provisions tougher than the law enacted by Uttar Pradesh, MP home minister Narottam Mishra said on Friday.The home and law departments are jointly finalising the draft of the bill to target organised crime, MP’s home minister told reporters in Bhopal. Mishra said the government was going to propose a provision to seize the assets of gangsters.“We are also coming up with a provision to distribute the seized property and money among poor people,” the minister added.Once this law is enacted, Mishra said, “the mining mafia, liquor mafia, land mafia and other anti-social elements will be eliminated from the state.” The home minister said the state will set up special courts for fast disposal of cases and will have a special provision of providing safety to eyewitnesses. “Those who will help these criminals, directly and indirectly, will also be punished under this bill.”The government could introduce the bill during the Winter session of the MP assembly.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan earlier announced the government’s intention to come up with strict laws to curb organised crime.Over the past year, the state government has razed more than 500 houses and illegal structures of criminals in MP.The Congress, however, was unrelenting in its criticism of the government, accusing it of patronising criminals.“Recently, a BJP leader was arrested for raping a minor. If the state government really want to control crime in MP, they should stop patronising criminals,” said Ajay Yadav, MP Congress spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-to-enact-law-to-seize-assets-of-gangsters-give-them-to-the-poor-minister-101631300281629.html
11-09-2021||Delhi||Wettest monsoon in a decade, Met records show||New Delhi: The city is likely on its way to break the record for the wettest monsoon ever, said forecasters as light to moderate showers throughout the day on Friday helped the Capital breach the 1,000mm rain mark for the first time in over a decade, data from the weather office showed.Data available with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) shows that so far this monsoon, Delhi has received 1,015.5mm rain after parts of the city received showers early Friday morning and in the evening.According to the data maintained by the Met department, Delhi last experienced a wetter monsoon in 2010, when the city received 1,030.5mm rain.“Thunderstorm with moderate to heavy rains, along with winds at a speed of 30-60kmph, is likely over parts of Delhi and NCR starting Friday night. This will continue on Saturday and Sunday,” said the IMD forecast.Met officials said with a forecast of moderate to heavy showers in Delhi-NCR during the weekend, the Capital will “easily surpass” the 2003 record for the wettest monsoon.“Delhi will break its rainfall record for 2010. We will have to see what the new record is going to be. We still have time before the monsoon withdraws,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD.Despite a late-onset, the monsoon this year has seen some erratic, record-breaking patterns. The monsoon officially arrived in the national capital on July 13, after a delay of 16 days instead of its usual onset on June 27. The resultant rainfall, arising from the late arrival of monsoon was, however, covered with only a few spells of heavy rain, with July receiving 507.1mm rain, compared to the normal precipitation of 210.6mm, and recording a surplus of 141%.In August, monsoon patterns changed again when the city experienced two spells of break monsoon. IMD officials said one such spell of break monsoon lasted for 10 days, making it one of the longest dry spells the city has ever seen in the monsoon season.In August, Delhi received 214.5mm rainfall against the average monthly precipitation of 247.7mm. The rainfall trends changed again in September. Unlike August, which by and large remained dry due to the break monsoon, Delhi recorded eight rainy days between September 1 and September 10 with the rainfall recording standing at 248.9mm against the normal of 62.6mm for those 10 days. The overall monthly average rainfall for September is 125.1mm. Last September, Delhi’s rainfall recording was only 20.9mm for the whole month.Weather forecasters said extreme monsoon recordings this season were an impact of global climate conditions as well as local factors that played a part this year.“This will be one of the wettest monsoons Delhi has ever seen. The city is just short of 30mm rain, which will be covered by a single spell of rain,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services, a private weather forecasting centre.Explaining what caused these extreme recordings this monsoon season, Palawat said, “Earlier, we used to see that the low-pressure areas that formed in July and August used to go till Gujarat, and because of this, Delhi did not receive much rain. We have observed in the last few weather systems that the low-pressure areas reached only till Uttar Pradesh. The closer a low-pressure area is, the higher the intensity of the rainfall in a region. Hence, Delhi didn’t get enough rainy days this year, the intensity of rain spells was high.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/wettest-monsoon-in-a-decade-met-records-show-101631299630751.html
11-09-2021||Delhi||28-year-old cable TV operator chased and gunned down in Shalimar Bagh||Five assailants on motorcycles, including two who were out on parole, allegedly chased and shot dead a 28-year-old broadband cable network operator outside a private hospital in north-west Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh early Thursday. Two of the alleged attackers, identified as Mustaquim and Harsh alias Pikaso, were arrested within 12 hours of the murder while the other three are still at large, police said.The murder took place four hours after the operator, identified as Yashpal Sisodia, and his 12 associates allegedly picked up a fight with the five men in outer-north district’s Mukundpur village, allegedly over claiming dominance in the neighbourhood. Both groups belonged to Mukundpur village, which is about four kilometers from the murder spot, the police said. Additional deputy commissioner of police (north-west) Aalap Patel said both groups were attending a private function organised in their village on Wednesday night, when the first round of fight broke out. Sisodia and his associates outnumbered the other group led by Anchal Mishra and Mustaquim, who were out on parole.“Mishra and his associates fired a round in the air during the fight after which they were assaulted by Sisodia’s group. Sisodia allegedly abused and slapped Anchal and that left Anchal feeling humiliated and planning revenge,” said the additional DCP.Around 2am on Thursday, Sisodia and his three cousins were at a private hospital in Shalimar Bagh, where his uncle Saurabh Sisodia was admitted following a road accident in Bhalaswa Dairy area. Sisodia and his cousin Aakash were talking outside the hospital gate when Mishra, Mustaquim, Pikaso, Ajay Panwari and Vijay allegedly arrived on two motorcycles and got into an altercation with them over the earlier fight, police said.The five men started assaulting Sisodia as well as Aakash, who tried to save him. Sisodia tried to flee the spot, but the five men chased him down and shot him dead. At least four bullets were fired and three of them hit Sisodia in his leg, waist, and chest. He collapsed on the road after which the attackers fled on their motorcycles. Aakash raised the alarm and Sisodia was rushed to the hospital, where he was declared brought dead. A case of murder and firing was registered and the investigation taken up by the north-west district’s special staff team.“The team recorded Aakash’s statement and identified the suspects. Two of them were arrested around 2pm Thursday. Two pistols and a Pulsar bike that were used in the crime were recovered from them. Searches are being conducted to nab the other absconding suspects,” said the additional DCP.Police said that Mishra was arrested along with his father and sister in 2017 for allegedly murdering a bottled water supplier in Mukundpur village over a personal dispute. Mustaquim was previously involved in six cases, including those of robbery, firing and property grab, among others. He came out on parole around three months ago, said an investigator.“When Mishra came out on parole in August, his gang told him that Sisodia used to trouble them and often made “derogatory comments” about Mishra. When both groups on Wednesday night, Mishra confronted Sisodia over this and the groups got into a fight, which eventually ended up in Sisodia’s murder,” said the investigator, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gang-violence-28-year-old-cable-tv-operator-chased-and-gunned-down-in-shalimar-bagh-101631299501567.html

11-09-2021||Delhi||Seven members of ‘Pardi gang’ arrested on way to commit robbery in central Delhi||Seven members of the “Pardi gang”, belonging to an eponymous tribal group in Madhya Pradesh considered to be one of the oldest groups primarily involved in burglaries, were arrested on Thursday night from near Vijay Ghat in central Delhi where, police said, they had assembled to commit a night burglary.Police said they also recovered three country made pistols, nine cartridges, four knives and house breaking equipment from them, adding that they have solved a case of burglary in west Delhi’s Hari Nagar about a fortnight ago with the arrest.The gang, also known as the “kachha-baniyan gang” because of its members choice of attire while committing burglaries, was active in Delhi-NCR for years but the continuous police crackdown on the gang over the past forced them to shift base to other states. Senior police officers said the recent Covid-19 lockdowns brought the gang’s presence in the Capital further down, adding that they resurfaced once the restrictions were lifted.Senior police officers said that the gang, which is believed to have been actively involved in criminal activities since the British era, were among the most dreaded in the Capital due to their brutal violence. The last recorded incident of violence by this gang in Delhi was in July 2014, when five men murdered a woman and grievously injured her mother, before fleeing with their belongings in Narela.Over the years, human rights activists have decried the use of the name of the tribe to identify the gang, noting that it defames the entire community.Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Monika Bhardwaj said that the crime branch’s special investigation unit-1 (SIU-1) recently received information that members of the gang had begun their criminal activities in Delhi. Subsequently, the team gathered information and learnt that some members of the gang were planning to assemble at Delhi Chalo Park near Vijay Ghat and burgle a house nearby.“Our team members laid a trap and caught seven suspects at around 11.30pm on Thursday with illegal weapons and house breaking equipment. Those arrested were identified as C Nikhil Dass (24), Samrat (22), Shravan Raj (22), Ramdas (34), Shiv Pratap (23), Sindbaj (23), and Shaktiman (22), all from Guna district in Madhya Pradesh. They members were previously involved in cases related to burglaries, planning dacoity and attempt to murder in Madhya Pradesh,” said DCP Bhardwaj.Interrogation of the arrested men revealed that they had come to Delhi along with 20 more gang members, including women, around one and a half months ago. Police said some of them were staying on pavements outside Sarai Rohilla and Old Delhi railway stations, while the rest were camped below a flyover in Khajuri Khas in northeast Delhi. However, they had fled from the spots by the time police raided the areas.Explaining their modus operandi, the DCP said the gang posed as balloon and toy sellers during the day to identify potential targets which they subsequently burgled at night.“They enter the house by removing the grill of the window or breaking the doors. While committing the burglaries, they wear only a vest and underwear and apply oil or grease on their bodies to make them hard to catch. To make sure the target house is empty, they first target the house with a slingshot. The burglars also carry arms with them in case situation worsens. Children, teenagers and women are also involved in the gang. They usually target gold and cash kept in the house,” added DCP Bhardwaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/seven-members-of-pardi-gang-arrested-on-way-to-commit-robbery-in-central-delhi-101631299201515.html

11-09-2021||Delhi||Power minister Satyender Jain inaugurates solar power station in South Delhi||State power minister Satyendar Jain on Friday inaugurated a 100 kilowatts peak (kWp) micro-grid solar power station and 460 kilowatt hour (kWh) charging station at south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar. Solar panel systems are given a rating in kilowatts peak, which is the rate at which they generate energy at peak performance, such as on a sunny day in the afternoon. A solar panel with peak power of 100 kWp, working at full capacity for an hour, is capable of producing 100 kWh electricity.“Salient features of the smart power system include efficient load management, uninterrupted power supply and decongested power lines. The smart power system has been established as a pilot project. It will be replicated across Delhi if it turns out to be a success,” said Jain in a statement.“A micro-grid solar power station and charging station has been inaugurated. I am highly grateful to the Government of Germany for providing us with their assistance... The quality of this grid is very good. These solar panels and charging stations are efficient and also look beautiful, which makes them different... We will use this grid to further enhance the power infrastructure of Delhi and come out with innovative solutions. This intervention is a revolution in the power sector and should be replicated on a larger scale,” said the power minister. Jain further said, “We will endeavour to scale this up to hundreds of megawatt (MW). If we install such grids in the capacity of 10 MW or 20 MW at different places and scale it up to 600 to 800 MW, then our energy fluctuation will be very minimal. This will make our grid system more robust. Delhi Government will definitely take measures to make this happen. This smart micro-power grid will decongest the power network and ensure uninterrupted power supply to the people of Delhi. This state-of-the-art intervention of the Delhi Government will help in stabilising the power grid, when the demand for power peaks, by efficiently distributing the load.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-power-minister-satyender-jain-inaugurates-solar-power-station-in-s-delhi-101631299081445.html
11-09-2021||Delhi||HC tells cops, civic body to evict hawkers from Munirka market||The Delhi high court on Friday directed the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and Delhi Police to ensure that no hawking takes place in Munirka Village’s Rama furniture market, and reminded the agencies that it was their bounden duty to keep the road or pedestrian zone free of encroachments.“If it is a no hawking, no vending zone, then you have to remove them (hawkers). The executive engineer and the SHO (station house officer) should personally ensure that there are no encroachments..If you have to fence the area, you put up a board of “no hawking, no vending”, ” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said.“In our view, it is the bounden duty of the municipal corporation and the Delhi Police to ensure that no encroachment takes place on the road or pedestrian zone,” the bench said.The court was hearing a petition by Munirka Village residents’ welfare association which said hawkers have illegally occupied the road and rampant encroachments are taking place on public road and pedestrian zones in and around Munirka Village and near the Munirka Metro station.The court observed that hawkers cannot continue to sell their wares from a “no squatting” zone without the connivance of municipal officials.“These people are keeping everyone happy. There is a hafta (protection money) being paid by all of them (hawkers)… It does not happen without that,” the court said.Appearing for the petitioner RWA, advocate Meenakshi Kalra said these encroachments are also taking place around Rama furniture market and, despite repeated requests and representations to the authorities, no action has been taken against the encroachers. Kalra also said all hawkers have also drawn illegal power cables from the metro station premises.On being informed by power discom BSES’s counsel that they have undertaken a survey and booked four people for power theft on September 8, the court said it was not satisfied with the action taken and remarked that the authority has only done a “window dressing exercise”.“Without their (BSES officials) connivance, it would not be possible for anyone to regularly tap into the electricity lines illegally in broad daylight,” the court said.It asked the power company to ensure that no electricity theft takes place in the area.Advocate Beenashaw N Soni, appearing for SDMC, said the corporation has been taking action from time to time but hawkers return once the action is completed. She also said the area is a “no hawking” zone and no tehbazari licences (hawker licences) have been granted and once the hawkers have been removed, it is the duty of the police to enforce that they do not return.However, the court said both authorities should ensure that such an encroachment does not happen. It asked the authorities to file a status report and photographs of cleared up roads on the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/high-court-asks-south-civic-body-police-to-act-against-illegal-hawkers-in-munirka-village-101631299022231.html

The private company will conduct surprise inspections, catch those dumping construction waste in open areas in the city and has the power to issue challans, according to one civic body official. In the last 10 days, over 25 such vehicles were caught in the city, the official said. The initiative was after several complaints from residents regarding the dumping of waste at empty plots other than the designated spots to process construction and demolition (C&D) waste.“In Gurugram, both people from the city and outside come and dump waste in open spaces, which the MCG has to clear at its own cost. According to norms, people can call on the MCG helpline to send a team to pick up the waste for a nominal charge, but many want try to avoid this too,” said the official from the Swachh Bharat Mission wing of the MCG. “This leads to a revenue loss for the MCG, and to stop that, we have started this initiative.” After the vehicles are intercepted, challans of ₹25,000 are issued to these truck and tractor drivers, from where 70% of the amount goes to the private firm and 30% goes to MCG, said the official.The official further said that the initiative was started this month and the firm was hired for one year. According to the MCG’s estimate, the city generates around 850 tonnes of C&D waste daily, most of which is scattered on roadsides and vacant plots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-starts-campaign-to-stop-illegal-dumping-of-construction-waste-101631298960918.html

Officials said Ahuja asked the protesters to give him time till Wednesday evening to resolve the issue following which they agreed to put off their strike till 5pm September 15.On Wednesday, the SE, Ramesh Sharma, was suspended under orders from the Haryana urban local body minister Anil Vij after mayor Madhu Azad told him off the tiff she had with Sharma on Monday. Sharma, who was divested of his charge soon after the incident, had claimed that he was targeted for refusing favours to Azad who denied the allegation. The MCG employees then called a protest, the first in the civic body’s history.“In the first two rounds of meetings, the MCG commissioner asked the protesting employees to return to service and ensure that the public is not inconvenienced. However, the employees agreed to do so only if the SE is reinstated,” said a senior MCG official who was present in all three meetings but did not wish to be named.The official quoted above said that in the third meeting the MCG commissioner asked them for 10 days’ time to resolve the matter. Both sides then agreed to a five-day truce.Earlier in the day, at least 300-400 MCG employees belonging to several departments gathered at a garden near the entrance to the MCG office in Sector 34 office and began their protest.“The responsibility of the MCG is to provide facilities to the common person, and it should be our endeavour that the citizens do not face any kind of inconvenience. Everyone should work together like a family,” said Ahuja speaking at the protest site in the morning in an attempt to discourage the protest.“The unions’ representatives and councillors were told to give their versions in writing that will be sent to the government. We are working towards resolving all matters raised by the protestors,” said Ahuja. The protestors demanded that only elected members and MCG officials should be present inside official meetings. During the MCG review meeting on Monday, SE Ramesh Sharma allegedly also argued with the mayor’s son and the husbands of two councillors before walking out.On Thursday, Ahuja issued an order that only MCG officials and elected members can attend official meetings, as per provisions of the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994.“The MCG commissioner has assured us that the SE’s suspension will be looked into. We have put our protest on hold for the interim. In case there is no change, we will start protesting from Thursday onwards and this time, we won’t hold back,” said Rajesh Kumar, district president, MCG sanitation workers union, one of the unions supporting the protest.On Wednesday, the mayor and a dozen councillor met minister Anil Vij demanding action against the SE following which the SE was suspended.The suspension evoked a strong reaction within the MCG as officials with many saying that Sharma’s suspension was not right. Despite many attempts, Ramesh Sharma could not be reached for comment.On Thursday, the protesting employees had observed a pen-down strike, the first such strike in MCG since its inception in 2008.For Friday, the protestors had threatened for a full-scale strike, however, following talks with senior MCG officials they agreed to execute essential municipal services in the city.However, no other civic work in the MCG was executed and no files regarding the development or maintenance of amenities were cleared or floated afresh.“The decision to suspend the SE was taken by the ULB. The protests by Muncipal Corporation of Gurugram officials and workers were a sign of disobeying with the ULB’s decision. I am glad that they have called off the strike for the interim as the public should not suffer the burden of internal MCG matters,” said Azad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-official-mayor-tiff-protest-called-off-for-five-days-101631298900957.html

Soil transmitted helminths (STHs) are worms that are, as the name suggests, transmitted through soil contaminated with faecal matter. Common STHs are roundworm, whipworm and hook worms. Dr Virendra Yadav, Gurugram chief medical officer, said, “Albendazole tablets will be given free of cost to children between 1 and 19 years of age and to women between 20-24 years who are not pregnant or breastfeeding a child. Due to presence of worms in the stomach, the physical and mental development of children can be affected, which can lead to anaemia.” A worm infection can be identified with symptoms such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weakness, vomiting and loss of appetite, lack of interest in studies and loss of blood and among problems. To prevent STHs, one should avoid defecating outside, should wash hands particularly before eating and after using toilets, wear footwear, wash fruits and vegetables and eat properly cooked food.In Gurugram, 536,886 children and 99,184 women will be given the drug, said officials.

11-09-2021||Delhi||AAP alleges irregularites to the tune of ₹100 crore in MCDs, BJP denies||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of corruption in the municipal corporations in Delhi (MCDs) and alleged financial irregularities to the tune of ₹100 crore, a charge which the latter denied as “baseless”.“The BJP has done an advertisement boarding scam of ₹100 crore in the MCDs. They bypassed rules to ensure that certain private company benefitted in crores. Violating a Supreme Court order, the BJP allowed private companies to earn over ₹100 crores through gantry and flyover panel advertisements,” said AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj in a press conference in Delhi.He further said, “The ₹100 crore should have come to the MCD but it went to a private company. The Supreme Court banned gantry and flyover panel advertisements as it distract drivers’ attention. Many accidents have happened due to them. Accidents have increased on the DND flyway due to illegal advertisements. Many people died due to corruption of BJP leaders.”While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules the three municipal corporations. Delhi goes to the municipal polls next year.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the city government is also using the same contractor. “Bhardwaj has once again levelled baseless allegations which are just intended to malign the image of the MCD. Today Bhardwaj has tried to say that illegal advertising is being done by private contractors on DND flyway and accused MCD officials of illegally pocketing money out of them, cleverly ignoring the fact that even the Delhi government is advertising on the Delhi-Noida road, meaning Delhi government too is using the same private contractor. If Bhardwaj says that MCD officials are pocketing money from the advertising contractor, then he should clarify whether the Delhi government officials too are getting kickbacks from illegal advertising payments. It will be better if AAP leaders, instead of maligning MCDs with frivolous allegations, ask their chief minister to release pending municipal funds as per 4th & 5th Delhi Financial Commission for period between 2015 to 2021.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aapalleges-irregularites-to-the-tune-of-100-crore-in-mcds-bjpdenies-101631298661459.html

11-09-2021||Other||UP Congress to take out yatra, announce poll candidates early||Lucknow: The Congress has blown the poll bugle, deciding to take out a statewide ‘Congress Pratigya Yatra: Hum Vachan Nibhayenge’ (Congress commitment: We will keep our word) to ‘expose’ the BJP government for not keeping promises and also to present the party as an alternative in the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. A decision has also been taken to declare the Congress candidates for 2022 assembly elections well in advance and not at the last minute. An announcement to take out the ‘yatra’ was made after Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra reviewed the party’s poll strategy at a series of meetings at the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee headquarters here on Friday. “We will take out the ‘Congress Pratigya Yatra: Hum Vachan Nibhayenge’ that will cover a distance of 12,000 km. Senior party leaders will lead the yatra and reach out to the people. The focus of the ‘yatra’ will be on Yogi Adityanath government’s failure to keep its promises, rising inflation, poor health services, rising unemployment, corruption and rising crime, including crimes against women,” said a senior party leader. “We are in the process of deciding the routes and other finer details for the ‘yatra’ that may be divided into four or more parts to cover majority of cities and villages across Uttar Pradesh,” said a senior party leader. A resolution authorising Priyanka to take any decision on selection of candidates was passed at the meeting of Pradesh Election Committee (PEC) that she attended along with senior party leaders. “The PEC has authorised Priyanka Gandhi to take a final call on selection of candidates. First list of candidates for about 40 candidates is ready. For short-listing of candidates on other seats, the PEC will meet again on October 5. Priyanka Gandhi has agreed that the party should declare its candidates well in time and not at the last minute” said another leader. UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu and Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhana Mishra confirmed that the party would soon take out the ‘Congress Pratigya Yatra: Hum Vachan Nibhayenge’. There are indications that the ‘yatra’ may be launched after a week or 10 days. As the process of setting up organizational structure at block and nyay panchayat level is nearing completion, Priyanka has asked for progress reports about their functioning from the district party presidents. Out of eight party zones, the organizational structure in four zones came for review on Friday while the functioning of units in remaining four zones would be scrutinized on Saturday. “The Congress is making all the efforts for 2022 elections. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is leaving no stone unturned to revive the Congress. If the Congress is able to improve performance in the polls it will be a big achievement. But it’s late for the Congress. Voters are aware that all the ‘yatras’ being planned and promises being made now are being done with elections in mind and so it’s not going to help the Congress at this stage,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department, political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-congress-to-take-out-yatra-announce-candidates-early-101631297401590.html

At a high-level virtual Covid-19 review meeting, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh said that vaccine effectiveness is evident from the data being analysed. “Special efforts are taken to reach out to government employees, and those who continue to avoid getting vaccinated will now be asked to go on leave till they get the first dose,” he said, adding that the strong measure is being taken to ensure that those who are vaccinated do not have to pay the price for continued hesitancy among others. The Punjab government has also allowed teaching and non-teaching school staff who have taken at least one dose of vaccine more than four weeks ago to resume duties, subject to submission of a weekly RT-PCR negative test report. However, all those with co-morbidities will be allowed to return once they are fully vaccinated. Health minister Balbir Sidhu suggested that the gap for the second dose be reduced for the school staff to 28 days. However, chief secretary Vini Mahajan informed the meeting that the Centre had rejected the state’s request. Citing the latest sero-survey, the chief minister revealed that for children in the age group of 6-17 years, the positivity was at 60%, and it was higher in the age bracket of 14-17 years. “Covid-19 has spread equally across gender and place of residence, as per the survey, which has confirmed that our children, even though affected by Covid-19, have remained largely safe from serious disease,” said the chief minister. The social security department has been asked to prepare to open anganwadi centres within this month, making Punjab the first state to do so. “The opening of these centres will be subject to the vaccination of staff members and other guidelines to be worked out jointly with the health department,” said the chief minister. Curbs extended till Sept 30; cap of 300 on all gatheringsIn view of the upcoming festival season, the chief minister also ordered extension of the existing Covid-19 restrictions till September 30, and imposed a cap of 300 attendees on all gatherings, including political. While ordering strict enforcement of wearing of masks and social distancing, he also made it mandatory for organisers, including political parties, to ensure that participants, management and staff at food and other stalls at festival-related events are fully vaccinated or at least have had a single dose. Calling for continued vigil in the light of festivals, the chief minister urged all political parties to lead by example, while directing the director general of police to ensure compliance of restrictions by all. He also directed the chief secretary to make joint squads of administration and police in each district to ensure compliance at restaurants, marriage palaces and other such places. The health department was directed to ensure the vaccination (at least one dose) of the staff at sweet shops, kiosks and dhabas. The state has already vaccinated more than 57% of the eligible population, with the first dose administered to 1.18 crore and second to 37.81 lakh people. The chief minister also ordered an increase in daily testing from 45,000 to 50,000 as part of preparations for the possible third wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-unvaccinated-govt-staff-to-be-sent-on-forced-leave-101631282039539.html

He said it could lead to a major reshuffle in the police force by the end of the month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mass-reshuffle-in-police-on-cards-before-assembly-polls-101631279339454.html

The 21-year-old mother with her two kids was in the hospital for sonography test when the incident took place. According to the police, the accused woman picked up the infant and fled. An FIR lodged at Bund Garden police station states that the accused committed the offence with the help of her husband, who has also been detained for questioning. Preliminary investigation points that she committed the crime as she was unable to give birth to a baby. The 26-year-old accused along with her husband entered the woman’s ward of the hospital pretending to be a nurse. She grabbed the infant and escaped within a few minutes. The victim after realising that her child is missing created a scene inside the ward, police said. Sub-inspector Savita Sapkale, investigating officer in the case, said, “The woman was seen taking the child away in her lap and later she sat in an autorickshaw and escaped. An eyewitness caught her after a chase and handed her to the police. On questioning, she said of taking the extreme step as she could not have a child of her own.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-police-arrest-woman-for-stealing-3-month-old-infant-from-sassoon-hospital-101631275798468.html

The BJP proposed six names to the party leadership, out of which, Tibrewal’s was selected.“This fight is not against any person. This fight is against injustice. The chief minister doesn’t belong to any party. She is the chief minister of West Bengal. But despite that, she kept silent during post poll violence. I am sure the people of Bhabanipur would understand why Nandigram didn’t vote for Mamata,” Tibrewal told reporters.Banerjee, a resident of Bhabanipur, won the seat twice in 2011 and 2016 but shifted to Nandigram, where the anti-farmland acquisition movement against the Left Front government had transformed her into a major political force, to take on her former protege and now a BJP leader, Suvendu Adhikari.Though the TMC chief powered the party to a resounding win for a third consecutive term in office, she lost the Nandigram seat to Adhikari by a narrow margin.Banerjee has to win the bypoll to become a member of the assembly in order to continue in the chair. She had taken oath on May 5 and must get elected within six months as per protocols.Reacting to Tibrewal’s nomination, veteran TMC leader and party spokesperson Tapas Roy said: “Let them (BJP) bring their central leaders and pit any one of them against Mamata Banerjee in Bhabanipur. When the results are declared, they would not find a place to hide as they would be defeated by a record margin.”While Srijib Biswas was fielded by the Left Front, the Congress has decided not to nominate a candidate for the election.Counting for the polls is slated to take place on October 3.CM Mamata files nominationBanerjee on Friday filed her nomination for the Bhabanipur assembly by-poll.Banerjee was accompanied by the wife of state cabinet minister Firhad Hakim at Survey Building in Alipore where she filed her nomination papers. She was later seen greeting people with folded hands before boarding her car.“The people waiting to avenge the conspiracy that was hatched to defeat Mamata di at Nandigram,” Hakim told reporters here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-fields-advocate-priyanka-tibrewal-to-take-on-banerjee-in-bhabanipur-byeelections-101631256358240.html

Bush told people at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania that Americans learned much about themselves on September 11.“We learned that bravery is more common than we imagined, emerging with sudden splendor in the face of death," Bush said Saturday at a ceremony on the 20th anniversary of the attacks.Bush, who was President during the attacks, commended the courage of the Flight 93 passengers and crew, who are believed to have foiled an attack on the US Capitol by leading the plane to crash in rural Pennsylvania.“The 33 passengers and seven crew of Flight 93 could have been any group of citizens selected by fate. In a sense, they stood in for us all," Bush said. "The terrorists soon discovered that a random group of Americans is an exceptional group of people.”He encouraged Americans to put aside their political differences in the spirit of what he saw after 9/11.“So much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger, fear and resentment," Bush said. “On America’s day of trial and grief, I saw millions of people instinctively grab their neighbor’s hand and rally to the cause of one another."Vice President Kamala Harris began her remarks at the Flight 93 memorial with words for those who lost loved ones on September 11.“So many in our nation -- too many in our nation -- have deeply felt the passage of time these past 20 years," she said. "Please know your nation sees you and we stand with you and we support you.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bush-remembers-flight-93-passengers-who-foiled-attack-on-us-capitol-in-911-101631382306484.html
11-09-2021||World||US marks first 9/11 commemoration out of the shadow of Afghan war||The United States marked the 20th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks with the same solemnity as every year, starting with the bell ringing at 8.46am at the memorial in Lower Manhattan in New York, the time the first plane hit North Tower of the World Trade Center.At 9.03am attendees stood again to observe a moment of silence when the South Tower was hit with a hijacked jet. At 9.37am, the attendees observed a moment of silence when the Pentagon was hit with a jet leading to the death of 184 people onboard and on the ground, and again at 10.03am when another hijacked jet with passengers crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. At 9.59am, the moment of silence was observed again when the South Tower fell and at 10.28 am when the North Tower started falling.A moment of silence was observed to mark each of these tragedies.For the first time though, the US commemorated the tragic day and events out of the shadow of the longest war in its history it had launched 20 years ago to hunt down the perpetrators of the attack - Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda - in Afghanistan.US President Joe Biden, who ended the war last month amidst both criticism and applause, and First Lady Jill Biden were joined at the New York memorial service by former president Bill Clinton and ex-secretary of state Hillary Clinton and former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama.The American president released a video message on Friday calling for “national unity”. Joe Biden said: “In the days that followed September 11, 2001, we saw heroism everywhere. We also saw something all too rare: national unity. Unity is what makes us who we are, America at its best. To me, that’s the central lesson of September 11th.”Former president George W Bush, who was president at the time and who launched the Afghanistan war, and his wife Laura Bush attended the event in Pennsylvania, the site where Flight 93 had crashed as its passengers tried to wrest control of the plane from the terrorists, who, it is widely believed, had planned to slam it into either the US Capitol or the White House in Washington DC. Bush joined vice-president Kamala Harris and second gentleman Douglas Emhoff.“On this 20th anniversary, on this solemn day of remembrance, we must challenge ourselves to, yes, look back. For the sake of our children. For the sake of their children,” said Kamala Harris at the Shanksville event, adding, “And for that reason, we must also look forward. We must also look towards the future.”Former president George W Bush spoke movingly of the united America he had led out of the 9/11 tragedy compared to the bitterly divided country now. “In the weeks and months following the 911 attacks I was proud to lead an amazing, resilient united people. When it comes to the unity of America, those days seem different from our own,” he said, adding, “Malign forces seem at work in our common life, which turn every disagreement into an argument. And, every argument into a clash of cultures.”George W Bush did not name anyone, but there was a clear pointer in his speech was to the politics of former president Donald Trump, who was not at any of the three commemoration sites. But, he used the solemn occasion to hit out at his successor. In a video message, he slammed the “inept administration” of President Joe Biden over the way the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan happened. “The leader of our country was made to look like a fool and that can never be allowed to happen,”Donald Trump said.The other former president, Barack Obama, recalled the courage and selflessness displayed by passengers of Flight 93 and first-responders. “Over the last 20 years, we’ve seen the same courage and selflessness on display again and again. We saw it a decade ago when, after years of persistence, our military brought justice to Osama bin Laden. “And we’re seeing it today - in the doctors and nurses, bone tired, doing what they can to save lives; the service members, some of whom weren’t even born 20 years ago, putting themselves at risk to save Americans and help refugees find a better life; the first responders battling roaring fires and rising waters to bring families to safety. They represent what is best in America, and what can and should bring us together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-marks-first-9-11-commemoration-out-of-the-shadow-of-afghan-war-101631383268112.html

Speaking at a webinar on Afghanistan’s future and regional stability, Pakistan NSA Moeed Yusuf said that abandoning the war-torn country again would be a mistake."The world must think about the cost of abandonment of Afghanistan," the Centre for Aerospace & Security Studies (CASS), organiser of the webinar, quoted Yusuf as saying.India and Western countries have opted for a wait-and-watch policy as they are apprehensive about engaging with the Islamist fundamentalists given the Taliban’s history of gross human rights violations. Under their harsh version of Sharia law, the Taliban had banned girls education and women at workplaces during the previous rule. They were also notorious for holding public executions in stadiums.Also Read | 'ISI would be interested:' US-built databases a potential tool of Taliban repressionPakistan, on the other hand, was proactive in the government formation in Afghanistan. Earlier this week, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed that Pakistan's powerful intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed met the group’s de-factor leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar amid efforts to finalise the government. Baradar was later named the deputy prime minister of the provisional government.Yusuf said the Western countries committed a catastrophic mistake of abandoning Afghanistan after the conflict between the erstwhile Soviet Union and the so-called Afghan Mujahideen ended. The early 90s witnessed a prolonged civil war which led to the formation of the Taliban under the leadership of Mullah Omar.He claimed that Pakistan was the only nation that bore the brunt of abandoning Afghanistan, a country that, under the Taliban’s rule, provided shelter to Al Qaeda leaders, resulting in the 9/11 attacks in the United States. Pakistan NSA further stated that the world needs to constructively engage the Afghan Taliban in order to prevent governance collapse and avert another refugee crisis, according to PTI.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-nsa-calls-on-countries-to-engage-with-taliban-warns-about-cost-of-abandonment-101631375677519.html

Reports said that Mullah Fazel, the deputy defence minister of the interim cabinet, also referred to ISI chief Hameed Faiz's recent visit to Kabul which, according to the audio, 'has ruined Afghanistan's entire future and another war is expecting". Hindustan Times did not independently verify the authenticity of the viral audio clip.A News18 report said that the audio mentioned a firing incident in the President's Palace between Faiz Hameed's bodyguards and the Taliban commanders. Audio file of a Taliban leader who is saying, "Punjab destroyed everything", "in Arg between Taliban there was a huge fight and there is still a lot of problems between Taliban", "guest (ISI chief) ruined Afghanistan's entire future and another war is expecting".👇 audio file pic.twitter.com/WtTU6HBZD0Faiz Hameed's recent visit to Kabul raised questions over Pakistan's role behind the Taliban and reports said that the ISI chief visited Afghanistan to mediate between the Taliban and the Haqqanis. Before his visit, the Taliban were set to announce a Cabinet under the leadership of Mullah Baradar. After the visit, there were some tweaks in the plan the final Cabinet was set up under the leadership of Taliban Supreme leader Akhundzada. Two prominent Haqqani leaders have also been inducted into the Cabinet. Reports said that this was not the Cabinet that the Taliban were actually planning as they had promised an inclusive Cabinet.The clash during the ISI chief's visit was not the first one regarding the Cabinet formation. Going by reports, the visit itself was prompted by a clash between the Taliban and the Haqqani network in which Mullah Baradar was injured.After the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, Pakistan officially distanced itself from the Taliban using the fact that Mullah Baradar was in jail in Pakistan until the US wanted him to be released.The ISI chief had said that his visit was meant for discussing the situation of the country with the leadership.

11-09-2021||World||Hurricane Larry hits Newfoundland wipes out power, trees||People in the Canadian Atlantic coast province of Newfoundland woke up Saturday to streets littered with branches and debris, torn and tossed around by the ferocious winds of Hurricane Larry.Larry made landfall as a Category 1 storm just after midnight Friday along the southern coast of the island, bringing sheets of rain and sustained winds of 130 km/h (80 miles) across the Avalon Peninsula, which includes the provincial capital of St. John's.The city's streets were lined with fallen branches Saturday morning, and trees were uprooted and overturned on many lawns.A small crowd gathered around Mary Queen of Peace elementary school Saturday, shaking their heads slowly as fragments of the school's shredded roof whipped around in the remaining winds.A large part of the roof was blown clear off the building and lay in a heap of siding and nail-riddled boards on the ground some distance away.As of 10 am, nearly 30,000 people in the St. John's region were still without power, Newfoundland Power's website said. But the lights and coffee makers were on at a Tim Horton's near the Rooms provincial art gallery, and the lineup to get a morning coffee snaked through the restaurant and out the door.Brandon Snook was outside the coffee shop with his infant son, Myles, as his wife grabbed a few cups inside. They didn't have any power to make their own, he said.Myles slept through the entire night, Snook said, clearly impressed.“My sister, her little little one lost her play house,” he said.“It got smashed up against the house in about two million pieces.”His own house made it through OK, he said -- just a bit of siding peeled loose.An empty building nearby in the Rawlins Cross intersection wasn't so lucky; several of its traffic-facing windows were shattered in their frames, leaving the inside of the building completely exposed.Up the street, parts of the green iron fencing surrounding the Basilica Cathedral had fallen down and several of the massive structures windows were missing.The Royal Newfoundland Constabulary urged pedestrians and drivers across the peninsula to stay home as officers swept the area to report fallen trees and power lines.Newfoundland Power, meanwhile, assured those in the dark that crews had been out since daybreak to work on the power lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-larry-hits-newfoundland-wipes-out-power-trees-101631372688357.html

In a campaign-style video message, Trump lamented the chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan last month which led to the killing of 13 US service members and dozens of Afghans in a suicide bombing outside the Kabul airport."This is a very sad day," Trump said in the message."It is also a sad time for the way our war on those that did such harm to our country ended last week,” he added.Trump was referring to the US’ Afghanistan invasion in 2001 to eliminate Al Qaeda in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and the chaotic withdrawal after two decades that saw the return of the Taliban in the war-torn country. The United States had toppled the Taliban regime in a bid to find Al Qaeda leaders, especially their chief Osama bin Laden, who had planned the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.Also Read | 'America is under attack': When White House chief of staff whispered to George W.

Trump blamed the chaotic withdrawal on "bad planning, incredible weakness and leaders who truly didn't understand what was happening.""Joe Biden and his inept administration surrendered in defeat," he continued. "We will struggle to recover from the embarrassment this incompetence has caused."On Saturday, Biden started a full day of memorial events from Ground Zero, the site where the World Trade Center's twin towers once stood. He then began travel to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where a hijacked plane crashed in a field as passengers tried to take control of the flight from terrorists.“Twenty years ago, nearly 3,000 lives were cut short by an unspeakable act of cowardice and hatred on 9/11. As a nation, we must never forget those we lost during one of the darkest moments in our history and the enduring pain of their families and loved ones,” the US president tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-uses-9-11-anniversary-to-attack-biden-says-he-was-made-look-like-a-fool-101631371143406.html
11-09-2021||World||Biden, Obama, Clinton mark 9/11 in NYC with display of unity||Three presidents and their wives stood somberly side by side at the National September 11 Memorial, sharing a moment of silence to mark the anniversary of the nation’s worst terror attack with a display of unity.Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton all gathered at the site where the World Trade Center towers fell two decades ago. They each wore blue ribbons and held their hands over their hearts as a procession marched a flag through the memorial, watched by hundreds of Americans gathered for the remembrance, some carrying photos of loved ones lost in the attacks.Before the event began, a jet flew overhead in an eerie echo of the attacks, drawing a glance from Biden toward the sky.Biden was a senator when hijackers commandeered four planes and executed the attack. Now he marks the 9/11 anniversary for the first time as commander in chief.The president will spend Saturday paying his respects at the trio of sites where the planes crashed, but he left the speech-making to others.Instead, the White House released a taped address late Friday in which Biden spoke of the “true sense of national unity” that emerged after the attacks, seen in “heroism everywhere — in places expected and unexpected.”“To me that’s the central lesson of September 11,” he said. “Unity is our greatest strength.”Biden arrived in New York on Friday night as the skyline was illuminated by the “Tribute in Light,” hauntingly marking where the towers once stood.Following the morning ceremony in New York City, Biden will visit the field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where a plane fell from the sky after heroic passengers fought terrorists to prevent it from reaching its Washington destination. And finally, he will head to the Pentagon, where the world’s mightiest military suffered an unthinkable blow to its very home.Biden’s task, like his predecessors before him, was to mark the moment with a mix of grief and resolve. A man who has suffered immense personal tragedy, Biden speaks of loss with power.He gave voice to the pain that comes with memories of 9/11 in his video message, saying, “No matter how much time has passed, these commemorations bring everything painfully back as if you just got the news a few seconds ago.”Robert Gibbs, who served as Obama’s press secretary, said for Biden, “It’s a moment for people to see him not as Democratic president, but as president of the United States of America,.”“The American people are somewhat conflicted about what they have seen out of Afghanistan the last couple of weeks,” Gibbs said. “For Biden, it’s a moment to try to reset some of that. Remind people of what it is to be commander in chief and what it means to be the leader of the country at a moment of such significance.”On the 20th anniversary of the attacks, Biden now shoulders the responsibility borne by his predecessors to prevent future tragedy, and must do so against fresh fears of a rise in terror after the United States’ hasty exit from Afghanistan, the country from which the Sept. 11 attacks were plotted.Biden is the fourth president to console the nation on the anniversary of that dark day, one that has shaped many of the most consequential domestic and foreign policy decisions made by the chief executives over the past two decades.The terror attack defined the presidency of George W. Bush, who was reading a book to Florida schoolchildren when the planes slammed into the World Trade Center. He spent that day being kept out of Washington for security reasons — a decision that then-Sen. Biden urged him to reconsider, the current president has written — and then delivered a brief, halting speech that night from the White House to a terrified nation.The following year, Bush chose Ellis Island as the location to deliver his first anniversary address, the Statue of Liberty over his shoulder as he vowed, “What our enemies have begun, we will finish.”The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were still deadly when Obama visited the Pentagon to mark his first Sept. 11 in office in 2009.“No words can ease the ache of your hearts,” he said.“We recall the beauty and meaning of their lives,” he said. “No passage of time, no dark skies can dull the meaning of that moment.”By the time Obama spoke at the 10th anniversary, attack mastermind Osama bin Laden was dead, killed in a May 2011 Navy SEAL raid. Though the nation remained entangled overseas, and vigilant against terror threats, the anniversary became more about healing.President Donald Trump pledged to get the U.S. out of Afghanistan, but his words during his first Sept. 11 anniversary ceremony in 2017 were a vivid warning to terrorists, telling “these savage killers that there is no dark corner beyond our reach, no sanctuary beyond our grasp, and nowhere to hide anywhere on this very large earth.”On Saturday, as Biden was making his way to all three sites, Bush was to pay his respects in Shanksville. Trump planned at least one stop in Manhattan and was to deliver ringside commentary at a boxing match at a casino in Hollywood, Florida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-obama-clinton-mark-9-11-in-nyc-with-display-of-unity-101631368480099.html

A second source familiar with the situation said that the FDA anticipated a similar timeline for Pfizer.If Pfizer submits its EUA by the end of September, and the data support its use, "by the time we get to October, the first couple of weeks of October... the Pfizer product will likely be ready," Fauci said, according to the source.Fauci said that Moderna Inc will likely take about three weeks longer than Pfizer to collect and analyse its data on children age 5-11, according to the source. He estimated that a decision on the Moderna shot could come around November, according to the source. The second source said Fauci's timeline for Moderna appeared "optimistic."Officials at Pfizer, Moderna and NIH did not immediately comment.Pfizer has previously said that it would have data on children age 5-11 ready in September and planned to submit for an EUA shortly after. Previously, federal health regulators, including Fauci, have suggested that an FDA decision might come in November or later. Moderna on Thursday told investors it expected data from its children's study by the end of the year.Earlier on Friday, the FDA said it would work to approve the Covid-19 vaccines for children quickly once the companies submitted their data. It said it would consider applications based on a faster path to authorize the shot for emergency use.Such emergency authorisation requires companies to submit two months of safety data on trial participants, versus six months required for full licensure.Pfizer partner BioNTech told Der Spiegel that it also expects to request authorization globally for the Covid-19 vaccine in children as young as five over the next few weeks and that preparations for a launch were on track.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-could-authorise-pfizer-covid-19-shot-for-kids-aged-5-to-11-in-october-101631366076323.html

They were seen in photographs holding printed banners and were being escorted by Taliban soldiers carrying rifles and machine guns. Saturday’s demonstration came after several protests in Kabul and other cities in Afghanistan earlier in the week called for women’s participation in the government and called for their right to education and jobs. Taliban fighters have tried to scuttle such demonstrations, often led by women, by firing into the air to disperse protesters and effectively banned such shows of defiance."Women who left Afghanistan cannot represent us," one of the pro-Taliban banners read.

11-09-2021||World||'America is under attack': When White House chief of staff whispered to George W. Bush on 9/11||Americans are commemorating the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks that claimed nearly 3,000 lives and resulted in a years-long war in Afghanistan and Iraq. While the remembrances have become an annual tradition, the recent withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, which saw the return of the Taliban in the war-torn country, this day holds a special significance.Al Qaeda terrorists hijacked commercial airliners and crashed them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon. A United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania after passengers tried to regain control of the hijacked plane.On that fateful day, then US President George W. Bush was in Sarasota to interact with a class of students at Emma E. Booker Elementary School.Here's how the things unfolded on September 11, 2001:American Airlines 11 departed from Boston for Los Angeles at 07.59am and has its last routine communication with the ground at 8.15am.At 08.19am, a flight attendant reported an emergency to the airline's reservation office in North Carolina via an airphone. After 22 minutes, a duty manager was told that air traffic controllers declared hijacking of the flight, believing it was headed toward New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport."Something is wrong. We are in a rapid descent," another flight attendant told the airline's office in Boston."Oh my God, we are way too low," the flight attendant said after she was asked to determine the plane's location by looking out of the window.The flight crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8.46am.Also Read | On 9/11, how a Nasa astronaut saw attacks on US from spaceThen White House chief of staff Andrew Card, who was in Sarasota with Bush, told Fox 13 that initially it was believed to be a small private plane. “Sir, it appears a small twin-engine prop plane crashed into one of the towers at the World Trade Center," Card recounted a Navy captain telling the president.Bush remained seated with the children as they believed it was an accident.At 8.42am, the United Airlines Flight 175, which had departed from Boston for Los Angeles at 7.58am, reported a “suspicious transmission” overheard from another plane. It was American Airlines 11 which was about to crash into the North Tower. The United Airlines Flight 175 lost communication with the ground after reporting the transmission.A flight attendant called the airline's San Francisco office to report that the plane has been hijacked. She informed that both pilots had been killed, another flight attendant stabbed and hijackers were flying the plane in all probability.The plane crashed into the World Trade Center's South Tower at 9.03am. The tower collapsed at 9.58am in 10 seconds.Also See | Photos: 20 years later, a 9/11 image connects the photographer & survivorThe Navy captain, who had informed Bush about the plane crash, told Card that another plane had crashed into the second tower of the World Trade Center.Card walked up to the president and whispered, "A second plane hit the second tower, America is under attack."Bush remained in the classroom for about five to seven minutes and left with his motorcade at 9.35am. Air Force One departed without any fixed destination and landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.American Airlines 77, which departed from Dulles for Los Angeles, deviated from the assigned course at 8.54am. The transponder was turned off two minutes later. An airline executive learnt about the communication being lost with another flight, with one already crashed into the WTC. The airline ordered flights to not take off and those already in theair to make emergency landings.At 9.34am, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport advised theUS Secret Service of unknown aircraft heading in direction of the White House. But the plane made a 330-degree turn for downtown Washington and crashed into the Pentagon three minutes later.United Airlines Flight 93 from Newark to San Francisco crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania at 10.02am as passengers tried to regain control of the flight.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/america-is-under-attack-when-white-house-chief-of-staff-whispered-to-george-w-bush-101631354742003.html

Nasa astronaut Frank Culbertson saw the aftermath of the 9/11 tragedy from orbit from the International Space Station (ISS) as “smoke seemed to have an odd bloom to it at the base of the column that was streaming south of the city”. "It's horrible to see smoke pouring from wounds in your own country from such a fantastic vantage point," he wrote. "The dichotomy of being on a spacecraft dedicated to improving life on the earth and watching life being destroyed by such willful, terrible acts is jolting to the psyche."Frank Culbertson was widely called at the time as the “only US citizen not on earth” when the 9/11 terrorist attacks occurred 20 years ago. On 9/11, 19 al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial airplanes to carry out devastating suicide attacks against the United States. They flew two planes into the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center which then collapsed, a third plane was flown into the Pentagon, while crew members and passengers on a fourth plane forced hijackers to crash in Pennsylvania. The 9/11 attacks killed 2,977 people, the single largest loss of life resulting from a foreign attack on American soil.Culbertson was about 400km above Earth inside the still-under-construction ISS with two Russian cosmonauts Mikhail Tyurin and Vladimir Dezhurov when he saw the huge column of smoke streaming from Lower Manhattan where the Twin Towers fell. Culbertson captured video and photos of the 9/11 site from space for Nasa, while satellites also tracked the attack site from orbit.Also read | Costs of War: This is how much US spent on war against terror post-9/11 attacksThe Nasa astronaut wrote about his experience the next day. “Well, obviously the world changed today. What I say or do is very minor compared to the significance of what happened to our country today when it was attacked by .... by whom? Terrorists is all we know, I guess. Hard to know at whom to direct our anger and fear…” Frank Culbertson said.A flight surgeon told Frank Culbertson “they were having a very bad day on the ground” and “described the situation to me as best he knew it”. “I was flabbergasted, then horrified. My first thought was that this wasn't a real conversation, that I was still listening to one of my Tom Clancy tapes. It just didn't seem possible on this scale in our country. I couldn't even imagine the particulars, even before the news of further destruction began coming in,” Culbertson said.Also read | 9/11 attacks: 20 years on, scars remainHe said he tried to explain to Tyurin and Dezhurov “as best I could the potential magnitude of this act of terror in downtown Manhattan and at the Pentagon”. “They clearly understood and were very sympathetic.”The Nasa astronaut said he found a window that would “give me a view of NYC and grabbed the nearest camera. It happened to be a video camera…” “The smoke seemed to have an odd bloom to it at the base of the column that was streaming south of the city. After reading one of the news articles we just received, I believe we were looking at NY around the time of, or shortly after, the collapse of the second tower. How horrible…”Also read | Myths perpetuated and busted in the 20 years since 9/11Culbertson said it was “pretty difficult to think about work after that”. “It all looked incredible from two to three hundred miles away. I can't imagine the tragic scenes on the ground,” he wrote.“Other than the emotional impact of our country being attacked and thousands of our citizens and maybe some friends being killed, the most overwhelming feeling being where I am is one of isolation,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-9-11-how-a-nasa-astronaut-saw-attacks-on-us-from-space-101631356201464.html
11-09-2021||World||Healthy boys more likely to be hospitalised with Pfizer side-effect than Covid-19: Study||Healthy adolescent boys are more likely to be hospitalised with a rare side-effect after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine than the virus itself, claims a new study. US researchers studied the rate of post-vaccination cardiac myocarditis cases in the 12-15 and 16-17 age groups to analyse the benefits and risk of administering mRNA vaccines among adolescents.The researchers identified a total of 257 vaccine-related cardiac adverse events (CAEs) following the second dose of the mRNA vaccine. The rate of the CAEs per million among 12-15-year-old boys was 162.2, while it was 94.0 in 16-17-year-old boys. Among girls, the equivalent rates were 13.0 and 13.4 per million respectively.The study suggests that the rate of CAE was 3.7 to 6.1 times higher among healthy 12-15-year-old boys than their risk of hospitalisation from Covid-19 in 120 days as of August 21. The rate of CAE was 2.6-4.3-fold higher at times of high weekly hospitalization risk, such as during January 2021.“For boys 16-17 without medical comorbidities, the rate of CAE is currently 2.1 to 3.5 times higher than their 120-day Covid-19 hospitalization risk, and 1.5 to 2.5 times higher at times of high weekly Covid-19 hospitalization,” the study says.The study is yet to be peer-reviewed and currently available on a pre-print server.Also Read | Myocarditis: All you need to know about disease linked to Covid-19The United States had issued a warning to watch the symptoms of myocarditis after a small number of heart inflammation cases were reported in adolescents. While the US has continued administering mRNA vaccines among young teens, the UK’s advisory body on vaccination has not recommended inoculating all 12-15-year-olds with mRNA vaccines.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) had opined that though the benefits from vaccination are “marginally greater”, there is “considerable uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the potential harms.” The committee further acknowledged that the margin of benefit against risk is “too small” to advise on a universal programme of vaccination for healthy 12 to 15-year-old children.“As longer-term data on potential adverse reactions accrue, greater certainty may allow for a reconsideration of the benefits and harms. Such data may not be available for several months,” the JCVI said in an independent report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/healthy-boys-more-likely-to-be-hospitalised-with-pfizer-side-effect-than-covid-study-101631353224894.html

The decision might have been taken to save money at a time the country is reeling under cash shortage. Some reports have however said that the Taliban were pressurised by its allies against organising an oath-taking ceremony.That the Taliban were planning to hold it on September 11 was never confirmed by the Taliban leadership though reports have claimed that invitations were rolled out to China, Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, Qatar, Russia, India and the US. The Kremlin on Friday confirmed that Russia would not take part in any way in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan. The speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said earlier this week that Russia would be represented at the inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency reported."The inauguration ceremony of the new Afghan government was cancelled a few days ago. In order not to confuse people further, the leadership of the Islamic Emirate announced the part of the Cabinet, and it has already started to work," Inamullah Samangani, a member of the Taliban government's cultural commission tweeted.After delaying the announcement over a reported disagreement between the Taliban and the Haqqani network, an interim Cabinet was announced on Tuesday under the leadership of Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-might-have-cancelled-9-11-oath-ceremony-to-save-money-reports-101631352172037.html
11-09-2021||World||Epic Games vs Apple court case: Here's how the ruling affects in-app payments||Apple was forced to loosen the grip it holds on its App Store payment system after a US judge ruled on Friday in a closely watched battle with Fortnite maker Epic Games. Though app makers will be able to take steps to skirt the up to 30 percent commission Apple takes on sales, the tech giant avoided being branded an illegal monopoly in the case.Here are some key questions on the App Store and the impact of the ruling:How does the App Store work?The App Store acts as the lone gateway for mobile applications of any kind onto iPhones or other Apple devices.Apple requires developers to adhere to its rules for what apps can or can't do, and makes them use the App Store payment system for all transactions there.Apple takes a commission of up to 30 percent of app purchases or transactions, contending it is a fair fee for providing a safe, global platform for developers to hawk their creations.Apple maintains that 85 percent of the approximately 1.8 million apps at the digital shop pay nothing to the Silicon Valley-based tech giant.What was the ruling?The ruling by US district court judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers said that Apple's control of the App Store did not amount to a monopoly, but that it must let developers include links to other online venues for buying content or services.App makers will be able to provide links that users can click on to take them to another website to buy content or otherwise interact.Apple can still require its payment system to be used for in-app purchases, meaning it should still get its share of transactions such as buying virtual gear in a game or a subscription.Gonzalez Rogers wrote that Apple violated California's laws against unfair competition but that it was not "an anti-trust monopolist... for mobile gaming transactions."Big change?The biggest change lovers of Apple mobile gadgets might notice is that apps should start showcasing links enticing them to leave the App Store to spend money.Apple representatives called the ruling a validation of the App Store business model.The judge did not order Apple to let Fortnite back in the App Store, and studio's CEO Tim Sweeney tweeted the game would only return "when and where Epic can offer in-app payment in fair competition with Apple."Bite out of Apple's revenue?It will be difficult to estimate what sort of bite the ruling will take from the company's income.Most of the offerings at the App Store are created by small developers who haven't built their own payment systems the way Epic Games runs its own online shop, noted analyst Carolina Milanesi.Small developers likely see benefits to using Apple's payment system and provided perks, such as promoting apps or handling refunds, the analyst reasoned.App users might also feel more comfortable trusting transactions on Apple's platform rather than entering credit cards or other information on third-party websites."How many developers can do something else when it comes to payment systems and how many customers are interested in using something else?" Milanesi asked."I don't think this ruling is a problem for Apple from a revenue perspective."And, Apple may be planning to more than offset any lost revenue with its own advertising business, according to the analyst.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/epic-games-vs-apple-court-case-here-s-how-the-ruling-affects-in-app-payments-101631344079744.html

Report claims Kabul drone strike killed aid worker, 9 of his family members||The US may have mistakenly targeted an aid worker rather than Islamic State fighters in a drone strike in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, which killed 10 people, The New York Times has reported using video analysis and interviews. According to the Pentagon, it foiled a new attack planned by the Islamic State through a Reaper drone strike on August 29 in the last known missile fired by the United States in its two-decade war in Afghanistan. The drone strike came the day before US troops ended their 20-year mission and following a deadly attack outside the Kabul airport, which killed 13 service members and at least 170 Afghans trying to escape the Taliban.The US military called it a “righteous strike” and officials have said that the drone attack in a dense area near Kabul airport was carried out after hours of surveillance on a white sedan, which they thought was carrying explosives. However, the New York Times said its “investigation of video evidence, along with interviews with more than a dozen of the driver’s co-workers and family members in Kabul, raises doubts about the US version of events, including whether explosives were present in the vehicle, whether the driver had a connection to ISIS, and whether there was a second explosion after the missile struck the car.”Also read | Several children killed in US drone strike on IS in Afghanistan: ReportsAhmadi’s brother Romal told the Times that 10 members of their family, including seven children, were killed in the strike—Ahmadi and three of his children, Zamir, 20, Faisal, 16, and Farzad, 10; Ahmadi’s cousin Naser, 30; three of Romal’s children, Arwin, 7, Benyamin, 6, and Hayat, 2; and two 3-year-old girls, Malika and Somaya. However, the US said three people were killed in that drone strike on that day.The New York Times said Ahmadi, 43, worked as an electrical engineer for California-based aid and lobbying group, Nutrition and Education International, since 2006. It reported the US military may have been seeing Ahmadi and a colleague loading canisters of water, which was in short supply after the collapse of the Western-backed government and picking up a laptop for his boss.Also read | Will continue drone strikes in Afghanistan 'if and when needed': PentagonUS officials say that a larger blast took place after the drone strike, showing that there were explosives in the vehicle. Times visual investigations team and a Times reporter examined the scene of the strike the morning after the drone strike and followed up with a second visit four days later. The report said they found no evidence of a second, more powerful explosion. “Experts who examined photos and videos pointed out that, although there was clear evidence of a missile strike and subsequent vehicle fire, there were no collapsed or blown-out walls, no destroyed vegetation, and only one dent in the entrance gate, indicating a single shock wave,” it said.“It seriously questions the credibility of the intelligence or technology utilized to determine this was a legitimate target,” Chris Cobb-Smith, a British Army veteran and security consultant, told the Times.Also read | Civilian casualties due to US drone strike 'being investigated': White House official Jen PsakiPentagon spokesperson John Kirby said while commenting on the report that US Central Command "continues to assess" the strike but that "no other military works harder than we do to prevent civilian casualties." "As Chairman (Mark) Milley said, the strike was based on good intelligence, and we still believe that it prevented an imminent threat to the airport and to our men and women that were still serving at the airport," Kirby said, referring to the top US general.The New York Times noted that a rocket attack the following morning, claimed by the Islamic State group, was carried out from a Toyota Corolla similar to Ahmadi's.Ahmadi’s relatives have questioned why he would have a motivation to attack Americans when he had already applied for refugee resettlement in the US. “All of them were innocent. You say he was ISIS, but he worked for the Americans,” Emal, Ahmadi’s brother, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/did-us-make-a-mistake-report-claims-kabul-drone-strike-killed-aid-worker-kids-101631339797333.html
11-09-2021||World||Toronto fest: Documentary tells stories of 9/11 survivors, victims’ families||As the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks is marked today, a new documentary, memorialising the personal narratives of many who were directly impacted, had its premiere as a special event at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).The documentary, Memory Box: Echoes of 9/11, brings together the emotional stories of these persons, including survivors, family members of victims, rescue personnel and onlookers. These stories were recorded in the months following 9/11 by artist Ruth Sergel, who created a wooden video booth and transported it to New York, Washington DC and Shanksville in Pennsylvania, the three sites of the attacks, and invited people to share their experiences of that day and those following.In introducing the film, which premiered as a special event at TIFF, co-director Bjorn Johnson described the project as a “collection of extraordinary but little known testimonies” and a film not about what people “saw on September 11, but rather what they felt and, more so, how they processed their trauma”.In the film, Ruth Sergel outlined her objective: “I could see the damage being done to people when they couldn’t tell their own story in their own words. It was just planes, planes, planes, building down, building down. There was absolutely no space for more complicated stories about what people actually felt.”Among those recounting their experience was Joanne Capestro, who was working on the 87th floor of one of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. As the first plane hit, she didn’t know what had happened and thought it was an earthquake. “We shook so strong,” she said in the video recorded months after the tragedy.There’s William Sekzer, whose first thought was that this was the building where his son worked. As he recalled, “Realising you’re helpless is a terrible thing for a parent.”The videos collected are raw, voices choke and tears flow as the horror of that day is remembered.Juxtaposing those recollections are videos and news footage from the unfolding attacks on that eventful day, moving from Lower Manhattan where the WTC stood, to the Pentagon, where another plane struck, to the small town of Shanksville in Pennsylvania where the aircraft, that passengers managed to seize control of from the Al-Qaeda terrorists, crashed, leaving no survivors.It captures the words of the rescuers, including those at Ground Zero in New York, only managing to find “buckets” full of body parts. Among those remains was a bone fragment of William Sekzer’s son.The film’s last section revisits those who were featured in the video. Twenty years later, they describe how their lives had changed. Among them was Joanne Capestro who said “you have to be able to persevere”.In its description of the film, TIFF said the directors, Johnson and David Belton “interspersed Ruth Sergel’s testimonies with news footage from the time to create a powerful narrative of how those massive, cataclysmic events affected specific individuals, and how those memories have come to reshape lives. The result is a remarkable portrait of both trauma and resilience”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/toronto-fest-documentary-tells-stories-of-9-11-survivors-victims-families-101631340005679.html
11-09-2021||World||Canada elections: Man arrested for threatening PM Justin Trudeau||An unidentified man has been arrested and charged by police in the province of Ontario for threatening Liberal Party leader and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau while he was campaigning in the town of Cambridge in late August.Water Regional Police did not name the person but said he was 32 and was from the town of Kitchener. In a release, they said he has been charged with two counts of uttering threats. The incident occurred on August 29 and local law enforcement launched their investigation after “viewing video of the event, speaking to witnesses, and receiving information provided by the RCMP”.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) is tasked with ensuring the safety of the leaders of major Federal parties.Justin Trudeau has faced protests by noisy crowds at several campaign stops, essentially over his announcement that vaccines will be mandatory for public employees and travel on domestic trains and flights. On September 6, he was hit by gravel thrown by angry protestors during a campaign stop in the town of London in Ontario. That incident is also being investigated by local police.That incident occurred as Justin Trudeau was preparing to board his campaign bus and media accompanying him reported that some of them were also hit by fragments.That was the first incident of violence on the campaign trail leading up to the September 20 Federal elections.Justin Trudeau also faced similar noisy protests in Surrey in British Columbia, while a campaign event in the town of Bolton in Ontario was cancelled last month due to the gathering of a large number of protestors. However, previous incidents have been restricted to shouting of abuse at Justin Trudeau.Justin Trudeau said last week that he will “not allow” such “anti-vaxxer mobs” to “dictate how this country gets through this pandemic”. Those attacks have drawn criticism from Justin Trudeau’s principal rival, Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole, who had tweeted, “This is disgusting and I condemn these actions in the strongest term possible. Political violence is never justified and our media must be free from intimidation, harassment, and violence.”According to Canadian media reports, the protests have been linked to the fringe People’s Party of Canada but there was no information whether the man arrested in Cambridge had any association with it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-man-arrested-for-threatening-pm-justin-trudeau-101631337305162.html
11-09-2021||World||Costs of War: This is how much US spent on war against terror post-9/11 attacks||The September 11, 2001 attacks ushered in an era of increased surveillance, human rights violations and mass displacements globally, with the social and economic fallout likely to continue for decades, activists and academics have said.The 9/11 attacks triggered new security laws in the United States, and an extended campaign to root out terrorism worldwide which has had far-reaching consequences from the rise of surveillance technologies to refugee crises.A recent report by three US activist groups has claimed that tech giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft have made vast profits from US government contracts since the 9/11 attacks.Nearly 3,000 people were killed in the attacks on US soil.The Costs of War project at Brown University has calculated the actual cost incurred by the United States of America, both in monetary as well as humanitarian terms. Here's is a look at that:• The vast economic impact of the US post-9/11 wars goes beyond the Pentagon's "Overseas Contingency Operations", according to Costs of War project. It led to an expenditure of more than $8 trillion and caused about 900,000 deaths, according to its estimates.• At least 37 million people have fled their homes in the eight most violent wars the US military has launched or participated in since 2001 - including Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen, the Costs of War project said.• The true figure is likely to be as high as 59 million, the researchers said, noting the "incalculable harm" done to individuals, families, towns, regions, as well as to entire countries physically, socially, emotionally, and economically.• The US spent $2.313 trillion in operations in both Afghanistan and Pakistan since launching its military mission after the attacks in 2001, the researchers said. This was part of the overall budgetary costs it incurred in the post-9/11 missions.• They say the amount does not include funds that the US government is obligated to spend on lifetime care for American veterans of this war, nor does it include future interest payments on money borrowed to fund the war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/costs-of-war-this-is-how-much-us-spent-on-war-against-terror-post-9-11-attacks-101631334125392.html

The 1267 Committee is headed by India till December 2022.Resolution 2593 was passed by the UNSC under the presidency of India on August 30, 2021 with Russia and China abstaining from voting.Paragraph two of resolution 2593, which has become a mantra for the democratic world, clearly demands that Afghan territory should not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists or to plan or to finance terrorist acts. While reiterating the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan, the resolution also calls to take action against those individuals and entities designated pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999).While Taliban has not been designated as a terrorist organization, many of its leaders are under the 1267 list with Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani being the most prominent one. The head of Haqqani Network is designated both by UN and US Department of State and has a USD 5 million bounty on his head. Other prominent listed ones are: Abdul Haq Wasiq, head of intelligence; Mohammed Fazl, Deputy Minister for Defence; Khairullah Khairkhwa, Minister of Information and Broadcasting and Noorullah Noori, Minister for Border and Tribal Affairs. While Sirajuddin Haqqani remains in the shadows, the four others were released from Guantanamo Bay detention facility in exchange for a US Army deserter during the Obama regime.Violation of 2593 resolution will lead to UN sanctions on the Taliban government, particularly if the Sunni Islamist group provides safe havens to terrorists group like al Qaeda, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba or Tehreek-e-Taliban, Pakistan. All these groups have publicly sworn allegiance or Bayat to elusive Taliban chief Hibatullah Akundzada with JeM’s chief operational commander Mufti Abdul Rauf Azhar aka MARA personally meeting him in Kandahar last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsc-2593-is-mantra-for-delisting-taliban-shadowy-leaders-101631332467958.html
11-09-2021||World||Britain's Prince Andrew served with legal papers in sexual assault lawsuit||Britain's Prince Andrew has been served with a lawsuit by a woman accusing him of sexually assaulting and battering her two decades ago, when she asserts she was also being abused by the financier Jeffrey Epstein, according to a Friday court filing.In an affidavit filed with the US District Court in Manhattan, Cesar Sepulveda, identifying himself as a "corporate investigator/process server," said he left a copy of Virginia Giuffre's lawsuit on Aug. 27 with a police officer guarding the Royal Lodge in Windsor, England, a property Andrew occupies.The London-based Sepulveda said police had told him a day earlier they were instructed not to accept court documents on Andrew's behalf, but upon his return was told documents would be forwarded to the prince's "Legal Team."Police refused to let him see Andrew or to say where the prince was, he added.Spokespeople for Andrew said on Friday that his lawyers had no comment. A source close to Andrew's legal team said the prince had not been personally served.Andrew, 61, is one of the most prominent people linked to Epstein, charged by Manhattan federal prosecutors in July 2019 with sexually exploiting dozens of girls and women.Epstein, a registered sex offender, killed himself on Aug. 10, 2019, at the age of 66 in a Manhattan jail.In her lawsuit dated August 9, Giuffre said Andrew forced her to have unwanted sexual intercourse at the London home of Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite and Epstein's longtime associate. She also said Andrew abused her at Epstein's mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side, and on a private island that Epstein owned in the US Virgin Islands.In a November 2019 BBC interview, Andrew, who had been a friend of Epstein, denied Giuffre's claims of sexual abuse and said he did not recall meeting her. "I can absolutely, categorically tell you it never happened," Andrew said.An initial conference is scheduled for Monday afternoon before US District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan. Maxwell faces a scheduled Nov. 29 trial before a different Manhattan judge on charges she aided Epstein's sexual abuses. She has pleaded not guilty.In 2017, Maxwell settled a $50 million civil defamation lawsuit against her by Giuffre for an unspecified amount. Maxwell is not a defendant in Giuffre's lawsuit against Andrew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britains-prince-andrew-served-with-legal-papers-in-sexual-assault-lawsuit-101631331582441.html
11-09-2021||World||US honors 9/11 dead on 20th anniversary of attacks||America marks the 20th anniversary of 9/11 Saturday with solemn ceremonies given added poignancy by the recent chaotic withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and return to power of the Taliban.Heart-wrenching commemorations will unfold at each of the three sites where 19 Al-Qaeda hijackers -- mostly from Saudi Arabia -- crashed packed airliners, striking the cultural, financial and political hearts of the United States and changing the world forever.The memorials come with US troops finally gone from Afghanistan, but national discord -- and for President Joe Biden, political peril -- are overshadowing any sense of closure.In a video posted on the eve of the anniversary, Biden urged Americans to show unity, "our greatest strength.""To me, that's the central lesson of September 11th. It's that at our most vulnerable, in the push and pull of all that makes us human, in the battle for the soul of America, unity is our greatest strength," Biden said in a six- minute message from the White House.At New York's Ground Zero, where two pools of water now stand where the Twin Towers used to, relatives will read out the names of the nearly 3,000 people killed, in a four-hour-long service starting at 8:30 am (1230 GMT).Six moments of silence will be observed, corresponding with the times the two World Trade Center towers were struck, and fell, and the moments the Pentagon was attacked and Flight 93 crashed.Monica Iken-Murphy, who lost her 37-year-old husband Michael Iken in the World Trade Center, says this will be a "heightened" anniversary for many Americans.But for her, as for many other survivors, the pain has never wavered."I feel like it just happened," she told AFP.A whole generation has grown up since the morning of September 11, 2001.In the interim, Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden has been hunted down and killed. A towering new sky scraper has risen over Manhattan, replacing the Twin Towers. And less than two weeks ago, the last US soldiers flew from Kabul airport, ending the so-called "forever war."But the Taliban who once sheltered bin Laden are back ruling Afghanistan, the mighty US military humiliated. In Guantanamo Bay, accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other men continue to await trial, nine years after charges were filed.Even the full story of how the attack came to happen remains secret. Only last week did Biden order the release of classified documents from the FBI investigation over the next six months.- 'Honor and memorialize' -At Ground Zero, 2,753 people, from all over the world, were killed in the initial explosions, jumped to their deaths, or simply vanished in the inferno of the collapsing towers.At the Pentagon, an airliner tore a fiery hole in the side of the superpower's military nerve center, killing 184 people in the plane and on the ground.And in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the third wave of hijackers crashed into a field after passengers fought back, sending United 93 down before reaching its intended target -- likely the US Capitol building in Washington.Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will stop at each of these places on Saturday to "honor and memorialize the lives lost," the White House said.In his video address Friday night, Biden urged Americans to come together as they reflect on the tragedy."Unity doesn't mean we have to believe the same thing, but we must have a fundamental respect and faith in each other and in this nation," Biden said.The president had planned for this to be a pivotal day in his nearly eight-month-old presidency.However, instead of presiding over a moment of unity, Biden will traverse a country angry about the messy Kabul evacuation, which included 13 US soldiers killed by a suicide bomber, and stung by the broader realization of failure and defeat.For the relatives of victims, the anniversary, as always, is about keeping the memory of their loved ones alive."It's like Pearl Harbor," said Frank Siller, whose firefighter brother Stephen died at the World Trade Center."People who weren't alive don't have the same feeling about it as those who were alive. But America has never forgotten about Pearl Harbour and America will never forget about 9/11."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-honors-9-11-dead-on-20th-anniversary-of-attacks-101631330339473.html
11-09-2021||World||Ukraine says all-out war with Russia is 'a possibility'||Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday that an all-out war with neighbouring Russia is very much an ‘unfortunate’ possibility, but to prevent that he would first like to have a substantive meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. “I think there can be,” Zelenskiy said when asked at the Yalta European Strategy (YES) summit if there could really be an all-out war with Russia. “It's the worst thing that could happen, but unfortunately there is that possibility.”The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has been referred to as an “undeclared war” in the past, has rolled on for seven years and has already cost thousands of lives. It started when Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, a move yet to be recognised by several Western powers. The conflict later extended to Ukraine's east, where Moscow backs pro-Russian separatists at the Donbas region, with more troops (an additional 10,000, according to reports) amassing near the border. Kyiv says the conflict in eastern Ukraine has killed 14,000 people since 2014.“Ukraine has been ready for a long time,” said Zelenskiy, pointing out that the country had not yet received a clear answer to its request to join the Nato military alliance, a move that is almost certain to infuriate Moscow.“All-out war would be the biggest blunder on Russia’s part,” the Ukrainian president was quoted as saying in a report by the Independent online newspaper. “It’s a spooky scenario but unfortunately it isn’t unlikely. The danger is reaching a point of no return.”According to the Reuters news agency, Moscow has accused Ukraine of losing interest in peace talks, while Zelenskiy pushed in vain for a meeting with Putin in the conflict zone. “Honestly, I don't have time to think about him,” Zelenskiy said on Friday, referring to Russian president Putin. “I'm more interested in whether we can really meet substantively, not declaratively as he does with some states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-says-all-out-war-with-russia-is-a-possibility-101631324971098.html
11-09-2021||World||Now president, Joe Biden to mark 9/11 rite amid new terror fear||He will again make the ritual journey to sacred American landmarks of loss. He will once more bow his head in silent prayer. He will repeat words of comfort for those whose lives changed forever on that brilliant September day two decades ago.But this time, Joe Biden will hold the rank of commander in chief as he marks the anniversary of the nation's worst terror attack. Now, he shoulders the responsibility borne by previous presidents to prevent future tragedy, and must do so against fresh fears of a rise in terror after the United States' exit from the country from which the September 11 attacks were launched.This 9/11 comes little more than two weeks after a suicide bomber in Kabul killed 13 US service members as the military concluded its withdrawal from Afghanistan. And as Afghanistan returns to Taliban rule, there are fresh concerns that the country could again be a launching pad for attacks that Biden's government will be charged with preventing.But for Biden, like his predecessors, the 9/11 anniversary can also present an opportunity to try to reclaim the sense of national unity that followed the attacks, a spirt long since faded amid the country's divisive politics."For Biden, it's a moment for people to see him not as Democratic president, but as president of the United States of America,” said Robert Gibbs, who served as President Barack Obama's press secretary.“The American people are somewhat conflicted about what they have seen out of Afghanistan the last couple of weeks,” Gibbs said. “For Biden, it's a moment to try to reset some of that. Remind people of what it is to be commander in chief and what it means to be the leader of the country at a moment of such significance.”The president will commemorate the solemn anniversary on Saturday by paying his respects at the trio of sites where the hijacked planes struck, puncturing the United States' air of invincibility and resulting in the deaths of 3,000 Americans.While the ceremonies don't call for him to make public remarks, Biden released a video Friday to remember those who lost their lives, comfort their families and honour the courage and sacrifice of first responders and servicemembers over the last 20 years.He delivered an impassioned appeal for the nation to set aside its differences and reclaim the spirit of cooperation that sprung up in the days following the attacks.“Unity is what makes us who we are — America at its best,” Biden said. "To me that's the central lesson of September 11,” he added. “Unity is our greatest strength."First on Saturday for the president will be a stop in New York City, where the twin towers of the World Trade Center were toppled as a horrified world watched on television. Then, a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where a plane fell from the sky after heroic passengers fought terrorists to prevent it from reaching its Washington destination. And finally, the Pentagon, where the world's mightiest military suffered an unthinkable blow to its very home.Biden's task, like his predecessors, will mark the moment with a mix of grief and resolve. A man who has suffered immense personal tragedy, Biden speaks of loss with power and eloquence, and he has repeatedly addressed the grief caused by the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed more than 600,000 lives across the country.“We all remember distinctly that day and how much it's impacted us and has impacted us for the last several decades,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week. “That's true for him as well.” Afghanistan will shadow the day.Osama Bin Laden used that nation to mastermind the 2001 attacks, ushering in an expanded era of terror attacks on soft targets — hotels, office buildings, nightclubs — in cities across the West. Al-Qaeda was routed from Afghanistan in the months after September 11. But other groups have taken up the cause, including the Islamic State group in Afghanistan, believed to be responsible for the Kabul attack last month.Biden has long argued that the United States' military mission in Afghanistan was over, that the US needed to stop allowing its soldiers to die there. But for some, the return of the Taliban to power, and the terror threat it could produce, has made the 20th anniversary a bitter and worrisome one.Biden will be the fourth president to console the nation on the anniversary of that dark day, one that has shaped many of the most consequential domestic and foreign policy decisions made by the chief executives over the past two decades.The terror attack defined the presidency of George W. Bush, who was reading a book to Florida schoolchildren when the planes slammed into the World Trade Center.The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were still deadly when President Barack Obama visited the Pentagon to mark his first September 11th in office in 2009.By the time Obama spoke at the 10th anniversary, bin Laden was dead, killed in a May 2011 Navy Seal raid.President Donald Trump pledged to get the US out of Afghanistan, but his words during his first September 11 anniversary ceremony in 2017 were a vivid warning to terrorists, telling “these savage killers that there is no dark corner beyond our reach, no sanctuary beyond our grasp, and nowhere to hide anywhere on this very large earth.”On Saturday, as Biden visits all three sites, Bush will pay his respects in Shanksville while Obama will do the same in New York. Trump will be delivering ringside commentary at a boxing match at a casino in Hollywood, Florida, though he is planning to make at least one stop in Manhattan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/now-president-joe-biden-to-mark-9-11-rite-amid-new-terror-fear-101631326247476.html
11-09-2021||World||Vaccine or test: US Prez Biden makes big push for shots||In his most forceful action so far on the Covid-19 pandemic, US President Joe Biden on Thursday ordered sweeping federal vaccine requirements for as many as 100 million Americans - private-sector employees as well as health care workers and federal contractors - in an all-out effort to curb the surging Delta variant.Speaking at the White House, Biden sharply criticised the millions of Americans who are not yet vaccinated.“We’ve been patient. But our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us,” he said. The unvaccinated “can cause a lot of damage, and they are”.The expansive rules mandate that all employers with more than 100 workers require them to be vaccinated or test for the virus weekly, affecting about 80 million Americans.And the roughly 17 million workers at health facilities that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid also will have to be fully vaccinated.Biden is also requiring vaccination for employees of the executive branch and contractors who do business with the federal government - with no option to test out. That covers several million more workers.Children aged 12 or over who attend public schools in Los Angeles will have to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 by the start of next year, city education chiefs said on Thursday, the first such requirement by a major education board in the US.Meanwhile, Denmark’s high vaccination rate has enabled the Scandinavian country to become one of the first European Union nations to lift all domestic coronavirus restrictions.The return to normalcy has been gradual, but as of Friday, the digital pass - a proof of having been vaccinated - is no longer required when entering night clubs, making it the last virus safeguard to fall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-or-test-us-prez-biden-makes-big-push-for-shots-101631322962744.html

Beijing said the call took place on Washington’s request. The last time the two leaders had spoken was on February 12.“The US’s China policy has resulted in serious difficulties in bilateral relations and runs counter to the fundamental interests of the peoples in the two countries and the common interests of all countries,” Xi told Biden.Xi pointed out that whether “they (China and the US) can handle their relationship well bears on the future of the world, and it is a question of the century to which the two countries must provide a good answer”.Xi said the two countries should demonstrate “strategic vision and political courage”.A White House readout on the phone call said Washington and Beijing needed to ensure that “conflict” between the two countries is avoided. “President Biden underscored the United States’ enduring interest in peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and the world and the two leaders discussed the responsibility of both nations to ensure competition does not veer into conflict,” it said.The US, Biden reportedly said, looked forward to strengthening communication and cooperation with China on the climate crisis and other important issues.Earlier in the day, China-based Xinhua news agency reported that the two leaders held “candid, in-depth and broad strategic communication and exchanges” on bilateral ties.Besides frosty ties over a range of issues, from trade to human rights to transparency over the origin of the Covid-19 pandemic, the call between Xi and Biden took place in the backdrop of developments in Afghanistan where the Taliban group swept to power in mid-August.Chinese media quoted Biden as saying the US had no intention to change the “one-China principle”, and it was ready to engage in more exchanges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-and-xi-jinping-hold-first-call-in-seven-months-101631322877055.html
11-09-2021||World||The big names of 9/11: Where are they now?||The world is marking the 20th anniversary of September 11 terror attacks on the United States. Nearly 3,000 people were killed in the 9/11 attacks that forever altered world history.In these 20 years, a war was waged against terrorism, al Qaeda's Osama bin Laden was hunted down, and a new skyscraper replaced the Twin Towers (one of the sites of the attacks) in New York.Bin Laden, Hamid Karzai, George W Bush and Condoleezza Rice were some of the central figures in the chaos that followed the terror attacks in the US.Here is a look at the big names of 9/11 and where they are now:Osama bin Laden: The founder of al Qaeda, he became the face of terrorism since the attacks, sparking dread and bewilderment as to how he could orchestrate the attacks from the caves of Afghanistan. On May 2, 2011, in a mission code-named Operation Neptune Spear, US special forces hunted him down in Pakistan's Abbottabad and killed him.Hamid Karzai: He lobbied hard with the West to take action against the Taliban and al Qaeda. When the US uprooted the Taliban, he became president, until 2014. He survived assassination attempts and is still on the fringes of Afghan politics, taking part in power-sharing talks recently.George W Bush: The 43rd president of the US, he was informed of the attacks while reading "The Pet Goat" to second graders in Sarasota, Florida. He passionately spoke to the people of the United States that night, and later spearheaded the war on terror. He has long retired to oil painting in Texas. Recently, he said he was closely tracking the developments in Afghanistan.Dick Cheney: While the Secret Service played "hide the president" with Bush on September 11, the VP hunkered down in a bunker in the White House. After surviving five heart attacks, Cheney now the oldest living former US Veep.Condoleezza Rice: She was the National Security Advisor (NSA) to Bush when 9/11 took place. In the summer of 2001, she met with CIA director George Tenet to already discuss the looming threat of al Qaeda attacks on US targets. More recently, she became one of the first two women allowed to join the Augusta National Golf Club. She's now director of Hoover Institution at Stanford University.Rudy Giuliani: Mayor of New York City at that time, he was the hero of the moment. Oprah Winfrey called him "America's Mayor". Time magazine declared him Person of the Year. His recent misadventures as a Donald Trump supporter are well documented. They resulted in the suspension of his law licence.Colin Powell: He was the secretary of state in 2001. On 9/11, he was in Lima on an official visit. He went on to make a case before the United Nations for military action against Iraq, later drawing fierce criticism for it. He left the Republican Party after the January 6 assault on the Capitol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-big-names-of-9-11-where-are-they-now-101631323161191.html
11-09-2021||World||Denmark becomes only European country with no Covid-19 curbs||Denmark on Friday became the only European nation with no Covid curbs, losing a requirement to show vaccine passports to enter nightclubs as it cautiously embraces a return to normal.New infections have eased off in Denmark as vaccine rates have climbed, reaching over 70 percent of the overall population.But as the Scandinavian country looked ahead to a new post-pandemic reality, the WHO warned that vaccines alone may not end the pandemic and the virus could be around for years.One Denmark resident said the lifting of the last curbs was "liberating" after a tough pandemic slog."It's been a rough couple of years. I have three kids and we have had homeschooling and it's been a lot of hard days," Klaus Sylvester said."It's quite liberating that Denmark no longer has restrictions."The nightclub rule was the last in a long line of measures that Denmark has gradually lifted in recent months.It is now the only nation in Europe to have no restrictions in place after Iceland lifted all its measures in June, only to reimpose them after cases spiked again.Denmark introduced Covid passports in March 2021 as part of a gradual easing of rules.On August 1 it lifted the Covid pass requirement at museums and indoor events with fewer than 500 people, before ditching it for major events, while masks have not been required on public transport since mid-August.On Saturday, a sold-out concert in Copenhagen will welcome 50,000 people, a first in Europe."We are definitely at the forefront in Denmark as we have no restrictions," Ulrich Rum-Petersen, an event promoter, told AFP."We are now on the other side of the pandemic thanks to the vaccination rollout."Danish authorities insist the virus is under control, with around 500 daily Covid cases and a reproduction rate of 0.7.Vaccines have been swiftly rolled out, with 73 percent of the 5.8 million population fully vaccinated, and 96 percent of those 65 and older.- Cautious optimism -Optimism was tempered Friday as the World Health Organization's Europe boss warned that vaccines were not likely to end the pandemic for good.Instead, jabs will help prevent serious disease and death, though the virus is likely to be around for years to come as it mutates, said Hans Kluge."We should anticipate how to gradually adapt our vaccination strategy to endemic transmission and gather really precious knowledge about the impact of additional jabs," he told reporters in Copenhagen.Denmark made third doses available to vulnerable groups as of Thursday, and the health minister said vaccines played an important role in helping the country return to normal.But he struck a cautious note."Daily life is basically back to normal, but that doesn't mean there won't be any danger down the road," Magnus Heunicke said Friday."The virus has mutated several times, so I can't make any guarantees. But with this many people vaccinated, we are well set," he told Danish television TV2.Christian Nedergaard, who owns several restaurants in Copenhagen, said that while everyone is happy about the return to normal life, "the situation is still complicated"."The memory of coronavirus will fade very quickly from some people's minds but not for everyone, and for restaurants this period has for sure been a game-changer," he said.Karoline Heiberg, a 24-year-old Copenhagener, said she felt conflicted about the lifting of all restrictions."On the one hand I'm excited ... because I miss pre-corona life," she said."But on the other hand I don't feel quite safe" she said, especially "on public transportation, people cough all the time."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-becomes-only-european-country-with-no-covid-19-curbs-101631322091824.html

But at the moment, it’s contained to the family," said Palaszczuk.The surge in new cases comes as Australia struggles to contain the highly infectious Delta variant that threatens to push the country's economy into its second recession in as many years.The rise in cases sees Australia's two largest states and its capital in strict lockdowns as authorities seek to curtail infections while racing to vaccinate as many people as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cases-in-australia-s-victoria-state-hit-13-month-high-101631319664401.html
11-09-2021||World||Afghanistan situation ‘very fragile’, we are concerned: India at UNSC||Terming the situation in Afghanistan “very fragile”, India on Thursday called for a “broad-based, inclusive and representative” government in Kabul and stressed the need for the international community to rise above partisan interests and stand with the Afghan people.“The situation in Afghanistan continues to be very fragile. As its immediate neighbour and a friend to its people, the current situation is of direct concern to us,” India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador, TS Tirumurti, said at the UN Security Council Debate on Afghanistan.“We reiterate the need for the voices of Afghan women to be heard, aspirations of Afghan children to be realised and the rights of minorities to be protected. We call on humanitarian assistance to be provided urgently and underline the need to provide unhindered access to the UN and other agencies.”On the issue of the interim Cabinet that the Taliban have announced that includes several sanctioned names, Tirumurti stressed India’s call for an inclusive dispensation. “A broad-based, inclusive and representative formation attained through an inclusive negotiated political settlement would gain greater international acceptability and legitimacy,” he said.A day after Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, the United National Security Council issued a press statement saying that the territory of Afghanistan should not be used to threaten or attack any country.During his speech, Tirumurti said India was privileged to preside over the adoption of a “substantial and forward-looking resolution” of the UNSC during its presidency of the 15-nation body last month.The resolution “took into account some of our collective concerns, in particular on terrorism, where it has noted the commitment of the Taliban not to allow the use of the Afghan soil for terrorism, including from terrorists and terrorist groups designated under Resolution 1267”. It also “underlined that Afghan territory should not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts”, added Tirumurti, and cited the Kabul airport attack to say terrorism continues to threaten Afghanistan.He reiterated India’s long and significant contribution to the development of Afghanistan. “India’s emphasis has been on the welfare and well-being of the people of Afghanistan,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-situation-very-fragile-we-are-concerned-india-at-unsc-101631317744919.html
11-09-2021||World||How Biden, then a Senator, had reacted after planes flew into World Trade Centre on 9/11||US President Joe Biden, one of the most powerful men on the planet, was a Senator when the Al Qaeda terrorists attacked the twin towers of the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. In his memoir titled ‘Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics’, Biden has recounted the tragic day when he was serving as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.The Democratic senator from Delaware was on a train from Wilmington to Washington when two planes, hijacked by Al Qaeda terrorists, flew into the World Trade Centre, turning the twin towers into rubble. He was talking to his wife, now the First Lady, Jill Biden."Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.""Jill, what is it?""Another plane ... the other tower."Also Read | Myths perpetuated and busted in the 20 years since 9/11Moments after a third plane hit the Pentagon, Biden got off the train at Union Station from where he saw a brown haze of smoke in the sky, according to the memoir. He rushed to the Capitol and insisted that it was the safest place to be even as the buildings were being evacuated. Biden said he tried to enter the Capitol building but was refused entry by a police officer. At that point, he felt it was important to “show the country we were still doing business", as per the memoir.After 20 years, Biden will visit all three memorial sites to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks. He will visit ground zero in New York City, the Pentagon and the memorial outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the White House said last Saturday. He will be accompanied by Jill Biden, who was on phone with her husband on the fateful day when nearly 3,000 people were killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-biden-then-a-senator-had-reacted-after-planes-flew-into-world-trade-centre-on-911-101631298212770.html
11-09-2021||World||Myths perpetuated and busted in the 20 years since 9/11||In an article in the New York Times on February 20,2020, Sirajuddin Haqqani, the interior minister of Afghanistan and head of the globally proscribed Haqqani Network (HQN) group, propagated a myth by promising a consultative mechanism for “a new, inclusive political system in which the voice of every Afghan is reflected and where no Afghan feels excluded”. Today, two decades after the 9/11 terror attacks, Haqqani, a US-designated global terrorist with a $5million bounty on his head, is the interior minister of a hardline, exclusive, Taliban government in Kabul after the pusillanimous exit of the US forces and abject surrender by the US-trained Afghan forces.After spending more than $825 billion on military expenditure, $130 billion on reconstruction and losing at least 2,300 men in the war against the Taliban and al Qaeda since 2001, the US war against terror has come full circle — it has ceded power to those from whom it snatched power two decades ago. Worse still, there has been no material change on the ground. The 20-year military occupation of Afghanistan by US forces post 9/11 has shattered many myths, raising serious questions about the US’s future capacity and capability to exert influence on the world. The hasty and pathetic retreat from Kabul will have a serious reputational consequence for the US military and its feckless leadership. Here are some myths that lie brutally exposed with the sudden end of Operation Enduring Freedom, which was launched on October 7, 2001, in response to the twin-tower attacks in New York on 9/11.Also Read| 9/11: Decades after the attack, toxic dust still ails Americans1. Invincibility of the US military and forever warsThe war in Afghanistan is the longest war in the US history after Vietnam, which also ended in American defeat at the hands of an asymmetric force, the Vietcong, and an equally unceremonious exit from Saigon in 1975. Clearly, neither the occupying forces nor the occupied have any love for endless wars. Just as Afghan public support went down for the US forces over the years, the American military also lost the motivation to fight the enemy. India learnt this the hard way in less than three years (1987-1990) in Sri Lanka with nearly 90,000 troops deployed at its peak; the Soviet Union learnt the same lesson in 10 years in Afghanistan. Forever wars are untenable, and the Americans should have gone for a decisive knock-out punch of the Taliban and its affiliates rather than get drawn into a deliberate long-drawn battle.2. The Taliban won and America lostThe argument that a rag-tag sandals-and-black-turban wearing terror militia defeated the US in Afghanistan is fundamentally flawed. The fact is that the war was won by a duplicitous Pakistan, which successfully managed a high-risk act by overtly supporting the US in counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan, while its spy agency, the ISI, sustained the Taliban militarily through endless supply of rabid Sunni Islamist cadre, weapons, ammunition, intelligence, tactics, and medical support. Pakistan was both the problem and the solution and the US could never win till Rawalpindi, the headquarters of ISI, was humbled in battle. With Taliban leadership councils or shuras openly functioning in Quetta and Miramshah, and terror affiliates, HQN and al Qaeda, operating in Afghanistan from across the Durand Line separating the two countries, it was a tiring game. And the US did get tired in the end.Nearly a decade ago, in October 2011, then US secretary of state Hillary Clinton bluntly told the Pakistani leadership that it could not keep “snakes” in its backyard to strike its neighbours, even as she asked Islamabad to “squeeze” HQN for attacks on US forces in Afghanistan. Little did she know that the “backyard” she referred to was a pit full of assorted venomous snakes. If there was any doubt about ISI’s nexus with its demon child, that is comprehensively shattered last week when the current DG ISI Lt General Faiz Hameed flaunted his credentials like an imperial viceroy in Serena Hotel in Kabul to supervise military operations against resistance in Panjshir and to approve the Taliban cabinet.Also Read| 9/11: The end of the ‘forever wars’Former Indian foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal said: “The US war on terror began with a bang after 9/11 and has ended with a whimper. The Taliban were not forgiven for hosting Osama bin Laden but Pakistan which sheltered Osama for years got forgiveness. More than that, this war did not get extended to Pakistan which regenerated the Taliban and has been complicit in its terrorism. The US has rewarded Pakistan with strategic depth in Afghanistan, and at India’s cost. India has been a victim of cross border terrorism for over three decades. Beyond vengeance, if the war on terror was meant to uphold civilised values, these have been abandoned in the Afghanistan-Pak region. If the war on terror was to make the world safer, that expectation has not been met. “ It lies to the credit of ISI that the US paid over $35 billion to Pakistan, a unique payment for its deceit.3. Al Qaeda and Taliban have no truck with each other, and al Qaeda has been decimated in AfghanistanEven as US President Joe Biden declared closure of the mission in Afghanistan citing the completion of military objectives — decimating al Qaeda and killing its first chief Osama bin Laden — a US State Department report totally contradicted the US commander-in-chief. The quarterly report of lead inspector general for Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, released on August 17, stated that according to the State Department, the Taliban continues to maintain its relationship with al Qaeda, providing a safe haven for the terrorist group in Afghanistan. If this was not enough, a June report to the UN Security Council said that a significant part of the al Qaeda leadership resided in Afghanistan and just across the border in Pakistan. It said the primary component of the Taliban in dealing with the al Qaeda is the Haqqani Network with ties between two groups sealed on basis of ideological alignment, comrades-in-arms, and inter-marriage. The Biden fallacy was nailed when al Qaeda swore “bayat” (allegiance) to Taliban supreme leader Mullah Hibatullah Akundzada on August 31, while announcing global jihad against the US, Israel, and India. It is naive to assume that the US, with its intelligence-gathering capabilities, does not know that pan-Islamic terror groups morph into different identities for operational reasons, with one group deliberately propped up as the enemy for convenience. That enemy is now the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP), which any intelligence operative in India will say is an ISI creation and a conglomerate of disaffected cadres from al Qaeda, Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. The last ISKP emir Aslam Farooqui aka Mawlawi Abduillah was arrested by Afghan intelligence on April 4, 2020. He had past links with LeT and Haqqani Network. Farooqui was apparently killed after he was freed from Bagram prison after the Taliban swept to power.4. America was distracted by Iraq and Afghanistan, resulting in rise of ChinaA classified US National Defence Strategy report in 2018 stated that interstate competition, not terrorism, was the primary concern in US national security. The CIA now talks about shifting from counterterrorism to conventional intelligence or spying on other states such as China. It is a flawed argument on part of the US to blame the rise of China to its obsession with Iraq and Afghanistan.It was Washington itself that assiduously promoted the interests of Beijing by conjuring up fears of the Russian bear to make China into an economic and military power.Also Read| 9/11-related illnesses claimed more victims than attack: ReportThe much-trumpeted Asia Pivot of the Obama regime never fructified, and the US only woke up after China flexed its military muscle to turn the South China Sea into its backyard, militarily threatened Taiwan and Japan, and trained its missiles on a US base in Guam.China will now seize the opportunity presented by the US’s humiliating exit from Kabul and go for the global jugular through its proxies to become the pre-eminent superpower.5. Taliban has changed from its previous versionWith 17 out of 33 ministers in the Taliban cabinet designated as global terrorists by either the UN or the US or both, and with no women or minority representation, the myth propagated by Haqqani in the Left-liberal West lies in tatters. After two decades of fighting, the Taliban has become more radical and hardline as they believe they defeated the mighty US military (albeit with the help of Pakistan). This is also a result of shady US interlocutors cutting side deals with the Taliban leadership in Doha through the world’s worst (or best) brokers in Qatar and Pakistan with the help of the UK, whose military was brutally decimated in the 18th century by the ancestors of the present Sunni Pashtun force. The present Taliban regime will be the beacon for all affiliated terror groups, particularly in the Afghanistan-Pak region, and its continuation in power will accelerate the perception of diminishing US power with the latter’s own allies in West Asia and Asia questioning its credibility. Rising radicalism will further destabilise the world. It was Covid-19, with its origins in Wuhan, which dented the US economically, but it is the Afghan retreat that has hurt the perception of American military capability. Two decades after 9/11, the stage is set for China. And India should beware of the consequences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myths-perpetuated-and-busted-in-the-20-years-since-911-101631297395851.html
11-09-2021||India||Govt slashes edible-oil duties again as prices soar||NEW DELHI The Union government on Saturday slashed duties on edible oils to a decade’s low to ease prices at home, which have spiralled on the back of high global rates. The country meets two-thirds of its domestic demand for vegetable oils through imports. The government has “further reduced the standard rate of duty on crude palm oil, crude soyabean oil and crude sunflower oil by up to 2.5%”, a statement said. The standard rate of duty on refined oils of palm, soyabean and sunflower stands had been cut by 32.5% in a series of moves to make vegetable oils cheaper. In June, the government had cut duties on palm oil by 5% and lifted restrictions in the import of refined palm oil, as food inflation worries mounted. Edible oil prices have risen by up to 60%, according to data from the consumer affairs ministry from a year ago. Average costs of a litre of mustard oil rose to ₹170 in August compared to ₹120 a year ago. “It may be noted that the international prices and thereby domestic prices of edible oils have been ruling high during 2021-22 which is a cause of serious concern from inflation as well as consumer’s point of view,” a government statement said. According to an August report of the Food and Agricultural Organisation, global prices have rallied sharply in recent months due to bad crop in key producing nations and higher demand as economies reopened from Covid shutdowns. Higher food inflation not only impacts poorer households more, which tend to spend a larger share of their monthly budgets on food, compared to the well-off, but they also throw the Reserve Bank’s inflation targets off gear. Palm is one of the most widely consumed oils, which is found in everything from bread to ice-creams. Cutting import duties can lower prices instantly. Edible oil is India’s third most high-value import, after crude oil and gold. India typically imports from producers such as Malaysia, Indonesia Brazil, Argentina and Russia. Throughout June, the government was evaluating the price trends before taking a “decision” on cutting import duties, an official with knowledge of the matter said. The first cuts in tariffs came in June itself as global commodity outlook showed the high prices were likely to hold, the official said. “Prices are likely to slide only when summer harvests kick in by December. The duty cuts should bring down prices without much lag unless there is hoarding,” said Abhishek Agrawal, an analyst with Comtrade, a private commodity brokerage firm, adding retail prices should come down by at least ₹5. Currently, India’s levies on edible oil imports range between 32.5% (for palm oil, the cheapest edible oil) and 35% for soyabean oil. The country produces about 11 million tonnes of edible oil but consumption hovers around 24 million tonnes. According to official data, the share of rural and urban consumption in total is 3.8% and 2.7%. Much of the demand comes from commercial users, such as biscuit and snack makers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-slashes-edible-oil-duties-again-as-prices-soar-101631384589865.html
11-09-2021||India||Verdict given by Allahabad HC disqualifying then PM Indira Gandhi was judgment of great courage: CJI||The 1975 verdict of Justice Jagmohanlal Sinha of the Allahabad High Court disqualifying then prime minister Indira Gandhi on charges of electoral malpractices was a judgment of "great courage" that "shook" the nation, leading to imposition of Emergency, CJI N V Ramana said on Saturday.The Chief Justice of India (CJI), who along with President Ram Nath Kovind, took part in programmes, including the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Uttar Pradesh National Law University here and a new building complex of the Allahabad High Court, recalled the rich traditions and contributions of one of the oldest high courts in the country."In 1975, it was Justice Jagmohanlal Sinha from the Allahabad High Court who passed the judgment that shook the nation, when he disqualified Smt. Indira Gandhi. It was a judgment of great courage, which could be said to have directly resulted in the declaration of Emergency. The consequences of which I do not want to elaborate now,” Justice Ramana said.The CJI said that the Allahabad High Court has a history of more than 150 years and its Bar and Bench have produced some of the greatest legal luminaries in the country.The June 12, 1975, verdict delivered by Justice Jagmohanlal Sinha of the Allahabad High Court had convicted the then prime minister of electoral malpractices and debarred her from holding any elected post under the Representative of Peoples Act.The verdict is widely believed to have led to imposition of Emergency on June 25, 1975.Indira Gandhi had won the 1971 Lok Sabha election from the Rae Bareli seat in Uttar Pradesh by defeating her opponent Raj Narain.The defeated leader had challenged her election alleging electoral malpractices saying that Gandhi's election agent Yashpal Kapoor was a government servant and that she used government officials for personal election related work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/verdict-disqualifying-then-pm-indira-gandhi-was-judgment-of-great-courage-cji-101631381308940.html

11-09-2021||India||IMD predicts heavy rainfall in several states for next 3-4 days. Check details||After the Delhi-NCR region witnessed heavy rainfall on Saturday, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that the rainfall in the national capital will continue till Sunday morning. RK Jenamani, a senior scientist at the IMD, said that Delhi will again receive a fresh bout of rain from September 17."Heavy rainfall in Delhi will continue till tomorrow morning. It will cover Delhi-NCR, Punjab and Rajasthan. Systems over east Rajasthan and another forming over the Bay of Bengal are likely to intensify further. Delhi will receive a fresh spell of rain from September 17-18," news agency PTI quoted Jenamani as saying.The weather forecasting agency has also predicted “heavy to very heavy” rainfall for Mumbai, the rest of Konkan, and Western Maharashtra for the next three to four days. An orange alert has been issued for Raigad, Pune, Ratnagiri, Satara and Kolhapur, which means local officials should remain prepared if rainfall intensifies. On the other hand, a yellow alert for Mumbai, Thane, Wardha, Palghar and Sindhudurg districts. The residents of the rest of Maharashtra should expect ‘light to moderate’ rain in the next three to four days.“The low-pressure area developed in the Bay of Bengal is expected to get converted into depression and move north-north-west in next couple of days. It is expected to bring more intense showers over Western Maharashtra, Konkan including Mumbai region starting from Sunday,” an IMD official said.Odisha is also expected to receive heavy to very heavy rain in the next two days due to a low-pressure area formed over the Bay of Bengal.

11-09-2021||India||Probe report on Kozhikode air crash lists non-adherence to SOP by pilot as probable cause||The final probe report on the Air India Express Kozhikode air crash that took place on August 7, 2020 released by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) states the probable cause of the accident was non-adherence to the standard operating procedure by the pilot flying the aircraft. It also noted that the role of systemic failures as a contributory factor cannot be overlooked in this accident.“The probable cause of the accident was the non-adherence to SOP by the PF (Pilot Flying), wherein, he continued an unstabilized approach and landed beyond the touchdown zone, half way down the runway, in spite of ‘Go Around’ call by PM (Pilot Monitoring) which warranted a mandatory ‘Go Around’ and the failure of the PM to take over controls and execute a ‘Go Around’,” the report noted.On August 7, 2020 the Air India Express Boeing-737 plane repatriating Indians stranded in Dubai due to the pandemic overshot the runway in heavy rain, skidded off the table-top runway and broke into two parts after crashing nose-first into the ground. The flight was carrying 190 passengers and crew. It was the deadliest commercial aviation disaster in the country in 10 years and claimed 20 lives. Another Air India Express flight from Dubai overshot Mangalore’s table-top runway in 2010. It slid down a hill and left 158 people dead.On Thursday, Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said the final probe report on the Air India Express Kozhikode air crash that took place on August 7, 2020 that has been delayed for over eight months will be made public in a few days.HT On January 21 reported that the final probe report due for submission in January 2021 will be delayed by two months. A civil aviation ministry order, reviewed by HT, had granted a two-month extension to the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), the regulatory body in charge of the investigation, to submit the report. Following an extension till March the final probe report was finally released on September 11.The report noted that the investigation team is of the opinion that the role of systemic failures as a contributory factor cannot be overlooked in this accident.“A large number of similar accidents/incidents that have continued to take place, more so in AIXL (Air India Express Ltd), reinforce existing systemic failures within the aviation sector. These usually occur due to prevailing safety culture that give rise to errors, mistakes and violation of routine tasks performed by people operating within the system,” it said.The report noted the actions and decisions of the PIC (Pilot in Command) were steered by a “misplaced motivation to land back at Kozhikode to operate next day morning flight AXB 1373.”It also said the unavailability of sufficient number of Captains at Kozhikode was the result of faulty AIXL HR policy which does not take into account operational requirement while assigning permanent base to its Captains. There was only 01 Captain against 26 First Officers on the posted strength at Kozhikode.“The PIC had vast experience of landing at Kozhikode under similar weather conditions. This experience might have led to over confidence leading to complacency and a state of reduced conscious attention that would have seriously affected his actions, decision making as well as CRM (CREW RESOURCE MANAGEMENT),” it noted.The report also noted the possibility of visual illusions causing errors in distance and depth perception (like black hole approach and up-sloping runway) cannot be ruled out due to degraded visual cues of orientation due to low visibility and sub- optimal performance of the PIC’s windshield wiper in rain.“The AIXL pilot training program lacked effectiveness and did not impart the requisite skills for performance enhancement. One of the drawbacks in training was inadequate maintenance and lack of periodic system upgrades of the simulator. Frequently recurring major snags resulted in negative training. Further, pilots were often not checked for all the mandatory flying exercises during simulator check sessions by the Examiners,” it said. Nineteen passengers were fatally injured and seventy five passengers suffered serious injuries in the accident while ninety passengers suffered minor or no injuries. Both pilots suffered fatal injuries while one cabin crew was seriously injured and three cabin crew received minor injuries.The draft report was shared with the Accredited Representative appointed by the National Transport Safety Board of the United States of America. Relevant comments from them have been incorporated in the report, it noted.There was fuel leak from both the wing tanks; however, there was no post-crash fire. The aircraft was destroyed and its fuselage broke into three sections. Both engines were completely separated from the wings.The AAIB in August last year appointed a team of five investigators to lead the probe and submit a report within five months.AAIB director-general Aurobindo Handa appointed Captain SS Chahar, a former Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)-designated examiner for pilots of B737NG aircraft, as the investigator-in-charge tasked with completing its inquiry and submitting the report.He was assisted by Operations Expert Ved Prakash, Senior Aircraft Maintenance Engineer-B737 Mukul Bhardwaj, Group Captain Y S Dahiya, Aviation Medicine Expert, and Jasbir Singh Larhga, Deputy Director AAIB.The bureau’s role is to conduct an independent aircraft accident investigation, obtain a preliminary report to assist in setting up a committee of inquiry in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organisation rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/probe-report-on-kozhikode-air-crash-lists-non-adherence-to-sop-by-pilot-as-probable-cause-101631378887977.html

The two really think CM stands for Chairs Musical," Trinamool leader Derek O'Brien tweeted.The Aam Aadmi Party said the BJP is scared of the AAP in both Uttarakhand and Gujarat. "AAP enters Uttrakhand, presents a robust & effective opposition to ruling BJP. BJP compelled to remove its CM. AAP breaches BJP's citadel, wins 27 seats in Surat, captures the space of opposition in Gujarat dislodging ineffective Congress. BJP forced to remove its CM," AAP leader Raghav Chadha said.All BJP-ruled states are suffering from deep-seated infighting inside the party, Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said. "This shows the failure of PM's and HM's leadership. If their anointed CM, Vijay Rupani has failed Gujarat and its people after 5 years, the onus must lie at the doorsteps of Modiji. Time to rid Gandhi-Patel’s ‘Karambhoomi’ of the machiavellian BJP & its leadership," Surjewala tweeted."In the election states, people have made up their mind to change the BJP government, but they are constantly changing the Chief Minister to mislead the people. No matter how many Chief Ministers they change, the people have made up their mind to change the BJP itself!" the Indian Youth Congress tweeted in Hindi. Vijay Rupani on Saturday made the unexpected announcement of his resignation, which is being seen as BJP's governance overhaul drive, a part of which was executed in the recent Union cabinet reshuffle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-stands-for-chairs-musical-trinamool-aap-congress-react-to-vijay-rupani-s-exit-101631375699407.html
11-09-2021||India||India raises return of students with Australia||India on Saturday raised with Australia the issue of problems faced by Indian students wishing to travel to Australian campuses because of existing Covid-19 restrictions and asked for the issue to be addressed as soon as possible. Students from India have faced problems since last year in travelling to several countries, including China, the US, Canada, Germany and Australia. This issue was raised by external affairs minister S Jaishankar with his Australian counterpart during the first India-Australia 2+2 dialogue of defence and foreign ministers. Jaishankar said in his opening remarks at a media interaction following the meeting that he specifically took up with Payne problems faced by Indian students in Australia and “those wishing to go to Australia as well as the Indian-origin community” there. He added, “I urged that the difficulties faced by the students due to travel restrictions be sympathetically addressed as soon as possible.” Replying to a question on the same issue, Jaishankar said the government had heard a lot from the students and that “their frustrations, their feelings are completely understandable”. He said the matter was discussed in some detail and Payne had “shared with me what is Australia’s thinking about when students would be able to come”. Payne described herself as an “enthusiastic proponent” of welcoming the “much-loved Indian students back into the Australian education system as soon as it is possible”, and noted that there are currently more than 60,000 Indian students in her country. Research and modelling done by the Australian government has led to a four-phase pathway for the country’s Covid-19 response and progression out of restrictions. Once enough Australians have been vaccinated, the government will begin reopening and students will be able to return in phases three and four, she said. “There is shared desire on both sides to see that travel resumes between our countries as soon as it is safe to do so and I look forward to being one of the people at the airport to welcome the first arrivals of Indian students coming back to Australia,” Payne said. Jaishankar noted that India had been having “some problems” regarding the travel of students with “some other countries”. He said, “We had [problems] initially with the US, we are still having some issues with Canada. So I do want the students of the country and [their] parents...to know that it is something we take as a very high priority and take up very, very vigorously with our foreign partners.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-raises-return-of-students-with-australia-101631377027579.html
11-09-2021||India||Afghanistan’s soil must not become safe haven for terrorists: India, Australia at 2+2 meet||India and Australia on Saturday insisted Afghanistan’s soil must not become a safe haven for terrorists or be used for attacks on other nations, even as they called for steps to ensure an inclusive governing structure in Kabul and the safe departure of people wishing to leave the war-torn country. At the conclusion of the inaugural India-Australia 2+2 dialogue of defence and foreign ministers, the two sides asserted that their bilateral partnership and cooperation in groupings such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad was focused on ensuring an open and inclusive Indo-Pacific and not aimed at any country. Remarks by defence minister Rajnath Singh, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and their Australian counterparts, Marise Payne and Peter Dutton, at a media interaction following the meeting made it evident the situation in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover on August 15, and mounting concerns about terror emanating from Afghan soil were a major part of the discussions. The significance of the meeting being held on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US – an event that triggered the American invasion of Afghanistan – wasn’t lost on the ministers. Jaishankar said in his opening remarks this was a reminder of the importance of “combating terrorism without compromise”, and India appreciates the value of global cooperation given its location close to the “epicentre” of terror. In her opening remarks, Payne said: “Last month did see the fall of Kabul and along with the ongoing fight of terrorism, the future of Afghanistan remains a central concern to both of our countries.” Jaishankar said in response to a question that UN Security Council resolution 2593 emphasises “Afghanistan must not allow its soil to be used in any manner, by anybody for terrorism”. Payne added: “We do share a very strong interest in ensuring that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for the breeding or the training of terrorists and that is an abiding concern of the international community.” The two sides, Jaishankar said, have concerns about the “inclusiveness of the dispensation” in Kabul, the treatment of women and minorities, the travel of Afghan nationals and humanitarian aid. Payne said Australia’s focus is on seeking safe passage for its citizens, foreign nationals and visa holders of other countries who want to leave Afghanistan. “We are very conscious of the impact of violence and breaches of human rights on the Afghanistan community and again would call for those fundamental human rights to be observed,” she said. The Taliban takeover exacerbated issues that were already affecting the Afghans, such as a drought and significant internal and external displacement of citizens, and international organisations such as UNHCR should be allowed unimpeded access to provide humanitarian support, she added. Payne, who is also Australia’s minister for women, spoke strongly for the rights of Afghan women and girls. Australia worked for two decades to ensure such rights, including in education and participation in the workforce, were preserved and the international community must now ensure these rights are “not wound back”, she said. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that developments in Afghanistan were a key part of separate meetings held by the foreign and defence ministers. The Indian side also raised its concerns about terrorism from Afghan soil and Pakistan’s backing for the Taliban at all the meetings, the people said. Jaishankar’s reference to the Taliban setup in Kabul as a “dispensation” was an indication the Indian side is in no hurry to accord any recognition to the interim cabinet formed by the group this week. Responding to another question on the Chinese side referring to Quad as an “Asian NATO”, Jaishankar said this is a platform for India, Australia, Japan and the US to cooperate for the benefit of the world, and such a description amounts to a misrepresentation of reality. “I think a term like NATO is very much a Cold War term, looking back. I think Quad looks [to] the future, it reflects globalisation [and] the compulsions of countries to work together,” he said. There is no relationship between issues the Quad is focused on – such as vaccines, supply chains, education and connectivity –and NATO, he added. Payne said the Quad champions Asean centrality and has a “positive and practical agenda” that includes Covid-19 vaccines, climate change, critical technologies and countering “dangerous disinformation”. She added, “Our constructive engagement in an informal diplomatic network is overwhelmingly about contributing positively for that open, inclusive and resilient region in which we all want to live.” The four ministers asserted that India and Australia are committed to bolstering cooperation across the Indo-Pacific to ensure a free and open region based on a rules-based order and to improve coordination for maritime security and information-sharing. Singh said the two sides discussed institutional frameworks for collaboration in defence and fighting the pandemic, and emphasised the need to ensure free flow of trade and adherence to international rules. “On bilateral defence cooperation, we decided to expand military engagements across services, facilitate greater defence information-sharing and to work closely for mutual logistics support,” Singh said. Dutton described India as a “rising Indo-Pacific great power” and an “increasingly significant security partner for Australia”, and said the bilateral logistics support arrangement enabled Australia to airlift oxygen to India during the second wave of Covid-19 infections this year. He said he and Singh had agreed on new initiatives to further defence ties and engagement between the armed forces. Australia will invite India to participate in the Talisman Sabre exercise and continue to participate in India’s Malabar naval exercise along with the US and Japan. The two sides agreed to reinforce each other’s maritime domain awareness through increased information-sharing, and Australia will increase its defence diplomatic representation in New Delhi to support coordination on maritime security and greater information-sharing, Dutton said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghanistans-soil-must-not-become-safe-haven-for-terrorists-india-australia-at-2-2-meet-101631373727332.html

11-09-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: Sept 11, 2001 — America under attack: Thousands feared dead in multiple terrorist strikes on US cities||Washington- Fortress America was breached today by the world’s most spectacular terrorist attack. In the first of a series of coordinated attacks, two hijacked planes crashed into and levelled New York’s 110-storey World Trade Center. In Washington DC, another hijacked aircraft wrecked parts of the Pentagon and a car bomb damaged the State Department. Thousands of people are feared dead. US President George Bush said the explosions were an “apparent terrorist attack” and said “terrorism against our nation will not stand”. He promised the US would hunt down those responsible. A Boeing 767, also believed to have been hijacked, also crashed in western Pennsylvania. The attacks began shortly before 9 a.m. local time (2 p.m. EST), when two hijacked passenger planes flew directly into the upper floors of the World Trade Center towers in the heart of New York’s financial district. Shortly afterwards in Washington DC an aircraft hit the helicopter pad at the Pentagon. One side of the five-sided US military headquarters collapsed and there are an unknown number of casualties. A third explosion in New York an hour after the initial crashes brought the south tower of the World Trade Center crashing to the ground. A witness said he saw bodies falling from the towers and people jumping out. Minutes later, the Center’s north tower also collapsed. “I just saw the building I work in come down,” said businessman Gabriel Ioan, outside City Hall, with a cloud of smoke and ash from the World Trade Center behind him. “I just saw the top of Trade Two come down.” The ash was two to three inches deep in places. People wandered dazed and terrified. Senator Chuck Hagel said: “This is the second Pearl Harbour. I don’t think that I overstate it.” Authorities had been trying to evacuate the 50,000 people who work in the twin towers. New Yorkers have been told to head to the north of the city away from the disaster zone, and bridges and tunnels in Manhattan have been closed amid fears of further attacks. Subway lines were shut down and trading on Wall Street suspended. The Federal Aviation Administration said it was diverting transatlantic flights headed for the US to Canada after earlier grounding all flights in response to the attacks in New York and Washington. Thousands of people have been evacuated from the White House and all other government and public buildings in Washington DC and New York, including the Treasury, the White House, the UN headquarters and the State Department. Chicago has also begun evacuations. Other US cities are on alert. Borders with Canada and Mexico have been sealed. An Arab journalist said that bin Laden had warned of an unprecedented attack against the US a fortnight ago. From Abu Dhabi there was a report that a Palestinian group had owned responsibility but the group later denied these reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/american-under-attack-thousands-feared-dead-in-multiple-terrorist-strikes-on-us-cities-101631369227554.html
11-09-2021||India||‘Concern about inclusiveness’: Jaishankar on Afghanistan dispensation||External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said there is a concern about the inclusiveness of the dispensation, about the treatment of women and minorities in Afghanistan as he stated Afghanistan was a key issue of discussion in the India, Australia 2+2 dialogue."We had a detailed exhange of views on Afghanistan with Australia," the minister said adding that the views of the two countries are very similar and can be summed up by United National Security Council Resolution 2593. "...which emphasises most of all that Afghanistan must not allow its soil to be used in any manner by anybody for terrorism," the minister said in what is the first statement coming from India after the Taliban announced their interim government on Tuesday this week, under the leadership of Supreme leader Akhundzada.First formal diplomatic contact between India, Taliban: Safe return of nationals a priority"But apart from that, there is a concern about the inclusive of the dispensation, concerns about the treatment of women and minorities, matters related to travel of Afghans, issues regarding humanitarian assistance. So, it is an evolving situation," the foreign minister said, without naming the Taliban.Australian foreign minister Marise Payne too said the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is being seriously watched by the international community. "For 20 years, we have worked for the people of Afghanistan," the minister said.India has maintained a ‘wait and watch’ stance on the question of recognising the present government in Afghanistan, like the international community. It emphasised time and again that the focus at present is to help Afghans.The interim Cabinet announced by the Taliban has drawn criticism from the United States which pointed out the fact that the cabinet does not include women and mostly comprise known faces of the Taliban leadership. The inclusion of sanctioned Haqqani members Sirajuddin Haqqqani and Khalil Haqqani has also drawn criticism. Over a dozen of members in the Cabinet are sanctioned, reports claimed. To this, the Taliban took objection and urged the United States to remove these names from its sanction list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concern-about-inclusiveness-jaishankar-on-afghanistan-dispensation-101631368085677.html
11-09-2021||India||Caste and Covid-19, the two reasons for Vijay Rupani’s ouster||Gujarat on Saturday joined the list of states where the Bharatiya Janata Party leadership at the Centre opted to change the state leadership ahead of the assembly elections. After Karnataka where Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa was replaced by Basavaraj Bommai ahead of the 2023 elections and Uttarakhand where the incumbent Trivendra Singh Rawat was first replaced by Tirath Singh and later by Pushkar Dhami, Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani on Saturday announced his resignation. Both Gujarat and Uttarakhand will pick new assemblies in 2022.Among the reasons cited by party leaders for the 65-years old Rupani’s replacement are his response to Covid-19 and his caste. The Jain CM’s performance in facing the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and failing to build cohesive political support for the BJP which still faces challenges from the Patidars, a community with immense political power that can swing electoral outcome, were stated as key determinants in the decision.A change of face a little over a year ahead of the elections is expected to blunt anti-incumbency in the state. The term of the 182 member assembly ends in February 2023.A senior party leader based in Delhi said the change should not be attributed to Rupani’s performance but is part of the BJP’s policy of fostering newer leadership. “The BJP believes in leadership development process whereby newer people are given a chance to be in charge. In Gujarat that is what has happened… it’s a generational change. New leaders will take over the charge with enthusiasm,” said the functionary.However, a section of party leaders also said the resignation is an indication that the central command is not inclined to go to polls with incumbent leaders in states where public perception is not in their favour.“Even though the chief minister carried forward the development agenda that was set by Prime Minister Modi when he was the chief minister of the state there were many issues that could be attributed to for this change. The first and foremost being the state’s response to the Covid-19 challenge,” said a second leader. He went on to add “…Since he also did not meet the criterion that was arrived at after doing the electoral calculations the party decided that he should be replaced and a newer person given charge till elections.”The central leadership that included general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh and Union minister and state in-charge Bhupendra Yadav held a series of meetings with the state party leaders in the past few months to get an insight into the public sentiment against the CM.In April this year, the High Court of Gujarat took a serious view of the state‘s preparedness for the pandemic and said the manner in which the government had dealt with the challenge was “not satisfactory and not transparent”.There was uproar over the lack of oxygen supply in hospitals that led to deaths, hospital beds were also in short supply.Rupani, a non Patidar leader had replaced Anandiben Patel in 2016 in the aftermath of the agitation by the politically powerful Patidar community that was rallying for being brought under the ambit of the castes based on quotas. He was sworn in for a second term after the party won the 2017 assembly elections even though there were reservations among the state leaders on his elevation.The party has been concerned over the state unit leaders losing hold over the electorate. In 2017 when the party returned to power it won just 99 of the 182 seats down from the previous election’s 115. Later, the Aam Aadmi Party‘s performance in the Surat municipal Corporation rang alarm bells again. The party has officially dismissed the AAP‘s emergence in the state, but it is aware of the simmering discontent among the Patidars over the delay in taking back cases that were filed against those booked in the 2015 agitation, said a third leader.This is not the first time that Rupani‘s credentials as a leader have been called into question. After the 2017 election a section in the party was not inclined to support his candidacy as chief minister and had preferred Nitin Patel for the top job. “The two names that were proposed in 2017 were Nitin Patel a powerful leader of the Kadva Patels, and the Leuva Patel leader Jitu Vaghani who also has clout among the Patidars but was later made the party chief. The choice of a non Patidar CM was seen as an unorthodox move, but had support from the PM and Amit Shah and he was the RSS’s pick as well,” said the third leader.Political commentator Ghanshaym Shah said there was pressure from the party cadre and the Patidar community to change the Chief Minister. “The party cadre had relayed to the central leadership the need to have the Patidars on their side so the change can be attributed to this pressure,” he said.On the speculation that the party could favour moving the assembly elections to the first half of 2022 to coincide with five other states including Uttar Pradesh; a senior election commission official said, elections can be held ahead of scheduled only if the term of assembly is set to expire in the next six months. In this case, since elections are 15 months away, polls ahead of schedule will only be possible if the state assembly is dissolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/caste-and-covid-19-the-two-reasons-for-vijay-rupani-s-ouster-101631368266945.html
11-09-2021||India||When can Indian students return to Australia for studies? Ministers answer||Union foreign minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said that detailed discussions were held between him and his Australian counterpart Marise Payne regarding when Indian students can return to Australia for their higher studies at Australian universities.The Australian foreign minister said that it is following the modelling suggested by Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity and after the Australian government vaccinates its citizens to a certain level it can take a decision on reopening in a manner that will allow foreign students to return to Australian campuses where they have enrolled for studies.“Our response in Australia has been based on research and modelling suggested by the Doherty Institute and that gave us a four-phase pathway in terms of our response to Covid and our progression through and out of the restrictions in place. We are on our way to vaccinating Australians to a level which will give us the confidence to reopen in a manner that will enable students to return in phase 3 and phase 4. There is a shared desire on both sides to see that travel resumes,” Payne said at the press conference held after the India-Australia 2+2 ministerial meeting.Jaishankar said the problems with students returning to their universities or joining universities in courses they have taken admission in are not limited to Australia but with the US and Canada as well. He said that problems have been sorted out to some extent with the American authorities but some problems remain to be solved with regard to the Canadian government. He further added that these issues which concern higher education in foreign countries are being taken on high priority by the Centre.“The frustrations felt by students and their parents are completely understandable. Students would like to be in the institutions where they were studying or were already studying. We discussed it in some detail today. Minister Payne also told me what Australia thinks about this situation,” Jaishankar said.Australian foreign minister Payne also said that she is one of the ‘most enthusiastic proponents of welcoming our much-loved Indian students’ back to Australia. “We are ready to welcome back Indian students as soon as possible. The diaspora is present and very much active where I live and where I work (Western Sydney). We miss their engagements sincerely,” Payne said.Payne also said that there are over 60,000 students in Australia. “I do definitely understand the desire that students have for on-campus and in-country experience. The Covid-19 restrictions have impacted travel to and from Australia, even for Australians themselves. Even ministers like us have to comply with quarantine restrictions,” Payne said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-can-indian-students-return-to-australia-for-studies-ministers-answer-101631365452886.html

11-09-2021||India||Rains threaten kharif crops, onion prices||Moisture-propelling weather patterns across India have re-activated the monsoon system again, flooding several states and risking key summer-sown or kharif crops, including onion, a widely consumed price-sensitive food item. A cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal, dumping heavy rainfall in West Bengal, moisture drafts due to a low-pressure formation over northern states and a rainy trail across Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha has flooded large parts of several states, endangering crops. Rice fields in many districts of the food bowl states of Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh have gone under water, growers said, while Delhi witnessed historic rains on Saturday. A monsoon going into hyperactive mode in a month when it should begin tapering off could bring misery to the farm sector, which supports half of India’s population. The India Meteorological Department, the national weather agency, in an alert on Saturday said there could be “damage to horticulture and standing crops in some areas due to inundation”. After hampering planting of summer-sown crops such as soybean, rice, cotton and vegetables due to a long dry spell from mid-June to mid-July, flooding has now affected crops in states such as Uttarakhand, parts of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh. Lower yields or output can stoke food prices, as job cuts post Covid-19 has impacted nearly one million Indians, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a private data firm. “Onions, a staple in most Indian households, are likely to make consumers cry again with erratic monsoon leading to an eventual delay in harvest,” Crisil Ltd, a ratings firm, said in a research note Saturday. Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are major onion-producing states, accounting for over 75% of total summer onion output. Although harvest time is a month away, Crisil Ltd’s “on-ground report” said onion seed transplantation suffered critical lags due to on-off rains, potentially delaying the time onion crop takes to mature. Summer onions account for no more than 30% of India’s annual supply, but they are critical to prices stability because they replenish supplies during the lean September-November, period. Experts hold that longer dry spells followed by short periods of heavy rainfall are tell-tale signs of a changing climate’s impact on the monsoon, which waters 60% of the country’s net-sown area. “If heavy rainfall persists, yields may be affected, although mild rainfall in September is beneficial,” said Ashok Renjen, a former agronomist with Punjab agriculture department. The IMD on Saturday forecast “fairly widespread” rainfall with “isolated heavy to very heavy falls”, which correlates to hazardous rainfall, in many states until September 14, especially in parts of Konkan and Goa, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha. While rice planting stood at normal levels for the current week, at 106 million hectares, farmers have sown oilseeds over 17 million hectares, which is also considered normal, according to official data. Pulses, another essential basket of legumes, have been sown over 13.9 million hectares, marginally higher than normal. “Standing water could cause crops to wilt,” said Gambhir Singh, a farmer from Haryana’s Babbain region, speaking in Hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rains-threaten-kharif-crops-onion-prices-101631361846891.html

The 65-year-old Rupani was sworn in as the chief minister for the second time in December 2017. "I was allowed to serve the state for five years. I have contributed to the development of the state.

One gives the baton to the other.”Rupani, who is from the Jain community which has around 2% population in the state, said the Bharatiya Janata Party will decide about who will be the next Gujarat chief minister as he denied that he had any differences with state BJP president CR Patil. There is speculation that his successor may be from the Patidar community.Vijay Rupani first became the Gujarat chief minister on August 7, 2016, after the resignation of incumbent Anandiben Patel and continued in the office after the BJP's victory in the 2017 assembly elections.

11-09-2021||India||Key numbers show economy is finally turning; here’s how to read them||Saturday’s numbers around the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) – a measure of economic activity – suggest the economy is finally turning. On an annual basis, the index expanded 11.5% in July. Over last month, it grew 7.2%. In other words, the metric continues to grow and is now at pre-pandemic levels. First off, what is the IIP and how good a measure is it of economic growth? The IIP is a composite indicator. It’s a number, and the rate at which that number increases, expressed as a per cent, measures short-term changes in the quantity of production of a basket of industrial products during a given period. How much factories raise output of goods by – that’s is an important dipstick for many other indicators, such as demand, people’s spending levels and future demand. Demand can only pick up when consumers get access to money, either as income or credit. The IIP measures sub-indices for primary goods (for instance, bread), capital goods (machinery), intermediate goods (say, a mobile-phone chip) and infrastructure and construction goods (like cement). Further, the sub-indices also measure the output of consumer durables and consumer non-durables. Manufacturing is a key sector tracked. For instance, the latest data show that consumer durables output rose 19.5% in July on a month-on-month basis. This is a slowdown from a rise of 31.2% in June but confirms that white goods continue to be in expansion mode. These are signs of factories humming again. The abatement in Covid infection rates are the biggest reason for the uptick, and barring another wave, things should look good. However, the green shoots continue to mask the underlying weaknesses from a Covid double blow. About 2.5 crore rural households demanded unskilled, menial jobs under the make-work rural jobs guarantee programme, MNREGA, in August, official data show. The government was able to provide paid work to only 1.6 crore households under the programme, which points to a lack of enough supply of jobs (funding) to meet demand. A proprietary gauge of manufacturing activity in August fell, compared to the previous month, suggesting industrial output has yet to stabilise. The IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) came in at 52.3 in August, compared to 55.3 in July, an IHS media statement said. A PMI number above 50 is indicative of economic expansion. This means that manufacturing is picking pace. An area of concern is employment. Unemployment in August rose 8.32% from 6.95% in July, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy or CMIE. Mounting unemployment will pile more pressure on the Modi government if economic expansion doesn’t correlate to more jobs, which is not always the case. In any jobs survey, people with jobs are categorised as employed. People without jobs but looking for work are considered unemployed. The labour force participation rate is simply equal to people who are employed plus people who are not employed. In a rough-and-ready sense, the unemployment rate is then simply the number of unemployed divided by the total labour force times 100. Capital-intensive growth, for instance, a scenario where automation drives profits, can lead to fewer jobs being added to the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-numbers-show-economy-is-finally-turning-here-s-how-to-read-them-101631354947495.html

The Medicine From the Sky project will be taken up on a pilot basis in 16 green zones in Telangana and later scaled up on the national level based on data, Scindia said. “This 'Medicines from the Sky' project will be taken up in 16 green zones. The data will be analysed for three months. We along with the health ministry, IT ministry, state government and the Centre will together analyse the data and make a model for the whole country. Today is a revolutionary day not only for Telangana but for the whole country,” the minister said.Scindia said the new drone policy brought out by the NDA government at the Centre recently eased rules regarding drone operations in the country by reducing the number of forms that need to be filled to operate them from 25 to 5 and the type of thefee charged from the operator from 72 to 4. While no permission is needed to fly drones under the green zone, a nod is needed in the yellow zone but red zones are no-fly areas.Scindia said the drone policy was envisaged under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The minister added that an interactive aerospace map is being prepared and various zones are being earmarked with the help of states.The Medicine From the Sky project is an initiative of Telangana in partnership with the World Economic Forum, NITI Aayog, and HealthNet Global of the Apollo Hospitals. The Medicine From the Sky project was launched on experimental Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) drone flights for the delivery of vaccines using the identified airspace of the Vikarabad district.From Saturday, BVLOS drone flights will travel a distance of 9-10km and carry consignments of vaccines, medical samples and other healthcare items. According to reports, trials of delivering medicines and vaccines using drones began from Thursday under the Telangana government's ambitious 'Medicine From The Sky' project. The trial flights are to be conducted till October 10 at Vikarabad and a majority of them will be by tech start-up Skye Air Mobility, PTI reported earlier.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/medicines-from-the-sky-drones-to-deliver-vaccines-drugs-in-telangana-101631351421934.html
11-09-2021||India||CPM’s Brinda Karat underscores significance of women’s reservation bill in conversation with HT||This Sunday, it will be 25 years since the first time the Women’s Reservation Bill was introduced in Parliament. The bill which proposed to amend the Constitution of India to reserve 1/3rd of all seats in the Lok Sabha and state assemblies for women was introduced by the Deve Gowda government in 1996. There were four attempts to do so but it was only passed in Rajya Sabha during the UPA government in 2010, with both Congress, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Left parties pushing it through. However, since then, it has lapsed as regional parties, and even critics within the Congress and the BJP, have stalled its passage. HT’s Sunetra Choudhury spoke to CPM’s politburo member and former MP Brinda Karat about whether this proposed law is still relevant and why women need quotas in politics. Here are the excerpts from the interview. Q: Has anything changed since then?Karat: Well, I remember that day 25 years ago. We were all so happy and we really felt that it was going to usher in a mechanism to fill the gap between men and women, and just the following day, this issue came on the reservation raised by the BJP MPs at the time, and from then to 2021, there have been so many excuses - from obviously a parliament or government or governments who have not thought it to be top on the agenda and that is the reality. Q: We remember those images very clearly of you and Sushma Swaraj, all holding hands outside Rajya Sabha because the bill had been passed. How is it that you had the Congress and the BJP, two major parties, supporting this and yet it seems impossible?Karat: I don’t think it’s impossible at all, it just requires political will. Now, for example, both the Congress and the BJP had many sections within their parties, as you rightly say, which oppose the bill. The TMC at that time abstained from the bill, that was also a very unexpected gesture because if you remember, there were a lot of histrionics by TMC MPs in the Lok Sabha but when it came to the actual passage of the bill, they abstained from it. But the political will was also shown by the Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha. If you recall, there were very ugly physical attacks which were sought to be made on the minister, and women of all parties stood as sort of a wall around him. The person just behind me stood on the table and smashed the glass and was bleeding on the table next to me. But at the end of the day, there was a political will that ensured that the bill was discussed, debated and then adopted. So, the first issue here is why is the present government, with such a strong majority and having promised the bill in 2014, not pushing for it? Change the constitution, destroy a state like Kashmir, everything they can do with that majority but why have they not used that majority to get the Women’s Reservation Bill passed? So, the first question is, if the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Modi government have the political will to get this bill through? I think no. And there are many reasons for that. One of the reasons is also a kind of a cultural framework in which they operate. One of the objections before the OBC reservation within the reservation was if you bring more women into politics you’re going to destroy the ideal family. Because every woman will then have the ambition to be in the public life, and what’s going to happen to the ideal family? Which represents our Sanskriti, which represents our civilisation, our women whose main job is to bring up children, preferably sons. What is going to happen to all of that? So, there are cultural reasons also within the BJP’s ideology which baulks at bringing legislation as a right for women to be at least one-third. So, I say today, it’s good you have 78 women, it’s the highest Indian Lok Sabha has ever had, but it’s still just 14.4 per cent. If you would have the bill, there would be 180 women in the Lok Sabha. So where are the missing women? And why are they missing? That’s the issue.Q: Would you like to remind people exactly what kind of role each party played?Karat: Firstly, I think it’s positive that regional parties, such as the TMC, the Biju Janata Dal, the YSR Congress, have been successful in giving a better representation to women compared to the national parties. If you look at the Lok Sabha now, actually it is the regional parties who have given a much representation to women. And as far as the Left is concerned, although we did have much improved numbers of candidates in the last Lok Sabha election, as you can see, we didn’t win the seats, so we have only one member in the Lok Sabha right now which is the worst we have ever had. So, certainly, as far as regional parties including TMC is concerned, it is better, but you have to look at the national perspective. And these parties within their own states, for their own reasons, are within their own parties. Allegiance to the leader, for example, is a very important part of regional parties but if you look at the national perspective, that is why these parties play a completely different role when it comes to parliament. So the point is, there are differences within parties, but unfortunately because of those differences it’s not just women who suffer, I would say, it’s democracy that suffers. Q: The other thing you talked about, the bleeding arm of the MP who was trying to protest, it’s interesting to see that Parliament has always had strident protests like we witnessed recently.Karat: That’s absolutely true, and also it requires the commitment of the chair to push through legislation, and I am sure that the present Speaker, if he was given an opportunity by the party in power to steer the reservation bill through, would be strong and committed enough to do it. But the question that I again raise is, why is the BJP government not even listing it in its agenda of business? I mean, we talk about being the vishwa guru but unfortunately but fare badly on a measure of social justice for women. Out of 193 countries, when women’s representation in the lower house is concerned, the elected parliament, we are at the 135th or 136th spot, I mean that’s a pretty shocking statistic, isn’t it?Q: But why didn’t the UPA push for it between 2010 and 2014?Karat: No, they didn’t have the numbers. If they worked hard enough to get the numbers, as they did for many other reservations. So, again I think, numbers was an issue at that time for UPA 2 because they were dependent on certain parties which were not in favour of the women’s reservation bill. The kind of political leadership that was required to push it through, they failed at that. And you know their default was to set up a UPA committee, have a select committee, let’s have another select committee. I mean they have had 3 committees on the women’s reservation bill. I don’t think any other bill has gone through that torture process. And if you look at another figure, Sunetra, how long is it going to take? People ask me every often, why do you want legislation? Aren’t you notorious enough to get people representation? A lot of women feel why are we people asking for quotas et cetera? Look at this figure - in the 1st Parliament of India after Independence, where women had come out in such large numbers, we had 24 women. That’s in 1952. In 2019, when the last elections were held, we got 78. So if it takes 73 years to get about 50 more women in parliament, how many years is it going to take to reach one-third reservation without a quota?Q: The government is very proud of the fact that they have two cabinet ministers, top ministers, including the finance minister, as women and seven new ministers who have now come into the council of ministers. Surely, even if it is tokenism, it counts for something, doesn’t it? Karat: Certainly. There’s no doubt about it. To increase the number of women and to show that women are more than capable of taking responsibility in higher places, certainly has an important message for the country. The question that I raise is - what are these women doing, as far as women’s reservation bill is concerned? Why are they not raising their voices? I remember in their own party there was a Sushma Swaraj, there was a Najma Heptulla, cause she shifted from the Congress to the BJP, but even in her position in the BJP I remember Sushma Swaraj; how she fought for that bill against many in her own party. So, we can have some really fundamental differences, oppositions and be on opposite sides of the barricade on so many other major issues, but on the women’s reservations bill, why are these women ministers, who have shown that they are more than capable of following their government policies, why are they not expanding the framework of their work to challenge those who are not bringing the bill, why? That will be meaningful. One is that it’s very good, at least I think, to have more women in public life, it certainly pushes the envelope for women in a patriarchal society, there’s no doubt about it, but the second aspect is also the policies that you follow. You need to push a wider agenda. Q: Do you think in the last 25 years things have become easier for women in politics? Karat: I certainly do. And I think having around 50% of women in local bodies through the reservation quota, I think that has made a huge difference in rural India. And I don’t go for this proxy politics kind of a thing, cause there is proxy politics where there’s class, where there’s caste, where there’s gender, that blotch on our democracy is there, but why I am so convinced that reservation in parliament and assembly is so important for democracy is because we have seen the way India has really set a record for the whole world in 50% reservation for women at local body level. And women have gained that confidence and I think its a chain reaction, women voters, making their needs and requirements known to political parties, women voters voting independently, women seeing representation growing at the local level in the rural areas of India, in the villages, in the urban local bodies. So in the last 20 years, there has been a tremendous increase of women in public life and the patriarchal conservative orthodox framework that women are best suited in homes, we have seen a huge change in that in the last 20 years. And we have to salute the women of India and that is why it is all the more criminal, I use that word advisedly, it is criminal to have a huge majority and not want to take India’s democratic process forward but block it by blocking the bill.Q: My final question, why is it that 25 years later, the women’s reservations bill is still relevant?Karat: I believe that the power of patriarchy is bad for everyone, it is bad for men, women and for Indian society. And the will of patriarchy is being reflected in the blockages, the blockade of the women’s bill. So, the first point is, bring the women’s bill, it does weaken the patriarchal process, patriarchal attitudes and that can only be good for social justice. Secondly, I believe if you bring more women into parliament and have more women in public spaces, it also helps to make that public space less unequal. And I think that is also a good thing for Indian democracy. And the third joint is, within the women’s reservation bill, there are reservations for Scheduled Tribe and Scheduled Caste women, and I believe that reservation for Scheduled Tribe and Scheduled Caste women will strengthen the role of women not only in those communities but will set an example for the rest of India who may be so elitist to think that there is only a particular set of women who can be in parliament and can be a leader. So, this gives the opportunity to a much larger range of women politicians. So all in all, it would be very useful, helpful to strengthen the process of Indian democracy.

The President was welcomed at the Bamrauli airport by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and governor Anandiben Patel. Keshav Prasad Maurya, the deputy chief minister of the state, MP Rita Bahuguna Joshi, and other local MLAs were also present to welcome the president at the airport.President Ram Nath Kovind lays foundation stone of Uttar Pradesh National Law University and Advocates Chambers, Allahabad High Court in Prayagraj UP CM Yogi Adityanath & UP Governor Anandiben Patel were also present at the event pic.twitter.com/Xhie6wojouThe new Allahabad high court complex includes a multi-level parking facility, an advocate chamber library, and an auditorium. According to the Uttar Pradesh government, the building complex will have around 2,600 chambers for the lawyers of the court. Around 6,00 crore rupees have been released for the entire project.Speaking at the foundation-stone laying ceremony, the President said that timely and cheap justice in the common man's language is “our responsibility”.“Lawyers and litigants face problems due to the lack of infrastructure in the judiciary,” the President said. “I have seen the struggle of the poor seeking justice. Proper infrastructure and the judicial appointment will ensure that justice is imparted on a timely basis.”The Uttar Pradesh National Law University is being constructed in the Jhalwa area of Prayagraj. Referring to the varsity, the President said that the NLU must be built in accordance with guidelines that were designed after studying the very best law universities in the world. Union law minister Kiren Rijiju, Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, and other senior judges also graced the foundation-stone laying ceremony today with their presence. After the President unveiled the plaque for the institution, Union minister Rijiju said that Prayagraj is the center of culture and education and emboldens the spirit that the judiciary must always remain independent in its approach.“We want India to be the center of arbitration and mediation of the world,” he said. “Speedy and timely delivery of justice to the common man is our target. I ensure that the central government is working with all its might to strengthen the judiciary.”Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath welcomed all the guests present at the event, which included the President of India, UP governor, the CJI, the law minister, other judges of the Supreme Court, and senior officials. He said that a demand for a separate law university and a multi-level parking facility was being raised for years. “Prayagraj is the land of ‘Dharma’ and about 24 crore people depend on Prayagraj for justice,” he said. “The state government will fully cooperate in the National Law University project.”The Chief Justice of India, NV Ramana, addressed the event in English and talked about the city's role in the freedom struggle. Pointing out that he is privileged to be in the land of Triveni, the CJI congratulated all the staff of the Prayagraj administration. Quoting Gandhi, he said, “What is really needed to make a democracy function is not knowledge or facts, but right education.”Notably, this is the second time in two weeks that the President has made a visit to the state of Uttar Pradesh. President Kovind had earlier on August 26 gone on a four-day visit to the state by a special train, inaugurating multiple projects in the process. In late June, he had visited his ancestral village of Paraukh in the Kanpur Dehat district of Uttar Pradesh and interacted with old friends from his school days and his early days of social service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-kovind-in-prayagraj-lays-foundation-of-law-university-high-court-complex-101631345232648.html

An announcement regarding this was made during a joint press conference by farmers leaders and Karnal administration after a meeting where administration accepted most of the demands of the protesters.“After discussions, we have collectively decided to call off the protest here (outside mini-secretariat),” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) and farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni.The farmers had launched the protest on September 7 against the police action last month in which 10 farmers were injured.At the press conference, which was held after fourth round of meeting between both the sides, Haryana additional chief secretary Devender Singh promised a judicial enquiry by a retired judge of the high court into the August 28 violence when several protesters were lathicharged while heading towards Karnal to protest against a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) meeting. Singh said the probe report will be submitted within a month.The officer also announced government job (against a vacant post) to the next kin of the farmer Shushil Kajal, who the farmers claimed died due to police action. "Farmers are our brothers," said Singh.Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha, who was allegedly heard in a video giving instruction to policemen to "break heads" of the farmers if they breached the security cordon, will remain on leave during the investigation, Singh added. The farmers demanded FIR against the IAS officer and the cops on duty, but today agreed for a judicial probe."We have now taken a legal opinion and found that judicial enquiry is better option than the FIR. And the FIR will be registered later if he was found guilty in the investigation," said Charuni, who also addressed the joint press conference.Though Singh or any other official did not announce any compensation for those injured in August 28 violence, farmer leaders claimed that government has agreed to it.The farmers launched their indefinite protest at the main entrance of Karnal's mini-secretariat. It was led by Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a platform of farm unions spearheading the protests against the agricultural laws since November last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnal-farmers-agree-to-end-protest-after-administration-agrees-to-their-demands-101631341799127.html

The spirit of his speech has the potential to create a more just, prosperous and inclusive planet.”The Prime Minister shared Swami Vivekananda’s speeches at the World's Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893, attaching a link to the official website of Belur Math.Recalling Swami Vivekananda’s iconic 1893 speech at Chicago, which beautifully demonstrated the salience of Indian culture. The spirit of his speech has the potential to create a more just, prosperous and inclusive planet. https://t.co/1iz7OgAWm3Here's the full text of Swami Vivekananda's iconic 1893 speech at Chicago, courtesy of Belur Math:RESPONSE TO WELCOMEAt the World’s Parliament of Religions, Chicago, 11 September 1893"Sisters and Brothers of America,It fills my heart with joy unspeakable to rise in response to the warm and cordial welcome which you have given us. I thank you in the name of the most ancient order of monks in the world; I thank you in the name of the mother of religions; I thank you in the name of the millions and millions of Hindu people of all classes and sects.My thanks, also, to some of the speakers on this platform who, referring to the delegates from the Orient, have told you that these men from far-off nations may well claim the honour of bearing to different lands the idea of toleration. I am proud to belong to a religion that has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance. We believe not only in universal toleration, but we accept all religions as true. I am proud to belong to a nation that has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of all religions and all nations of the earth. I am proud to tell you that we have gathered in our bosom the purest remnant of the Israelites, who came to southern India and took refuge with us in the very year in which their holy temple was shattered to pieces by Roman tyranny. I am proud to belong to the religion which has sheltered and is still fostering the remnant of the grand Zoroastrian nation. I will quote to you, brethren, a few lines from a hymn which I remember to have repeated from my earliest boyhood, which is every day repeated by millions of human beings: ‘As the different streams having their sources in different places all mingle their water in the sea, so, O Lord, the different paths which men take through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee.’The present convention, which is one of the most august assemblies ever held, is in itself a vindication, a declaration to the world, of the wonderful doctrine preached in the Gita: ‘Whosoever comes to Me, through whatsoever form, I reach him; all men are struggling through paths which in the end lead to Me.’ Sectarianism, bigotry, and its horrible descendant, fanaticism, have long possessed this beautiful earth. They have filled the earth with violence, drenched it often and often with human blood, destroyed civilization, and sent whole nations to despair. Had it not been for these horrible demons, human society would be far more advanced than it is now. But their time has come; and I fervently hope that the bell that tolled this morning in honour of this convention may be the death-knell of all fanaticism, of all persecutions with the sword or with the pen, and of all uncharitable feelings between persons wending their way to the same goal."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-recalls-swami-vivekananda-s-iconic-chicago-speech-here-s-what-he-said-101631335598787.html

11-09-2021||India||36th Rafale to get India specific enhancements||France will deliver three Rafale fighters a month to India for the next three months with the last of the 36 contracted omni-role fighters carrying all 13 India specific enhancements to be delivered in January 2022, HT learns.While 26 of the 4.5 generation fighter jets are already operational from Ambala in the western sector and Hashimara in the eastern sector, three more Dassault-manufactured fighters will be landing at Jamnagar base after refuelling mid-air over UAE on October 13. Three more are expected to be delivered in November and another three in December.However, it is the 36th Rafale fighter that will be equipped with all India specific enhancements to make the platform more lethal. India specific enhancements have been included in Hammer air to ground, SCALP land attack and Meteor air to air missiles used by Rafale with more range, and accuracy, but it is only after the 36th fighter has landed after testing all India specific enhancements with some technologies having Israeli origins that the previous 35 fighters will be fitted with all the enhancements.While the India specific enhancements remain classified, they are understood to be related to a more powerful radio altimeter, radar warning receiver, low band jammer, flight data recorder, high-altitude engine start-up, synthetic aperture radar, ground moving target indicator and tracking, infra-red search and track, helmet-mounted display, missile approach warning systems and very high-frequency range decoys.France, one of India’s closest strategic allies, has already sent the enhanced missiles and ammunition for Rafale to IAF. While the Meteor missile is best in its category in the Indian subcontinent, the Hammer and SCALP have pinpoint accuracy with last-minute target adjustment capability and radar avoidance. These weapon systems have multiple guidance facilities so that the enemy has no chance of jamming the missile either in the air to air or land-attack mode; they can be used in stand-off mode for land targets over 70 kilometres away.While the Indian Navy is also believed to be examining the option of a Rafale-Maritime fighter for its indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, to be launched next August, IAF has been asked to rationalize its fighter squadron strength due to the enhanced capability of Rafale.Experts say that one squadron of Rafale is equivalent to 2.5 squadrons of Russian Su-30 MKI in terms of turnaround and maintenance. IAF’s capability will further be multiplied with the addition of the S-400 air defence system to the Indian fighting capability, they add.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/36th-rafale-to-get-india-specific-enhancements-101631318098099.html

If you raise such allegations against Kannur University, you can raise similar charges against Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi also. V D Savarkar is included in the syllabus of JNU also,” he told the media.Members of various student unions burnt copies of the books on Thursday, prompting state higher education minister R Bindhu to seek a report from the V-C. “This is a sensitive issue. I have sought details from the V-C. I feel that such content is not good,” Bindhu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-leaders-books-in-varsity-syllabus-fan-row-101631317102592.html
11-09-2021||India||After ‘positive talks’, farmers say Karnal impasse may end||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Friday said the third round of talks with the Karnal district administration over the August 28 police action on farmers concluded on a “positive” note and hinted that the ongoing impasse may end by Saturday. The SKM is a platform of farm unions spearheading the protests against the agricultural laws since November last year. Neither the farmer leaders nor government representatives disclosed what was discussed in the meeting which lasted for more than four hours. The farmers, however, said that most of their issues pertaining to the police clashes last month were resolved and that only two or three were left for discussion in the next round of meeting on Saturday. “The meeting was very positive and we are expecting that this issue might be resolved in the next meeting at 9 am on Saturday,” farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni said. Haryana additional chief secretary Devender Singh, who presided over the meeting, also said the talks with farmers proved to be positive and that another meeting was slated for the weekend.The development comes at a time when farmers have been staging an indefinite protest at the main-entrance of Karnal’s mini-secretariat since September 7 against the police action last month.Several protesters were lathicharged while heading towards Karnal to protest against a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) meeting on August 28. Around 10 farmers were injured in the incident. Soon after, a video had surfaced in which IAS officer Ayush Sinha was allegedly instructing policemen to “break heads” of the cultivators if they breached the security cordon at the BJP meeting.Among other issues, the farmers have sought the suspension and registration of an FIR against Sinha, who was later transferred out of Karnal and posted as additional secretary of Citizen Resources Information Department (CRID).At Friday’s meeting, the government assured to initiate action against the IAS officer, according to people familiar with the development. The farmers also sought compensation of ₹25 lakh and a government job to the kin of farmer Sushil Kajal, who they claimed died due to police action, and financial assistance of ₹2 lakh each to the injured farmers besides free treatment in government hospitals.Charuni said the farmers will hold a discussion with other senior SKM leaders on Friday night and all issues are likely to be cleared during Saturday’s meeting.After two meetings with the protesters failed, the state government had sent Singh for talks with a 13-member delegation of farmers led by Charuni on Friday. The SKM had called a meeting of all senior leaders at Karnal on September 11 to announce a ‘big decision’ if their demands were not met. “As the talks were positive, the decision about SKM’s meeting for further course of action will be taken on Saturday morning,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) spokesperson Rakesh Bains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-positive-talks-farmers-say-karnal-impasse-may-end-101631315516875.html
11-09-2021||India||Don’t hold rallies till polls are declared: SKM to Punjab parties||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a joint forum of 32 farm organisations leading the protest against three controversial central laws, on Friday asked political parties in Punjab to not hold election rallies as it adversely impacted the campaign by cultivators, suggesting that poll speeches should start only after the elections are announced in early 2022.However, three key political parties, Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), disagreed with the proposal.“They will face the music if they refuse to accept our appeal and it will be considered as anti-farmer,” announced BS Rajewal president of a faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was not called for the meeting.“I think a gathering of up to 300 persons is fine for an event by a political party or the government,” he said, adding that in case Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh holds public rallies, he would also face opposition. The announcement was made after one-to-one meetings with the leaders of the political parties.After disruption of its rally in Moga last week by farmers, SAD approached SKM for talks. The latter, then, decided to hold meetings with all the parties.“SKM should retain the national character of the Kisan Andolan by not imposing restrictions on political activities ,” suggested SAD’s Rajya Sabha MP Balwinder Singh Bhundar. Former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra, spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema and Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal were part of the Akali Dal delegation.“We appeal to the SKM to reconsider its decision,” said AAP MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan. MLAs Baljinder Kaur and Aman Aroa and former NRI wing convener Jagtar Singh Sanghera accompanied him for talks.SKM also asked the Congress government to withdraw cases against farmers and not force them to submit land record for the procurement of food grains from the upcoming crop of paddy, starting from October 1. State party chief Navjot Singh Sidhu assured them that he will take it up with the government. Working president Kuljit Singh Nagra and general secretary Pargat Singh were also part of Congress team.Congress Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and ex-MP Ranjit Singh Brahmpura also met the farm leaders..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-hold-rallies-till-polls-are-declared-skm-to-punjab-parties-101631303102239.html
11-09-2021||India||Punjab to send unvaccinated govt employees on compulsory leave||Punjab on Friday announced that government employees without even one Covid-19 jab for any non-medical reasons will be compulsorily sent on leave after September 15, becoming the latest in a handful of states to attempt a mandatory vaccine mandate.A government statement said chief minister Amarinder Singh took the “strong measure” to protect the people of the state and ensure that vaccinated people do not pay the price for continued vaccine hesitancy.“Special efforts are taken to reach out to government employees, and those who continue to avoid getting vaccinated will now be asked to go on leave till they get the first dose,” the chief minister said at a a high-level virtual Covid review meeting.Till Friday, Punjab had administered nearly 15.9 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, of which 12,039,477 were first shots and 3,826,637 were second. This translates to roughly 53% of the state’s adult population having received at least one shot of the vaccine, which puts Punjab among the bottom 10 of India’s states. For comparison, 59% of India has received at least one shot of the Covid-19 vaccine.Singh also ordered the extension of existing Covid-19 restrictions till September 30, with a limit of 300 on all gatherings and strict enforcement of masks as well as social distancing.Earlier, the number of people allowed for indoor gatherings was 150 and outdoors was 300.He also allowed teaching and non-teaching school staff with at least one dose more than four weeks ago to resume duties, subject to submission of weekly RT-PCR Covid-negative test reports.However, people with co-morbidities will be allowed once they are fully vaccinated. Health minister Balbir Sidhu suggested the gap for the second dose to be reduced for school staff to 28 days.However, chief secretary Vini Mahajan informed the meeting that the Centre had rejected the state’s request.Citing the latest sero-survey, the chief minister said that for children between 6 and 17, the sero positivity was at 60%, and it was higher in the age bracket of 14-17. He also directed the health department to ensure that all staff at sweetshops, kiosks and dhabas was vaccinated with at least one dose.Earlier this year, the governments of Manipur and Mizoram tried to enforce a mandatory vaccine regime.In June, Mizoram said only vaccinated individuals should be engaged for manning shops and stores or undertaking any work, and only these people should be allowed to step out of houses.In July, Manipur proposed to prioritise the opening of institutions, factories, shops and offices where employees were vaccinated. MizoramBut both proposals were struck down by the high courts, which viewed these conditions as inimical to freedom of choice and expression, and said it would trample upon the freedom of the individual to get vaccinated or choose not to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-to-send-unvaccinated-govt-employees-on-compulsory-leave-101631302682116.html

11-09-2021||India||Bengaluru: Girl sets out on foot to meet grandparents 270 km away||In their quest to track the 15-year-old girl, who was missing her grandparents and set out on foot from Bengaluru to a village in Kodagu to meet them, the Bengaluru police on Friday said it analysed over 250 CCTV cameras. During her journey on foot, the girl lost her way and was reunited with her family after two weeks.“The painstaking efforts of the PI (police inspector) and the staff of the Banashankari PS in tracing a 15-yr-old orphan girl who was missing are praiseworthy. The girl left Bengaluru and decided to walk 270 km to meet her grandparents in Kodagu. She lost her way after walking for 20km and the police tracked her in 8 days after analysing the footage from 250 CCTV cameras,” Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant said in Twitter post on Friday. According to police, the 15-year-old left home on the morning of August 21. “She had lost her parents at a young age and she was living with relatives in Bengaluru since 2020. After her parents’ death, she was raised by maternal grandparents in Kodagu district and she was very close to them,” said a Banashankari police station official. Recently she had expressed her wish to return to her grandparents since she was not happy living in Bengaluru. However, the elderly couple insisted on her stay in Bengaluru for her education. Unable to convince her grandparents or relatives to take her back, she had decided to walk to Kodagu, the official said. Soon after this, the relatives of the girl filed a complaint with the police who then began searching for her. “We started looking at the CCTV cameras in the area. In total, we scanned through the footage of at least 250 cameras in the location. We first spotted her on a camera walking on Mysuru Road. So, we followed her on multiple CCTV cameras and found that she was near Kengeri. We couldn’t trace her after that,” said HP Puttaswamy, inspector at Banashankari police station. Meanwhile, after walking for hours, hungry and lost, she knocked on the door of a random house off Mysuru Road. A woman in the house took her in and fed her. “The girl explained the entire situation to the woman and asked her not to inform police since they would send her back to her relatives. And the woman agreed,” said the police officer. The girl was in the house for eight days. The police working on the input from the CCTV footage started doing a door-to-door enquiry to locate the girl. “We had reached the area where the girl was. It was during this time, the woman who had given her shelter came forward to inform the police that the girl was with her,” said the officer. Police who suspected harassment from the relatives counselled the girl. She however insisted that they didn’t cause any problem and that she started walking because she wanted to meet her grandparents. The girl was taken to a rehabilitation centre near Nimhans and was later reunited with her grandparents, who took her to Kodagu on September 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengalurugirl-sets-out-on-foot-to-meet-grandparents-270-km-away-101631300522189.html

11-09-2021||India||Residents mark Ganesh Chaturthi amid uncertainty over festive days||Even as people were seen visiting temples to get a glimpse of the deity and take part in the festivities, confusion continues to engulf the Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations in Karnataka and across Bengaluru as the Basavaraj Bommai government is yet to clarify on the number of days the festival will be allowed. Bommai on Friday said that he has asked revenue minister R Ashok to speak with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to get a clarification on the issue. However, the BBMP has stated that it will decide on a “case-by-case” basis on where it can allow the festival to go on for five days. The civic body, however, maintained that the celebrations, according to the government orders, are limited to just three days. “In Bengaluru it has always been three days, but the government order said that the outer limit (of the city) is five days,” Randeep D, the special commissioner (health) and BBMP’s zonal commissioner (Mahadevapura) said on Friday. He added that the BBMP expects all public celebrations to end by three days but that the officials will take a “reasonable call” based on specific requests. The oral statements with no written order have fueled confusion among the people in Bengaluru where Ganesh Chaturthi will be celebrated in a muted manner for a second year in a row due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the impending third wave of infections. Amid the uncertainty and gloom, a temple in Bengaluru decorated itself with eco-friendly items, which caught the eyes of several devotees.We celebrate it (Ganesha festival) every year and this temple is very famous for all those decorations. Every year they have a different concept. This year it is corn and last year I guess it was grapes,” said one devotee at the Sri Sathya Ganapathi Temple in Bengaluru. The temple was decorated with nine different types of flowers, corn, banana and pineapples. The corn was hung from the ceilings and droned the pillars of the temple. “Actually this year we got the news from government on Monday so that we can do Alankar (decorations) only in the temple and not outside. Otherwise, we would have installed a 30 feet high Ganesh idol with different types of items ,” Mohan Raju, the former deputy mayor of Bengaluru said on Friday. He added that after the three-day celebrations, the fruits will be removed and given back to devotees to avoid any of it going for a waste. Though there were strict guidelines mentioned at the entrance of such temples across the state, people inside were seen moving around freely and at times in violation of Covid norms. Members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Thursday had stormed into the BBMP headquarters in Bengaluru to protest the city administration’s decision to reduce public celebration of Ganesh puja to three days. VHP workers also carried a large Ganesh statue with them that they placed in front of the city administration headquarters in protest. “The government will not decide how we will practice our religion and they will not decide how we will keep out Ganesh idols. We will continue to do what has been practiced so far. I don’t follow the government’s order, I will only follow what my parents and gurus have taught me,” said Shashi Kant, one of the VHP workers who stormed into the BBMP headquarters, Hindustan Times had reported. Ashok, on September 6, had announced after a meeting with the chief minister, officials and other experts, that the government has approved five days, starting September 10, to celebrate Ganesh festival. People were seen thronging markets and other busy areas of the city as festival shopping took precedence over the threat of contracting the infection in Bengaluru which is home to almost a quarter of Karnataka’s over 70 million population. The entire locality of KR Market, one of Bengaluru’s busiest business spaces, was abuzz with people all jostling for festival-related shopping. The government was forced to cede to the demands of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators and other right wing groups who demanded that there be no restrictions on the celebration of “Hindu festivals”. Ashok had earlier said that the celebrations will be permitted only in taluks or administrative units where the Covid-19 positivity rate is lower than 2%. The government had also restricted orchestra, cultural programmes and processions during these five days. The Karnataka government in an order, specifying extension of guidelines for surveillance, containment and caution on Thursday night stated that the Covid-19 situation had been on the decline. “The state as a whole has an average case positivity rate of 0.73% and the districts have a case positivity rate of less than 2%. Hence, to sustain the substantial gains that have been achieved due to stringent containment measures, there is a need to continue with the existing measures along with focused surveillance, testing-tracking-treatment, vaccination, micro containment measures, and strict adherence to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” the order stated. It further stated that guidelines for extension will be in force up to 6 am on September 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/residents-mark-ganesh-chaturthi-amid-uncertainty-over-festive-days-101631300163386.html

11-09-2021||India||JD(S) to hold key meet amid discord murmurs||The Janata Dal (Secular) is scheduled to meet on Monday, the first of the 10-day session of the state legislature, not only to discuss the party’s strategy but also to decide the next course of action against growing discontent within its ranks.In the last few weeks, the party’s top leadership was seen making scathing remarks against at least three of their legislators that include GT Deve Gowda, SR Srinivas (Vasu) and now K Srinivas Gowda who represent Chamundeshwari, Gubbi and Kolar constituencies respectively.Considering the party has just 32 legislators out of the 225 seats in the state legislature, possibility of a disciplinary action and growing discontent within the party against them constitutes a larger problem for former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy-led regional outfit.“It (taking disciplinary action) is still in discussion and nothing has been decided. This issue (disciplinary action) is likely to come up on Monday,” HD Kumaraswamy, the state president of the JD(S) told Hindustan Times on Friday.“The session is on for two weeks and we will get an idea on this (on growing dissent),” he added.The three legislators who are likely to face disciplinary action could not be reached for comment.The JD(S), whose support mainly comes from the Vokkaligas, believed to be the second largest caste group in the state, is now running short of options to keep its flock together, analysts said.“The JD(S) is nothing but a fill-in-the-gap party. They will go with whoever assures them power,” said a north Karnataka-based political analyst, requesting not to be named.He added that the party’s “unprincipled” political functioning will further add to its oblivion in the state as workers get disenchanted with its functioning and enamoured by the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The JD(S) is the only major political outfit that has allied both with the BJP and the Congress in the past and had bitter fall outs, albeit temporarily. The party continues to have alliances at the local level with the two national parties that has added to the disenchantment of grass root level workers ahead of the soon-to-be held zilla and taluk panchayat elections apart from the 2023 assembly polls. The JD(S) is in talks with the BJP in Kalaburagi district where the Urban Local Body (ULB) polls held on September 3 has given the former a chance once again to play the role of a ‘kingmaker’, which it has played in state and local administration on more than one occasion.The BJP is also trying to mobilise support in the southern districts of Karnataka where JD(S) draws most of its strength in terms of elected representatives to the lower house of the legislature.The BJP is also eyeing reach out to the Vokkaliga community by first forming a board and doling out a whopping ₹500 crore for it. The party can also help benefit the community amid the raging caste census row. The Vokkaligas have at least so far firmly stood behind HD Deve Gowda.The dominant communities like Vokkaligas and Lingayats have now come together to oppose the release of the findings of the caste census data that was commissioned by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in 2015 as a way to safeguard their dominant position in the state.On the other hand, a group of extremely backward castes approached the Karnataka high court in August to compel the Basavaraj Bommai-led BJP government to release the findings of the caste census as a way to block attempts by more dominant communities from moving up the reservation ladder.Another Benglauru-based analyst said that it would be more beneficial for the BJP to side with the dominant communities demand rather than depend on the support of a fragmented backward classes group who are not known to vote en-masse.“(HD) Deve Gowda, Kumaraswamy and HD Revanna, who are liked by all political parties, will continue to be kingmakers and this could go up to 2023 elections also. We cannot rule them out,” Professor Chambi Puranik, a political analyst said.He added that those leaving the party or considering it are doing so to secure their own future or that of their family’s and not because of ideological reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jds-to-hold-key-meet-amid-discord-murmurs-101631300101812.html
11-09-2021||India||3 labourers die while cleaning water reservoir in Assam||Silchar: Three labourers, including a 16-year-old, died in Assam’s Silchar while cleaning a drinking water reservoir tank of the public health and engineering department on Friday evening, officials of the disaster management authority said.According to the officials, all three died of suffocation due to smoke created by an electric generator inside the 12-foot-deep reservoir. The deceased were identified as Salim Uddin Laskar (40), Nazim Uddin Mazumder (45) and Samsul Alom Mazumdar (16). Laskar died inside the reservoir while the other two were declared dead at Silchar Medical College and Hospitals, officials said.Tapan Sharma from the public health and engineering department’s Silchar division said their initial investigation revealed presence of gas inside the reservoir tank, but they were not sure how it was generated.“This is an old reservoir tank and we outsourced the reconstruction work to an agency named Binni construction. They used some labourers but we believe there was a security laps somewhere which led to unfortunate death of three individuals. Police are investigating the matter and more information will come later.”Soon after the incident, officials of Cachar district administration along with a team of disaster management authority rushed to the spot. Biprojit Choudhary from the disaster management authority said that locals called them around 4pm on Friday after they rescued two unconscious individuals from the tank.“Salim Uddin Laskar, a resident of Karimganj district, first suffocated inside the reservoir and lost his consciousness. Nazim Uddin Mazumder and his son Samsul went inside to rescue Salim but they also got stuck inside. Local residents gathered to rescue them and also informed us. One person died inside the reservoir while the rest two were declared dead in Silchar Medical College and Hospitals on arrival.”Locals blamed the contractors of negligence after the incident. Miya Khan, president of Tupkhana gaon panchayat, said, “The agency which involved the labourers in the work didn’t provide them basic security measures so that they can come out if something unfortunate happens. When the three persons got stuck inside, they did not have a staircase to help themselves. There was no technical instructor who can support them. It’s a serious security laps which killed the three poor labourers. We demand adequate compensation to the families of these three individuals. The department should give us assurance that these kinds of security laps will not repeat in future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-labourers-die-while-cleaning-water-reservoir-in-assam-101631299861589.html

Since he did not seek bail when he was produced before a judge following his arrest, the court remanded him in judicial custody for 15 days.His lawyer Gajendra Sonkar, said he subsequently moved a bail application and sought a hearing.“After hearing the arguments, Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) Janak Kumar Hidko granted him bail on Friday,” Sonkar said.Nand Kumar Baghel walked out of prison hours later after spending three nights behind bars.Nand Kumar Patel was booked for promoting enmity between different groups on a complaint by Sarv Brahmin Samaj, the outfit that alleged that the chief minister’s father, speaking at an event in Uttar Pradesh, recently urged people to “boycott Brahmins”, evict Brahmins from the country and called them “foreigners”.In a statement after the police filed the First Information Report (FIR) against his father, chief minister Baghel said the reported comments by his father hurt the sentiments of the community.“Every person is equal before my government. Everyone knows about my ideological differences with my father. Our political thoughts and beliefs are different. I honour him as his son but as a CM I cannot forgive him for such statements which disturb public order,” the statement said, adding that legal action in the matter will be ensured.“Nobody is above the law in my government even if he is the chief minister’s 86-year-old father,” the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antibrahmin-remarks-chhattisgarh-cm-s-father-gets-bail-after-3-nights-in-prison-101631299621038.html
11-09-2021||India||Cong questions Centre’s decision to appoint new governor in Tamil Nadu||Tamil Nadu Congress unit has raised doubts over the Union government’s “intention” behind the appointment of a new governor for the state, wondering if it was an attempt to target the MK Stalin-led DMK. On late Thursday night, the Rashtrapati Bhavan made new appointments and shuffled governors, including R N Ravi, governor of Nagaland who was appointed as the governor of Tamil Nadu. Ravi replaces Banwarilal Purohit, who held additional charge as governor of Punjab and is now appointed as regular governor in poll-bound Punjab.Incoming governor, Ravi was born in Bihar and joined the Indian Police Service (IPS) in 1976, and was allotted the Kerala cadre. He has also held positions in the CBI and IB. He was appointed as the Centre’s interlocutor for the Nagaland peace talks in August 2014 and was appointed as Nagaland governor in 2019.On Friday, state Congress chief K S Alagiri referred to the case of another former IPS officer Kiran Bedi, who he said as lieutenant governor (L-G) of the neighbouring union territory of Puducherry, interfered with the functioning of the Congress government there. The Congress government eventually fell earlier this year, owing to a spate of resignations of MLAs, some of whom jumped ship to the BJP. The Congress had often met the President to recall Bedi, accusing her of running a parallel administration and not allowing for welfare schemes to be implemented. She was eventually replaced by former Tamil Nadu BJP-chief Tamilisai Soundararajan, who was given additional charge as LG of Puducherry while she was also the governor of Telangana. Alagiri brought up their common police background. “The appointment of a retired police officer as Tamil Nadu governor has raised suspicion,” Alagiri said in a statement. “I suspect that Ravi has been appointed to create problems for chief minister M K Stalin.” However, Stalin and former chief minister Edappadi Palanwami expressed gratitude towards Purohit and welcomed the new governor for the state. According to a Rashtrapati Bhavan communique, President Ram Nath Kovind released late on Thursday night said that new appointments will take effect when they take charge of their respective offices. In October 2017, Purohit was appointed as the 14th Governor of Tamil Nadu when the state was reeling under a political crisis following J Jayalalithaa’s death in office as chief minister in December 2016. He has been embroiled in several controversies during his stint. He also leaves the state office having avoided taking a decision on the clemency plea of one of the convicts serving a sentence for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination and handing the decision over to the President of India stating that he was the right person to rule on this. “Evasion is not a constitutional act,” says political commentator, Ramu Manivannan. “Governors are being seen as instruments of the central ruling party. This office seems to be functioning against the tenets of a federal system and we should address the office of the Governor through political and constitutional reforms to bring in accountability for their actions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-questions-centre-s-decision-to-appoint-new-governor-in-tamil-nadu-101631299443811.html
11-09-2021||India||EC meets Rijiju, seeks power to delist inactive political parties||The Election Commission of India last week met law minister Kiren Rijiju regarding a host of electoral reforms, including the power to delist inactive political parties and linking Aadhaar to voter identity cards, people familiar with the matter said. “The law minister was briefed on several of the reforms that are pending with the ministry,” one such person said on the condition of anonymity. “Once the amendments are drafted, they will hopefully be introduced in the winter session of Parliament. The power to take action against political parties that have not contested elections for decades but are still enjoying tax exemptions on donations was discussed as well. HT sent the law ministry a detailed questionnaire but did not receive a response.The poll watchdog has the mandate to register a political party but no power under electoral law to deregister any party.An EC official familiar with the matter said that the voluntary linking of Aadhaar data was agreed upon with the government, while the power to delist the political parties remains a point still to be discussed. In 1999, the Commission put 200 parties on notice as they had not contested any polls. At present, India has over 2,700 political parties, but only seven are recognised at the national level and 50 at the state-level. A recognised national party has to poll 6% of valid votes in any four or more states and in addition win four Lok Sabha seats.According to the Association of Democratic Reforms, the number of registered unrecognised parties has doubled in the last decades. The number rose from 1,112 IN 2010 to 2,301 in 2019.The commission, composed of chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra and election commissioners Rajiv Kumar and Anup Chandra Pandey, been pushing for the reforms with the CEC writing to the ministry in May to “expedite them”. Election Commission of India is pushing for at least five key electoral reforms. including making paid news an electoral offence, linking Aadhaar numbers to the electoral roll , and increasing the punishment for filing a false affidavit (to two years of imprisonment), and has written to the government in this regard, HT reported on June 8.There are nearly 40 proposals pending with the ministry. Elections in the states of Goa, Manipur, Uttarakhand, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh are due early next year. ECI has been considering a wide range of electoral reforms to usher in digitisation, removing duplication of voters and enabling remote voting for non-resident Indians (NRIs), even migrant workers within the country. The commission on May 17, sent a reminder to then law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to revisit at least the five key reforms.ECI has proposed that the voters who turn 18 should be able to register more than just once in a year. At present, only those who turn 18 as of January 1 are eligible to register as voters. ECI also wants to get tough on false affidavits. At present, candidates who furnish false information can be punished with up to six months of imprisonment. The Commission has suggested increasing this to two years.Documents reviewed by HT show that the commission has also pitched the linking of Aadhaar data to the electoral roll, part of its plan to eliminate duplication of voter ID cards. According to the person mentioned above, the commission wrote to the law ministry last month to approve the voluntary linking of Aadhaar data to voter ID cards by means of a gazette notification. “The Election Commission proposes verification of elector using Aadhaar Authentication and voluntary seeding of Aadhaar for providing speedy services to voters like registration of new voters, change of address, downloading voter slips etc,” the commission said in a letter to the ministry. “The proposed Aadhaar authentication/seeding will be optional for those electors who want to use Aadhaar for faster delivery of services.”It adds the ministry of electronics and information technology is a gazette notification published on August 5, 2020, allows for the use of Aadhaar by the central government in the interest of good governance. “It is therefore requested that the proposal for voluntary authentication/seeding of Aadhaar from UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India), for providing faster electoral service, may be agreed to,” the letter said. A second person familiar with the matter said that the proposal is with the UIDAI and could be implemented within three months once approval is given. “The main consideration will be to create a data vault to protect the information,” the person said on the condition of anonymity. “The process normally takes within three to six months to be completed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-meets-rijiju-seeks-power-to-delist-inactive-political-parties-101631299442330.html
11-09-2021||India||Stalin tables Bill to set up panel for SC/ST members||Tamil Nadu government will set up a commission for Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities, which will have functionary powers of a civil court, the chief minister MK Stalin announced in the state assembly this week. A Bill to this effect was introduced in the assembly on Thursday to be called The Tamil Nadu State Commission for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act, 2021. The commission will be empowered to inquire suo moto or on a petition by the victims. With the powers of a civil court trying a suit (under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908), the commission can summon any person, examine witnesses, call for the production of any document, receive evidence on affidavits, and requisition any public record from any court or office. “To safeguard the welfare of the SCs and STs, and to protect and develop their economic and social wellbeing, the state government has decided to constitute the commission,” said Stalin, after the Bill was tabled. This decision was taken following suggestions from the vigilance and monitoring committee on August 19, a recently reconstituted body with Stalin as the chairman.The Bill clarifies that the National Commission for the SCs and STs will prevail over the yet to be set up state commission. If the national body is seized of any matter, the state body will not have jurisdiction on the same and in case of conflicting recommendations, the national body’s decisions will prevail. The state commission will have a chairperson, vice-chairperson and five members, out of which three will be from SCs, two from STs and a woman member. The commission will look into any violations of rights provided under the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989. Among its functions, the commission can recommend action against public servants who are negligent in preventing such violations. The commission is expected to investigate and monitor safeguards present in various legislations, in the interest of SC/STs and promote awareness of the same. “Undertake a review of the implementation of the policies pursued by the Union and state government with respect to SCs and STs,” the Bill read. The state government will consult the commission on policy matters related to the community, and the commission will also carry out research work to avoid discrimination. Stalin also drew on the past achievements of the DMK regime, which increased the reservation for the community and introducing a 3% special reservation for SC Arunthathiyars to state it was their tradition to protect the interests and ensure equality. In a separate announcement earlier this week, Stalin also supported the caste-based census and said that he would soon write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the matter. On Wednesday, Stalin said that ₹10 lakh reward as an incentive to panchayats following the practice of common crematoriums or graveyards. And to expedite cases related to the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, Stalin announced setting up four new special courts in Salem, Krishnagiri, Madurai and Tirunelveli, since these places have more pending cases. He also said that schools run by the Adi Dravidar Welfare Department will be brought to the mainstream under the guidance of the School Education Department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-tables-bill-to-set-up-panel-for-sc-st-members-101631299323677.html

11-09-2021||India||Andhra government to run website for online sale of movie tickets||Andhra Pradesh government is preparing a state-run website for online sale of movie tickets, both single and multiplex theatres, across the state, an order issued by principal secretary (home) Kumar Vishwajit on August 31 stated.The website would be similar to the railway reservation ticketing system, the order said. Andhra Pradesh state film, television and theatre development corporation will run the upcoming portal, and the government is working out other modalities. As of now, tickets in Andhra are sold online by private entities such as BookMyShow whereas, offline tickets are available at the theatre box office.Currently, online ticket sales are restricted to major cities like Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam. Physical counters at theatres are the only mode of buying tickets in rural areas. A government official who did not want to be quoted said the order was passed keeping in mind tax collections or tax revenues to the state government from movie theatres. “The tax collected per year is just a small percentage of the business the Telugu film industry makes. It is an old issue and is being sorted out. For example, if a film-maker earns ₹100 crores, the tax has to be paid accordingly,” he added. The order further stated that the state government constituted a committee to create a blueprint of the system. The committee comprises the principal secretary (home) as the chairman and the principal secretary (Information technology) as co-chairman.Other members include the secretary of the Andhra information and public relations (I&PR) department and managing director of the Andhra state film, television and theatre development corporation, managing director of the Andhra technological services and a representative of the commercial taxes department’s commissioner.The move has worried industry bigwigs, who are concerned about the government’s intention behind this order. Several people refused to comment on the matter, terming it ‘very sensitive’. A senior person from the film industry, who didn’t want to be named, said that the issue will only be resolved if one of the senior actors meets chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to sort it out.A well-known movie producer from Andhra, who also requested anonymity, said that the film industry had recommended online ticketing to streamline taxation earlier. “But the issue now is that there is no clarity about what the government wants to do. They mentioned that they would create something like a railway ticket portal. But how can money first come to the government and then come to us?” he questioned. The movie producer added that one can not go to the government for their money, as it will lead to red tapes. “There is no clarity on this. This is not an essential community, it is a business,” he remarked. According to estimates, the Telugu movie industry, known as Tollywood, used to generate over ₹1000 crores every year during pre-Covid times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-government-to-run-website-for-online-sale-of-movie-tickets-101631299261581.html
11-09-2021||India||Farm income rose 16%, but share from cultivation dropped: NSO data||Farm incomes rose 57% between 2018-19 and 2012-13, at a compounded annual growth rate of 7.8%, and the inflation adjusted numbers work out to 16% at a CAGR of 2.5%.Interestingly, much of the increase seems to have come from wages and animal husbandry, with the share of income from cultivation actually declining from 48% to 38%.The numbers are the first indication of how farmers fared under the first Narendra Modi government, and are from the National Statistical Office’s (NSO) results of the “Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households and Land and Holdings of Households in Rural India” (SAS) survey conducted in 2019.According to the survey, the average debt of a farm household increased by 58% to ₹74,100 in 2018-19, from ₹47,000 during 2012-13. In real terms, that’s a 16.5% increase. But the share of agricultural households with outstanding loans decreased marginally from 51.9% to 50.2%.The numbers indicate that agriculture has not fared badly under the Modi government, although their income from the production of crops or allied activities has actually declined in real terms; they are also a reflection of the fact that the monsoon has not let down farmers in the past seven years (except in certain parts of the country, but regional variations in income and indebtedness will become clear only in a disaggregated analysis).The survey is the most comprehensive one on the condition of agricultural households and gives data for the July 2018-June 2019 period. The previous round of this survey was conducted in 2013 and collected data for the July 2012-June 2013 period. This is the first compressive account of the state of farmers under the Modi government.Agricultural incomes rose...CAGR of the gross value added or GVA added in agriculture was 3.6% between 2012-13 and 2018-19 (considering a July-June year), the latest two rounds of the SAS rounds. But that doesn’t say much about the condition of farmers in India. The SAS gives data on average income of agricultural households. This was ₹10,218 per month in 2018-19. To be sure, the household income in this round of the survey included income from rent of leasing out of land, which was not included in 2012-13. Without such rent, the average household income in 2018-19 is ₹10,084. This is a 57% increase (CAGR of 7.8%) over the nominal income of ₹6,426 in 2012-13. Adjusting with CPI rural for inflation, makes the growth 16% or a CAGR of 2.5%.... but were powered by non-cultivation incomeAn agricultural household may earn from sources other than agriculture, such as wages or non-farm business. Wages, cultivation, farming of animals, and non-farm business had a share of 40%, 38%, 16%, and 6% in 2018-19. These shares were 32%, 48%, 12%, and 8% in 2012-13. This suggests that farming or crop production as an occupation is on the decline. Not only do agricultural households not earn even a majority of their incomes from cultivation, it is not even their largest source of income.In absolute terms, the nominal income from crop production or cultivation per agricultural household was ₹3,798 in 2018-19, 23% higher than in 2012-13. However, in real terms it has declined by 8.9%.To be sure, such decline can also happen if agricultural households (it includes even those who are engaged in animal farming) remain the same or increase, but they don’t earn from production of crops. Therefore, it is important to look at the change in this income per agricultural household actually engaged in crop production. From cultivation or production of crops and related activities alone, the net nominal income (receipts less expense) of households actually engaged in cultivation was ₹4,001 in 2018-19, 19.4% more than ₹3,350 in 2012-13. In real terms, such income declined 11.7%.Not all farmers are part of agricultural householdsNot all farmers are part of an agricultural household. The survey defines an agricultural household as one which produces field or horticultural crops, livestock or products of other specified agricultural activities even if it does not possess or operate any land. To exclude households with insignificant production, only households receiving value of produce more than ₹4,000 and having a member self-employed in agriculture in the previous 365 days are considered. The income cutoff in 2018-19 has been adjusted for inflation – it was ₹3,000 in 2012-13 – and the definitions are identical to that in 2012-13, the report shows.What happened to farm loans?The average amount of outstanding loans per agricultural household was ₹74,100 in 2018-19, 58% more than ₹47,000 during 2012-13. In real terms, however, outstanding loans increased by 16.5%. The share of agricultural households with outstanding loans decreased marginally from 51.9% to 50.2%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-income-rose-16-but-share-from-cultivation-droppednsodata-101631298840933.html
11-09-2021||India||Govt enables vaccine status check by firms, services||The Union government on Friday launched a new digital tool to verify a person’s vaccination status directly from Co-WIN, a step it said will allow various entities such as employers, hotels, airlines and railways to safely resume or expand activities.The tool, called the Know your Customer’s/Client’s Vaccination Status, or KYC-VS, paves the way for wider adoption of so-called vaccine passports that an increasing number of countries are seeing as key to the recovery from the pandemic. Many western countries are now making it mandatory for people to get a shot before they can enter public transport and crowded venues like nightclubs.Similar restrictions may now be possible at scale in India once the system is adopted widely. For instance, people wanting to use the local train network in Mumbai at present need to apply for a pass after having their vaccine -- the new API can now digitise and speed up the process.“CoWIN is launching a new API that will make it easy for organisations/institutions to know the vaccination status of their employees, associates, customers. We believe this will help us resume socio-economic activities faster while ensuring everyone’s safety,” RS Sharma, the CEO of the National Health Authority, said in a tweet on Friday.“This consent-based/privacy-preserving API is being offered with a webpage that can be embedded in any system/portal. This will ensure a quick and seamless integration with any system,” he added.According to the details in a government release, a person will be able to approve a verification request since they will be sent a one-time password (OTP), without which the system will not return the vaccination status.“This response will be digitally signed and can be shared instantly with the verifying entity. A real-life example could be when at the time of booking a railway ticket, an individual will input the necessary details for buying the ticket and if required, the concerned entity will also get the vaccination status in the same transaction, with the due consent of the individual,” a government statement said.According to an official, who asked not to be named, the new tool will help avoid the need for people to present their full certificates. “One really does not need to access a person’s full Covid-19 vaccination certificate; this tool will provide just the confirmation to those who want to know it as part of business dealings or offering services etc,” this person said.At least 58% of India’s eligible population – which comprises all adults – have received at least one dose. Of these, 18% have been fully vaccinated. In all, 720 million doses have been delivered till September 10.Health experts have said being vaccinated is likely to become a crucial prerequisite, as it has in many parts of the world, for activities to return to pre-pandemic levels. But such a move comes with concerns of possible discrimination until universal coverage has been achieved and everyone has had adequate opportunity to get a dose.“It is also a polite way of urging people to come forward and get vaccinated; there’s still a section that needs convincing. It’s a well established fact that when you get vaccinated then the disease largely does not take a wild turn,” said Dr Sandeep Nayar, director and head, chest and respiratory diseases department, BLK Super Specialty Hospital. “It will also help at the psychological level as you’d feel comfortable if you know passengers in your flight are vaccinated,” he added.Privacy experts, however, said there could be several issues involved.“Once information about where and by whom a person’s vaccination status is verified is recorded, it will allow for an individual’s social graph to be created. This has serious privacy concerns because it could potentially identify where you have been and if you have taken, for example, a flight or a train,” said Anand Venkatanarayanan, privacy and cybersecurity researcher.He added that since the Co-WIN database is centralised, it adds to the risks in case of a breach. “Such verification would have been possible with decentralised verification with the QR codes, but it will now be aggregated into what can turn into a centralised social graph.”PM chairs high-level meetMeanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a high-level meeting to review the Covid-19 outbreak in India and the government’s measures, including on vaccination. According to a government statement, the PM was briefed about current outbreak hot spots and on the availability of critical resources like oxygen supply, as well as vaccine stocks.“PM spoke about the need for constant genome sequencing to monitor emergence of mutants,” the statement said. “PM spoke about the need to ensure adequate testing across the country... (and) said that the entire ecosystem to ensure increased oxygen availability, including oxygen concentrators, cylinders and PSA plants, needs to be rapidly augmented,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-enables-vaccine-status-check-by-firms-services-101631298601444.html
11-09-2021||India||CM rejects Catholic bishop’s remark, says narcotics issue not linked to religion||A day after a Catholic bishop remarked that girls and youth from the community were becoming victims of a “well-orchestrated narcotic jihad” in Kerala, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday stressed that the problem of narcotics has “no religion” and those holding responsible positions should refrain from making statements causing division in society. Taking note of Bishop of Pala Diocese of the Syro-Malabar church, Mar Joseph Kallaranghatt’s controversial remarks on Thursday, the chief minister said: “It (narcotic jihad) is a new term. I never expected such a statement from a person like him. I have no idea what prompted him to make it. Narcotics has no religion and nobody encourages it.”“Persons holding such respectable positions should be careful while making such a statement. It will create unnecessary rift and animosity. It is a fact that all religions and governments are concerned about increased use of narcotics. It is not proper to put everything into the account of a particular section,” he told reporters here. The priest also came under criticism of the opposition Congress. Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly V D Satheesan, in a social media post, requested the community and spiritual leaders to desist from making any move or such statement. “We can’t count the number of crimes based on caste or religion. Such a statement was not expected from a religious leader. All will have to keep restraint to ensure brotherhood and peace,” he said. Echoing the same, senior Congress leader and MLA P T Thomas said the bishop’s remark is not conducive to communal harmony.“It should not have come from a person like him who is a known thinker and theology expert. Such statements will affect our communal harmony and amity,” he said. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, rallied behind the Catholic priest. “What he said is true. Both ‘love jihad’ and ‘narcotic jihad’ are prevalent. We are not blaming the whole community, but extremists elements within it. Even top police officers admitted that a syndicate is working behind this,” state BJP president K Surendran said. “Love jihad” is a term often used by right-wing groups to describe unions between Muslim men and women belonging to other religion.Several Christian leaders also came out in support of the Bishop. “You can’t crucify a religious head who is reeling out facts. His words are not against the whole community but against a section of misguided people who have the least regard for other religions,” Janapaksham (a political party) leader P C George said. Former spokesman of Kerala Catholic Bishops Council, Varghese Vallikat, also supported the Catholic priest. Muslim organisations such as the Samasta Kerala Sunni Students Federation (SKSSF) and Kerala Naduvathul Mujahideen, however, demanded the Bishop present evidence to substantiate his claims.“His statement is intended to create a rift between two communities. The government should take legal action against him for promoting hatred,” Sathar Panthallur, SKSSF general secretary, said. Last month, the Bishop had exhorted believers to have more children to check the depleting population of Christians. The Pala diocese had announced a monthly assistance of ₹1,500 for couples married after 2000, and who have four or more children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijayan-rejects-catholic-bishop-s-remark-says-narcotics-issue-not-linked-to-religion-101631298545768.html
11-09-2021||India||Abhishek Banerjee to hold roadshow in Tripura as TMC eyes state polls||Intensifying its plans to make inroads in Tripura in the 2023 state elections, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Friday announced that its national general secretary, Abhishek Banerjee, will lead the party’s first roadshow in Agartala on September 15.Several Parliament members and legislators from Bengal will accompany Abhishek to the north-eastern state for the mega rally next week, the party said. At least 43 of 60 seats in the state are in control of the BJP and its allies.“Abhishek will lead the roadshow in Agartala,” TMC’s state general secretary Kunal Ghosh confirmed.The Mamata Banerjee-led party has been focusing on expanding the TMC’s footprint to states outside West Bengal after the chief minister’s spectacular victory against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the West Bengal assembly elections this year.The TMC leader’s plan to visit Tripura also comes amid increasing clashes between workers of the BJP and CPI(M), which ruled the state from 1978 to 1988 and again from 1993 to 2018. “The BJP has been intentionally attacking CPI(M) workers since last week to divert people’s attention from the rise of the TMC. But the strategy will not work. We are fully sympathetic towards the CPI(M) workers and support their struggle. However, we urge them to vote for us and oust the BJP,” Ghosh said. However, former Tripura CPI(M) state secretary Baijan Dhan told HT that by asking Left supporters to vote for the TMC, Bengal’s ruling party was making a mockery of the current situation. “We are not opposed to any party holding rallies in Tripura but TMC leaders should not drag electoral politics into the current situation. They should have sympathy for our workers who are facing attacks every day. This is not the time to talk about elections,” Dhar said. Taking a swipe at the TMC, Tripura BJP spokesperson Subrata Chakraborty said the former is always welcome to hold rallies as democracy prevails in the state. “Abhishek Banerjee is welcome to hold the roadshow because democracy prevails here. TMC leaders are claiming that it is going to be a historic event. We wonder if it will historically mark the end of TMC’s journey in Tripura like the three earlier occasions when it unsuccessfully contested the state polls. We know that TMC and CPI(M) have an understanding but people have faith in the governance and welfare measures of Biplab Dev,” he said. The TMC had unsuccessfully contested the polls in 2008, 2013 and 2018. “In 2008, the TMC was literally an unknown force in Tripura,” Chakraborty added. It is for the third time in two months that Abhishek will be visiting Agartala next week. During his last visit on August 2, Abhishek had told local leaders that organisational committees will need to be set up right down till the polling booth-level by end of the year. I-Pac, the company formed by election strategist Prashant Kishor which helped the Mamata government to sweep the April elections in Bengal, has already begun collecting data on the ground to help TMC make inroads into Tripura. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Friday announced that its national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee will lead the party’s first roadshow in Agartala on September 15, months after youth and senior leaders started visiting Tripura and announced that they will oust the Biplab Deb-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the 2023 assembly polls.Sushmita Dev, former Congress Lok Sabha member from Silchar in Assam, who joined the TMC in August, has been regularly touring the state where her deceased father, former Union minister Santosh Mohan Dev earlier held the Tripura West Lok Sabha seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abhishek-banerjee-to-hold-roadshow-in-tripura-as-tmc-eyes-state-polls-101631298544521.html
11-09-2021||India||I-T dept ‘surveys’ offices of NewsClick, Newslaundry||The Income Tax department on Friday carried out a “survey operation” at the office of website Newslaundry as part of an investigation into the finances and funding of the organisation, according to four people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named.The department also carried out a separate survey operation at the office of NewsClick.One person familiar with the development said the I-T action came after certain gaps were noticed in the financial statements, as well as irregularities in the foreign investments, received by both the portals. A second person said the department was looking into the sources of funds of current as well as previous promoters of the websites and that it had “sufficient reason” to carry out a survey“NewsClick and Newslaundry received Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) at very high premium while their net worth was very low. There are also gaps in the financials of both the companies, which suggest tax evasion but we are verifying the same,” the first person added. While the foreign investment in NewsClick was received in 2018-19, this officer didn’t disclose the period when Newslaundry received such funds from outside India.According to the Newslaundry website, much of the company’s equity is held by its three co-founders, Sekhri, Roopak Kapoor, and Prashant Sareen, and by an impact fund Omidyar Network (the current managing director and partner of its Indian operations is Roopa Kudva). Madhu Trehan, another co-founder, divested her stake in favour of the other three co-founders. She did not respond to a text message seeking comment.HT reached out to Newslaundry CEO Abhinandan Sekhri and NewsClick founder Purkaystha on Friday for their reaction but there was no response.In a message posted on his Twitter handle on Saturday, Sekhri referred to the income tax 'surveys."We have nothing to hide and have done everything by the book and are not in any breach or violation of any law. We conduct our business honestly and with integrity," Abhinandan Sekhri said on Twitter. "We have in the past given the IT authorities all documents related to our funding and accounts. We will cooperate in whatever way we are required to by the law. We will also continue to practice public interest journalism which is why we exist”.NewsClick also released a statement on the I-T action on Saturday, asserting that the latest action "appears to relate to the same false and unfounded allegations being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate and the Economic Offences Wing, Delhi Police. We have these allegations challenged in the courts"."These investigations by various agencies, and these selective allegations, are attempts to stifle the independent journalism of media organisations – including Newsclick," the news portal's Prabir Purkayastha said in the statement.The I-T department and the finance ministry did not respond to e-mail queries and text messagesIn a survey operation, which is carried out under provisions of Section 133 A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, tax officials cover only the business premises of an assessee and those linked to it and not their residential addresses. However, tax authorities can seize documents. During a survey, I-T officials look into documents such as books of accounts, bank statements, and details of cash and stock.The I-T teams reached the Newslaundry and NewsClick offices at Sarvodaya Enclave and Saidulajab respectively in the morning, and checked the documents till evening while asking those in the office to switch off their phones.Officials said they have seized documents and electronic communications from both the companies.As the next step, the survey team will study the finances of the companies and prepare a report for further action, if any, by the concerned assessing officer, so that a formal investigation can be launched under the I-T Act , a third person, a government officer explained.I-T officials had visited the offices of both the portals on June 30 as well and notices were served to the concerned office bearers.NewsClick was earlier raided by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on February 9 this year for alleged money laundering linked to foreign funding received by it. The Delhi high court in June this year directed the ED to not take any coercive action against Purkayastha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-dept-surveys-offices-of-newsclick-newslaundry-101631298542785.html

She’s gang-raped, filmed||Thiruvananthapuram: A 28-year-old woman who travelled 300 km to meet a man she befriended online was gang-raped by the man and his three friends in north Kerala’s Kozhikode, police said on Friday.Police said the four drugged her, took turns to rape her and filmed the assault before they finally dumped her a short distance from a private hospital. They warned her against complaining to the police, threatening to put out videos and photos of the assault on the Internet.“The hospital alerted the police,” assistant commissioner of police K Sudarshan said, adding that the accused left her near a hospital because they were afraid she may die. Her condition now is stable, he said.The woman, who is still under treatment at the hospital, shared the phone number of the man she was in touch with and some other details to help the police track down the accused.Police officer Sudarshan said two accused including P Anas, the man she became friends with over short video streaming mobile application TikTok, have been arrested. “We have some leads about absconding two and they will be arrested soon,” the police officer said.The woman, a resident of Kollam in south Kerala, had been in touch with Anas for nearly two years on social media. Anas insisted that they meet and invited her to come to Kozhikode. She finally made the trip on Thursday.He took her to a flat in the city; his friends later joined in. The accused first forced the woman to drink liquor and then some substance, possibly narcotics, and then raped her one by one.One of the accused has criminal antecedents, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-woman-travels-300km-to-meet-her-online-friend-she-s-gang-raped-filmed-101631296681232.html
11-09-2021||India||Mathura-Vrindavan area declared pilgrimage site; meat, liquor sale banned||The Uttar Pradesh government on Friday declared an area of 10 sq km around the birthplace of Lord Krishna in Mathura-Vrindavan as a “teerth sthal” (pilgrimage site) and banned the sale of liquor and meat in this area which spans 22 wards of the Mathura Nagar Nigam. The city has a total of 70 wards managed by the local body.Seven other areas in Mathura linked to the life of Lord Krishna and his consort Radha, have already been declared pilgrimage sites by the Yogi Adityanath regime. These include Vrindavan, Gokul, Barsana, Nandgaon, Goverdhan, Baldev and Radhakund.“The Uttar Pradesh government on Friday declared 10 sq km area under Mathura Nagar Nigam a teerth sthal (pilgrimage spot). The area comprises 22 municipal wards of the municipality. This automatically means that meat and liquor cannot be sold in the area,” said Navneet Sehgal, additional chief secretary (ACS), information department, UP.Additional chief secretary Avnish Kumar Awasthi issued a detailed order, specifying the names of the 22 wards. A copy of the order was marked to the commissioner, Agra division, district magistrate (Mathura), SSP (Mathura), Mathura Nagar Nigam and vice-chairman of the Braj Teerth Vikas Parishad in Mathura.The decision was welcomed in Mathura and Vrindavan.“Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has kept his word and declared Mathura as teerth sthal. It was a long pending demand and will ensure the revival of the glorious past of this religious city with Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi as its centre. Devotees coming to Mathura were not happy over the sale of meat and liquor in the land of Krishna,” stated Kapil Sharma, secretary of Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Trust in Mathura.Mahesh Pathak, national president of Akhil Bharatiya Teerth Purohit Mahasabha, also welcomed the decision to declare 22 wards of Mathura as a pilgrimage site.“There are 70 wards in Mathura-Vrindavan Nagar Nigam, including nine wards of Vrindavan, which already has pilgrimage site status. Of the remaining 61 wards of Mathura, 22 are being declared as pilgrimage spots. We would have loved having all 61 wards of Mathura Nagar Nigam as pilgrimage spots but declaring 22 wards with Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi as epicentre is no less a welcome decision,” stated Pathak.The issue of pilgrimage site status to Mathura was raised on ‘Janmashtami’ last month when chief minister Yogi Adityanath was in Mathura to offer prayers to Lord Krishna at Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi. In his address, he favoured the sale of meat and liquor in the temple town. He even suggested that those engaged in the sale of meat and liquor be rehabilitated by getting them to open milk vends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mathuravrindavan-area-declared-pilgrimage-site-meat-liquor-sale-banned-101631296261175.html
11-09-2021||India||India, Australia discuss Afghanistan crisis implications, terrorism||New Delhi: The defence ministers of India and Australia on Friday discussed the security situation in Afghanistan, its implications for the region, issues related to the Indo-Pacific where China has scaled up its maritime activities, and steps to further bilateral military cooperation across domains, people familiar with the developments said on Friday. Defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Australian counterpart Peter Dutton met on the eve of the first 2+2 dialogue between the two countries. Australian foreign minister Marise Payne and Dutton are in India for the dialogue with their Indian counterparts S Jaishankar and Singh on Saturday. “The defence minister told Dutton that India was monitoring the Afghanistan situation closely. He also said India was concerned about terrorist activity emanating from that country,” said one of the officials cited above. The Indian security establishment is concerned about terrorist activity in Afghanistan spilling over into the country after the Taliban takeover. The situation in Afghanistan is expected to figure in the 2+2 dialogue between the two countries on Saturday, along with other important security issues such as China’s role in the region, and the situation in the East and South China Seas, as previously reported by HT. Australia is also working with its partners to ensure a “joined up approach in any engagement with the Taliban”, though the current focus is on ensuring that the Taliban permits the safe passage of Australian and other citizens who wish to leave Afghanistan, Australian envoy Barry O’Farrell said on Thursday. He also said that Australia was concerned that the new regime created by the Taliban in Afghanistan was not inclusive and had UN-sanctioned members of the Haqqani Network, and any engagement with the group would be based on its actions. Both countries are keen to work jointly to realise the full potential of the India-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, Singh said after the bilateral meeting with Dutton. “This partnership is based on our shared vision of free, open, inclusive and rule-based Indo-Pacific region. Both Australia and India have tremendous stakes in peace, development and free flow of trade, rules-based order and economic growth in the region,” Singh said. Strengthening defence ties was on the agenda. Singh said the wide-ranging talks focused on defence cooperation and expanding military engagements across the three services, enhancing defence information sharing, cooperation in emerging defence technologies and mutual logistics support. “Both sides noted with happiness that Australia joined the Malabar Exercise in 2020. In this context, we also expressed satisfaction in the continued participation of Australia in Malabar Exercise this year,” he said. India, the US, Japan and Australia -- or the Quad -- conducted complex naval drills off the Pacific Ocean island of Guam last month under the Malabar banner, with the exercise involving destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines, helicopters, long-range maritime patrol aircraft and elite special forces elements. The second phase of the Malabar exercise will be held in the Bay of Bengal from October 11-14, said another official. China has been monitoring the activities of the Quad countries. Beijing has been wary of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, which was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level in 2019. Singh apprised Dutton about steps being taken by India to achieve self-reliance in the defence sector and the “growing innovation ecosystem in India”. “We discussed opportunities to work together in defence, science and technology areas. I invited Australian industry to take advantage of India’s liberalised foreign direct investment policies in the defence sector. We both agreed that there are opportunities of bilateral collaboration for co-development and co­-production [of systems],” Singh said. He added that India was committed to forging a robust partnership with Australia to promote regional security and growth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-australia-discuss-afghanistan-crisis-implications-terrorism-101631295786210.html
11-09-2021||India||BJP, RSS breaking J&K’s composite culture: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ideological fount, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), of trying to break the composite culture of Jammu & Kashmir.“The feeling of love, brotherhood that exists amongst you all is being ruined by the people of BJP and RSS. Your composite culture was attacked, your brotherhood was attacked and they weakened you before snatching your statehood. You can see for yourself that the Union territory’s economy, tourism, business are badly hurt,” Gandhi told party officer bearers at a function, on the second day of his two-day visit in Jammu. The former Congress chief, who paid obeisance at the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine in Katra on Thursday, said: “There are three symbols of mata (pindis) there - Mata Durga, Mata Lakshmi and Mata Saraswati. Durga ji symbolises the power to protect, Lakshmi ji fulfils one’s aim and Saraswati ji is for knowledge. The BJP weakened all these powers when it converted Jammu & Kashmir into a Union territory, brought farm laws, demonetisation, Goods and Services Tax, and installed people having RSS background in educational institutions.” “When these three shaktis (powers) are in your home and country, your home and country will make progress,” he said in an indirect attack on the Centre over its economic policies. Gandhi further recalled how the three powers were strengthened during the Congress regime when the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act or MGNREGA was implemented and the gross domestic product rate stood at 9%. Pointing towards his hand, Gandhi correlated the Congress election symbol with Lord Shiva and Guru Nanak Dev, and said it was the symbol of being fearless. “This hand is the symbol that you should not be afraid of anything,” he said, adding that the “BJP is afraid of everything”.Asking party cadres to strengthen the Congress, Gandhi said: “The day party workers feel that they are being heard in the party, Congress will come back with not 100, 200, 300, but 450 seats.” The Congress leader also spoke of his meeting with a delegation of Kashmiri Pandits earlier in the day. “During the meeting, I realised that I am part of this delegation. My family is also a Kashmiri Pandit family and I am a Kashmiri Pandit. Therefore, I want to say here that I don’t lie and I want to tell my Kashmiri Pandit brethren that I will help you,” he said. Gandhi said he planned to visit Ladakh soon, and added that his visits to the Union territory always made him feel “at home”.“This is my second visit to Jammu & Kashmir in a month and I will be visiting Ladakh shortly. I had said in Srinagar that whenever I come to Jammu & Kashmir, I feel that I have come home. Yesterday I went to offer prayers at Vaishno Devi and I felt at home. My family has very old relations with Jammu & Kashmir,” the Congress leader said. The Congress leader also reached out to displaced Kashmiri Pandits, saying he and his family belong to this community, and promised them all help. “I do not tell lies,” the Congress leader said.Hitting back, BJP leader Sambit Patra said: “Astonishingly Gandhi forgot that the woes of the Kashmiri Pandit’s were because of the ‘politics of appeasement’ of Congress.Congress for its petty vote bank politics sacrificed also the development of Kashmir.”(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-rss-attacking-j-k-s-composite-culture-rahul-gandhi-101631273639025.html
11-09-2021||India||BJP’s UP election campaign buzzwords: ‘Damdaar’, ‘imandaar’||As it prepares to face tough questions on its performance on various fronts including the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, law and order and the state of economy, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh has designed a campaign to project its image as damdaar (decisive) and imaandar (honest).Ahead of the assembly elections scheduled for early 2022, the election campaign, which will include social media outreach, will be pivoted on the “accomplishments” of the “Modi-Yogi partnership” said a person aware of the details. The Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh has been criticised for its inadequate preparedness for the second wave of the pandemic which left over 18,000 dead in the state according to union government data. The state faced an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen and other essential medical supplies that exacerbated the pandemic conditions. To be sure, UP’s current case fatality rate is, at 1.3%, on par with the national number of 1.3%, and medical infrastructure in almost all states was overwhelmed by the ferocity and intensity of the second wave – caused largely by the delta variant of the virus, which is now raging through the US – that took everyone by surprise. Still, like many other states, UP is also believed to have undercounted its dead. According to a June 21 report by news website Article 14, which analysed death registration data from the state’s 24 districts, UP registered around 197,000 excess fatalities during the pandemic period (July 2020-March 2021) over the pre-pandemic average – around 42 times the state’s official Covid death toll in the time period.To counter the charges against its systemic deficiencies that came to light during the second wave, and more recently with the death of children (from a mystery viral fever, not Covid) in Firozabad, the state government is bringing out a report card to list its achievements in the past five years and how its performance compares favourably to the previous government’s. “The party has decided to use social media content in the form of snippets, videos and cartoons to deliver the message of how the Yogi government fulfilled its promise of cracking down on crime and corruption and creating jobs,” said a party functionary who asked not to be named. To illustrate its accomplishments, the Fark Saaf Hai (the difference is clear) campaign has also been sharpened for social media dissemination. The party claims it has met most of the promises it made in its election manifesto. “In the last 70 years, there were just 12 medical colleges in the state; after the BJP came to power, in the last four years, 48 medical colleges have been set up. Of these, 23 medical colleges have already begun functioning, nine will be inaugurated soon and construction of 16 will begin soon,” the functionary added. Former Rajya Sabha MP and Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Javed Ali Khan, however, said the figures are incorrect. He said during SP rule, there were already over 30 medical colleges functioning in the state. Part of this comparison will be the Bhoole Toh Nahi (don’t forget) campaign where the party will recall incidents of crime committed when the Akhilesh Yadav government was in power. To blunt the criticism over the continued crimes against women, the state has listed steps such as setting up 1,535 women help desks in police stations across the state, ensuring a response within 10 minutes to distress calls made through the helpline number 112 and, how as part of its “mission” to curb crime, the state has made 8,000 arrests and filed several cases against criminals. “The state has been able to take action in at least 13,000 cases under the Gangster Act, property worth ₹1,800 crore that belonged to various mafia dons and criminals has been attached by the government. Cyber security cells have been set up in all 75 districts to strengthen the drive against crime in the state,” the BJP functionary said. The Opposition, however, dubbed these claims as hollow. Khan said the first promise that the party had made in its election manifesto was to create 700,000 jobs and double the income of farmers. “It has failed on both fronts, can they give us a list of even 350,000 jobs that were created?. As for decline in the crime rate, all one has to do is read the news reports from the ground; every day there are incidents of rape, abductions and dacoity in daylight. The national crime record bureau data belies their claims,” he said. As per the National Crime Records Bureau data of 2019, UP recorded the third-highest number of cases of crime against women after West Bengal and Maharashtra. In 2020, the UP government had claimed that crimes such as murder and rape had come down during the tenure of the Yogi government. Citing NCRB data, the government claimed that the number of murders in the state fell from 2,762 in 2016 to 2,032, and there was a reduction of 39% in instances of rape.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-new-up-campaign-themes-damdaar-and-imaandar-101631261218507.html
11-09-2021||India||Why India’s August was unbearable despite monsoon||This August, most Indians believe, was hot and dry -- and they are not wrong. The country saw its lowest August rain in 12 years this year (24% lower than the long-period average or LPA). The month was also the third hottest August in the past 120 years. HT reported last month that July was the sixth-warmest July on record with a mean temperature of 28.52 degrees Celsius, 0.55 degrees Celsius above normal, and the third-warmest July considering the minimum temperature at 24.88 degrees Celsius, 0.56 degrees Celsius above normal.That trend continued in August; the average maximum and mean temperatures were the third-highest during the 1901-2021 period; and the average minimum temperature was the eighth-highest. Specifically, the average maximum, average minimum and mean temperature for the country during August were 31.75 degrees Celsius, 24.39 degrees Celsius and 28.07 degrees Celsius respectively against the normal of 31.09 degrees Celsius, 24.01 degrees Celsius and 27.55 degrees Celsius based on the average for 1981-2010 period, the India Meteorological Department said. India ended August with an overall monsoon deficiency of 9%. IMD expects it to make up the balance because of higher than normal rains in September, although this will still only manage to take the overall rain to the “lower end of the normal category”, IMD said at the beginning of September. A rainfall that is within 20% of the long period average in either direction is considered normal. “The main reason why August recorded high temperatures (both maximum and mean) is that the monsoon was subdued for several days over a large part of the country. Naturally, when there is less rain there is less clouding and temperature goes up. But this is also a signature of climate change--which is why several recent months have made records in terms of temperature. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its Physical Science Basis report has also flagged that we can expect record temperatures in the coming years,” said OP Sreejith, head, climate monitoring and prediction group, IMD.Central India, especially, was hit hard. The average maximum temperature over central India recorded during August is the second-highest (31.25 degrees Celsius), while the average minimum temperature is the sixth-highest (24.50 degrees Celsius) and average mean temperature is the third-highest (27.88 degrees Celsius) since 1901. There were two major breaks in the monsoon, August 9-16 and August 23-27, when northwest, central and adjoining peninsular, and west coast of India received subdued rainfall. Intra-seasonal variation in terms of week-by-week rainfall variation over India shows that monsoon rainfall activities were largely subdued for three consecutive weeks.“The formation of fewer low-pressure systems compared to the climatology and absence of their longer westward movements during August contributed to the large deficient rainfall in central India as well as all India,” IMD said in a statement on Friday. Negative Indian Ocean Dipole over the tropical Indian Ocean, a phenomenon where the western Indian ocean becomes colder than the eastern one, and which is unfavourable for monsoon prevailed throughout August, contributing to deficient rainfall. There were also fewer typhoons in the West Pacific and so there was an absence of westward movement of their remnants into Bay of Bengal. This led to fewer low-pressure systems forming over Bay of Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thirdwarmest-august-on-record-received-lowest-rainfall-in-19-years-101631258218187.html
