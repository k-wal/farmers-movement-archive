04-09-2021||Pune||Pune ZP ends contract of 594 staff on Covid duty||Zilla Parishad (ZP) Pune has ended the services of staff hired on a contractual basis during the second wave of the Covid 19 from September. This is the second time Pune ZP has curtailed the number of contractual staff. In June, the services of 957 contractual health workers had been terminated and now 594 workers, including doctors, nurses, staff, and technicians are being relieved of their duties. As this move will reduce the number of operational Covid care facilities, the active patients will be moved to the nearest government facilities which have regular staff. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune Zilla Parishad, issued the order of curtailing these health workers and it has been applicable from September 1. According to this order, the services of contractual workers hired for dedicated Covid health centre (DCHC), Covid care centre (CCC) and dedicated health hospitals (DHC) have been put to an end on August 31. “The number of active patients is assessed and they would be transferred to other government hospitals. I have instructed the health officials that this transition should not cause any inconvenience to patients,” said Prasad. Following rise in cases during the second wave, Pune ZP had conducted rapid recruitment drives. Almost 2,000 contractual staff were hired in March and April. Citing budget constraint, ZP had curtailed 957 health workers. According to sources, the state government has directed to let go the contractual staff as the Centre has not approved required funds. Officials predicted that the curtailing may create shortage of health staff in rural parts because currently there is also the additional responsibility of vax drive against Covid19. “Patients would be shifted to other government facilities but there would also need more workers. “Also, the health system would be short of workers. The Covid active patient number is under control for now. We will try to adjust now with regular staff and the workers under National Rural Health Mission. If the situation worsens or the patients’ number increases then I am sure the state government would make some other provision to recruit health staff on contract,” said a senior ZP official on condition of anonymity.As September is progressing, the caseload of active Covid patients is recording a gradual increase and rural areas are contributing to half of that number. On September 3, the number of active Covid cases in Pune district was recorded at 10,042 which had fallen to almost 7,600 in mid-August. On September 3, there were 5,714 active cases in rural areas. Pune ZP has already identified 91 villages as hotspots and district administration has also been instructed to give special attention to rural areas as the weekly positivity rate in this unit was recorded at 4.8% for the last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-zp-ends-contract-of-594-staff-on-covid-duty-101630780164247.html
04-09-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | Black kites, in a dream so blue||Nurturing stricken wild birds to good health and reintroducing them into the wilderness is no mean task. Ask Dimple Bedi Kamra, an English teacher residing in Chandigarh’s Sector 16 and one whose house is invariably booked with orphaned, abandoned or wounded birds. These winged waifs are delivered in boxes at her gate at unearthly hours, and sometimes even ‘gifted’ anonymously.For each species, the diet is different. Overfeeding a chick in a well-intentioned response to its incessant and piteous begging calls for food can lead to its death. Each species and each specimen of a particular species requires a subtle variation in handling. Kamra, who has nursed an estimated 2,000 wild birds, maintains a delicate balance. She consciously restrains the affection that wells up in her for distressed birds. She steadily widens the distance between her and the nurtured ones so that the birds do not get too familiar or dependant on humans and emerge relatively fitter for ‘re-voyaging’ the wilderness. In other words, one cannot love wild creatures to death.Two chicks of the black kite (cheel), a common raptor glimpsed as dark specks in the tricity’s blue skies, were recently placed in Kamra’s gentle hands by the NGO, Mowgli Aid. The chicks blossomed under her care and are five months old. Kamra has slowly eased them into the wilderness by ensuring they regularly fly away from her home. The kites named, Julius and Caesar, by Kamra come back to her for feeding but she has progressively reduced the feeds so that the kites learn to hunt and scavenge on their own. The complication that has arisen is that Julius and Caesar have found a wild companion kite. They bring the ‘Friend’ to Kamra’s abode to share the feed. However, what augurs well for their tryst with independence is that the human-reared kite siblings have managed to bond with a wild kite.“Unlike some other raptors I nurtured, the two kites displayed a gentle nature and not once did they attack me or anyone else in the house. They proved to be very playful and vocal about their demands, especially for food. One of their favourite playthings was my black hairband, which they tried to rip to shreds but fortunately did not succeed! Kites are very intelligent creatures and have proved their evolutionary resilience by breeding prolifically and adapting to diverse habitats and contingencies. I am confident Julius & Caesar will embark on a fulfilling life, high up and in the freedom of the blue skies. My heart has to let them go,” Kamra told this writer.The quill pigWere a naturalist to seek a ramble along the Leisure Valley before dawn, a chance encounter with an Indian crested porcupine would be on the cards. Porcupines rarely wander into bungalows, unlike snakes, and if they do, they are likely to be rescued from the Northern sectors fronting the scrubland jungles that extend from the Sukhna lake along Uttar Marg. The rescue team of the UT forests and wildlife department is called to remove and rehabilitate porcupines only two or three times a year. A porcupine surfaced in a Sector 4 bungalow on Tuesday leading to surprise and excitement. Porcupines typically forage at night and this one probably had lost its way by wandering afar from the jungles.Porcupines are reckoned as the prickliest of the rodents and have earned the sobriquet of ‘quill pig’ due to their pugnacious nature, fearlessly taking on tigers and leopards. Porcupines tend to flee rescue teams but on occasion, when cornered, flare their bunch of legendary quills (or spines) like an umbrella, produce an intimidating rattling sound with the quills, and charge in reverse gear at the target while mustering quite a speed. The hollow quills embed in the target’s flesh on impact and get detached. A rescue personnel was attacked in a defensive reaction but fortunately the thick jeans he was sporting deflected the quill. Rescue teams usually manage to pre-empt defensive attacks by throwing a blanket or gunny bag on the porcupine.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-black-kites-in-a-dream-so-blue-101630780045819.html
04-09-2021||Chandigarh||Vexed with sewage spillage, Ludhiana resident sends complaint to CM’s office||Irked over the sewage accumulated in the streets and parks of Urban Estate, Sector 39 on Chandigarh Road, a local, Premjeet Singh, has filed a complaint with the chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s office on Saturday. He stated that sewer lines tend to get clogged in the area even after a short spell of rain. Despite repeated complaints, he claimed, the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) has failed to resolve this issue. The filth and mud remains accumulated in the parks and streets of the area, he mentioned, and added that foul smell is persistent while unhygienic conditions continue to take a toll on the health of residents. “We have been complaining against water accumulation and overflowing sewer lines in the area for years now, but the authorities have failed to find a solution to our problem. The accumulated rainwater and sewage even enter the houses of residents,” he added. “Last year too, I had submitted a complaint with the CM’s office and MC officials were directed to resolve the issue, but to no avail. Even the councillor and MLA concerned have failed to pay heed to our problem. If they cannot resolve the issues being faced by the public, then the public representatives should step down from their respective posts,” Premjeet said.‘Filth will be removed on Sunday’Meanwhile, area councillor (ward number 18) Vanit Bhatia said the work of cleaning the main sewer line on Chandigarh Road was going on with a super-suction machine, due to which the sewer lines of nearby areas, including Sector 39, were plugged to stop the sewer flow. The accumulated sewage has been drained out and the filth will be removed from the area on Sunday, Bhatia added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vexed-with-sewage-spillage-ludhiana-resident-sends-complaint-to-cm-s-office-101630779984879.html
04-09-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Cabinet minister launches project to help heart attack victims||Punjab food, civil supplies and consumer affairs minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu on Saturday launched a project funded by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) focussing on the timely intervention in case of heart attacks in Ludhiana. The project aims to save precious lives from heart failure by initiating the treatment within golden hour (first 90 minutes) of the onset of symptoms. Accompanied by Ludhiana deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma, director health services, Punjab, Dr GB Singh besides Dr S Ramakrishna, Dr Bishav Mohan, Dr GS Wander, Prem Gupta and others, the cabinet minister termed the project the biggest service to mankind under which clot-buster drug tenecteplase would be given free of cost to patients at 11 centres. Ashu said not everyone can afford to buy tenecteplase drug being used to dissolve blood clots in the heart because of its high cost (around ₹25,000- ₹30,000). He said in 70% of the cases, this drug cannot be administered because of late arrival.Deputy commissioner Sharma directed the health department to sensitise the public about the symptoms of the heart attack through its ground-level health workers as most of the victims are not aware of the signs and ignore by considering it a gastrointestinal problem. He said that the 11 centres included civil hospital, Krishna Hospital, Pahwa Hospital, RCH Pohir, Sarabha Hospital, SDH Jagraon, SDH Payal, SDH Samrala, Life Care Hospital and SDH Machhiwara, where best possible treatment for the patients suffering from heart attack can be availed. He said the doctors and paramedics of these hospitals have been trained at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) in the last one year. Dr Bishav Mohan from DMCH thanked director health services Dr GB Singh for playing a pivotal role in bringing this project to Punjab. He said that Dr Singh brought seven government hospitals which cover the majority of the rural areas of the district under the project’s ambit.He said that coronary heart diseases, especially ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI or heart attack), are leading cause of mortality globally and in India.“Punjab falls in the red zone with the mortality rate of 250 deaths per lakh of population,” he added. ‘Acidity, gastric issues could be signals of heart attack’In 33% of cases, a person who suffers a heart attack confuses sudden deterioration of health with acidity and gastric issues, said senior cardiologist Dr Bishav Mohan while speaking on the sidelines of the programme of ICMR-funded project of timely intervention in heart attack cases. In the majority of cases, people ignore such symptoms, he said, adding that 95% lives can be saved from heart attacks if the patient receives the treatment within three hours and 80% lives can be protected if the drug is administered within six hours. He said erratic lifestyle, pollution, genetic issues, stress, diabetes and obesity are some of the common reasons behind increased the number of heart attacks.“Fortunately, incidents of heath attacks in Punjab due to excessive smoking are less, but findings have shown that extreme workouts (in some cases body is not accustomed to it) and high intake of protein supplements (which also leads to thickening of blood) are also becoming the leading causes of heart attacks,” Dr Mohan said.Dr S Ramakrishna of ICMR stressed that ECG was quite important to get timely treatment. “ECG is the most cost-effective measure to detect such abnormalities. That is the reason why a lot of stress has been laid on the availability of ECG services. Early detection is an early cure,” he added. In many cases, it has been found that people are not aware of the cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and timely administering of tenecteplase, which could save lives in case a patient suffers a heart attack. Symptoms of a heart attackPain in the area between shoulder blades, arm, chest, jaw, left arm, or upper abdomen, dizziness, fatigue, light-headedness, clammy skin, cold sweat, or sweating. Heartburn, indigestion, nausea or vomiting anxiety, chest pressure, feeling of impending doom, palpitations, shortness of breath, or shoulder discomfort are also among the signs of heart attacks||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-cabinet-minister-launches-project-to-help-heart-attack-victims-101630779866032.html
04-09-2021||Chandigarh||Waste piles up as Ludhiana’s first static compactor remains out of order||Amid municipal corporation’s tall claims regarding installation of new static compactors to compress solid waste collected from the city, the existing infrastructure seems to have been forgotten. Set up in 2016 at a cost of around ₹1 crore, the city’s first static compactor in Dugri has been lying defunct for over two months, causing garbage to pile up outside, much to the chagrin of people living in the vicinity. The compactor was meant to collect and compress waste, which was earlier dumped in the open at secondary points, before being shifted to the landfill on Tajpur Road. “Since the three units of the compactor were set up, they repeatedly developed snags until they stopped working completely. These could also not handle the garbage load directed here, leading to daily dumping of waste on the roadside. Apart from stench, it also poses hurdles in smooth traffic flow,” said Dilpreet Singh, a nearby resident.An MC official, requesting anonymity, said A2Z company, which earlier handled solid waste management in the city, was operating the compactor and hook loaders for handling the garbage from collection to disposal. But since the company’s contract was terminated in February, the compactor’s maintenance suffered.MC health officer Dr Vipal Malhora said since the compactor had developed snags, the corporation had decided to replace it under the Smart City Mission.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said the civic body was working on installing static compactors at two dozen sites in different parts of the city. “Also, detailed project reports are being prepared to hire contractors for solid waste management in the city, including transportation of waste to the main dump site,” he added.Under fire from the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the MC has been struggling to manage the nearly 1,100 metric tonnes of solid waste generated daily in the city, leading to the landfill on Tajpur Road gaining more height by the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/waste-piles-up-as-ludhiana-s-first-static-compactor-remains-out-of-order-101630779864824.html
04-09-2021||Other||People in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar avail of govt services via special camps||The Chhattisgarh government has claimed that the citizens in its Bastar region are able to avail of various government services via special camps – which are being organised for redressal of grievances pertaining to Aadhaar card, ration card, ayushman card and pension cases.In other districts such as Sukma, villagers made a beeline in similar special camps in Silger, Sarkeguda and Minapa, to avail of the government services, a statement by the Chhattisgarh government read.A facilitation camp was organised at village Sarkeguda with the aim to provide several facilities to the villagers. “Vehicles were also arranged by the administration so that the villagers do not face any problem in commuting to the campsite,” the statement added.The villagers of Minapa and Silger also informed the district administration about their problems, and these special camps are being set up in these areas as well for “quick redressal.” “Similar camps will be organised in other villages in the coming days,” the government statement noted.Bastar division has seven districts, and these are included in the list of “aspirational districts of the country.” “In the tribal-dominated districts of Sukma, Bijapur, Dantewada, Narayanpur, Kondagaon, Bastar (Jagdalpur) and Kanker, access to facilities in the hinterland has always been a challenge due to geographical complexities and Maoist activities,” the statement pointed out.To eradicate these issues, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel-led Chhattisgarh government decided to adopt a camp strategy as per the local conditions for the development of Bastar division – moving away from the traditional methods.“This new strategy of governance is based on the principles of development, trust and security. To ensure an environment of security in the Maoist-affected interior areas, security-force camps were set up at various places,” the statement read.Furthermore, these special camps paved the way for the establishment and functioning of other camps as well. With the usage of mobile clinics of ‘Mukhyamantri Haat-Bazaar Clinic Yojna’ – medical camps have also begun in the Haat-bazaars of the interior areas, where the villagers are getting the facility of free examination, treatment and medicines. Several schools that were shut down due to Maoist activities in the interior areas have also been successfully reopened.English medium schools have also started at various places along with teaching in local dialects. These schools are being run under the ‘Swami Atmanand English Medium School Scheme’, in which free education is being offered to every student with facilities like private educational institutes.Due to the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, Chhattisgarh has gathered the maximum number of minor forests produces in the country. “Most of the minor forest produce in the state is collected in these seven districts of Bastar division. With better strategy, now the collection of minor forest produce is being done in a more systematic and organised manner,” the statement read, adding that forest dwellers do everything starting from collection to purchase.Self-help groups, in return, obtain these forest produces, and set up purchase camps in Haat-bazaars. “The enthusiasm of the villagers has increased due to the increase in the price of minor forest produce by the government and increasing the number of minor forest produce purchased on support price from seven to 52,” the government statement added.It said that after the minor forest produces are collected, they are processed locally, thereby helping in employment opportunities for the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/people-in-chhattisgarh-s-bastar-avail-of-govt-services-via-special-camps-101630778884185.html

Two pistols, ten live cartridges, two knives, four mobile phones and a stolen motorcycle have been recovered from their possession, said police. The suspects have been as identified Chandan Kumar (30), a resident of Gurugram, Sudhir Kumar (32), a resident of Hardoi, Amit, a 28-year-old resident of Kanpur and Rajesh Jinger (30), a resident of Rajasthan.Virendra Singh, senior sub-inspector of Phase 3 police station, said police received information that four illegal weapons smugglers would be meeting near Gadhi roundabout in Noida on Saturday. “Two suspects were waiting there while two others arrived on a motorcycle. A police team reached the spot and apprehended the four suspects,” said Singh. Police said the suspects stole the motorcycle from Niwari bus stand parking in Ghaziabad on August 29. The complainant, Sunil Kumar Sharma, said he parked his motorcycle at the bus stand and went to meet someone. When he returned after half an hour, he found his bike missing. A case of theft under Section 379 of the IPC was registered against unknown persons at Niwari police station in Ghaziabad. During interrogation, the suspects revealed they bought pistols from some people in Bhind in Madhya Pradesh. “The suspects used the stolen motorcycle to develop networks among people in villages. They used to strike a conversation with people and convince them to buy the weapon,” said Singh. Sometimes, police said, the suspects also connected with buyers on social media. “The suspects frequently changed their mobile numbers to escape surveillance. They used to buy each pistol for ₹14,000-20,000 and sell them for ₹35,000 – 40,000. They kept no record of the weapons sold to the people. They have been involved in this illegal activity for about two years,” said Singh. A case has been registered against them under Sections 4 and 25 of the Arms Act. The suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/illegal-weapon-racket-busted-4-held-in-noida-101630778605294.html
04-09-2021||Noida||8-foot-long python rescued from Noida’s Sector 127||An eight-foot-long adult Indian rock python was rescued on Thursday night after it was found crossing a busy road near Tech Boulevard in Noida’s Sector 127, said officials on Saturday. According to officials, a commuter informed about the python to the animal rescue and rehabilitation organisation Wildlife SOS. By the time a two-member team reached the spot, the snake wound itself around the branches of a tree on a road divider in Sector 127. One of the rescuers climbed up the tree to safely extricate the distressed snake, said officials. “The python is currently under observation centre in Delhi and will soon be released back into its natural habitat once deemed fit. We have decided to release it in an urban forest of Chhatarpur,” said a statement from Wildlife SOS. One of three subspecies of pythons found in India, the Indian rock python is the most common yet is a ‘near threatened’ species as per the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)-- an international organization working in the field of nature conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. This indigenous species of python is fast losing it’s habitat due to urbanisation and is poached for exotic pet trade or skin for fashion industry, said experts.The python is protected under Schedule-1 of the Indian Wildlife act 1972 and it is illegal to poach or kill the animal.According to the forest department, there are many rock pythons in Noida. “The reason why they are frequently spotted is because the region has several natural habitats for the python We urge people not to engage personally or harm them and inform the officials instead,” said Pramod Kumar Srivastav, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.Earlier too, in November 2019, a 12-ft long Indian rock python was rescued by the forest department from Sector-88. The python was later released in its natural habitat at Surajpur wetland.According to experts, Indian Rock Python can grow upto 24 feet and are an indicator species.“If it’s there, it indicates that even at a micro-level, there was a habitat to support it, along with prey. The Indian rock python feeds on large rodents, that also includes large rats. It’s a very non offensive species that won’t attack unless cornered. It may bite if one engages too much with it,” said Kartick Satynarayan, wildlfie expert and co-founder of Wildlife SOS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/8footlong-python-rescued-from-noida-s-sector-127-101630778424132.html

04-09-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Two women stabbed in 26 hours during sleep, police on lookout for ‘disturbed’ man||Panic has set in the Maharajpur locality in Sahibabad after two women, while they were sleeping, were allegedly attacked with a knife by an unidentified man over a span of 26 hours. Police have beefed up security in the area as they suspect a ‘psychologically disturbed’ man is on the rampage. According to police, in both the incidents, the assailant inflicted deep injuries to the faces of two women -- Shahnaz, 32, and Hasnuma Khatoon, 30. While Shahnaz sustained injury to the head in her ground floor house around 3.15pm on Thursday, Khatoon suffered a deep cut near her eye in her house on the third floor of a building around 5pm on Friday, police said, adding that both the victims are out of danger.Police said that they have registered an FIR under IPC section 307 (attempt to murder) following an assault on Shahnaz, while they lodged an FIR under IPC section 324 (causing hurt by dangerous means or weapons) in the second case. Both FIRs were lodged at Link Road police station. “The man entered my house quietly, picked up a knife and inflicted injury to my head before fleeing. The knife got stuck in my head. Locals rushed me to a doctor who referred me to a hospital in Vaishali. My husband was out for work when the incident took place,” Shahnaz said. Her husband Aslam Ansari, an e-rickshaw driver, rushed to the hospital when he got a call about the incident. “I almost fainted after seeing my wife bleeding profusely. But the doctors at the hospital pulled out the knife. I had left my house at 3.08pm as per the footage from a nearby CCTV camera. Nearly 15 minutes later, the assailant arrived and stabbed my wife,” he added. The family is from Banka district in Bihar. The second victim, Khatoon, a native of Madhepura in Bihar, is scared and not stepping out of her house. “I was sleeping in the bedroom when I felt a sharp pain. I thought that my children might have hurled something. Soon, I realised that it was a deep cut to my face with a knife... I could see the assailant fleeing. He had brought the knife with him and left it in my house,” Khatoon added. “I was taken to a doctor. At the clinic, people told me about the similar incident a day before. I am very scared now.” Mohammad Makhdoom Alam, Khatoon’s husband, said that the assailant tried to inflict deep injury before fleeing the spot. The couple stays in the house along with their two sons aged five and seven years. Police said they initially suspected some personal rivalry in the first case, but after the second similar incident in the same locality, they changed the line of investigation. “We suspect that the same unidentified man seen in the CCTV footage could be the assailant in both the cases. In both incidents, he assaulted the women when they were sleeping. It seems that the man is psychologically disturbed and he did not want to kill them. The two houses are located within a distance of about 250 metres. We have formed five teams to nab the suspect,” said Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2). The officials said that they have deployed policemen in plain clothes in the area and have also roped in informers to trace the suspect. “We are trying to trace the suspect. All the CCTV cameras in the area are being scanned,” said an officer from Link Road police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-two-women-stabbed-in-26-hours-during-sleep-police-on-lookout-for-disturbed-man-101630777884250.html
04-09-2021||Noida||GB Nagar DM to play for gold glory at Tokyo Paralympics||As soon as he got back from the stadium after making it to the finals of the men’s singles class SL4 badminton event at the Tokyo Paralympics on Saturday, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar and Indian shuttler Suhas LY called up his wife with a victory roar. Ritu Suhas, the DM’s wife, said that the world number 3 ranker screamed at the top of his lungs over a video call as he could not control his excitement of having secured a medal for India at the games.Suhas LY, who has been in action at the Tokyo Paralympics since September 2, conveniently sailed through his first two matches in the badminton group play, securing a position in the semifinals. On Saturday, he defeated Indonesia’s Fredy Setiawan by 21-9 21-15 during the semifinals, securing a medal for India. Now, the 38-year-old has set his sights on gold as he faces France’s top seed Lucas Mazur in the finals on Sunday. Even if Suhas loses the match, he will still bring home a silver medal.“I never watch any of Suhas’s matches live as it makes me very nervous. Today was very special as he secured a medal for India which has always been his dream,” said Ritu.Speaking to HT about her husband’s performance at the Paralympics, Ritu said it is the result of the sacrifices and struggles that her family has made in the last six years. “It has been Suhas’s dream, since the past six years, to represent India at the Paralympics. All the tournaments and championships he has played so far have been so that he could get selected for the global event,” said Ritu, who also holds the title of Mrs India 2019.Last year, when the outbreak of Covid-19 postponed the Games that were supposed to be held in 2020, Suhas, the 2007-batch IAS officer, felt that he has lost his chance, said Ritu.“Suhas had taken a six-month long leave from his administrative work in 2019 to train himself for the 2020 Paralympics and when they were postponed, he was very disheartened. Then he was given the charge of Gautam Budh Nagar district, where he discharged his duties with sincerity. When he got the chance to represent India at the Paralympics this year, he gave his all to get selected,” said Ritu.The couple has a six-year-old son and an eleven-year-old daughter. “Suhas used to go for his trainings late at night after wrapping work. Juggling in the two fronts affected our children as it meant they had to sacrifice their time with him. My son does not sleep without meeting his father and keeps asking when will he be back home,” she said.Narrating an incident, Ritu said once she was involved in a car accident in Lucknow but did not inform her husband about it as she did not want to disturb him during his training.“When he left for Tokyo, we did not discuss anything about what medal he will bring back. Badminton is his passion and we did not want to put any stress on him. However, I am proud of all that he has achieved for himself,” she said. Residents in Gautam Budh Nagar are also cheering for the DM ahead of his match on Sunday.“Residents’ whatsapp groups are buzzing with cheers for Suhas LY’s match on Sunday and the residents feel very proud of the district magistrate. As he has already secured a medal, our federation is organizing a felicitation event for him on September 19. No matter which medal he brings home, he has made the whole district very proud of him,” said Rajiva Singh, president of Noida Federation of Apartment Owner’s Association (NOFAA).At the DM’s camp office in Noida, officials are excited to watch the finals on Sunday. “The DM is an inspiration to not just the people of GB Nagar but the whole country. We are excited to watch his match on Sunday and will cheer him on,” said Vandita Srivastava, additional district magistrate (finance), GB Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-dm-to-play-for-gold-glory-at-tokyo-paralympics-101630777764122.html
04-09-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana lawyer lighting up slum children’s lives with education||Once a ragpicker, 12-year-old Munni wants to don the hat of deputy commissioner of Ludhiana. Braving all odds, this slum dweller now is an inspiration for people around her, courtesy Hariom Jindal. The 53-year-old lawyer from Kitchlu Nagar has managed to bring a radical change in the lives of at least 500 slum children he has taught for free since 2013. As one meets Munni, the unpleasant surroundings may once give a picture of her sorry state of living but only until she greets the person in fluent English. Such has been the impact of Jindal’s relentless efforts to impart free education to slum children. Passing by a garbage dump, Jindal had first seen a group of children collecting plastic from trash on Hambran Road eight years ago. Moved by their miseries, Jindal, who had an international shipping business, pledged to work for the poverty stricken kids and give them a bright future. “I shut my business down after meeting those poor kids and pursued a degree in law. I was resolved that I would dedicate my life to impart education to underprivileged children who remain deprived of basic life amenities. Today, these kids are as smart as any other student of their age,” Jindal said.He added that the group of ragpickers he had met then were now well-trained computer experts, well versed with their fundamental rights, functioning of the government and even the Constitution of India. Jindal is currently running three slum schools in Ludhiana’s Hambran Road, Sai Baba Mandir Road and Nau Gaja Peer Road areas, where he teaches over 150 students with the help of five more teachers. He is also running a computer centre to make his students tech-savvy. He teaches students up to Class 8 through the National Open School and is willing to help those who want to pursue further education. “Young kids are begging on the streets, but no one bothers. The administration makes tall claims of working with various children organisations, but things move only on papers and these kids continue to remain deprived of their basic rights. I wish to see India free of poverty before I die,” Jindal said. Sunny, who passed Class 5 this year, said, “I want to change the fate of my family by becoming a police officer. I am grateful to Jindal sir for saving our lives and pulling us out of the darkness.”On the occasion of the Teachers’ Day, Munni, who studies in Class 5, said she would clear the civil services examination and that would be the best gift to her teacher. “Now, my neighbours ask me to teach their kids and I am a star among them,” Munni said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-lawyer-lighting-up-slum-children-s-lives-with-education-101630777705364.html

04-09-2021||Mumbai||If we don’t plan today, we won’t be able to produce even a toy plane, says Suresh Prabhu||For quarter of a century, India has been working towards indigenously manufacturing passenger aircraft with little or no success despite the country’s large aviation market.This ambition once again got a boost in February this year when Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) received a modification document of its manufactured 19-seater multipurpose light transport Dornier-228 (upgraded) civil aircraft from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for UDAN scheme. The aircraft is currently being used by the defence forces. Recently, the aviation regulator gave ‘certificate of airworthiness’ to this aircraft paving the way for its civil use.India is home to the world’s ninth largest $16-billion civil aviation market. Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the joint Indo-US business conclave in July last year had said India needs at least 1,000 medium-capacity aircraft for regional air connectivity and invited investors to come forward.Before this, former civil aviation minister Suresh Prabhu had in early 2019 announced that India would roll out a road map for manufacturing aircraft in the domestic market, and was open to join hands with top global players.Aviation experts said the idea to produce local passenger aircraft has become all the more significant given the Centre’s thrust on local manufacturing with missions like Make-in-India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat.However, a former DGCA official said the main issue is that the country till date does not have a design for any narrow-body or medium range turboprop except the Dornier aircraft. “Manufacturing of an aircraft is a later stage, firstly we need to come up with a prototype. Take the design approval from DGCA, build the prototype, get it certified and then start manufacturing,” he said. “Cost is also a major issue as each Dornier 2 certified aircraft (of HAL) came up at a massive cost of ₹55-crore, an amount in which a scheduled or non-scheduled operator can bring in three aircraft,” the official said.Moreover, HAL-produced aircraft was unpressurised which means it had height restrictions for flying. “So even if the aircraft performance is good and it is fuel-efficient, there would be issues in case the aircraft has to fly over hilly terrains. These were its drawbacks. Hence we need pressurized aircraft to start with 70-90 seater turboprop followed by Jet.”Even as a section of experts say this is the best time for the country to take a plunge and realise its long-cherished dream of having its aircraft, another section is of the view that the plan will not pay-off unless India achieves critical mass for such a high-capital intensive industry.“It (domestic manufacturing of aircraft) is a great idea but there are numerous challenges. It is important to build the Indian civilian aerospace industry by removing a large number of entry barriers which are a big challenge,” said Dhiraj Mathur, former partner at PwC, a global consultancy firm. “We have tried to manufacture these planes. Various efforts have been made over a period of time by NAL or National Aerospace Laboratory (to make a passenger plane) but the attempts have not been successful as designing and manufacturing aircraft is not easy.”Story of India’s indigenous aircraft developmentThe idea of giving a thrust on aircraft development in the country was mooted by former President late Dr APJ Abdul Kalam during his association with the premier Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).The project took of the ground in 1991 with NAL teaming up with a Russian partner. The foreign entity however pulled out of the project mid-way, leaving it in a limbo. In 1999, the then Government gave its go-ahead to NAL, under Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) to build on its own a multi-purpose aircraft, Saras, named after an Indian bird.NAL designed and developed the first prototype of the aircraft from scratch, which made its first flight on May 29, 2004. This marked the beginning of the indigenous civil aircraft program in the country. However, after an improved version of the aircraft met with an accident in 2009, the project was once again put on a pause button.In 2010, the then Government set up a 15-member high-level committee under former ISRO chief G Madhavan Nair to explore feasibility of manufacturing a passenger aircraft locally, which submitted its report in 2011.In 2017, the government announced a programme for development of a 90-seater aircraft in two phases- design and development, and manufacturing with private sector participation with an estimated budgetary requirements of ₹7,555 crore, reviving Saras project after approving certain modifications to the cockpit and cabin formation.On January 2, an upgraded Saras undertook high-speed taxi trial at Bangalore’s HAL airport. According to the revived plan, Saras will be used as a test aircraft for the development of Saras Mk2, a 19-seater transport aircraft. CSIR has already started working on the design of the indigenous next-generation commuter transport aircraft to be used for the Government’s UDAN scheme.What will it take to manufacture an indigenous aircraftAccording to Prabhu, the aviation ministry had prepared a roadmap in 2019, presenting a broad overview on how aircraft manufacturing should happen in India because Boeing had said it might manufacture aircraft in India. Admitting that manufacturing aircraft is not an ‘easy task’ as millions of components go into it, he said, “The idea was that we need to develop an ecosystem in the form of manufacturing various parts of an aircraft which finally get into the end-product. The plan, to begin with, was that original equipment manufacturers would be manufacturing the components at the companies overseas and may sell them too.”Prabhu added,”Once that critical mass comes in, then the eventual assembly will happen for a simple reason that the market is here,” he said. Prabhu said he had personally gone to Airbus in France to discuss the plan in detail with them, adding, “It (these talks) needs follow up actions, but I am not aware if it was done,” he said.Emphasising that the government without private sector participation can’t manufacture an aircraft, former DGCA official said, “Inputs from airports and private entities will have to be taken into consideration to successfully manufacture an aircraft. Even if we start in 2022, I don’t think that an aircraft will be available for airlines in the next 8-9 years as the certification process itself takes five years for big aircraft and three years for smaller ones and this is defined in all the country’s regulations.”Emphasizing that not all countries are in the business of aircraft manufacturing , Mathur said that one way of doing it is to talk to (existing) aircraft makers for manufacturing and outsourcing. More than being complicated, the main thing is that one needs demand and the market for these planes. “But the market has always been the same,” Mathur said. He said that the general slowdown in the last 5-6 years coupled with the ongoing pandemic is going to be a major gap creator.“Aircraft making needs 10-15 years of planning as the ecosystem has to be developed. So, the present state of the economy cannot be looked at if you are looking at 10-15 years ahead in time. If you don’t plan today, knowing today’s economic situation, then you will never be able to manufacture even a toy aircraft,” Prabhu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/if-we-don-t-plan-today-we-won-t-be-able-to-produce-even-a-toy-plane-says-suresh-prabhu-101630776986566.html

04-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 4th railway line between Kalyan and Asangaon on CR cards||To boost local train connectivity of Mumbai with the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Central Railway (CR) will begin construction work of a fourth railway line between Kalyan and Asangaon railway stations.Construction work for a new railway platform to accommodate 15 compartment local trains, along with extension of the existing platforms and construction of a new foot overbridge will be undertaken by the Central Railway post-monsoon.The 26km of new railway line from Kalyan to Asangaon railway station is a part of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP) 3A. The project is expected to cost ₹1,759 crore.Once completed, the Central Railway will be able to operate additional local train services along with 15 compartment train services between Kalyan and Asangaon railway stations. The zonal railway will also be able to increase local train services between the two railway stations as presently only two railway lines are operational. “The construction work will be carried out in connection with the 15 compartment work beyond Kalyan railway station,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer, Central Railway.The existing railway lines operate local, outstation and freight trains. Kalyan railway station on the Central Railway is a busy station as it operates both suburban and outstation trains. Before the pandemic 500,000 commuters travelled daily from Kalyan and 200,000 passengers commuted daily from Asangaon railway station.“Segregation of outstation and local trains will be possible once the construction work is completed and crossovers have been laid. This would help in decongesting the train traffic at Kalyan railway station significantly,” said a senior Central Railway official.Urban planners have stated that as the population has moved towards north of Mumbai, the railway line corridor will help in decongestion of the existing stressed railway network.“The commencement of the work on the railway line is a positive step as the population has shifted from south Mumbai towards the northern part of the city. The railway lines will help in segregation of outstation and local trains and reduce congestion. However, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) should undertake land development either industrial or commercial around the area to create jobs for people residing there,” said urban planner Sulakshana Mahajan.Passenger associations have cited that the construction of the railway lines should be done speedily. “Mumbai is overburdened and it is the need of the hour to construct the new railway lines as people are shifting outside the city. The work on the project should be done quickly,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.Meanwhile, a MUTP approved project for segregation of outstation and local train traffic by creation of two railway lines between CSMT and Kurla railway stations has hit a roadblock. The project — fifth and sixth railway lines that was approved in 2010 has not yet been completed and has land acquisition issues ahead of Parel railway station. The Central Railway is undertaking construction for the additional railway lines between Kurla and Parel and reconstruction work of a bridge near Sion railway station. The zonal railway has now written to the Maharashtra government to assist in the construction work of the railway line beyond Parel railway station.“Construction work on phase one of the project up till Parel is going on. However, we have written to the state government seeking assistance for the railway lines ahead of Parel. Land acquisition issue is a concern for the construction of railway lines ahead of Parel. If the acquisition issue is cleared the railway lines will likely be brought to the P’D Mello entrance of CSMT.” said a senior Central Railway official.Transport experts have stated that the railways should look into the requirement of having the fifth and sixth railway line up to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT).“As people are unable to afford housing in the city, the construction of the fourth railway line will help ease the bottleneck for people residing ahead of Kalyan, Asangaon and Kasara. The railways should look into the requirement of the fifth- sixth railway line up till CSMT. Trains on the Central Railway could terminate at Kurla and on the Western Railway at Bandra. Terminating all outstation trains in the island city should be restricted. A thorough geographic study and checking of commuting patterns needs to be undertaken.” said transport expert AV Shenoy.Passenger associations have stated that they have raised the concern for the construction of the railway lines between CSMT and Kurla and have asked the railway officials to complete the project soon. “We have discussed with the railway officials on the pending construction work of the railway lines that would segregate the local and outstation train traffic. The project should be completed soon in coordination with the state government.” added Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-4th-railway-line-between-kalyan-and-asangaon-on-cr-cards-101630776804633.html
04-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: FYJC second merit list out, no major dip in cut-offs||The second general merit list for first-year junior college (FYJC) seats was announced on Saturday morning with overall cut-off in top colleges dipping by 0.2% to 1.5%. A total of 60,037 students have been allotted seats in the second admission round and these students have time until September 6 to submit appropriate documents and confirm admissions.“Of the 60,037 students allotted seats in the second merit list, 13,282 have been allotted colleges of their first preference, 11,075 students have been allotted seats in the second preference college and 8,398 students have been placed in colleges of their third preference,” said an official statement released by the office of deputy director of education, Mumbai region.Cut-offs across popular colleges in the city remained on the higher side, with many witnessing less than a percent point dip compared to the first merit list. At Narsee Monjee College in Vile Parle, the commerce cut-off ended at 93.4%, which is 0.6% point less than the first merit list. At St Xavier’s College, the arts list dipped by 1.2% point whereas the science list ended at 91%, which is 1.8% point lower than the first merit list. Similarly, at VG Vaze College in Mulund, cut-offs in science and commerce streams dipped a percent point or less compared to the previous list. But surprisingly, cut-offs for arts shot up by one percent point, from 89% in the first merit list to 90% in the second. “Student were given the choice to change their college preference list after the first round, so our second merit list ended at a higher cut-off,” said an official from the institute.“Cut-offs were going to stay above 90% across top colleges because Class 10 students have scored very well this year across various school education boards. While students are confirming admissions at present, colleges are all worried that withdrawal of admissions will begin once common rounds are over and students will get the chance to approach individual colleges for admissions,” said the principal of a south Mumbai College.A total of 1.17 lakh FYJC hopefuls were allotted seats in the first merit list on August 27. However, over 50% of these students, including a large chunk of those who were allotted colleges of their first preference did not confirm admissions after the first round this year. After the first round of seat allotment, students were given another chance to re-fill their college preference forms and become eligible for the second merit list.“Surprisingly, even those students who have been allotted seats in colleges of their first preference are not accepting admissions, and this is a worrying trend. We are hopeful of cut-offs dipping in the third merit list, so students should not lose hope,” said Ashok Wadia, principal of Jai Hind College, Churchgate.Due to rising Covid-19 cases, many school education boards decided to scrap Class 10 board exams this year and instead promoted students based on their performance in the current academic year as well as their performance in Class 9. This helped push the overall score of lakhs of students across boards to a higher bracket and several schools highlighted an increase in students scoring 90% and above in their batches. As per information shared by the Maharashtra state board, the number of students scoring 90% and above stood at 6.34% (1.04 lakh) in the state, as compared to 5.08% (83,262) in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-fyjc-second-merit-list-out-no-major-dip-in-cutoffs-101630776744962.html

Deputy commissioner of police (airport) Vikram Porwal said the three were arrested when police was investigating a case of four men from western Uttar Pradesh, who were deported from Armenia last week. “On the intervening night of August 25 and 26, four passengers were deported from Yerevan, Armenia. After scrutinising their passports, we found that they had left from Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport for Armenia on the basis of e-visas of the Republic of Armenia. They were refused entry at Yerevan airport on the grounds of holding other persons’ visas. We registered a case and arrested the four men,” said Porwal. The four men-- from Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh--was lured by one Mehboob Khan, who is also originally from UP. During questioning, the four men said that they got the visas from an agent named Saif after paying ₹1.50 lakh. “We arrested Saif from Delhi’s Okhla, who disclosed the names of his accomplices-- Mahesh Kumar from Gurugram and Mehboob Khan from Muzaffarnagar. Khan runs a ticketing a shop in Delhi’s Taimoor Nagar,” said Porwal. Police said so far, they have arrested 44 men for forging documents and cheating and have launched a drive to find such suspects, who dupe people looking for jobs abroad. “Last year, police arrested 55 such agents, who specialised in passport and visa fraud,” said Porwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi44-held-for-forging-passports-and-visas-this-year-101630776684927.html

04-09-2021||Mumbai||Pocso court sentences 30-year-old to 5 years in jail||A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) court on Friday sentenced a 30-year-old to five years of imprisonment and fined him ₹15,000 for assaulting a minor girl by kissing her in a lift.According to the prosecution, the incident took place on December 27, 2016 at 8.30pm when the 10-year-old girl was heading to a friend’s residence on a lower floor of the same building.Special public prosecutor Geeta Sharma pointed out that when the minor took the lift from eleventh floor to visit a friend on the ninth floor, the accused was already present in the lift and as soon as the lift door closed he pulled the girl towards him by touching her back and kissed her.In the CCTV footage, the girl was seen struggling to release herself from the clutches of the accused who stayed in the same building.The accused had argued that he had kissed the child out of love and affection and there was no sexual intention behind it as he was impotent. After going through the CCTV footage, the court, however, said the accused did not deserve any leniency as the victim was dejected, frightened and hurt after the incident.Defence counsel Shakuntala Sharma had tried to prove before special Pocso judge Bharti Kale that the accused was mentally ill, impotent and was taking treatment. He had also taken a stand that when the incident happened the man had beard and moustache and it was not him.However, the special court after going through the CCTV footage noted that the accused had held the girl very tightly and the minor was seen struggling and opposing. The court also took into consideration medical report that showed that the accused had no major mental conditions and was conscious, oriented to time, place and person.

The court observed that it was question of common knowledge that pedestrians are not supposed to cross roads unless there is a zebra crossing.The incident took place on August 10, 2017, when Mudrika Harishchandra Kamble, 60, was trying to cross Eastern Express Highway near Kamraj Nagar and a vehicle hit her and fled from the spot.Kamble was first taken to Rajawadi Hospital and later shifted to Rubi Hall Clinic in Pune, where she died three days later.Pant Nagar police had registered a case in the matter against unknown accused under sections 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 304A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code.The police later traced the driver of the scooter as Hemant Hatkar and arrested him.Metropolitan magistrate SS Parave of Vikhroli court acquitted Hatkar mainly in view of absence of direct evidence against him. The court, however, observed that the prosecution has not placed on record any evidence to show that the accused had hit Kamble.The court observed that the spot panchnama shows that the incident took place in the middle of the road when Kamble was crossing the road and there was nothing on record which makes clear that at the spot of incident there was a zebra crossing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-acquits-biker-accused-in-hit-and-run-case-101630776386071.html

They had challenged the jurisdiction of the Jammu branch of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to register FIRs and probe these cases. The petitions were dismissed, with the court holding that the CBI had acted on the directions of the Supreme Court. The CBI had charge-sheeted the cops for alleged abduction and killing of innocent persons in Punjab during that period. The cases were registered in 1997 on incident of disappearance of a youth in Amritsar, with the charge-sheet being filed in 1999. The trial got held-up with these cops challenging the proceedings. With this, the trial would resume at Mohali CBI special court now. The main argument was that CBI did not have territorial jurisdiction to register the case in Jammu as all the alleged incidents were related to Punjab. The complainants had argued that they are habitual of filing repeated petitions, only to delay the trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fir-on-disappearance-of-youth-no-relief-to-ex-cops-from-hc-101630776324610.html

The accused has been named in 28 criminal cases and convicted in at least eight cases, the police said.The arrested accused, Iqbal Abbas Shaikh, was released from Pune’s Yerwada jail after serving three years sentence on September 1, following which he went to his mother-in-law Shamal Shigam’s house in Pitalewadi, Vile Parle to meet his wife Leena and two children.Shaikh was informed by his wife that she had married another person, who could take care of her and the children. Shaikh said he wanted to restart afresh with her and the kids and left, saying he would come again on Thursday.“When he came back next day, he found that Leena had left the house along with the children. When Shaikh asked Shigam about her whereabouts she did not tell him anything. This angered Shaikh who then started beating her. Shaikh smashed her head with a tile block and attacked her with a knife and had fled the spot,” said a police officer. Vile Parle police detection officers suspected Shaikh’s role in the crime owing to his presence in the area on Thursday and launched a manhunt for him. He was subsequently arrested from Pune.

04-09-2021||Mumbai||Central agencies were never used like this against opposition leaders, says Sharad Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government over alleged misuse of central investigation agencies. He said central agencies were never used in the past the way it is being used now to silence opposition leaders in many states across the country. He said the problem is not limited only to Maharashtra and opposition leaders in many states have been targeted.Pawar was reacting over the action of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against ministers and leaders from Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA). “Central agencies were never used like this in the country in the past. It appears that the existing (BJP) government is using them to silence the opposition parties; hence not only Maharashtra but Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and many states in southern India are facing similar situations. We are talking here since we know people related to our state but the problem is not limited to Maharashtra,” Pawar said.Many senior leaders such as transport minister Anil Parab, MP Bhavana Gawali and MLA Pratap Sarnaik (Shiv Sena), former home minister Anil Deshmukh, Eknath Khadse (NCP), among others have got notices from ED. In the case of Anil Deshmukh, both the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and ED are investigating allegations of extortion against him.He also criticised the BJP for demanding reopening of temples in the state. Pawar said they were expecting consonance from those who follow the BJP-led government at the Centre as they directed the state to take precautions in the backdrop of potential third wave threat looming large. “The Central government has issued guidelines and directed the state to take precautions for some more time, which the state government and chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) decided to follow. Others may have a different opinion, and in a democratic set up, it is their right to raise their voice. But those who follow the Central government should have shown consonance as the state government is following their directives. I don’t want to say more on this,” the veteran leader said.The former Union agriculture minister added that the lathicharge on farmers in Haryana is a serious matter. “But more than that, the farmers are on agitation for the past 14 months, regardless of winter, summer and monsoon season. If our rulers were sensitive, they should have taken a cognisance of this, but unfortunately the agrarian community is neglected,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/central-agencies-were-never-used-like-this-against-opposition-leaders-says-sharad-pawar-101630775904709.html

Sharma, 51, wants to change the impression that government schools have poor infrastructure and dull teaching methodology. He has painted science diagrams, solar and lunar eclipses and mathematics shapes on walls of the school for encouraging students to learn in an innovative way along with tagging QR codes on plants and creating a library for enriching knowledge of students.“During lockdown, we used to visit school in the absence of students. Utilising leisure time, I painted walls of schools and turned them into teaching-learning material. The creative art attracts students and has created a distinguished identity of my school,” he said. Dutt has been selected for the award in recognition of her efforts made for promoting girls’ education. She is an English teacher at Government Middle School at Rajnagar in Mahbubani. Recalling her initial years of career, Dutt said, “When I joined the school in 2005, there was no girl student in the class. When I enquired the reason, I learnt that villagers were reluctant to send their daughter to schools owing to their poverty and illiteracy.”“I started paying visits in nearby localities after school hours to encourage minority communities and poor families to send their girls to schools. My hard work paid off with time. At present, of 900 enrolled students, 60% are girls”, said Dutt, who is also a writer.“I stay in touch with students who have graduated from the school. Some girls have started their own coaching centres while some have qualified competitive exams. I feel satisfied that despite studying with limited resources, my students are doing well”, she said.The state education department has selected 20 teachers for state-level award this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/teachers-day-bihar-man-who-painted-a-universe-on-classroom-walls-set-for-award-101630772244533.html
04-09-2021||Patna||NAAC grading: Bihar considers fixing accountability on laggard institutions||The Bihar State Higher Education Council (BSHEC) has recommended strong measures for boosting accreditation of state institutions of higher learning, which includes fixing accountability on laggard ones and linking performance with promotion and development funds from the state. It has also advocated that Bihar’s state universities must have representatives of industries/employment agencies as members of the board of studies and implement the much-delayed choice-based credit system (CBCS) and semester system.An expert committee constituted by BSHEC over a month ago and headed by Lalit Natayan Mithila University (Darbhanga) pro vice chancellor Dolly Sinha, in its report submitted a few days ago, has said that lack of accountability was a cause of concern and linking it with promotion or any other suitable measure was necessary to increase involvement of institutions for certification from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). The report also advocated a state-level accreditation council and compulsory SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunities and threat) analysis by all institutions and submission of reports to the NAAC committee of the BSHEC for further action.Under the New Education Policy (NEP), accreditation is a basic requirement, linked to funding. Since 2013, when the central government linked accreditation as a mandatory requirement for (Rashtriya Uchchtar Shiksha Abhiyan) RUSA funding, there has been a rush by institutions to get accredited, but Bihar has been slow on this count. Under the NEP, a new body called National Accreditation Council (NAC), instead of NAAC, has been planned, with several accreditation institutions at the regional level. Many institutions in Bihar got poor grades in the past due to severe shortage of teachers, poor student feedback, inadequate infrastructure and lack of research.The state continues to fare poorly in the ranking of institutions by NAAC despite the fact that all institutions have to get accredited by next year. At the start of 2021, the total number of NAAC-accredited colleges was less than 100 in the state. This includes just six in the A-grade. The number of accredited colleges was 107 last year. Bihar has 250 constituent colleges and an even higher number of affiliated or private colleges.The committee has recommended that there was a growing need to do classification of colleges as per their accreditation status and make institutions go in for assessment l either by motivation, incentives or punitive action.If development fund is linked to NAAC report and grading, majority of the state institutions today will be deprived of it or may witness substantial reduction due to poor grading and just absence of assessment. At present, just one of the state universities, Patna University, is accredited. Accreditation of six other universities has lapsed.One can well imagine the state of higher education when the 156-year old Patna College, the oldest institution under Patna University, and 132-year-old BN College have been ranked ‘C’ by NAAC. Many institution ranked ‘A’ earlier have also slipped due to stringent NAAC framework. The BSHEC had to recently request NAAC for giving six-month extension to Bihar institutions for applying in view of Covid disruptions, as many of them could not even apply on time.According to figures available with the BSHEC, the number of accredited colleges in Bihar as on December 31, 2020, was 96. The committee has recommended that institutions be categorised on the basis of NAAC - first comprising those which have never applied for accreditation, second including those with expiry of first, second or third cycle and third comprising those which have their accreditation due.“The current status of NAAC accredited institution is very low, with very few institution completing third cycle. Majority of the institutions have completed just first cycle, while many have done not even that due to hesitancy. Some colleges got ‘A’ grade in 2014 but never went in for the second cycle, while several other big colleges ended up with very poor grade, indicating lack of preparedness, adaptation and modernisation. Under revised framework of NAAC, many colleges for degraded.there is an urgent need to change this trend and it requires proper coordination between the state government and the institutions. Accountability also needs to be fixed on part of laggard institutions and it could be linked to promotion to ensure better involvement,” said the committee report.With an aim to improving the gross enrolment ratio (GER) and quality in higher education centres, the BSHEC was constituted as a basic requirement under the Rashtriya Uchchatara Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA). The BSHEC has been given the responsibility of suggesting a roadmap for implementation of the new education policy (NEP) in the higher education sphere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/naac-grading-bihar-considers-fixing-accountability-on-laggard-institutions-101630772064540.html

Of the five deceased, four are children. They were identified as Ravindra Prasad (40), Deventi Kumari (12), Anshu Kumar (10), Kallu Kumar (6) and Priyanshu Kumar (5). On Saturday, agitated villagers blocked Motihari-Pakaridayal road for hours in protest. “Before these two children, two other children and an adult member of my family suffered similar complications, including pain in stomach, and died before they could be taken to the hospital,” said Sarita Devi, aunt of the deceased children. Dr Sharvan Paswan, in charge of public health centre at Motihari, while talking to reporters, confirmed four deaths in the family, two on September 1 and two on September 4, while pleading ignorance about the exact date of the fifth death. “The family members put faith on exorcists,” he said, adding that food poisoning or snake bite could have been possible reasons. However, Dr Anil Sinha, deputy superintendent (in-charge), Sadar hospital at Motihari, said it could well be a mysterious disease. “Blood clots were noticed on the nasal passage and mouth of the deceased. The autopsy report is still inconclusive. We have preserved the viscera of the deceased for examination by forensic experts,” he said.

After verifying the allegations, the agency laid a trap in the wee hours on Saturday and caught him red-handed with ₹1 lakh he had taken in bribe. The CBI also conducted searches at the office and residential premises of the accused in Kapurthala and Jaipur, which led to recovery of incriminating documents, officials said. The senior RCF officials denied any specific information related to the tender works for which the money was sought by the accused. They said a departmental probe will be launched into the matter, adding that they were yet to receive any communication from the CBI regarding the charges and arrest of Meena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cbi-arrests-rcf-kapurthala-principal-chief-engineer-for-graft-101630770024345.html

From there, she went missing. This incident happened almost 12 years back. A case was filed in the Gorakhpur police station of UP. But, Aitbariya couldn't be found anywhere," the Jharkhand government statement said.Aitbariya is a resident of Masmona village under the Bhandara police station of Lohardaga. As per the details, from UP she was taken to Haryana and later sent to Nepal.The development comes close on the heels of the Jharkhand government rescuing a septuagenarian, identified as Fucha Mahli, after he spent 35 years working as a virtual bonded labour in Andaman and Nicobar islands."Our government is committed to rescue every single child. We have suffered enough with this menace but not anymore. If the case is related to trafficking, I warn traffickers to stay away from our state otherwise, they will be dealt with the strictest action," chief minister Hemant Soren said.The statement said the state government took immediate steps to bring her back after information about her staying at an ashram in Nepal emerged through a tweet by someone in Nepal.Minister Champai Soren brought the tweet to the notice of the Jharkhand State Migration Control Room and the chief minister who released a strict order to work on the issue with utmost priority.The state government coordinated with the embassies of Nepal and India to ensure her safe return, the statement said adding after video conferencing and calls to her mother and elder sister, it was confirmed that she is the daughter of Late Birsa Oraon.Her father is no more, while her mother and other members of the family had lost all hopes of her return.After making all arrangements, the Lohardaga district administration was directed to arrange for her return from Delhi to Lohardaga.A district official, accompanied by Aitbarya's elder sister and brother-in-law, has gone to Delhi.

04-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 4,130 new cases, sees rise in active Covid cases||Maharashtra on Saturday added 4,130 fresh Covid-19 cases, while the state’s active case count saw a jump, taking it tally to 52,025 from 50,466 on Friday. Mumbai, for the fourth day, has reported over 400 fresh cases with 413 new infections.Experts warned that though overall the curve may have stabilised, the fresh cases are going up in some urban centers, including Mumbai and Pune. They also said these are “early signs” of a possible third wave of Covid infection and the state must impose some restrictions looking at the festive season.Meanwhile, Maharashtra administered over 1.1 million doses in a day on Saturday, the state health department said. “Today we bettered our previous best and in a single day [with] 1,161,141 doses of Covid vaccine administered till 6pm. Final figures could be still more,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health). Data on the Co-Win portal showed that Maharashtra had administered 1,192,556 doses till 7pm. The state could go past 1.2 million doses, health department officials said. However, the final numbers are awaited.The state reported 64 deaths on Saturday due to Covid-19, taking the toll to 137,707. Mumbai, meanwhile, added four deaths, taking its toll closer to 16,000 at 15,991. Cities and areas in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region added 538 fresh cases with Kalyan-Dombivli topping with 113 cases, followed by Navi Mumbai (86), Panvel (68), Thane rural (56), and Thane city (54).A look at the state’s Covid-19 data of the past seven days showed that the daily positivity rate is creeping up gradually. On August 28, the daily positivity rate was 2.41%, while increased to 2.44% on August 30, 2.56% on August 31, 2.69% on September 3.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, technical advisor to the state on Covid-19, said that the state is at a “critical stage” now and the municipal and district administration must step up the surveillance to detect cases faster before spread increases.“We. as a country, and particularly Maharashtra, are in a critical stage now. The cases are increasing in the state, especially in Mumbai, Pune and some other cities. We need to intensify surveillance and contact tracing. Even if the numbers are less, we must increase surveillance so that it does not spread in more areas. Testing also should be targeted,” Salunkhe said.Salunkhe also blamed citizens for the rise in cases. “People have started moving out and are taking things casually. Despite understanding the seriousness of the situation, we see people not wearing masks. Social distancing has now gone for a toss,” he said.The state government is concerned due to the forthcoming Ganpati festival as there are indications that the numbers may surge during the festive season. However, there is no plan to introduce any fresh restrictions before or during the Ganeshotsav festival in the state.State health minister Rajesh Tope on Friday said that there is no plan for any new lockdown in Maharashtra in the coming days. He, however, said that all residents should continue to follow safety protocols. “There is no possibility of fresh lockdown in the near future. I appeal to people to avoid crowding while celebrating the Ganesh festival. The celebration should be simple,” Tope said.Salunkhe said that the state must look at early signs and introduce some restrictions during the festive season. “Looking at early signs, which are indicative of a third wave soon, we must introduce some restrictions. We must not allow people to come out in large numbers during festivals like Ganpati, Navratri, and then Diwali,” Dr Salunkhe said.Meanwhile, on the occasion of the centenary year celebration of Topiwala National Medical College and BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced ₹100 crore for the civic-run hospital. Thackeray lauded the efforts of the hospital management through the pandemic and said that it has been able to keep up with the changes in medical science and provide effective health services by adapting to modern technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-4-130-new-cases-sees-rise-in-active-covid-cases-101630767984608.html

04-09-2021||Pune||Rs3 crore vegetable market in amenity space in Pune’s Kondhwa Budruk lying unused for two years||PUNE The Punyashlok Ahilyabai Holkar Vegetable Market and Multipurpose Centre, constructed in the amenity space of survey number 41 near VIT chowk in Kondhwa Budruk at a cost of Rs3 crore, has been lying unused under lock and key for the past two years. The vegetable market has 32 mini stalls or shops for vegetable vendors and five state-of-the-art auditoriums. As none of the stalls has been allotted, vegetable vendors are not allowed to sell vegetables at these shops, causing severe losses to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) exchequer.Local resident Sangita Shinde said that the market was constructed to cater to the needs of the residents while the auditoriums were built so that people could assemble for academic and other cultural programmes. “Currently, however, no vegetable vendor is allowed to sell vegetables as the stalls are yet to be allotted. We demand an early completion of the process as it is already two years and citizens have to go a long distance to buy vegetables despite having a vegetable market that is very near and convenient to us.”Ever since the market and multipurpose centre was inaugurated by the then state minister Bala Bhegade at the time of the 2019 assembly elections, not a single transaction has taken place, according to residents. What’s more, the vegetable vendors currently occupying the road in Kondhwa gaothan have emerged as a major bottleneck due to vehicular traffic and two-wheelers parked by buyers on both sides. So much so that residents have threatened agitations if the vegetable market is not commissioned at the earliest.Meanwhile, PMC vegetable market inspector for the Kondhwa and Hadapsar divisions, Ashwini Bhagwat, said, “It is a newly constructed market in Kondhwa Budruk and the process of allotment of stalls is currently in progress. Within one month, the official process will be completed following which the stalls will be allocated to vendors. All efforts are being undertaken at the administrative level to solve the issue.”The issue of misutilisation of amenity spaces in Pune has come to the fore after the PMC general body led by the BJP passed a resolution to lease amenity spaces for a term of 99 years. The decision has been vehemently opposed by opposition parties and in particular by civil society and citizens’ rights groups that have gone to the high court seeking a stay on the decision. Also, the BJP has levelled allegations that the actual privatisation and leasing of spaces began under the former Congress government where their leaders stand accused of not paying rent over Rs53.30 crore while others have taken public amenity properties at very nominal rates due to their strong political standing in former municipal body amenity spaces as per the Act.Amenity spaces, as per development control (DC) rules, are statutory spaces kept in the layout to be used for amenities such as open spaces, parks, recreational grounds, playgrounds, sports complexes, gardens, convenience shopping, parking lots, primary and secondary schools, nurseries, health clubs, dispensaries, nursing homes, hospitals, sub-post offices, police stations, electric substations, ATMs of banks, electronic cyber libraries, open markets, garbage bins, assisted living and hospice together, senior citizens’ housing and orphanages together, project-affected persons’ housing, auditoriums, conventional centres, water supply, electricity supply and other utilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rs3-crore-vegetable-market-in-amenity-space-in-pune-s-kondhwa-budruk-lying-unused-for-two-years-101630767084187.html

Breaking all such stereotypes, Sanna Masood, 35, a biotechnologist with a Masters in Business Administration, has been helping orchardists in remote areas of Kashmir adopt progressive farming and maximise their profits. Currently serving as the chief executive officer and managing director of the post-harvest division of Farm2U, a leading cold storage chain in Kashmir, Sanna puts into use her knowledge of plant biotechnology and plant tissue culture to guide the farmers.She also leads a team of 300 people, who specialise in high-density plantation and work towards bringing innovation in the horticulture sector, which is the Valley’s largest trade. “I guide orchardists about fruits they can put in coldstores. Many of them are surprised when they see a young woman give tips on establishing high-density orchards. But for women farmers, my presence is reassuring,” says Sanna, who has been encouraging more women to take up horticulture and agriculture, a trade that has been largely dominated by men until now, in the Valley. In 2013, she founded Seed Solutions, to help empower women in fields, but suffered a setback due to floods in the Valley. “We have started the project again and successfully trained three women in progressive farming. Their success is encouraging more women towards this field. But there is still a long way to go.” The 35-year-old has also been part of several women’s initiatives in Kashmir, such as the launch of scooty scheme, Hunarmand, an embroidery cluster for more than 114 women, and Zainab scheme, flood rehabilitation for more 150 craftswomen. “Despite being part of a big group, I have continued to work in women’s initiatives, especially in rural Kashmir. My initiatives have helped hundreds of women and made them self-reliant in the field of agriculture and horticulture. “Under two schemes, Thimram and Vestaun, we have established women clusters in medicinal plants --70 women in Shangus Anantnag and 57 women farmers in four villages of Pulwama district-- to help them earn a livelihood.” Daughter of renowned artist Masood Hussain, Sana grew up in the post locality of Jawaharnagar. “Though there were no farms or orchards where I grew up, my first tryst with plants was in the small garden in my house. Even as a child, I was fascinated with plants, seeds, flowers and anything that was close to nature.” She credits her parents and sister for all her success. “My family has always stood by me. Sometimes, my parents used to accompany me when I had to go far-off places in the mountains to learn organic farming.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/emblems-of-empowerment-sowing-seeds-of-innovation-and-gender-parity-in-valley-s-orchards-101630766724221.html

After Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal’s Gurdaspur visit on August 26, Mann has been camping at his Sangrur residence. Here, an average of around 1,000 workers a day, including party MLAs and ticket aspirants for assembly polls, have been meeting him. “A large proportion of these people see me as CM candidate,” he claimed Mann added, “AAP is a party that has risen from the grassroots. When it comes to naming the CM face in Punjab, then too the party must decide on the ground reality of workers’ demand. When we meet people, we have no answer to their question of our CM face. MLAs have also informed the party high command about the issue.”Mann claimed that AAP volunteers had appealed to the high command to declare him as the CM candidate. To a question on how other parties were faring, the two-time MP said, “The BJP’s culture is to contest elections without a CM face, Punjab has a different culture. I think the party should declare a CM face for the state. If AAP makes an announcement on CM candidate, volunteers will work with four-fold enthusiasm. I have also been a volunteer, so I know this.” On whether he has taken up the feelings of workers with the party high command, Mann said, “It is my responsibility to inform the high command about ground reality; they can also check facts. Volunteers want to work with more commitment, but they wish for a candidate of their own choice.”On AAP inducting the rich and the affluent into its fold, even as it claims to be a common man’s party, he said, “Some people are joining the party, but tickets will be distributed after asking the public.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-should-declare-cm-face-early-based-on-ground-realities-says-mann-101630766366493.html

Intensifying their stir for jobs, these unemployed teachers, in a symbolic gesture, have decided to ‘offer their blood’ to Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and ministers in the state government. These teachers belong to specialised categories like BEd or Physical Training Instructors (PTIs) etc. Many of them are into their mid 30s, with some even postponing their marriages, in the hope of a government job. Before the 2017 state assembly polls, the Congress had promised ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar’ (a job for every household). Unemployed BEd Teachers’ Union chief Sukhwinder Singh Dhilwan alleged that the Congress government was using lathis on unemployed youth, and trying to suppress their voice when they seek jobs. “The government is thirsty for our blood. We have, thus, decided to offer a chalice of blood to cabinet ministers, Vijay Inder Singla and Manpreet Singh Badal and Navjot Singh Sidhu on Teacher’s Day on Sunday,” he added. Their union has been holding a dharna opposite school education minister Vijay Inder Singla’s residence since December 31, 2020, forcing the minister to hold his meetings with the public at the PWD Rest House. One of them, Munish Fazilka, even climbed atop a water tank inside the Sangrur civil hospital on August 21. The protest of New Unemployed PTI Teachers entered its 14th day on Saturday. Baljinder Singh, 25, of New PTI Teachers Union said that they have been holding protests on roads for the past 18 months for their demand of government recruitment in government primary schools.Partinder Kaur, 36, said the government had failed to provide employment and forced them to hold protests on roads. “The government has not recruited teachers as required in government schools. We have been fighting for a long time and have no option, but to win,” she added.Hardeep Kaur, 32, said despite clearing all exams with good marks, they are still unemployed. “I decided to become a teacher and cleared the TET and other tests. The government, however, is not ready to fill vacant posts in government schools. This government, which promised to provide Ghar Ghar Rozgar, is killing our dreams.”Singla, who has been facing regular protests over the issue and was also opposed on Saturday, said, “The government has held a meeting with all unions and tried to resolved their issues. We are doing everything possible for teachers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/teachers-day-bitter-and-disappointed-aspiring-govt-job-teachers-to-intensify-stir-101630766004330.html

This is his first directorial but his interest dates back to early 80s when he was pursuing MD from Banaras Hindu University. “I was very active in the field of theatre. I had directed and acted in many popular plays such as Spartacus, Hera-Pheri, Sangtarash and also made Ek Kadam Aur, a short film on adult education, in those days. I also wrote plays like Samanantar, Tabiyat Kharaab Hai for Doordarshan while many were aired on radio. Then I got busy with my job as a doctor. Now I have written, produced and directed this film after a hiatus of nearly 40 years. Pandemic surely has given people opportunity to nurture their talent and hobbies,” he says. In between his stint in Mumbai, he learnt the art of film making while assisting others. “I was part of the team that made a feature film Tulsi Sohe Hamaar Angna and Den, a tele-film by Satyen Bose, and few other projects as well.” After that, his interest took a back seat. “Besides, my clinics I used to practice in Faizabad every Saturday. After lockdown, I discontinued that clinic so this gave me some spare time, so I took up writing. From my own resources I managed everything and roped in actors to shoot the film on Saturdays and partially on Sundays. Then every weekend I used to get its editing and post-production,” he tells. The 35-minute film stars Som Ganguly, Adwitya, Satish Bhartiyam, Mamta Praveen, Shikha, Rashi and others. “The story revolves around a young working couple having a difference of opinion about extending their family. The story is quite contemporary and explores the limit of love and mutual trust,” he says. Dr Agarwal says it’s because of OTT as a platform that he can think of coming up with another project in future. “Being a busy practitioner, I hardly get time. But I would surely like to take-up something soon. I have written two scripts but let’s see how things shape up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pandemic-has-given-people-opportunity-to-nurture-their-talent-dr-pramod-agarwal-101630757664083.html

Yet, I do not see an end to this interactive voice response (IVR) system. In fact, I have begun to believe that businesses put up these automated responses with the sole objective of discouraging their customers from calling them or complaining about their products or services.The IVR systems can be particularly frustrating when you urgently want to talk to a human being or a ‘customer care executive’ at the other end to resolve your problem quickly , but in order to get to that executive, you have to manoeuvre through endless options that offer you no solution, but only waste your time and test your patience.Going through the IVR menu is sometimes like going through an endless maze - within each option in the menu, you come across more choices and finally, after what seems like a marathon hurdle race, when you come to the human interface stage, either the line gets cut off or you have to be ready for another long wait before you can talk to the human being at the other end. Or you discover, after a lengthy struggle with a complicated and long IVR menu, that there is no human interface at all and that you have just wasted a lot of time. Who can remain calm and composed at the end of such experiences?Companies may be saving on salaries by using these IVR systems but they are certainly not earning the respect or loyalty of their customers. In fact, they might well be losing their customers to competitors.Here is an example, narrated by a reader. Following a serious health issue, he was advised by his doctors to get a particular test done every three months. He was using the same laboratory recommended by his doctor and this time, he noticed that they had sent him the result of the previous quarter’s test. Upset, he called the laboratory technician who had come to take the blood sample and when he failed to help, he called the laboratory to ask for the latest report. That one call changed his perception of the laboratory and he says he does not want to patronise them ever again.He says he had to wade through eight or nine menu options, none of which could help him with his problem. Finally, when he reached the stage where his call would be connected to a human being, he had to wait for over half an hour to finally speak to the company representative. Thus, what could have been resolved in half a minute, took almost an hour, thanks to the IVR.Interestingly, several surveys conducted in the United States have shown consumer displeasure, anger and frustration over the IVR system. A study commissioned by Interactions Corporation and conducted by an assistant professor of communications in the New York University in 2011, for example, showed an overwhelming consumer dissatisfaction -- 83 per cent -- with the IVR systems.The situation has not changed much over the years. A more recent research, published in September 2019 by Vonage, revealed that IVR menus had prompted 51 per cent of consumers to move away from a business altogether, resulting in a loss of about $262 per customer per year. The research, involving 2010 respondents in the United States, also showed that over 60 per cent of consumers felt the IVR system provided a poor customer experience. Another study conducted in the US in February and March this year by eGain reinforced the view that IVRs frustrated customers on account of long hold times and their inability to resolve queries. It’s time businesses took this issue seriously and provided customer care that actually delivers what it promises, without wasting their customers’ time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/please-wait-while-we-connect-you-to-customer-service-takes-a-back-seat-with-interactive-voice-response-systems-101630757063965.html
04-09-2021||Other||SC order on filling up consumer forums a welcome intervention||At a time when public confidence in the consumer justice delivery is at an all time low and consumer courts in the country are plagued by huge vacancies and infrastructural deficiencies, the Supreme Court’s suo motu intervention and direction to the Union and state governments to fill up all vacancies in eight weeks, brings a ray of hope.Of course this is not the first time that the apex court has hauled up the governments on poor enforcement of the Consumer Protection Act. In the initial years after the enactment of the consumer protection law in 1986, there was such resistance from state governments to constituting the consumer courts that the Supreme Court had to constantly step in, regularly monitor and ensure that the states established the redressal agencies contemplated under the Act. “It is such indifference which renders a well meaning legislation, intended to protect a large body of consumers from exploitation, ineffective,” the Supreme Court had commented in its order in 1993 (Common Cause vs Union of India)Even after three decades, there is not much of a change in the attitude of the state governments. The working of the consumer courts continue to be stymied by inadequate infrastructure, absence of secretarial staff, besides huge vacancies in the posts of judicial and non-judicial members (presidents and members ) that adjudicate over consumer disputes. So much so that in the last three decades, the Supreme Court and several high courts have interceded to ensure uninterrupted running of the consumer tribunals, but the consequent reliefs have only been short lived. Thus, closure of consumer courts on account of the absence of adjudicating members is now part of the ground reality of consumer protection in the country.It is also not uncommon to find state governments resorting to ‘jugaad’ to comply with the directions of the Supreme Court and putting one judicial member in charge of three consumer courts or appointing part-time members. So technically, the vacancies are filled up and the courts are functioning, but the truth is that their working is restricted to just about a few hours in a day. Ironically, if you look under the acronym “FunNFun” on the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission’s (NCDRC) website, you will see the list of functioning and non-functioning consumer courts. Interestingly, in the last three decades, the slate has never been wiped clean of non-functional forums.The vacancy positions are even more revealing - as per the data on the NCDRC website, dated June 30,2021, state governments had to fill up a total of 788 posts in district commissions and 81 in state commissions. Of course some states contributed more to these staggering numbers. For example, Uttar Pradesh had to fill up 153 vacancies in district commissions as on December 31, 2020, Madhya Pradesh had to appoint 74 adjudicating members as on May 31, 2021, and Tamil Nadu had 79 vacancies as on April 30, 2021.That’s not all, a comprehensive study on the working of these courts, sponsored by the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs and published last year by the Indian Institute of Public Administration, showed that 85.6 per cent of the consumer forums suffered from inadequate infrastructure, while 85.6 per cent lacked adequate staff.Now the new Consumer Protection Act of 2019 provides for online filing of complaints and e-hearing, besides mediation facilities to overcome the delays in the adjudication process. But here again, most consumer courts in the country do not have the required IT infrastructure nor facilities for mediation. IIPA study said 96.5 per cent of the forums had computers, many of them outdated, and 87.6 per cent had internet connections that were often poor.The crumbling infrastructure and the recalcitrant attitude of the state governments are only one part of the story of the failing consumer justice system in the country. The other part is the poor enforcement of the law by those adjudicating over consumer disputes and the failure of the new law to deal with these issues. I will write about that in my next column.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/scorder-on-filling-up-consumer-forums-a-welcome-intervention-101630757063142.html

At present, 161 community kitchens are running in the state, in which a total of 151,369 people were served food till the evening of September 2," tweeted Jha in Hindi.The Ganga, Gandak and Kosi rivers in Bihar have crossed the danger level in several areas of the state due to heavy rainfall. The Ganga River is flowing 12 cm above the danger mark in Patna. The tributaries of the Ganga River are also witnessing a rising trend in the water level. Kosi, which is known to be the sorrow of Bihar, is also flowing above the danger mark in various areas.On August 31, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar conducted an ariel survey of the flood-affected areas of Darbhanga and informed that financial aid of ₹6,000 is being provided to affected families.Nearly 16 districts in Bihar have been affected by floods due to incessant rainfall including Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Samastipur, Muzaffarpur, Vaishali and Patna.Earlier on Wednesday, the East Central Railway suspended the rail movement between the Darbhanga and Samastipur section as the flood water has almost touched the rail bridge between Hayaghat and Thalwara station of the Samastipur division.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/monitoring-flood-situation-in-bihar-rescue-work-underway-state-minister-101630755607418.html

Also read: Paralympics: Pramod Bhagat clinches gold medal in men’s singles (SL3) badmintonSukhbir met the Malukas at his Chandigarh residence over lunch. To placate the sulking two-time MLA, Sukhbir appointed Gurpreet, a former Bathinda zila parishad chairperson, as the SAD general secretary. Reposes faith in Sukhbir’s leadershipAfter the meeting, Maluka reposed full faith in Sukhbir’s leadership and added that the party is united. “Maluka sa’ab agreed to the decision (of ticket allocation) of the party. I have urged them to make a collective effort on all (six) seats of Bathinda district,” said the SAD chief. Maluka contested on five occasions from Rampura and won only twice, in 1997 and 2012. He remained cabinet minister both times. Maluka, once a blue-eyed aide of SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal, had been in dissent mode after the party on Sunday announced his candidature from his traditional seat of Rampura Phul. Maluka was keen to contest from Maur and wanted the Rampura Phul seat for Gurpreet. Jagmeet Brar to contest as SAD nominee from Maur Jagmeet Brar has been declared as the SAD candidate from Maur. As Brar’s candidature from Maur was expected, last week Maluka had demanded the party to desist from fielding him and advised it to take feedback from the party workers on winnability chances of him (Maluka) and Brar. Maluka had gone to the extent of saying that the unannounced norm of ‘one-family-one ticket’ was selectively thrusted upon the Maluka family to adjust an outsider. Political analysts said it’s surprising how Maluka, once a powerful Akali leader in Malwa, was cornered. “He was calling the shots in the SAD and was an aide of Parkash Singh Badal. It evoked much political interest the manner in which his candidature was announced last Sunday against his wishes and then the nomination of Brar, a party-hopper, was announced. Maluka had to take back his resolution made in the public last week that only Gurpreet would contest from Rampura Phul. It shows the new political strategy of the Badals in their traditional electoral bastion of Bathinda,” says a political analyst.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-in-poll-mode-maluka-falls-in-line-to-contest-from-rampura-phul-101630755023519.html

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of the two towers of Supertech’s Emerald Court project in Noida over grave violation of building norms. The court said the violation was a result of “nefarious complicity” between the Noida Authority and the real estate developer."While we respect the Hon'ble Supreme Court order, we have decided to re-present the matter before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a review application as the towers were constructed as per the approval of the competent authority conforming to the Building bye-laws," Supertech chairman RK Arora said in a statement, adding that Apex and Ceyane towers are not linked to or are part of any ongoing project of the company.Also read | UP govt forms SIT to probe Emerald Court caseSupertech Group is developing 10 crore square feet across its projects and Apex and Ceyane towers only constitute a mere 6 lakh sqft which is 0.6  per cent of the total portfolio, he added.

We would like to reassure all our customers, bankers, vendors and other stakeholders that we will deliver all our projects in the scheduled time frame," Arora said.A bench of Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice MR Shah said that the April 11, 2014, verdict of the Allahabad High Court, which directed the demolition of the two towers, does not deserve any interference. The bench said the construction of Supertech's twin 40-storey towers with 915 flats and shops was done in collusion with Noida authority and the high court was correct in holding that view.Also watch | Supertech twin towers demolition in Noida: Yogi govt forms SIT, SC orderThe Supreme Court bench directed that Supertech will have to demolish the towers at its own expense and complete it within three months under the supervision of the Noida Authority and an expert body such as the Central Building Research Institute.

04-09-2021||Pune||Marginal rise in Pune’s RT-PCR positivity rate||As the city gears up to the festive season and Covid-19 norms have been relaxed, the weekly positivity rate and RT-PCR positivity rate has shown a marginal increase as compared to that of the state average.As per the district health department, the weekly positivity rate in the Pune district was 4.4 per cent on August 17, and 5.8 per cent and 6.3 per cent on August 26 and September 2. While during the same period for the state it was 2.4 per cent, 2.5 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively.The RT-PCR positivity rate was 5.9 per cent on August 17, and 6.6 per cent and 7.3 per cent on August 26 and September 2. During the same period for the state, it was 3.1 per cent, 2.9 per cent and 3.2 per cent.Though the data suggests that the rise is marginal, the increase in the RT-PCR positivity rate shows that the infection is spreading in the area. Whereas a combined positivity rate includes Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) which may also show false negatives.Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune, said that the numbers are bound to increase due to the unlock process.“As more people are going outdoor for work and other activities, they will come in contact with others. In such a situation, it is important to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. As the city unlocks the positivity rate is bound to increase,” said Patil.“To save themselves from the third wave, it is important to wear masks, follow social distancing and maintain hand hygiene at all times. Only then the third wave can be delayed,” said Dr Patil.Other districts, unlike Pune, show a decrease in the RT-PCR positivity rate.As per the data furnished by the health department, on August 17, Ahmednagar district reported 7.1 per cent to 6.5 per cent on September 2. During the same time, Solapur district reported a 5 per cent RT-PCR positivity rate on August 17 which was reduced to 4.2 per cent on September 2. Similarly, districts like Sangli and Satara have also reported a decrease.Dr Dnyaneshwar Mote, a member of the Pune city Covid-19 task force for social action said that as Pune district has better contact testing and that’s why the rate is more.“Pune district has more population and medical infrastructure is also better and so many patients prefer coming to the city for testing. This is the primary cause for the rise in numbers,” said Mote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/marginal-rise-in-pune-s-rt-pcr-positivity-rate-101630753103740.html
04-09-2021||Pune||Startup Mantra: Pune-based PhiCommerce ready to roll out an end-to-end tokenisation solution||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines which are going to prohibit online merchants, payment aggregators and payment gateways from storing customers’ card details is bound to disrupt the digital payments ecosystem. Tokenisation (replacement of actual card details with an alternate code called ‘token’) is the next high-tech thing to happen in next five to six months in the payments segment of fin-tech space. Pune-based startup PhiCommerce is one of the few players in the Asian continent that are ready to roll out an end-to-end tokenisation solution. Founded in March 2015 by Jose Thattil, Tushar Shankar, Anil Sharma, Rajesh Londhe and Ramkumar Subbaraj, PhiCommerce is a new-age financial technology company that addresses evolving needs of digital payments infrastructure. Its payments processing platform PayPhi enables businesses to embrace the digital payments ecosystem with smart interventions to automate, integrate and streamline payment transactions across an omni-channel and instrument-agnostic platform. In the beginning After completing his BE Electronics from Mumbai University, Jose went to the Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies and completed his Masters in Management Studies in 1997. Says Jose, “I started my career with ICICI Bank. I was AVP Technology at the organisation and responsible for launching India’s first VISA Debit Card. That was my first real exposure to payments. What I realised then is that payments are going to be a requirement through all sectors in India. That’s when I decided to focus on digital payments as a career.” Jose moved to a Pune-based company named ElectraCard Services. He was one of the founding members of the company which was one of the earliest software product companies in digital payments. That’s how Jose’s association with Pune began. “We built payment solutions and deployed them for very large banks and institutions – both on payment acceptance and issuance side. Acceptance side operations were ecommerce, point of sale (POS), m-commerce, ATMs, Kiosks etc, while issuance side operations were to build and roll out very large debit card programmes, credit card programmes, wallets and other facilities. We did this in India and 22 countries across the globe,” Jose said. “As part of that 15-year journey, we were able to see how payments was evolving in countries like North America, Africa, Middle East, South Asia and South East Asia region. We realised it was not just peculiar to India, but globally also there was a lot of action happening in the digital payments space. In 2013, ElectraCard was acquired by Mastercard,” he said. In 2015, Jose along with Tushar, Anil, Rajesh and Ramkumar, decided to quit their jobs and start PhiCommerce. Jose is the chief executive officer, while Rajesh heads the payments business and Ani heads the soon-to-be-launched credit business. Tushar heads the sales and business development across both these business units while Ram is the chief technology officer. Says Jose, “I have known them for about 15 years and we have worked together. We are virtually a family. Each one of us have our own strengths or core areas/skillsets.” “In 2015, we were focussed on product development. In the early part of 2016, we were aware that digital payments are undergoing a revolution. There were three basic philosophies under which we started PhiCommerce,” says Jose. Omni-channel and instrument agnostic platform Says Jose, “For last 40-50 years, the payments space was largely led by card-based payments. However, in the last 5 to 7 years new payment methods originated. QR, mobile-based/wallet-based payments, biometric payments, IoT based payments started coming in. Most payment processing platforms globally were designed for a card-first transaction. To handle these newer payment instruments, there was a lot of programming and coding done on top of these card-based platforms. But it made these platforms lose the nimble nature. It was like getting patched on a core platform. If you build on top of a legacy stack then you will lose the benefits.” “In payments world, there are two basic concepts – Push or Pull payments. So, you should have a platform that can do both PUSH and PULL. You should have a platform that can process cards, or QR codes, or biometric or ECS type of transaction – all with the same ease. And you should be able to do online (ecommerce) platform or an instore platform or a doorstep platform. The whole world is now moving to an online-to-offline-to-online scenario. If you have different platforms or solutions to handle these channels, it is not going to work. As a business, there is increasing premium in having a singular view of your customer, and not having siloed systems. We realised that the world really requires a complete rethink on a payment processing stack. And we need to have a technology or platform that you would throw any sort of payment at it, it will be able to process. Thus, we decided to make PayPhi omni-channel instrument agnostic,” Jose said. Built in India and deployable anywhere in the world Commenting on the RBI and central government stance regarding payments data, Jose says, “Globally, lot of central banks and government are becoming very possessive about their payments data. Central banks and governments are insisting that payment infrastructure needs to reside on their soil. The data should not go out of the country. Which means that thinking from a payment processing stack perspective, it has to be ‘passport-able’ to any part of the world. Whatever be the application you develop, has to be such that it can be actually shipped out to a different location to be installed there very easily.” “Large payment processers globally had developed large and fragmented platforms which made it extremely difficult to replicate or deploy them it in any other part of the world. We came from a product background. We realised that anything that we do has to be largely productised with a view of deploying in any part of world at short notice.” Largely use-case driven approach to payments Jose has a “controversial” view about payments. Contrary to certain people who view payments as a commodity – involving only a debit and credit or a sender and receiver – Jose and his team believes that each industry has its own nuances of payments. He says, “The moment you treat payments as a commodity then the payment platform only takes care of the debit and the credit. As a result, whole lot of processes around it get manually done. For example, originating a payment, invoicing a payment, collecting payment, distributing payment at the backend, all of this is then manually done, since from a payment processors perspective you will be only responsible for the debit and credit. Whereas we believe that it is not so.” Jose also gives an example of an ecommerce marketplace transaction. “An e-commerce marketplace is expected to collect money from a consumer. Now that money doesn’t end with the marketplace. The marketplace then has to pass on a large portion of it to the sellers at the backend, to various logistics providers. This splitting between various service providers and sellers at the backend, is also according to us a part and parcel of the payment transaction. You cannot say that the payment ends with money having coming into the marketplace as account. What happens to the onward distribution of funds? So, we believe that there could a core that is common but every industry will have a certain requirement of some subtle nuances around payments. That is where we set about designing various APIs drive functionalities to cater to various large industries. Once we went live, we work with very large merchants across the country. We are present across all channels, all instruments in the country,” Jose says. Demonetisation and Covid influence Since its inception, PhiCommerce has witnessed three major developments which has propelled it growth. Demonetisation (2016), Covid-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown (2020-21) and the rise of direct to consumers (D2C) brands. Says Jose, “Demonetisation was a wake-up call for country emphasising that the shift from cash to digital has to happen. A lot of transactions, across industries, got converted from cash to digital almost immediately. But Covid-19 has forced people to adopt digital as a way of life. Cash-On-Delivery (COD) has converted to ‘Digital Payment On Delivery’.” Sharing his experience while working with one of their biggest client – a government-owned gas company – Jose said, “We see transactions coming from very rural distant places. People are making Aadhaar-based transactions for their LPG gas cylinders. These are people who have probably done their first digital transaction in their life. Now they have adopted to that. The pandemic has taught us that there is no going away from digital payments.” Doorstep Commerce – Next Big Thing Jose believes that doorstep commerce is going to become huge. He said, “PhiCommerce is among the pioneers to convert COD to digital payments at doorsteps. We see that today consciously or unknowingly you end up doing a lot of transactions at your doorstep. And largely all of that is in cash. We believe that with utility payments, food delivery, ecommerce payments, recovery of loans, insurance premium payment going digital at footsteps, doorstep commerce is going to become huge.” “India with all the action that we see in payments today, is hardly 25 per cent digitised. Almost 75 per cent people are still dealing in cash and 75 per cent of consumer payments still happen in cash. So much growth is still going to happen, over the next 8 to 10 years in India. As a payment solution provider, we are blessed to be in a country like India which is leading the world as far as new innovation in digital payments are concerned,” Jose said. Team expansion PhiCommerce is headquartered in Pune with a 45-member team. Jose said, “The last 5 years were the first phase of growth for us. Our entire energies have been focussed on the product development, building the whole stack and bringing the enterprise clients. Almost 60 per cent of our team is on the tech side and the rest comprising sales and operations. Now we are in process of expanding the sales team across the country, including Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru. In the next 12 to 18 months, our focus would be on growth both domestically and internationally.” Future Plans Says Jose, “We are in the process of expanding in the overseas as well. We will be launching in the Middle East in the next six months from now and we are also looking at Africa and South East Asia as two other markets.” Revenue and Funding While refusing to disclose the revenue and sales figures, Jose said that they are going through a funding discussion. He says, “Today from market perspective, by end of this financial year with close to 20 thousand merchants across the country, we will be processing payments for them.

The virtual meeting was organized by NABFOUNDATION. The meeting saw the heads of top agri start-ups share what they desired from the system. The meeting was chaired Dr. G R Chintala, Chairman, NABARD while Anil Agrawal, Additional Secretary, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Commerce and Industry delivered the inaugural speech. NABARD, through NABVENTURES, has provided venture capital assistance to agri startups and today is the largest supporter in the agri sector. Dr. Chintala remarked that leveraging the power of convergence was the need of the hour with some 1500 agri start-ups on one hand and some 4500 Farmer Producer Organizations set up by NABARD on the other. Convergence between NABARD, NABFOUNDATION, NABVENTURES and agri-start-ups, he added, can bring in the much-needed youthful dynamism and technological expertise which rural India needs so desperately. The biggest need expressed by agri start-ups across the country was access to farmer communities and self-help groups to broad base their areas of operation. Equally significant was the need for building backward linkages. The meat industry aggregator for instance would want to have more organized goat rearing among more rural communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-pune-based-phicommerce-ready-to-roll-out-an-end-to-end-tokenisation-solution-101630752744001.html

Internet services on mobile phones were yet to be restored.Barricades put up to block roads in Srinagar were in place and the security forces were deployed in large numbers. But people were allowed to move around, and private vehicles were back on the roads. Most of the shops and businesses remained shuttered and public transport was off the roads.In the Kulgam district, strict restrictions on movement remained in place following incidents of stone-throwing on Friday.Police said that the situation across the Kashmir valley remained peaceful and no untoward incident was reported from anywhere on Friday.“People are yet again requested not to pay any heed to the rumours being maliciously spread by the anti-national elements especially across the border with an objective to disturb the prevalent peaceful atmosphere in the valley,” said Vijay Kumar, inspector general (Kashmir).Geelani, the face of separatism in Kashmir for over three decades, died on Wednesday after a prolonged illness at 91. The separatist leader, who spent around two decades in jail, was largely confined to his residence because of ill-health since 2010.Geelani was on Thursday buried in a quiet funeral at a graveyard near his residence in Srinagar’s Hyderpora around 4.30am with his family alleging that the police forcibly took away his body.The police action was likely prompted to avoid a mass gathering, which may have turned restive or violent....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/clampdown-imposed-in-kashmir-following-geelani-s-death-eased-101630742365024.html

So far, they have discovered over 60 species of insects including ants, dung beetles, fig insects, parasitic hymenoptera over the last decade and a half. They also collected information on over 200 species of ants or almost 25% of Indian ant fauna from the sanctuary. Around 850 ant species have been reported in India.Of the two newly discovered ant species is named parasyscia ganeshaiahi after eminent ecologist K N Ganeshaiah. Parasyscia ganeshaiahi, small, cryptic ants usually nest in decaying logs or under rocks. It is different from all congeners in India with its yellowish-brown coloured body and 11-segmented antennae. All other parasyscia species in India have 12-segmented antennae.“This is the first time, the genus has been recorded in Arunachal Pradesh, Northeast India,” the researchers said in a press release. “Syscia are rare ants usually encountered in leaf litter, rotting wood, and soil habitats.”In Asia, syscia are found in China, Japan, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

04-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi teenager’s book on coding aims to bridge the digital divide||The pandemic drove many youngsters into worrying about what future holds for them. But some, rose above that challenge, to not just keep themselves engaged, but also help their peers. And 17-year-old Paarth Arya is one of the latter! “Last year while pursuing my 11th grade I felt some of our text books, though written with the right intent, could be made much simpler and less cluttered. I had done some online courses, like CS50 from the Harvard University, where they explained everything in a manner that was easy to understand,” says Arya, who is in std XII now, and adds, “The pandemic and the situation around me made me notice that while I was getting quality education online, some of the underprivileged students of my age were deprived of these opportunities. I felt I should do something to resolve this, and that’s why I wrote the book!” With an aim to spread his knowledge and love for coding, Arya wrote the book, The Python Champions of Coding, for those who are 10-12 years old, and interested in coding. And besides including lots of activities and relevant information, Arya has made sure to explain the concepts in an uncomplicated manner. “I tried to make it as easy as possible so that the readers don’t need a teacher and are able to understand it all on their own,” he says recalling how his love for coding goes back to when he was in class six. “I had a keen interest in coding and did some hackathons in school, and got the confidence to explore my abilities. I then started searching about online courses in coding, and gathered some knowledge. Of course last year we had so much time because of online education, and I even did many online courses in artificial intelligence, machine learning and so on, and realised that since I do have basic knowledge of the subject, I should do something in my own little way... I spent around five months writing the book, gathering knowledge from everywhere, going through the drafts again and again to include as many activities as possible, and showing the book to my parents and friends to ask for their advice to make sure that I present the information in a simple way. I even asked my teachers for advice. And when I approached my principal, she was so proud of me!” The young gun believes in the need to use technology for the good of youngsters. “Technology has many advantages all over the world... But it’s a very important to understand that technology itself has the power to be inclusive, and we should be sensitive and aware enough to harness it so that everyone can have access to advantages like knowledge and learning. This would also bridge the digital divide that’s deprived to a large part of our population,” says Arya, who has decided to donate the earning from the sale of his book for a good cause. “All my earnings from the book will be used to enable education for the underprivileged. It’s an NGO called Bring a Smile Foundation in Hyderabad, which works in education and health. A major premise of writing the book was also to be able to bridge the digital divide, to whatever extent possible. That is why, the content is available as a physical book, an e-book, and even as videos on YouTube,” he concludes.Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-teenager-s-book-on-coding-aims-to-bridge-the-digital-divide-101630738583497.html

Unlike the urban settlements, street lights in rural areas will be powered with solar energy, officials said. Emboldened by the assistance allocated by the Centre under the 15th Finance Commission to enhance basic infrastructure in rural areas, the panchayati raj department has proposed to set up at least 10 street lights in each ward across the state. The state government has recently received a sum of ₹1,100 crore on the recommendations of the finance commission. “While the department has used a part of the grant to provide supply water to each household, a certain portion of it would be allocated for installing street lights,” said panchayati raj minister Samtrat Chaudhary, adding that estimates were being made to launch the work immediately after the panchayat elections in December.The department has recently made a presentation in front of chief minister Nitish Kumar and got his nod to launch the Mukhyamantri Gramin Solar Light Yojna. During the meeting, the CM asked the officials to be particular about the selection of places so that no locality deserving the street lights should be left out.Additional chief secretary, panchayati raj, Amrit Lal Meena said that a survey to identify suitable places across 1.14 lakh wards of over 8,000 panchayats was underway. “Once it is complete, the department will seek the cabinet nod on the proposal,” added Meena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-villages-to-be-illuminated-with-solar-lights-101630736783440.html

Set up in 1921 by Rabindranath Tagore, Visva-Bharati is Bengal’s only central university, and the Prime Minister is its chancellor. The agitation began on August 28 when three students were expelled on disciplinary grounds. Chakrabarty was confined to his campus residence since then as the students blocked the gates.A section of the faculty members of the university wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a probe against the vice-chancellor.The university authorities on Wednesday moved the high court seeking intervention in ending the impasse created by the agitation. The students ended their agitation outside the campus residence of Chakrabarty on Friday afternoon after the high court passed a strongly worded order asking the local police to remove the agitators.The students said there is no bar on continuing with their peaceful demonstration beyond 50m of the campus.

04-09-2021||Patna||Bihar govt to provide ETS machines to amins for speeding up land survey work||The state government will soon provide electronic total station (ETS) machines for measurement of land and survey work being undertaken in 20 districts to newly recruited amins as part of the revenue department’s plans to digitise the land records and speed up the survey work, officials said. The ETS machines used in survey work are considered accurate in land measurements and removes manual interference in the measurement of land, which is one of the major reasons for land disputes. Amins are those appointed by the government to measure land. They have knowledge of land measurement and survey work.“Amins will be doing the land measurement at the village level with ETS machines. We are in the process of providing these machines in bulk so that there is more transparency in the measurement of land and corrupt practices are weeded out,” said revenue and land reforms department minister Ram Surat Rai. He said the process of purchasing the ETS machines was in the final stages and the distribution would start from October onwards. In Bihar, the special survey of land records being held in 20 districts is at different stages like Kistawar (mapping), Khanapurthi (filling the blanks), Tasdiq (attestation). The Kistawar and Khanapurthi are the two main stages of field survey where surveyors and amins are put on duty to measure the land as per the records for their update based on new sale and purchase of the property. There is already a process underway to digitise the record of rights (Khatiyan) by updating the records of actual owners of the land. People privy to the matter said the revenue department is also working on a proposal to introduce the system of slot booking of getting one’s land mapped by surveyors. It will help in the transparency of land mapping and provide the landholders with some flexibility in getting their land mapped at an appropriate time of their choice and save them from not having to depend on others to stay at the fields when the mapping work is being done. “The proposal is under consideration,” said the minister. Keeping in mind the pending legal dispute cases, mainly those related to petty disputes, the revenue department has already asked the circle officers and station houses (SHOs), as well as sub-divisional officers, to hold weekly meetings on each Saturday to review the pendency of cases and take measures for resolving them. The home and revenue departments, along with Bihar Prashashanik Sudar Mission, have now started working on a plan to segregate all land dispute cases by assessing its nature and complexity by providing a unique code like whether the dispute is related to a personal land dispute, government land encroachment, disputes over land measurement and cases pending at various courts. Officials said the process would be implemented soon and software is being developed for it. “The weekly meetings at the level of circle officers and SHOs as well as higher officials to review land dispute cases and take necessary steps is going on and giving good results,” said one official in the revenue department. In Bihar, land dispute is one of the major reasons behind heinous crimes like murder and rape. As per the National Crime Records Bureau, 2019 data, out of 3,138 murder cases reported in 2019, 782 cases were those in which property/land dispute was the motive. The revenue minister said the government will be soon posting 566 revenue officers at the block level to assist circle officers in handling revenue related matters. “ The posting of new revenue officers would lessen the load of circle officers who are often put on law and order duty and other works, which affects disposal of land-related cases,” Rai said. New law New legislation to resolve matters related to land disputes and fixing accountability on officers to dispose of mutation petitions in a time frame is being mulled by the revenue department. People privy to the matter said the proposed law would enable families facing disputes among coparceners (parties holding right in property) to go for mutation by consensus even if one of the parties is against it. Like, if in family, there are four brothers of which three brothers want to divide their ancestral land but one of the brothers is against it, the rest of the three brothers could move to get the land mutated if there is a consensus and majority view for it. The idea of this new law is to check land-related cases and also update the land records. Non-division of land or partition and mutation continues to remain one of the major obstacles in the updation of land records because of disputes among families over division and sale of ancestral land. “We are working on this idea and a new law could come. We are taking a legal view on it and necessary action will follow,” said revenue minister Ram Surat Rai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-govt-to-provide-ets-machines-to-amins-for-speeding-up-land-survey-work-101630731804227.html

04-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A quarantined bazar||A bunch of people in a tailor’s shop are attentively listening (see photo) to a breaking news on the mobile— a “din dahare” murder has taken place this morning at 10 outside Gurugram’s Sheetla Mata Mandir. A young man has been shot dead. The murderer has escaped.Otherwise things are peaceful, at least in this corner of the so-called Millennium City. Cool and shaded, Girdhar Kaushik Market is a long passageway connecting two market streets in Old Gurugram. The place lies like a person in isolation, cocooned within its own private world. A self-contained bazar, it is lined with garment shops and tiny tailoring establishments. Though one of its ends opens into Sadar Bazar and the other to Naya Bazar, its personality is distinct from the chaos of both these markets. On entering the laid-back lane, you feel distanced from the chaos. There’s that sense of being quarantined.This afternoon, the market is marooned in what feels like perpetual darkness. The sleepy corridor reminds one of the slow-moving time in the lockdown. The ambiance is so quiet that even a shopkeeper’s sudden laughter seems to create unrest in the air. Passing footsteps echo. The sound of rickshaw bells coming from outside appears as if originating from a remote world. Each shop is steeped in individuality. One establishment is decked with shirts and denim pants suspended from hangers. In another, a tailor is sitting on the floor and patiently ironing a white fabric. While Vinay Jewellers is wide open, the shop’s stately metal tijori is perched behind the counter; its owner—the sunar—is lounging outside in the “fresh air.”Inevitably, some people are using the lane as a shortcut to cross from one bazar to another. Many of them are familiar with the shopkeepers, and ‘Ram-Ram’ greetings are being tossed around generously.The extremely polite Tilak Raj of Bombay Tailors expresses relief that the market has returned to “normalcy” after the second surge of the coronavirus. A few shops are shuttered but that has nothing to do with the pandemic, he clarifies. “Some shopkeepers have gone out of town, some others have other reason to be absent… but no place has closed for ever,” he says. However, a few businesses here are running their operations with a reduced number of workers, says Mr Raj. “Some employees who left for their villages during the second surge have yet to return.”On stepping out of the market corridor and entering into the blinding sunlight, the calmly sensations produced by the passage instantly vaporize.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-quarantined-bazar-101630702738010.html

The rest of the funds will be approved soon, officials said.The planOfficials said they will install plants, street furniture, toilet blocks and solar-powered streetlights in the roads, and provide ample space for pedestrians and hawkers in the seven stretches.The plan also envisages improving the geometry of the roads by removing hurdles in its path, widening roads wherever required, and strengthening it by laying fresh asphalt layers.PWD officials also said they will improve streetlighting and decongest intersections by improving road geometry and installing proper signages.For redesigning the Vikas Marg stretch, PWD has estimated an expense of ₹37 crore.The road, which connects east and central Delhi, is one of the busiest stretches in the city, and is punctuated by important market and residential areas in east Delhi such as Laxmi Nagar, Preet Vihar, Karkardooma, and Anand Vihar.“Under the plan, PWD will strengthen the road, widen it wherever required, create separate lanes for non-motorised vehicles and remove encroachments,” an official said.The official said that Narwana Road has many transformers and poles that will be removed.Speaking about the Ring Road portion from Moti Bagh to Mayapuri junction, another official said that encroachment and roadside parking are the major causes of congestion.“In order to remove the encroachment, PWD plans to increase the size and number of lanes... The existing four lanes will be replaced by six lanes,” said the second official.The 9.2-km stretch has four flyovers, three Metro stations and three major intersections, and the revamp aims to create sufficient space for both motorised and non-motorised vehicles.“The service lanes will also be renovated to make space for cyclists and pedestrians,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/major-revamp-planned-for-7-key-stretches-in-delhi-101630701963636.html

They, however, said the activists may question the non-BJP leaders but it must be done “in a democratic way” so that it does not turn ugly. In a video message, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan), one of the largest farmer organisations, on Friday cleared the union’s stance, saying they will gherao the BJP leaders during the Punjab assembly polls. “The BJP is the ruling party at the Centre which is not repealing the three black laws. Though other political parties are also the same, we will not treat them in the same manner. We will give a call to boycott the election rallies of these parties in villages till the agitation is over,” said Ugrahan.The union, in a press statement, condemned the lathicharge on farmers during a rally of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief Sukhbir Singh Badal in Moga on Thursday. BKU (Dakaunda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh said their cadre will strongly oppose the BJP and its allies. “Other parties will be questioned as they failed to fulfill pre-poll promises. Their leaders should be questioned in a respectable language,” added Jagmohan.Leaders of the Kirti Kisan Union, whose activists were among those opposing Sukhbir in Moga, said the farmers hold protests only when they are not allowed to ask questions from political leaders.Bhupinder Longowal, state committee member of the union, said, “We are following the directions of the SKM and are questioning the SAD, Congress and AAP leaders whenever they are holding political functions. It is the SKM’s call to oppose political rallies and ask questions from politicians. We reach the rally venues to question the politicians but they refuse to answer.” SAD spokesman Winnerjit Singh Khadial said, “A delegation of farmers may question a leader but how can it be done when there are over 1,000 people. Our party never escapes any discussion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/focus-on-bjp-don-t-heckle-leaders-of-other-parties-farm-unions-make-fresh-appeal-to-volunteers-101630700061703.html

04-09-2021||Chandigarh||SAD constitution ‘forgery’ case: Hoshiarpur court directs Sukhbir Badal to ‘surrender’ before Sept 13 to get bail||The Hoshiarpur district and sessions court has directed Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal to “surrender” in the trial court on or before September 13 to get interim bail in a case of alleged forgery of the party constitution. The direction comes days after the Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissed a plea of Sukhbir, his father and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and party’s senior vice president Daljit Singh Cheema in the case filed against them in 2019 under Sections 420, 465, 466, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code. Seeking quashing of the case, Sukhbir had moved an application for interim bail. He had submitted that since no custodial interrogation was required, he be granted anticipatory bail. He also referred to the bail granted to co-accused Cheema in 2019. Additional sessions judge Jatinder Pal Singh Khurmi, however, directed him to surrender in the trial court on or before September 13 and stated that if he did so, he would be released on interim bail, subject to his furnishing a personal bond of ₹1 lakh with one surety of similar amount. The SAD leaders had approached the high court in 2019 seeking a stay on trial after Hoshiarpur additional chief judicial magistrate had issued them summons in the case. The high court had stayed the trial. On Friday, the court maintained that there was sufficient material on record with the Hoshiarpur court to summon the Badals and dismissed their 2019 petition. Social activist Balwant Singh Khera had filed the complaint that the SAD possessed two constitutions – one that it had submitted with the Gurdwara Election Commission and the other with the Election Commission of India (ECI) to seek recognition as a political outfit. He has alleged that the SAD had given a false undertaking to the ECI that it had amended its constitution to incorporate the principles of socialism and secularism whereas it continued its activities as a ‘panthic’ party and openly participated in the gurdwara elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-constitution-forgery-case-hoshiarpur-court-directs-sukhbir-badal-to-surrender-before-sept-13-to-get-bail-101630699580719.html
04-09-2021||Chandigarh||UGC pay scales: Teachers protest over delay in Punjab, Chandigarh||Teachers under the banner of Punjab Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organisations (PFUCTO) on Friday went on a mass casual leave and ceased work to protest against the unwarranted delays in the implementation of UGC pay scales in Punjab and Chandigarh.Around 2,000 teachers participated in the rally. Afterwards, the teachers marched towards the house of Punjab chief minister, but were stopped by the police. Teachers raised slogans till an officer on special duty of the CM, SS Brar, reached the spot. A memorandum was handed over to Brar who assured them that the CM would solve their issues.In a statement, general secretary, PFUCTO, Jagwant Singh said, “The Punjab government had notified the 6th Punjab Pay Commission award and Chandigarh had also endorsed it for its employees. But the UGC pay scales that were to be announced are nowhere in sight. The teachers are the only ones now whose pay scales are yet to be revised. This is causing immense anxiety and hardship to university and college teachers.”HS Kingra, president of PFUCTO, added that Punjab was the only state that was yet to implement UGC pay scales notified in November 2017 and UGC regulations notified in 2018. This had also adversely affected the implementation of UGC pay scales in Panjab University, colleges of Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh, which adopted the notification of the Punjab government.Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA) president Mritunjay Kumar said that it was unfortunate that despite a positive response in discussion, no progress had been made: “We have been impressing upon the Punjab government and the Chandigarh administration to do the needful, but to no avail. This has baffled the teachers, raising grave concerns about governance in general.”Research students and scholars from universities also joined the protest stating that the decision to delink from the UGC directly hurt them and they planned to join the protest in large numbers in the days to come.The teachers will go on a fast on Teachers’ Day at Panjab University. Thereafter, teachers will protest daily for two hours by boycotting classes. However, in the interest of the students, admission work will not be interrupted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ugc-pay-scales-teachers-protest-over-delay-in-punjab-chandigarh-101630699522819.html
04-09-2021||Chandigarh||HC rules against live-in relation between adult male, minor girl||The Punjab and Haryana high court has ruled against the live-in relationship between a minor girl and adult male. “Since sexual relationship forms an essential part of a live-in relationship in the nature of marriage and there cannot be any sexual relationship with a girl child less than 18 years of age by any person even with her consent, a girl child less than 18 years of age will not be entitled to a live-in-relationship in the nature of marriage with a person of her choice,” the bench of justice Arun Kumar Tyagi said. The court was seized of a protection plea from a 19-year-old boy and 15-year-old girl from Sangrur, who claimed they liked each other and wanted to stay as live-in partners till the time of majority as they are not of marriageable age. The court had sent the girl to a protection home in June and sought response from various parties, taking note of the fact that courts are getting a large number of such pleas. The court said that a minor girl aged above 15 years who has not attained marriageable age of 18 years may solemnise marriage with a person of her choice but such marriage cannot be legally enforced to allow consummation and custody too cannot be given to her husband. The minor girl is also not entitled to reside with a person of her choice in live-in-relationship in the nature of marriage and nor a minor girl can give consent to any person of her choice for her removal from lawful guardianship of parents, the court said, adding that sexual relationship with her for the consummation of marriage or live-in relationship and her consent for the same is immaterial. The court in the case has interpreted various laws with respect to marriage, crime against women and guardianship etc. The court further said that the fundamental right to protection of life and liberty of a minor girl does not extend to she residing with her husband or a person of her choice in live-in-relationship. Her life and liberty have to be protected by sending her to child care institution or she remains with her parents, the court added. In the case in hand, the girl has been sent to a child care home till attaining of majority but her family and boy’s family have been allowed to meet her, if she wishes to. The court has issued a slew of directions to Punjab, Haryana and UT to take steps for the welfare of such girls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-rules-against-live-in-relation-between-adult-male-minor-girl-101630699461147.html
04-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: DGP holds first open house with police force||Issues faced by women cops in discharge of their duties, red-tapism holding up welfare of the whole force, government houses crying for repairs and delay in promotions hitting the morale — these were some of the issues voiced by the police personnel during the first “Sampark Sabha” of Chandigarh director general of police (DGP) Praveer Ranjan. Held at the multipurpose hall of the police lines in Sector 26, the open house gave the DGP a forum to address the whole force and also listen to their grievances. The cops raised the issue of hardships faced by them, especially the female staff, in discharge of law and order duties. “Long duty hours in wake of agitations of different organisations from Punjab and Haryana are taking a toll on our health. There is no toilet or drinking water facility near the protest sites. The female personnel face a lot of hardships; so the department should make mobile toilets available for the force,” a cop urged the DGP.The suggestions included making tea and snacks available for four-hour duty and meal for eight-hour duty besides tents, chairs and tables for the personnel. They also sought separate investigation, law and order and beat duties so that daily work hours can be decreased to eight with provision of weekly rest to all. The police personnel urged the DGP to do away with “whims and fancies” in house allotments and cut the delay. They asked for house allotment on merit with the aim to provide government accommodation to maximum number of personnel. The issue of dilapidated condition of government quarters was also raised. The cops said when it comes to welfare of the force or service matters, red-tapism should not cause any hindrance and decisions should be taken in a timebound manner. They also sought implementation of the recommendations of Police Reform Commission in a timely manner. Shun corruption, be polite to people: DGP Meanwhile, the DGP encouraged the force to stay away from corruption and perform their duty with utmost dedication. The police chief also asked the men on ground to talk politely and be courteous while dealing with the public. “Focus on public complaints and improve behaviour. Don’t trouble people for small things; instil fear in criminals not the public,” said the DGP, while also asking the cops to adopt new technologies. The DGP also asked for removal of junk vehicles, mostly case properties, from police stations to ensure the premises are kept clean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-dgp-holds-first-open-house-with-police-force-101630699400954.html

04-09-2021||Lucknow||Power distribution network: UP asked to ensure discoms hand over 33 kv system to state transmission utility||The 33 kv system power distribution network in Uttar Pradesh, like in other states, may soon be merged with the transmission network under a joint venture (JV) with POWERGRID, a Central government entity, with a view to curtailing high distribution losses and improving services, a senior official aware of the issue said.The move is, however, also being seen as part of the larger plan of ending the state-owned power utilities’ (UP Power Corporation Ltd in UP’s case) monopoly by opening the power distribution sector for multiple players, including private companies. “The Union power ministry has written a letter to the chief secretary and the additional chief secretary (energy) asking them to take steps to ensure that the discoms hand over the 33 kv system to the state transmission utility (STU),” the official said.The 33 kv substation systems are distribution substations that take electricity from transmission substations and then supply the same to the end consumers after stepping down the high voltage to a safe level.The letter written by joint secretary (transmission) Mritunjay Kumar Narayan on August 2 says that while the sub-transmission system plays an important role as in interface between the distribution and the transmission systems and is critical for reliable power supply, sub-transmission system (distribution network) is beset with the problem of higher losses and inefficient performance.The letter refers to a high-level committee constituted under the chairman and managing director, POWERGRID, sometime back. The committee, according to it, recommended, among other things, bringing 33 kv distribution system under the state transmission utility for improvement of performance of 33 kv networks, including robust planning.The state governments, as per the letter, have been asked to facilitate handing over of 33 kv substations to state transmission utility (STU) in a phased manner, provide financial assistance to the state transmission utility for upgrading and modernising their 33 kv assets.“In the event, the state government is not in a position to provide financial assistance to the STU, then the STU can be asked to form a JV (joint venture) with the POWERGRID on 50:50 equity basis for moblising their financial resources,” the letter said. Power employees have claimed the move is nothing, but part of the larger design aimed to hand over the distribution system to private players. “Bringing the 33 kv system under transmission and forming a joint venture company with POWERGRID is encroachment of the Central government on a state subject and the move is aimed to finish government discoms to facilitate private suppliers,” said Shailendra Dubey, chairman of the All India Power Engineers’ Federation.Forming JV with POWERGRID, he claimed, would be the beginning of end of both state transmission utilities as well state discoms.“Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2021 has a provision that seeks to de-license the power distribution activity and allow multiple private companies to supply electricity in any area using the network of government discoms. After formation of JV company, this network will also be snatched from the state discoms,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/power-distribution-network-up-asked-to-ensure-discoms-hand-over-33-kv-system-to-state-transmission-utility-101630698860841.html

The Congress spokesperson feared that the privatisation of the Railways will lead to domination of big corporate houses. The SC/ST population will also be hit at they will lose job opportunities as the reservation will go once these assets are privatised, she added. Questioning the NDA government’s move to monetise national highways, Nayak said while the Union minister Nitin Gadkari bragged of good performance in the sector, why did the Centre want to privatise it. She also urged the Centre to pay heed to former AICC president Rahul Gandhi’s advice on NMP. Responding to allegations of nepotism in the Congress, Nayak said no party is bereft of phenomenon and referred to the leaders like Anurag Thakur, Pankaja Munde and Dharmendra Pradhan. Condemns attack on party’s former MLA The Congress launched a scathing attack on BJP-led Himachal government on Friday over law and order situation in the state after former MLA and CPS Jagjeevan Pal was assaulted by alleged saffron party workers. The incident took place on August 31 at Rada village in Sulah assembly segment but came to the fore on Thursday after a video was widely circulated on social media platforms. In the 10-second video, Pal is seen being slapped by a man and pushed around amid the chaos. State Congress spokesperson Rajesh Sharma in a press conference held at Dharamshala alleged that the former MLA was assaulted during a foundation-stone laying ceremony of new panchayat building. “Pal was slapped and pushed around by the BJP workers,” he alleged adding that BJP was setting a wrong precedent and the Congress will not allow Himachal to become UP and Bihar. He said the BJP was in intoxication of power and was resorting to violence. Sharma said the Sulah incident was an attempt to trample voices of dissent. He feared that the BJP may adopt the similar violent tactic to win the election in 2022 assembly polls and advised people to be cautious. Meanwhile, district Congress president Ajay Mahajan said the incident was an example of deteriorating law and order situation in the state. He said the Congress will stage a protest on the issue on Saturday and submit a memorandum to the deputy commissioner. Leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri also condemned the incident, saying such things happening in Himachal were harmful for the democratic setup and the image of the state. “Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur should take cognisance.

The destinations have been divided into four zones distance-wise, with rates fixed for each of them depending upon the type of vehicle. The new rates will be implemented from September 6. The four zones are 1-10 km (Mohali’s Sectors 66-A, 67, 80, 81, 82, Aerocity, ISB and ISSER), 11-20 km (Mohali’s Phase 1 to 11, Sectors 76-79, Dhakoli and Baltana in Zirakpur, Chandigarh’s Sector 41- 56 and ISBT-43), 21-25 km (Chandigarh’s Sector 1-40, ISBT-17 and railway station, Panchkula’s Sector 1- 21, Dera Bassi and Manimajra) and 26-30 km (Kharar, Landran, Sector 90-116 and 127, Panchkula’s Sector 22-30).Ajay Bhardwaj, the airport’s chief executive officer, said: “We had requested the Mohali administration to fix the rates for cab operators after receiving several complaints from passengers.” Umang Jindal, who is a frequent traveller, said in the absence of any regulation, cab operators had been charging whatever they felt like. “Most of the time, foreign travellers felt that they had been cheated. The authorities should now put up the rate list at the entry and exit points,” he saidGet car towed for exceeding 20 minutes at departureThe airport has also slashed penalty charges in case a car exceeds the free 10-minute drop facility at the departure. However, if 20 minutes are exceeded, the vehicle will be towed and handed over to the traffic police, said Bhardwaj.Now, a car will have to pay up ₹170 instead of ₹340 for spending 11-20 minutes while dropping off a passenger. In the case of a SUV, the penalty will be ₹200 instead of ₹400.Meanwhile, there has been no change in the parking fee. For 30 minutes, it is ₹30 for cars and ₹10 for two-wheelers. For parking up to two hours, the charges will be ₹85 and ₹20, respectively.Traffic marshals have been appointed for lane management, such as ensuring that vehicles headed to drop off passengers and those wanting to park their vehicle enter the right lanes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rates-fixed-for-prepaid-cabs-at-chandigarh-airport-101630698441731.html

Doctors and paramedics of these hospitals have undergone a one-year training at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH).Dr Bishav Mohan from DMCH said these 11 centres were ready to handle cardiac patients, and after diagnosis and initial treatment for three hours, the patient will be referred to higher centres for further treatment.“Tenecteplase is usually not available at primary and secondary health care centres because of its high cost ( ₹25,000- ₹30,000). Besides, in 70% of the cases, it cannot be administered because of late arrival and to change the scenario, awareness about the symptoms are being created by these centres in their area,” the doctor added.Further, DMCH, Christian Medical College and Hospital, and Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, will coordinate for management of these centres.He said a WhatsApp group had been created where specialists will be available round-the-clock for consultation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/icmr-project-to-limit-heart-attack-deaths-to-start-in-ludhiana-101630698380806.html

04-09-2021||Other||Debate: Chandigarh can’t go on a solo ride for MRTS||Tricity a collective unitIf we take a cursory glance, the neighbouring cities are considered to be a part of Chandigarh and collectively make the tricity. Even the bifurcation of sectors in Mohali seems to be an extension of Chandigarh. A large number of persons commute to and fro from all three cities for various reasons, causing traffic snarls. So, involving the two neighbours in the mass rapid transit system plan would solve half the problems. Surinder Paul Wadhwa, MohaliTricity’s traffic woes may soon match NCR’sThe traffic scenario in tricity is getting complicated and in the next decade or so, may become similar to the National Capital Region. So, a new public mode of transport such as a ,ass rapid transit system should be put in place now, keeping in view all three cities and not just Chandigarh. It is a much-needed step and involvement of Panchkula and Mohali is a must.Kampreet Gill, ChandigarhMake up for the delayIt appears that wisdom has finally dawned upon the UT bureaucracy to opt for a metro rail project after losing more than a decade in red tape. This delay has further aggravated the traffic problems on city roads. Now, instead of going it all alone, Chandigarh would do well to involve its neighbours in the plan for the benefit of tricity commuters. More so, when Haryana and Punjab already stand committed to bear the expenditure for their respective portions. SC Luthra, ChandigarhMRTS has to be a collective initiativeThousands of residents commute to and fro on inter-city roads in the tricity on a daily basis for official or personal work. Therefore, a mass rapid transit system (MRTS) will be able serve its purpose fully only if the project is taken up collectively by Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana. This will also help bring down the vehicle density on city roads and encourage residents to adopt an environment friendly mode of commuting.Ramesh Aggarwal, MohaliNeed to fast-track MRTS in view of population riseWith an increase in population in Mohali and Panchkula, the need to fast track the transport system has also risen multifold. Housing societies in Pinjore are also adding to the need for a better transport system. A well-coordinated approach to a transport solution is the need of the hour. Chandigarh’s mass rapid transit system has been a good idea but Panchkula, Mohali and the periphery should be included by working in unison.Garv Bhupesh, PanchkulaExclusive MRTS for UT a wasteChandigarh city has a floating population equal in size of its residents, if not more and has become overcrowded due to increasing crisscrossing of vehicular traffic and lack of point-to-point buses and overbridges. It will be a wasteful expenditure for Chandigarh to have MRTS exclusively for UT without engaging Mohali and Panchkula administrations. The proposed MRTS should be financed by Punjab, Haryana and Centre, covering 40 km radius up to Ambala Cantt, Morinda, Ropar and Kalka since employees and visitors in thousands travel back and forth to Chandigarh and surrounding areas on a daily basis. Buses should also run from point to point e.g. one bus from Ambala Cantt linking Sector 17 whereas another connecting high court and a third going to PGI/university. MRTS should consist of buses, metro train and autos. Col SK Aggarwal (Retd), PanchkulaProjects announced, shelved with change in dispensationFor years, Chandigarh has been mulling on starting a mass rapid transit system but so far, it has not seen the light of the day. Many projects are announced but changed with the change in government. For instance, in 2009, when Pawan Kumar Bansal of the Congress was elected the MP of Chandigarh, he announced the metro rail project for Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula very soon. But later, when Kirron Kher became the city’s MP, she declared it unfeasible. Several other projects such as the Tribune Flyover have been hanging fire as residents continue to suffer amid the political tug of war. Gurpreet S Malhotra, KansalCity too small for an independent MRTSChandigarh is a modern and beautiful city but small in size. No doubt, the mass rapid transit system can prove to be a game-changer but it will be useful only of the neighbouring cities are involved. UT administration must discuss with Mohali and Panchkula regarding the MRTS plan.Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliFresh mobility planDue to an increase in population and vehicular density, tricity roads are seeing frequent jams. To find an effective solution to this, the UT administration must include Mohali as well as Panchkula for a fresh study on the mobility plan for the tricity, and then decide on whether to go for a monorail project, sky bus, metro or any other mode of transport.Prabhjot Nagpal, ZirakpurBring down vehicle densityWith over 12 lakh people and 15 lakh registered vehicles, Chandigarh has the highest density of vehicles per household in the country. Inter-state routes cross the city on a daily basis. People from Panchkula and Mohali commute to Chandigarh and the vice-versa on a daily basis. Both Mohali and Panchkula have grown rapidly in terms of population over the last few years, thanks to a spurt in housing societies and BPO industry but the cities have not been able to keep up in terms of infrastructure. The representatives of the three cities should discuss a workable strategy to fix the gaps.Usha Verma, ChandigarhLackadaisical attitude of local leadershipThe tricity, particularly Chandigarh, has the highest ratio of vehicles per person in the country but we are unable to work on traffic management for the next 25 to 30 years. While the situation is bearable in Chandigarh, its neighbours Mohali and Panchkula are grappling with traffic issues. The local representatives are still struggling to decide on whether to go for a metro or monorail. Consultants are appointed, a hefty fee is paid and after a meeting or two on the reports, the report is put in cold storage for regime change. The basic problem, we don’t have a railways minister or an influential minister in centre to push the case for approval or funding. Suresh Verma, ChandigarhDecongest city roadsThe mass rapid transit system is a good plan to decongest the city roads, besides helping commuters save on fuel expenses. Both Panchkula and Mohali should be involved in the projects as Chandigarh residents cross over to its neighbouring cities and vice-versa for work, personal and social purposes.Vijay Garg, ManimajraLight metro is the right optionAs per the previous detailed project report (DPR), the metro is to run underground within Chandigarh and emerge thereafter to connect adjoining areas. In addition to tricity traffic, thousands of commuters visit daily from Haryana and Punjab daily. Due to this there is tremendous increase of traffic on roads, causing severe vehicular/ dust pollution, traffic jams, and accidents. Chandigarh as a Smart City must accept change, improve the quality of life and usher in efficiency. We must go for a light metro which is fast, comfortable, uninterrupted and non-polluting.Sateesh Dadwal, ChandigarhPunjab, Haryana must contributeDue to denial and monetary non-cooperation by two states, Chandigarh administration had to go alone for MRTS. With a surge in population and number of vehicles per person, it is only reasonable to come up with an MRTS. In the past, due to too much interference by bureaucrats, councillors, ministers, and initiatives taken by residents to protect the legacy of Le Corbusier, the metro project and flyover were put in limbo. A large chunk of population from the city commutes daily to peripheral towns for job or daily work. To make them at ease and decongest the roads, administration should expedite the MRTS project. Punjab and Haryana should also contribute to the project. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliNeed reliable public transport systemTricity has no reliable public transport system and most residents prefer to use their private vehicles or cabs for daily commute. A pan-tricity MRTS project will help bring down the traffic congestion and prove beneficial in the long run. If not a metro, the tricity should look at least improving its bus connectivity. If the tricity does decide to go ahead with an MRTS, it must formulate a solid plan for underground metro rail network.Sanjay Chopra, MohaliOne transportation system for 3 citiesIt is essential for the Chandigarh transport authorities to involve its two neighbouring cities, Mohali and Panchkula in its MRTS project. These three cities share porous borders with each other and therefore must have an integrated transportation system. A resident who is travelling between these three cities should be able to travel around using one transportation system only. The three cities are together and should always work together. Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhWill solve commuting woesIt is great that the UT administration us contemplating to switch to MRTS to decongest city roads, but the plan will be a futile exercise if the neighbours Mohali and Panchkula are not involved. Punjab and Haryana should also understand their responsibility towards a wholesome development of the tricity. A metro is any day better than autos etc, which charge commuters as per their will.Kundan Lal, MohaliCombined planningChandigarh can’t be separated from the tricity. Not treating the three cities, which are codependent on each other, as one unit is nothing but lack of vision. Hence all development in the three cities must be planned together.Anju Mohan, Panchkula A comprehensive approachThe study on Chandigarh’s Mass Rapid Transit System will be unrealistic and incomplete without involving Mohali & Panchkula. Chandigarh UT, Mohali and Panchkula form a large urban complex with multiple traffic and transportation problems and hence the MRST study should be comprehensive to achieve the desired results. Moreover, the Chandigarh inter-state capital region plan studies carried out in the past by the town and country planning organisation, also envisaged proper coordination between these three constituents.Hardaman Singh Bhogal, MohaliDecision seems to have been taken in hurryThe decision of the Chandigarh administration to go solo on the new study - mass rapid transit system (RTS) –is lopsided and seems to have been taken in a tearing hurry. The administration needs to revisit the decision and reverse the same in the larger interest of the people. It should, instead of going all alone, mull over bringing the two satellite townships, namely Panchkula and Mohali on board to make the envisaged project a huge success and reap good dividend out of it. Ramesh K Dhiman, Chandigarh Come up with a logical, workable solutionSince Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula constitute the tricity, a combined MRTS plan for the tricity would be logical and workable. Planning MRTS only for Chandigarh would be meaningless and actually a waste of money because a large number of commuters travel daily from Mohali to Panchkula and from Panchkula to Mohali. AK Sharma, ChandigarhUT’s problems also reflect on its satellite townsThe decision of Chandigarh administration to go for a fresh study on mass rapid transit system for City Beautiful is well-received. The population and number of vehicles in Chandigarh have increased manifold leading to traffic congestion. In addition, over two lakh vehicles on inter-state routes cross the city daily. Mohali and Panchkula, the satellite towns of Chandigarh, also have the same problem. Hence, UT Chandigarh must involve the two in its MRTS plan.Subhash Chugh, via emailProblem of floating populationAn MRTS Plan without involving Mohali and Panchkula will be inherently faulty, since the UT is servicing the population of both states and the traffic situation is already worsening. The MRTS should be a holistic plan which should see us through another 100 yrs. The MRTS should come up on all major axis so that people from these towns and cities do not need a car/bus to come to the major service points of the high court, PGI, secretariat, Panjab University. A metro will also help prevent the floating population from commuting to Chandigarh in their personal transport and ensure less pollution and less traffic chaos. The suggested axis could be: Karnal-Ambala- Chd-Nalagarh, Ludhiana-Khanna- Chd-Pinjore, and Ropar-Kurali-Chd Nalagarh.Maj RS Virk, ChandigarhOverall development of tricitySince Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali are interlinked, the developmental planning also must be interlinked. Connectivity in Chandigarh alone will not achieve the desired purpose and result. While overall development is the prime consideration, any individual planning, and not a totalitarian planning for the tricity will do against the overall development of all the three entities.Group Captain Samaresh Kumar Goswami ( Retd), PanchkulaREADER OF THE WEEKFast and easy commuting Yes, Mohali and Panchkula should be on board in Chandigarh’s mass rapid transit system (MRTS) plan. Besides making commuting fast and easy, it comes with other advantages such as energy efficiency and low cost of commuting etc. The MRTS may prove especially useful in bringing down the peak-hour rush on the roads. Ishita Nara, via email BY INVITATIONWhat city needsThe mode of transport, routes and distance have to be decided first. The MRTS has to be planned with a long-term perspective for the city. SD Sharma, member, Chandigarh heritage conservation committee Signal-free roadsTo decongest city roads, we need a signal-free road system. It is imperative that the three main roads - Dakshin Marg, Madhya Marg and Chandigarh Road should be signal free, so that, traffic flows smoothly in and out of the city without any bottleneck. DS Jaspal, retired IAS officer and former principal secy, transport Punjab Plan with a visionTo decongest city roads, UT administration should not only include Mohali and Panchkula but also towns like Dera Bassi and New Chandigarh for the MRTS. Chandigarh should have a vision for the next 30 years while deciding on the project. Sarvjeet Singh, principal secretary, housing and urban development, Punjab Retain city’s characterA mass rapid transit system cannot be limited to Chandigarh only and has to involve Panchkula, Mohali and beyond. In addition, before finalising the plan, care should be taken to not spoil the character of the city. Surinder Bahga, former chairman, Indian Institute of Architects Chandigarh- Punjab chapterSave time, moneyAn organic solution will help all stakeholders gain as the issue is crucial for the city’s development.

04-09-2021||Lucknow||UP’s August revenue collection goes up by ₹2544.21 crore||The Uttar Pradesh government on Friday claimed a consistent increase in its earnings with the total revenue collection going up by ₹2544.21 crore in August 2021 against the earnings made in the same month in 2020-21.It collected total revenue of ₹12089.42 crore in August this year (2021-22) against earnings of ₹9545.21 crore in the same month in 2020-21, about 87.3 per cent of the target of ₹13855.64 crore for the month.The state government’s total revenue collection in the first five months of 2021-22 (April 1 to August 31, 2021) was ₹54715.20 crore, about 71.8 per cent of the target of ₹77183.64 crore.“Uttar Pradesh’s economy is showing a consistent improvement and our collections are going up every month. We hope there will be further improvement in the state’s financial situation in the coming months,” said minister for finance Suresh Khanna while speaking to media persons in Lucknow.A close scrutiny of the data released on Friday indicates that the state government’s highest earning of ₹2461.93 crore was from VAT (Value Added Tax), an increase of 108 per cent against the target of ₹2258.84 crore for August 2021. Its non-tax revenue collection (mining and minerals) was, however, ₹136.39 crore, only about 55 per cent of the target of ₹248.00 crore for August 2021. It was ₹35.14 crore less than the earnings of ₹171.53 crore in the same month in 2020-21. Khanna said increase in VAT was because of increased mobility following the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. About lower collections from mining and minerals, he said mining had remained suspended from July to September. He said the state government also deferred collections due to the adverse impact of Covid-19.“The state government’s data of revenue collection for August 2021 shows increased economic activity. The increase in VAT shows increased mobility, besides the hike in prices of petrol and diesel. It’s good that the state government is able to reach closer to the targets of revenue collection. The economy is recovering fast and it should reflect on the better performance on the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) growth front. The state government should also attempt to achieve substantially its target of capital expenditure in the coming months to give a further push to the state’s economy,” said Professor Yashvir Tyagi, former head of the department of economics, Lucknow University.The state government spends ₹12,000 crore to ₹13,000 crore on the payment of salaries and pension to its employees and pensioners. It has been facing a paucity of funds due to the adverse impact of Covid-19. The state government presented a mini supplementary budget (first in 2021-2022) of ₹7301.52 crore on August 18, 2021. This was only about 1.33 per cent of its largest annual budget of ₹5.50 lakh crore (2021-2022) presented in February 2021. The state government also recently introduced fresh austerity measures to ensure availability of funds for the fight against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ups-august-revenue-collection-goes-up-by-2544-21-crore-101630698082578.html

The corporation had initiated a campaign to rid the nullah of garbage in December last year, wherein 24 nodal officers were deputed to conduct surveillance around the 14km-stretch of the nullah and issue challans to violators.However, the drive lost steam during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. On Thursday, Sabharwal conducted a meeting with officials of the MC’s health branch at the Zone A office and directed officials to issue regular challans to violators through the day. “The zonal commissioners of Zone A, B and D will also conduct surprise inspections in the morning and evening to supervise the nodal officers and MC police teams deputed for surveillance,” he said.Different teams of college and school students also conducted awareness drives in the areas near the nullah. An MC official said while the ₹650-crore project to rejuvenate Buddha Nullah was already underway, garbage was still being dumped in the nullah and had to be stopped. “A large number of residents discard waste in the nullah instead of handing it over to the garbage collectors to save fees. MC has fined several violators, but the illegal practice continues,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dumping-garbage-in-ludhiana-s-buddha-nullah-to-invite-5-000-fine-101630697960855.html

In an affidavit, inspector general of police, Bureau of Investigation, Punjab, Gursharan Singh Sandhu said there were 27 FIRs registered against him of which 17 are still pending for investigation or trial and in 10 cases, either he has been acquitted or cancellation reports have been filed. The cases include attempt to murder, criminal intimidation and in the latest FIR of July, he has been charged with rape.The information was given during a resumed hearing of a suo motu plea initiated on Supreme Court orders to monitor probes in criminal cases against legislators and parliamentarians in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. “I am being targeted by the government for fighting for the rights of the people who are suffering due to the misrule of both the SAD and Congress. I have full faith in the judicial system and strongly believe that I will come clean,” said Bains.Sandhu, a nodal officer appointed by the state government in these matters, also said that all field units have been told to supply information about the cases against MLAs and MPs, in which there is a stay operating. So far, only one such case has come to light, he said.During the hearing, amicus curiae Rupinder Kholsa pointed to slow probe in the FIRs against Bains and suggested it be expedited or high court should consider roping in an independent agency. Posting the matter for September 15, the high court observed that the government would be at liberty to appoint a “more competent” investigating officer if the probe is not proceeding further in right earnest. As per initial details, Punjab has said that at least 163 cases are pending against sitting or erstwhile MPs and MLAs in the state while a total of 21 cases – eight against ex-MLAs – in Haryana are pending. On high court orders, both the states and Chandigarh have appointed nodal officers to monitor and supervise probes in cases against MLAs/MPs.

Yogi also asked for using the Covid and Covid isolation beds for treating patients of dengue and also those in grip of other viral infections. Chief minister issued these directives at the Covid-19 review meeting and asked the nodal officers appointed for districts to take charge of the cleanliness and sanitisation drive in their respective districts. He also instructed them to monitor situations in the districts affected by heavy rain and flood and supervise relief measures there. “The health department should launch a statewide surveillance from September 7 with the help of Asha and Anganwadi workers and associated staff. The health workers should go door to door to trace people with fever or Covid like symptoms. Also, make a list of such people over 45 years of age who have still not taken their first dose of vaccine. Encourage them to get their doses,” Yogi said. “Not a single fresh case of Covid infection was detected in 64 districts of the state in the last 24 hours while 11 districts reported fresh cases in single digit. The state is doing 2.5 lakh Covid sample tests every day on an average and the daily positivity rate is 0.01%. The recovery rate has gone up further to 98.7%. At present, the state has 239 active cases of Covid-19,” he said. “Only 18 fresh Covid cases were reported through the tests done in the last 24 hours while 21 patients recovered during this period,” Yogi added. Talking about vaccination, CM said on Thursday 16.26 lakh doses of Covid vaccine were administered taking the total doses administered so far to 7.58 crore. He said the state government will organise ‘Gareeb Kalyan Mela’ (fairs for the welfare of poor) on September 25 in all 826 development blocks in the state. The meal would entail distribution of artificial limbs and such aids to physically differently abled and linking potential beneficiaries with pension, home, self-employment and other such schemes. Check cost of construction material Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the state government had learnt that various construction material such as cement, sand, coarse sand, ballast and other such items were being sold at escalated prices. He asked the mining department to immediately carry out inspections and check it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/use-covid-beds-for-treating-patients-of-dengue-other-viral-infections-yogi-adityanath-101630697601916.html

04-09-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC sitting tight on waiving penalty on water, sewerage charges||Nearly 10 days after the state government notified the One-Time Settlement (OTS) policy to clear water-sewerage user charges without penalty and interest on August 25, the Ludhiana municipal corporation has failed to implement it here.As a result, MC’s system still displays dues with penalty and interest, and unwary consumers are still clearing dues without utilising the waiver offered by the government. However, the civic body has started regularising illegal water-sewerage connections at nominal rates by issuing manual receipts. Under the policy, the connections can be regularised at less than 10% of the regular fee/penalty charged for the process. An MC official, requesting anonymity, said the departmental orders had not been issued to implement the notification due to which changes had not been made in the MC server at Suvidha Kendras. “The Suvidha Kendra staff cannot accept any amount lower than that displayed in the system, which is still reflecting penalty and interest. Some consumers have returned with complaints after realising these should have been waived,” the official said, adding that the matter had been taken up with higher authorities.MC superintending engineer Rajinder Singh said the process got delayed due to some departmental issues and the server/software had been updated on Friday.Under the policy, no penalty or interest will be charged on the principal amount if the dues are cleared within three months, following which only the penalty will be waived for the subsequent three months. After six months, the user will have to pay both penalty and interest on the pending amount, and the connection will also be disconnected. In Ludhiana, dues of water-sewer user charges defaulters have piled up to a whopping ₹200 crore over the past few decades. In many cases, the interest imposed is much higher than the principal amount. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal also conducted a meeting with officials of property tax wing and operations and maintenance cell on Friday evening, and directed the officials to expedite recovery of dues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-sitting-tight-on-waiving-penalty-on-water-sewerage-charges-101630697000725.html

04-09-2021||Chandigarh||1984 riots: SC refuses to grant interim bail to ex-MP Sajjan Kumar||The Supreme Court on Friday refused to grant interim bail sought on health grounds to former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, who is serving life imprisonment in an 1984 anti-Sikh riots case, saying as per the medical records his condition is stable and improving.The apex court, which dealt with the submission advanced by Kumar’s counsel that the former MP be allowed to undergo treatment at a private hospital at his own cost, observed that he cannot be treated as a “super VIP patient”.“You are feeling he is the only patient in the country to be examined. He is one of the patients,” a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh told the counsel representing Kumar.Observing that Kumar was accused of “heinous crime”, the bench further said: “You want him to be treated as some kind of a super VIP patient. That is what is happening.” At the outset, Kumar’s counsel referred to the medical records and said he was examined by the doctors at a government hospital here and the report says his condition has improved and he needed few more days of hospital care.The counsel said the doctors have not given any conclusion about the diagnosis of the problem and Kumar has lost about 18kg weight. He said 75-year-old Kumar was earlier treated by a doctor at a private hospital and he could be treated there, even being in custody, at his own cost.“No. Sorry. He is being looked after here,” the bench said.When his counsel argued that he was only making a request considering that the man should not die, the bench observed, “You are making a very large statement. Who can guarantee that except the Almighty.” The bench observed that a picture was portrayed before it that something is very wrong but as per the medical reports, these are age related ailments.“Merely because he has been, in his time, some high-profile person, does not entitle him to keep coming every time to the court on these issues,” the bench observed.The top court noted in its order that the medical report says that Kumar was examined and a medical board was also constituted. It noted that as per the report, “his condition is stated to be stable and improving but he needs some more day of hospital care.” On August 24, the top court had directed the CBI to verify the medical condition of Kumar and file an affidavit.In September last year, the apex court had dismissed Kumar’s plea seeking interim bail on health grounds.Kumar is serving life imprisonment after the Delhi high court convicted him and others in the case on December 17, 2018.The high court had reversed the acquittal of Kumar by the trial court in 2013 in the case related to killings of five Sikhs in the Raj Nagar Part-I area in Palam Colony in southwest Delhi on November 1-2, 1984, and burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar Part-II.The riots had broken out after the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her two Sikh bodyguards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/1984-riots-sc-refuses-to-grant-interim-bail-to-ex-mp-sajjan-kumar-101630696282579.html
04-09-2021||Mumbai||5.1 million fewer Covid vaccine doses given to women compared to men in Maharashtra||While Maharashtra has crossed the 60-million mark in administering Covid-19 vaccine doses, at least 5.1 million fewer doses have been administered to women. The gender disparity in vaccination stands at nearly 3% when compared with the estimated population of the state. As of September 2, Maharashtra had administered over 32 million vaccine doses to men and a little over 27 million vaccine doses to women. Of the state’s estimated 66 million male population, nearly 49% have received at least one dose while among the estimated 60 million females, around 46% have received at least one dose. State health officials attribute fewer jabs among women to the skewed sex ratio. However, public health experts say that it’s an invalid argument. “In absolute numbers, a 3% gender gap means a lot for a densely populated state like Maharashtra,” said Soumitra Ghosh, associate professor at Centre for Health Policy, Planning and Management, Tata Institute of Social Sciences. “More importantly, when we look at the combined statistics of the state, it masks the greater gender disparities at district-level or block-level. Certain districts and blocks will have a wider gender gap in vaccinations compared to others. There will also be gender gaps in rural and urban population,” he said. Mumbai, which crossed the 10-million mark in vaccinations on Friday as per Co-WIN data, has administered 5.6 million doses to men and 4.3 million to women. In absolute numbers, 1.3 million fewer doses have been administered to women in the city. Similar gaps exist in other districts too. In Ahmednagar, which is now recording among the highest daily Covid-19 cases in the state, 185,000 fewer doses have been administered to women. Beed district in the drought-ridden Marathwada region has administered 88,500 fewer doses to women compared to men. “The disparities are likely to be more evident when data is studied at a micro-level,” said Ghosh, adding that the state government must conduct microanalysis as it will have policy implications. According to a research article published in the Observer Research Foundation, the gender gap in vaccinations cannot be attributed to a skewed sex ratio alone. “It has several underlying gender inequality-related issues contributing to it. Longstanding structural problems in healthcare and the gendered nature of healthcare access have resulted in families being less likely to prioritise health and welfare of women over men.” Dr AL Sharada, director of non-profit organisation Population First, agreed. “The dynamics in many families is such that men would be given a preference or may be more willing to take the vaccine as they have to step out for work, while women may be at home. This also applies when access to free vaccines is difficult and one has to pay for the jab,” she said. Post-jab side effects also play a role in delay in vaccinations among women. Household work takes a hit if the homemaker or woman in the family falls ill, and this fear often leads to women postponing their vaccination. Misconceptions about pregnancy-related complications, irregular menstrual cycles, hair fall have also led to hesitancy. Experts said gender-sensitive policies that involve targeted efforts to get women to vaccination centres can help bridge the gap. “Organising special vaccination drives for women and leveraging the private sector through subsidies and CSR initiatives for women should be considered by the state,” said Ghosh. Director of state health services Dr Archana Patil and state immunisation officer Dr Dilip Patil remained unavailable for comment despite multiple attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/51-million-fewer-covid-vaccine-doses-given-to-women-compared-to-men-in-maharashtra-101630696281337.html

04-09-2021||Lucknow||Ram temple construction: Carving of stones resumes as Raj sculptors arrive in Ayodhya||With the arrival of eight sculptors from Rajasthan, carving of stones for Ram Mandir has begun in Ayodhya once again. Chiselling of stones resumed at the workshop at Ram Ghat amid full Vedic rituals on Thursday after eight years. This workshop was shut down during the Samajwadi Party regime in Uttar Pradesh in 2013. It was reopened in 2017 when the BJP came to power in the state. However, carving of stones could not be carried out due to lack of sculptors. “Carving of stones has begun after eight sculptors reached Ayodhya from Rajasthan,” said Champat Rai, general secretary, Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust. The ongoing foundation work of Ram Mandir is about to complete by the end of September. Thereafter, construction of the second phase of the temple will start. Around four lakh cubic feet stones have to be carved for Ram Mandir. At present, only 50,000 cubic feet stones have been carved. According to Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust, about 65 per cent work related with carving of stones has to be completed. Ashish Sompura, architect of the temple, said a large number of sculptors will arrive from Rajasthan and other places in November to expedite the carving work. By then, stones from Bansi Pahadpur in Rajasthan will also arrive in Ayodhya. The famous stand stones from Rajasthan are being used for the construction of Ram Mandir. During the ongoing filling process, around 44 layers of 300 mm each have been laid. Each layer has been compressed with simple and vibrating rollers. In the ongoing filling work of the temple’s foundation, 1.25 lakh cubic metre dug-up ground will be completed by the end of September. The Tata Consulting Engineers is working as a project management consultant and is assisting Larsen & Toubro in the construction work. According to Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust, Larsen & Toubro has appointed Balaji Construction Company of Rajasthan as its assisting partner to complete the foundation work at the earliest. The temple’s foundation will be 107 feet above the sea level and is being made of layers of stones. For filling the temple’s foundation, crushed stone of Banda, coarse sand, fly ash and asbestos are being used. Workshop to be set up in Rajasthan too The Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust is also likely to start carving of stones in Rajasthan where a workshop will be established. This workshop is likely to come up in Bansi Pahadpur region where famous stones mines are located. As stones are yet to arrive from Rajasthan, stones kept at the workshop in Ayodhya will be carved till then. It will take two months to carve these stones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ram-temple-construction-carving-of-stones-resumes-as-raj-sculptors-arrive-in-ayodhya-101630696104297.html

We are receiving rousing responses in district-level meetings and large numbers of people from every corner of the state will come to listen to him and pay tribute to Devi Lal on September 25,” he added.Retired political science professor Anant Ram said the JJP and INLD are still fighting for Devi Lal’s legacy.“The INLD has received strength after the release of OP Chautala and JJP’s graph has reached a low due to the farmers’ protest. This is the best time for INLD to strengthen its cadre and bring its old workers into the party fold who had switched over to JJP after the vertical split,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/inld-leaders-gear-up-for-jind-rally-101630695680867.html

04-09-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC directs ED to reply to Sanjeev Palande’s plea for quashing ECIR||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday directed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to respond to the petition filed by Sanjeev Palande, personal secretary of former home minister Anil Deshmukh, for quashing of the enforcement case registered against him.Palande contended that the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) under which he was arrested on June 26 were violative of his rights guaranteed by the Constitution and were ultra vires, hence should be quashed and set aside. Palande, who was arrested by the ED in connection with the first information report (FIR) filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in its probe in corruption charges against Deshmukh, has claimed that the enforcement case information report (ECIR) was based solely on the statement of former Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze, who was dismissed from service after his involvement in the Antilia bomb scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases came to light, and hence could not be relied upon. When Palande’s petition came up for hearing before the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, additional solicitor general Anil Singh for ED sought time to file reply to the petition as it challenged the constitutional validity of various section of PMLA. In his petition, Palande said he was appointed as Deshmukh’s personal secretary in 2020 and had been coordinating various activities of the then home minister with other departments and home department as well as scheduling meetings for him. Referring to the meeting at the home minister’s official residence wherein the issue of action being taken against hookah parlours and dance bars was allegedly discussed, the petition stated that the same was done as the home minister was expected to respond to a question in the Legislative assembly on the subject. The petition stated that after Vaze was arrested and former Mumbai Police Param Bir Singh filed a public interest litigation in the HC on March 24, CBI filed a first information report (FIR) on April 21. The petition states that on June 25, ED prepared an ECIR and conducted raids at the residence of Deshmukh at Nagpur and Mumbai and thereafter searched the houses of Palande as well as Kundan Shinde, personal assistant of Deshmukh, on the same day. Palande said he was issued summons under section 50 of PMLA and asked to accompany ED officers to their offices, which he complied to. The petition stated that he was interrogated for a long time and asked to make self-incriminating statements, and that he was arrested when he refused to do the same. Palande claimed he was only shown the ECIR and was informed of the grounds of arrest but was not given a copy of the same. The petition pointed out that as the PMLA sections invoked in the case were arbitrary and violative of the rights of an individual, the same were ultra vires of article 21 of the Constitution, and hence should be quashed and set aside. The petition also claimed that the practice of not providing ECIR was arbitrary and hence the same should be quashed.The court has allowed ED to file a response within two weeks and posted next hearing to September 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-directs-ed-to-reply-to-sanjeev-palande-s-plea-for-quashing-ecir-101630695560818.html

The plea was filed by Munish Lather and five others, who have stated that scores of farmers, including the petitioners, got injured in the police lathi-charge effected on instructions of the then Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha and other district administration officials, committed in violation of fundamental rights of the petitioners. Lawyers associated with the matter said state’s advocate general BR Mahajan, who appeared in the matter, has been asked to file an affidavit. However, a detailed order is awaited from the bench presided over by chief justice RS Jha. The plea also demands to look into role of the the SDM, DSP Virender Saini, and inspector Harjinder Singh, among others. “Members of civil administration as well as police administration in Karnal had acted illegally and brutally and dealt with unarmed peaceful agitators with undue force and brutality which has seriously jeopardised the fundamental rights of citizens, who have a right to demonstrate,” it was argued. The plea also alleges that the injured farmers were not provided medical aid immediately and that some of the injured were even threatened with not getting their X-ray examination done. One of the injured farmers had suffered a heart attack and subsequently died as per the plea. The plea also demands compensation to all the injured and directions to the Punjab and Haryana governments to not use bamboo sticks and opt for less lethal options.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/karnal-violence-hc-seeks-response-from-haryana-govt-101630695441062.html

The IPS officer, who was also holding the post of principal secretary, transport was relieved of the charge of transport department and the post had fallen vacant.Even as the home department proposed the name of another IPS officer, Kala Ramachandran, for appointment as principal secretary, transport , Vij insisted that prior approval from the Centre should be obtained before appointing her to a cadre post of IAS.While chief principal secretary to chief minister (CPSCM), DS Dhesi, okayed the proposal to appoint Ramachandran as principal secretary (transport) without taking approval from Centre, chief secretary Vijai Vardhan is learnt to have strongly objected to the move citing IAS Cadre Rules.Vardhan is also learnt to have communicated that if the appointment of nine non-cadre officers (IPS, IFS and IRS) to the cadre posts of IAS has to continue, then the state government should seek mandatory approval of the central government or replace them with IAS officers.Vij also held his ground stating that the IPS officers should not be relieved from the police department and posted to a cadre post of IAS officers till the department of personnel and training (DoPT) of central government grants approval in this regard.Rule 9(2)(c) of the IAS Cadre Rules state that if a select list is not in force and it is proposed to appoint a non-select list officer, the state government shall forthwith make a proposal to that effect to the central government together with the reasons thereof and the appointment shall be made only with the prior approval of the central government.The rules also state that a cadre post in a state shall not be filled by a person who is not a cadre officer except if there is no suitable cadre officer available for filling the vacancy.Also, if it is proposed to continue the person who is not a cadre officer beyond a period of three months, the state government shall obtain the prior approval of the central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ias-vs-ips-vij-haryana-chief-secy-object-to-move-to-appoint-ips-officer-as-transport-secretary-101630695381339.html

I am very proud of my son, and the medal truly makes up for all the hardship he has faced through his life,” said Singh, a farmer by profession.Praveen, who made his debut at the Paralympics this year, has set a new Asian record with a jump of 2.07m at the game. Speaking to HT over the phone from Tokyo, right outside the stadium, the ‘silver boy’ said that he had “expected to win a bronze medal... never a silver”. “Initially, I was a little nervous after my first attempt. On the second attempt, I figured out that I will definitely win a bronze and will not go empty-handed. However, by the third attempt, I gathered every ounce of energy within me and gave my best shot, which won me a silver,” said the 18-year-old champion.On Friday afternoon, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath congratulated his parents over calls.Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh visited Praveen’s house to congratulate his parents. “Praveen has made Jewar proud with this achievement. We were sure that he would win a medal for the country. I thanked his parents for giving us a sporting gem and we will organise a grand felicitation event for him. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister wanted to congratulate his parents personally, hence I made them talk to him over the phone.”“I am thankful to Praveen’s coach Satyapal who showed him the way to success. He worked very hard to train him, and we got the results today,” said Praveen’s father, adding that his son suffers from a congenital impairment which has rendered his left leg shorter and weaker than the other.For the past three years, Praveen has been training at the Jawahar Lal Nehru (JLN) stadium in Delhi. In April 2021, he had tested Covid-19 positive, which put a pause to his training, but he says that he managed to recover from it. “When I was in Class 12, I moved to Delhi for my training. During this time, my school supported me a lot by helping me with missed classes and I managed to clear my boards. Then, I got admission in Moti Lal Nehru College in Delhi University,” Praveen said.Talking about his journey, Praveen said that he was good at volleyball in school, before he started training for high jump in 2018. “I did not know about para-sports until 2018, after which I took part in a district-level game from where I contacted my coach, Satyapal Sir. It is because of his efforts that I managed to win a silver medal for India, with just three years of experience in professional high jumping. I always dreamt of making my parents and my village proud, and today it seems that I have achieved that,” he added.Sheetal, a teacher at Greater Noida’s Pragyan Public School said that the school is proud of their alumnus’ achievement. “Praveen is a 2019 pass out from our school and he has always been good at sports. The teachers at our school always supported him with the games,” she said, adding that they, too, will hold a felicitation event for him.The contingent’s deputy Chef de Mission, Arhan Bagati, said that Praveen is one of the youngest Indians to win a medal at the Paralympics. “Praveen’s performance has been outstanding today, but this is not his peak as he is just 18 years old. He will achieve much more in coming days, and we are sure that he will be make and break more world records in the coming years.”Earlier, Praveen won a silver medal in the 2019 World Para Athletics Junior Championships in Switzerland. He has also won the 2021 Para Athletics Grand Prix in Dubai in February. According to Praveen, he now focuses on the 2022 Asian Para Games and aims to make the country proud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/always-dreamt-of-making-parents-proud-says-silver-medallist-praveen-kumar-101630695323009.html

During the march, their workers lost their phones.Sanjeev Nigam, Noida AAP spokesperson and district general secretary of the party, said around 1000 people participated in the Yatra. “Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh had attended the programme. Some miscreants took advantage of the gathering and stole mobile phones of several people,” he said. Sector 39 sub-inspector Rajeev Kumar said the AAP workers had caught the suspect and assaulted him before handing him to the police. “We questioned him but did not find any mobile phone on him. The AAP workers claimed the suspect had stolen the phones and passed them on to other suspects who fled the spot. A case was registered against the suspect under section 379 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code. He was produced in the court and sent to judicial custody,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/13-mobile-phones-stolen-during-aap-s-tiranga-yatra-in-noida-one-man-arrested-101630695262009.html
04-09-2021||Mumbai||Jumbo Covid centres in Mumbai to have lounge for mothers of positive children||All six jumbo Covid centres in Mumbai will have a waiting room — mother lounge — for mothers of children who test positive for Covid-19. The non-infected mothers will be allowed to visit their children after wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) kits for their safety. The move comes after it was observed during the second Covid wave that the infection rate among children increased by almost 50% and these infected children had to stay in isolated wards, away from their families for their treatment. This often affects their mental health, causing anxiety and sadness.In this backdrop, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has instructed all the jumbo Covid centres — Dahisar jumbo centre, Kandarpada jumbo centre in Dahisar, Nesco jumbo centre at Goregaon, Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) jumbo centre, NSCI Worli jumbo centre and Mulund jumbo centre — to make space for non-infected mothers in the form of a waiting room. “We know that a mother’s touch is essential for children. When Covid-infected children undergo treatment in isolation wards, they become sad and scared. We have, therefore, created a space in our jumbo facility called mother lounge where these mothers can wait in an area with proper facilities like drinking water until their children get discharged,” said Dr Pradeep Angre, dean of Mulund jumbo centre. The mothers will also be allowed to visit their children in the ward with PPE kits. “We will take all precautionary measures so that non-infected mothers do not contract the infection from their children,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, who was the brain behind the new provision. Jumbo centres at BKC, Dahisar and Mulund have already started working on it. If this becomes successful in getting infected children comfortable, then the same will be replicated in major civic-run hospitals as well. “If hospitals have space for the lounge, they can do it. There are no restrictions on it. We have seen that when a patient gets to talk and see their family members, they become happier, which also contributes to their faster recovery,” said Kakani. Mumbai has recorded 745,012 Covid cases as of September 2, of which 3,418 are currently active, according to BMC’s dashboard. Of the total cases, 34,539 infections were seen among children and adolescents of whom 13,473 were aged below nine years and 34,539 were aged between 10 and 18. In the second wave, city psychiatrists received a large number of recovered Covid-19 young patients who had to get hospitalised for treatment. They visited psychiatrists with complaints of anxiety, fear and nightmares. “A child already becomes anxious when he/she contracts Covid-19. In addition to this, when they see healthcare staffers in PPE, they become more fearful. They have to stay alone in isolation wards which affects their mental health. Even after getting discharged, they are scared of staying away from their parents. Many suffer from separation anxiety from parents,” said Dr Nirmala Rao, founder of Aavishkar Clinic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/jumbo-covid-centres-in-mumbai-to-have-lounge-for-mothers-of-positive-children-101630695260922.html

04-09-2021||Noida||Trans-Hindon localities identified among high-risk for vector-borne diseases||The Ghaziabad health department identified Indirapuram, Vasundhara, Vaishali and parts of Sahibabad as among areas susceptible to dengue, while six other areas were identified as high-risk for malaria. To curtail the spread of the diseases, the department has asked Covid surveillance teams to join in the effort.The department said that they mapped the areas through special surveillance for the mosquito-borne diseases. In 2016, the district recorded 621 cases of dengue, according to official records , that gradually declined over the years to just five till date in 2021. Likewise, there were 128 cases of malaria in 2016 that increased to 293 in 2017 and have been on the decline since with this year recording six cases till date. The monsoon months, from June to September, are particularly favourable for mosquito breeding. “Localities of Indirapuram, Vaishali and those close to river Hindon and the Yamuna have been identified as high-risk for vector-borne diseases,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer. “Parts of Muradnagar, Loni and even area close to ponds have also been identified as high-risk for malaria. For special surveillance, we have roped in teams from the Covid testing to help in testing for the vector-borne diseases. We are also taking help of other departments as well.” The localities identified as high-risk for dengue include parts of Indirapuram, Vasundhara, Nehru Nagar, Vaishali, Khoda, Rajendra Nagar, Pratap Vihar, Nandgram, Karhera, Arthla, Akbarpur-Behrampur and Sudamapuri while those identified as high-risk for malaria, include mostly the rural blocks in in Loni, Bhojpur and Muradnagar, said officials. The officials said that the localities have been identified after analysing data from these regions over the last five years. Experts say that heavy waterlogging, especially in low-lying areas this monsoon season may result in spread of vector-borne diseases. Heavy waterlogging was reported from Indirapuram, Vaishali, Sahibabad, Patel Nagar, Govindpuram, Gandhi Nagar and delta colonies like Brij Vihar, among others, over the last few days. “In severe cases, these diseases may result in multi-organ failure. There has been incessant waterlogging in different parts of the city, and this may lead to spread of vector-borne diseases. So, it is vital that all preventive measures be taken up by the health department and even by residents,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). “Apart from vector-borne diseases, we also have many cases of viral fever.” The health department officials said that they have been able to bring down cases of dengue and malaria with rigorous efforts over the years. “This has been possible due to special drives that we take up every three months. Early detection and tracking help in controlling the spread. Further, under Covid-19, the weekend closure of markets also helped as we could deploy massive sanitisation measures at public places,” said GK Mishra, district malaria officer. He added that the district is not affected by kala-azar, filarial and Japanese encephalitis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/transhindon-localities-identified-among-high-risk-for-vector-borne-diseases-101630695141795.html
04-09-2021||Mumbai||Centre busy looting citizens; inflation could spark anger against Modi govt: Shiv Sena||Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana slammed the Centre on Friday over the rising prices of cooking gas and fuel and said that the government is busy “looting” the poor and middle-class population. The editorial pointed out that Centre has earned ₹23 lakh crore through cooking gas, and ₹1.12 lakh crore through GST (Goods and Services Tax) in August alone, but there is no respite from price hikes for the common citizens. The Sena mouthpiece warned that the continuous hike in prices could spark anger against the Narendra Modi government.The Sena also lauded former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who on Wednesday, launched an attack on the Centre over inflation and the repeated increase in fuel prices by asserting that “GDP growth” for the government meant “increase in Gas, Diesel and Petrol prices”. “The Modi government says the wheels of economy have accelerated. However, the economic cycle for the poor and middle-class people has slowed down. Several public sector units (PSUs) have been divested to raise money in the government’s coffers. Insurance companies and banks are being sold to private players. The government is running away from its responsibilities,” the editorial said.It also warned the Centre and said that the rising inflation could “spark an explosion of people’s patience”. “Inflation is on the rise, and if this continues, how long will it take for the spark of people’s anger to cause an explosion [against the government],” the editorial stated, adding, “The government is busy looting everybody now, but the entire country is coming together against this loot. Rahul Gandhi said the government has made the survival of the poor and middle-class impossible.”Taking on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government, the mouthpiece said when the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government left office in 2014, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was priced at ₹410 per cylinder, while today it reached ₹885 per cylinder, which is a 116 % increase. It added that petrol was available for ₹71.51 per litre but is now ₹101.34 per litre, which is a 42% increase, while diesel was priced at ₹57.28 a litre but now it has increased by 55% and costs ₹88.77. “Ten year ago, BJP’s Hema Malini, Smriti Irani, Meenakshi Lekhi and other women leaders had protested against inflation, wherein they took to the streets with empty LPG cylinders. Now when crores of women are facing inflation, where are these aggressive women leaders of BJP?” it the editorial questioned.Maharashtra BJP spokespersons said they do not comment on Saamana editorials as a part of their party’s policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/centre-busy-looting-citizens-inflation-could-spark-anger-against-modi-govt-shiv-sena-101630695085628.html

The dissolution of the committee came through a notification issued by AU registrar Prof NK Shukla. The symposium, which was scheduled to be held on August 13, had courted controversy when it emerged that some poets invited to it, had also been part of the anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi.An all-India Mushaira and Kavi Sammelan had been planned on the campus of AU on August 13 under the joint aegis of Uttar Pradesh Urdu Academy and Central Cultural Committee of AU and department of Urdu, AU. Prof Shabnam Hamid, head of the Urdu department and Prof Santosh Bhadauria, chairman of the Central Cultural Committee of AU were active in preparations for the event. However, the Mushaira was cancelled at the last moment despite the fact that almost all the invited poets had arrived, besides many guests. The cancellation had reportedly come after divisional commissioner Sanjay Goyal, who had earlier given his approval to attend the symposium as the chief guest and AU V-C, who was to preside over the function, backed out at the last moment.Although the university authorities were tight-lipped about the reason for the event’s cancellation, citing “unavoidable circumstances, many officials had confirmed that it was because of the names of some Urdu poets who were among the invitees, as they had raised their voice against CAA at the Shaheen Bagh protests in New Delhi. When this issue went viral on social media, the two had backed out from attending the event and it was cancelled. AU’s central cultural committee, which was constituted in December 2020, has been dissolved with immediate effect, confirmed university officials. On the reason for the committee being dissolved within just eight months of it being set up, AU public relations officer (PRO), Jaya Kapoor, said, “The AU administration has decided that there is a need for a new cultural committee, and hence, the existing committee has been dissolved so that a new committee can take over.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/au-dissolves-cultural-panel-new-one-to-be-set-up-101630695082982.html
04-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Covid cases stable but Mumbai sees surge||While new Covid-19 new cases in Maharashtra continue to be stable in the 4,000-plus level, Mumbai is seeing a rise as cases are now above 400. Maharashtra recorded 4,313 new cases on Friday including 423 cases in Mumbai. The total case tally in the state stands at 6,477,987.Mumbai had been recording less than 400 new cases daily till August 29.The state government is worried due to forthcoming Ganpati festival as there are indications that the numbers may surge during the festive season.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to Maharashtra government on Covid-19 management, blamed citizens for this impasse. “People have started moving out and are taking things casually. We see people not wearing masks and even those wearing are not wearing them properly. Social distancing has now gone for a toss,” said Dr Salunkhe. He said there will be a surge in cases in the coming festivals. “The next few months are festive seasons and there is bound to be congregations of people. This is going to be counterproductive and we may witness a surge again” he added. Union health ministry has advised the state to impose curbs to prevent any spiralling of numbers during the festivities, and warned that all the gains made till date may be nullified if the situation is not handled properly. Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretary general of Organised Medicine Academic Guild, also concurred with Dr Salunkhe, and said the government should crack down on such activities. “We are seeing more cases and increased hospitalisations. On one hand the government talks about restricting Ganpati festival and on the other hand, they are organising special buses for those going to Konkan region,” said Dr Gilada. The second wave of Covid-19 was worse than the first wave as it infected more people and caused more deaths. There are apprehensions that the third wave may turn out to be more severe, and hence all efforts are being made to stop this. Mumbai reported three deaths on Friday, pushing toll to 15,987. Total number of deaths in Maharashtra reached 137,643, of which Pune leads with 19,289 deaths followed by Mumbai with 15,987 and Thane with 11,319 deaths. On Friday, 160,481 tests were done while the number of recoveries clocked 4,360.There are currently 50,466 active patients across the state. Pune tops with 14,973 patients followed by Thane with 7,103 and Satara with 6,007 patients.Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has given nod to drama theatres and auditoriums to open from November. The decision was taken during a meeting with theatre personalities representing their associations. The state government is expected to issue standard operating procedure (SOP) for the same in the next few weeks.“The CM has given nod for the opening of drama theatres and auditoriums from early November. The SOP will be issued at appropriate time. We expect the third wave, even if it hits in the next few weeks, will subside by then. Theatres have been shut for last 18 months and need some time for preparations and maintenance work before they open,” said cultural affairs minister Amit Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-covid-cases-stable-but-mumbai-sees-surge-101630694962089.html

Greater Noida authority chief executive officer Narendra Bhooshan, who is looking after the project’s development, said, “We informed the chief secretary that one key feature of the township will be that waste will be collected, segregated via a dedicated pipe system and it will reach to the treatment facility set up inside the township. Treated waste water from this township will be recycled for irrigation and non-drinking purpose.”The chief secretary also visited hospitals in Gautam Budh Nagar to review preparations for a possible third wave of Covid 19, said officials.In 2017, the IITGL began allotting industrial plots in the township and only around 260 acres is yet to be alloted. Mumbai-based developer Shapoorji Pallonji is developing the township. While around half of the land was earmarked for industries, the rest was for residential and commercial purposes, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-chief-secretary-inspects-integrated-township-101630694902497.html

Teams had been deployed to ensure arrest of five others named in the case. He said the SIT members had been instructed to collect details of properties owned by the accused and complete the probe fast. The police commissioner said that he had also written a letter to regional transport officer, asking him to provide details and documents of luxury vehicles owned by the directors. He said that the cases were registered after several people filed complaints alleging that Nilgiri Infracity’s directors committed a large scale fraud. The victims alleged that Nilgiri Infracity Company claimed to give plots in Varanasi and Chandauli at a much lower price than the market rate.

04-09-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks Mumbai Police to reply to Delhi riot victim supporters’ plea against case||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked the Mumbai Police to respond to a petition filed by 16 people who were booked for violating prohibitory orders of the police by assembling for a candlelight vigil at Dadar on February 26, 2020 in support of the victims of Delhi mass violence. The petition stated they were not aware of the prohibitory orders, and as no law and order situation was created by their assembly, the FIR should be quashed and set aside. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing the petition, was informed by advocate Anandini Fernanades for the petitioners that they had received a notice stating that a first information report (FIR) had been registered against them under sections 37 (1) (powers to prevent acts leading to disorder) and 135 (penalty for contravention of Section 37) of the Maharashtra Police Act (MPA). The petitioners said they appeared before the magistrate on March 3, 2020 for bail and on furnishing cash security of ₹7,000 and a personal bond, they were granted bail. The court was further informed that a charge sheet was also filed in the case, pursuant to which the petitioners moved the HC seeking quashing of the criminal proceedings. The petitioners stated the vigil was attended mainly by students, senior citizens and social activists who did not have any criminal antecedents. They claimed that upon inquiry, the police said the charges were imposed on them as they had failed to abide by the public announcement made by the police restraining people from assembling in groups. The petition further said the charge sheet in the case was filed for assembling without permission, whereas the offence was actually pertaining to violation of written order issued by the deputy commissioner of police (operations) which came under a different section of MPA, which was unwarranted. The petition further alleged the charge sheet was based on one witness statement by an assistant police inspector who said the prohibitory order was announced over mega phones on February 20, 2020 and stuck outside notice boards of police stations. However, the same was not corroborated with documents. It also alleged that though men and women had been part of the vigil, action was initiated only against the men. “There is no legal basis for this unilateral and discriminatory decision of the respondents,” stated the petition. In view of this, the petitioners sought quashing of the charge sheet and criminal proceedings on the grounds that no fruitful purpose will be served if the proceedings are allowed to continue. After hearing the submission, the bench directed the Mumbai Police to respond to the petition by September 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-mumbai-police-to-reply-to-delhi-riot-victim-supporters-plea-against-case-101630694660652.html

The protesting farmers had parked their tractors outside the university from 11am to 4pm, blocking vehicular movement in that area.Sunil Fauji, a farmers’ leader, said that the Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Authority (UPSIDC) had acquired the land of Chithera and Duttawali villages for the development of the Shiv Nadar University (SNU). “They had promised jobs to the local youths, development of the villages, and 10% development plots. The land was acquired in 2007 but the promises have not been fulfilled.”“In 2013, after the farmers’ protest, the district administration had facilitated a meeting with the university management. They had agreed to provide increased compensation, free education to the farmers’ children, and job opportunities to the local people. The farmers only got the compensation, but the other demands were not met. We have decided to protest till all the demands are met,” Fauji added.Pradeep Tripathi, station house officer (SHO), Dadri police station, said, “A police team was deployed at the spot to maintain enforcement of law and order. The farmers protested peacefully, and it was called off in the evening... The farmers and university officials have decided to call a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the issues.”A spokesperson of the SNU, Delhi-NCR, said, “We are in talks with the UPSIDC, the district administration, and the Chithera village panchayat to amicably resolve the pending issues of land acquisition and compensation with the farmers. In our discussion with the authorities and the group of farmers on September 3, 2021, it has been decided that the farmers will provide all the requisite documents of unresolved cases of compensation to the UPSIDC to reach a resolution soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmers-protest-outside-shiv-nadar-university-over-land-acquisition-101630694542258.html

Thackeray also conducted the bhoomi pujan for the construction of a viewing deck at Girgaum Chowpatty. This deck will be built on an existing storm water drain outfall near Chowpatty.According to the plan, the plant constructed from corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds will generate 250-300 units of power everyday that will be used by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for electrification of its public parks. “The project is expected to generate about 250 to 300 units of electricity per day. Initially, the power will be used in a municipal park and a solid waste segregation centre. The project will result in partial savings in municipal electricity costs as well as savings in waste transportation costs,” BMC said in a statement. Further, Thackeray also performed the groundbreaking ceremony for starting the construction of a 475 square metre viewing deck near Girgaum Chowpatty. The viewing gallery, named as ‘Darshak Gallery’, is being constructed from the tourism point of view. “The gallery will be set up by taking into consideration the tides, altitudes and pressures from a scientific point of view. All the necessary permissions for the gallery have already been obtained and it is expected that the gallery will be up and running in the next three months,” the statement added.BMC has planned a nature’s trail for tourism, a few metres away from this proposed gallery. According to the plan, citizens will get a 700-metre-long walkway at Malabar Hill in the next few months to get a bird’s eye-view of the Arabian Sea. The walkway will be located nearby Babulnath Temple and will wind through the hill forest, giving unobstructed scenic views of the Arabian Sea and the bustling city. The design for the forest trail at Malabar Hill is expected to be constructed without cutting any tree, considering the concept is to build in lush greenery.Meanwhile, in the runner up of upcoming civic polls in February, politicians are on an inauguration spree. On Thursday, Thackeray inaugurated the beautification plan for Mahim beach. Under this plan, BMC undertook the cleaning of the beach, cleared heavy vehicles parked as well as hutments, filled up the beach with up to 5 feet of sand which was lost due to soil erosion, planted trees and set up pavements, garden furniture, a playing area and a 30-metre-high viewing tower for tourists, that gives a panoramic view of the Arabian Sea and the Bandra Worli sea link.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-gets-waste-to-enery-plant-viewing-deck-off-arabian-sea-to-open-in-3-months-101630694482301.html

The accused, Farooq Shaukat Bagwan, had forged documents that were used to buy the SIM cards allegedly used in the blasts case.Bagwan had moved the bail plea through advocate Sharif Shaikh claiming that he was falsely implicated and that he had already spent eight years in jail while the trial is still at the stage of framing of charges and a large number of witnesses were yet to be examined. He also claimed the prosecution failed to prove the conspiracy.Bagwan’s laptop and computer was seized but the forensic laboratory has not found any forged documents on it.Shaikh had submitted that the material available on record was not sufficient to prima facie establish guilt of the accused. He also argued that the prosecution had failed to establish conspiracy theory that the documents forged by him and the SIM cards obtained using the same were to be used for illegal acts.Vaibhav Bagade, for the anti-terrorism squad (ATS), opposed the plea.Special judge Dinesh E Kothalikar on Friday rejected Bagwan’s plea observing that the applicant has failed to make out a case for bail. The court further said there was delay in trial as some accused are lodged in Tihar Jail and the trial against them was going on before a court in New Delhi.The judge said prima facie, a case of conspiracy was made out from the available material. The accused had conspired to do illegal acts and strike terror with the intent to threaten or likely to threaten the unity, integrity, security and sovereignty of India by using fire arms and to exploit the communal sentiments of impressionable youths and to provoke them in the name of Jihad in order to resort to terrorist acts.The serial blasts took place at several places in Pune including Jangali Maharaj Road near Balgandharva Rang Mandir and five other places.

The Uttar Pradesh government has appointed the team to file a report and all documents related to the Supertech’s twin towers -- Apex and Ceyane -- located in Sector 93A.“We will visit the Noida authority office on Monday to collect details related to the probe,” said Sanjiv Mittal, Uttar Pradesh infrastructure and industrial development commissioner heading the SIT. The SIT has additional chief secretary (revenue) Manoj Singh, ADG Rajeev Sabharwal, and Uttar Pradesh chief town and rural planner Anup Kumar.The move comes a day after the state government formed the team to investigate and fix responsibilities of all the top officials of the authority who had approved the building map of the 40-storey twin towers in the housing complex in violation of the building regulations. The state government formed the SIT in compliance with the Supreme Court order, in which it had directed demolition of the towers within three months and prosecution of the officials involved.According to sources, the Noida authority had a committee that used to approve building maps from 2005 to 2012, when the map of the twin towers was approved. The committee had members from the engineering and planning department too. The committee had planning officials like Tribhuvan Singh, VA Devpujrai, Rajpal Kaushik, Vimla Singh, Shailendra Kaire, Mukesh Goyal and engineer Baburam among others. All these officials have retired except Mukesh Goyal. According to the rules, the Noida authority chief executive officer has the power to delegate the roles to the officials to approve building maps. The then CEO (not identified) had formed a committee that used to approve the building maps. The authority has shared these details with the state government, and it is part of the SIT probe now. The SIT is likely to file FIRs against all the officials involved in Noida next week, said the officials.Meanwhile, the Noida authority chief executive officer, Ritu Maheshwari, took a meeting with all the officials in Sector 6 on Friday to discuss the Supreme Court order compliance. “We have identified all documents related to the twin towers map approval and will provide those to the SIT,” said a Noida authority official, requesting anonymity.The authority has also started taking steps to be ready for demolition of the building as per the apex court order. The Uttar Pradesh government had earlier suspended Mukesh Goyal, who was taking care of hearing the case in the apex court.

The International Business, IT &ITES (Information technology and information technology enabled services) and commercial and industrial (non-polluting) hub will be very close to the Centre’s India International Convention and Expo Centre, said officials . A senior DDA official said, “The consultant will have to carry out a detailed study of the area, delineate boundaries of the influence area of the identified land parcels. The consultant will have to prepare a detailed layout plan.”The land-owning agency aims to develop the three sectors based on the Transit Oriented Development policy. As a lot of big projects, such as the international convention centre, land pooling, Railway passenger terminal at Bijwasan, Urban Extension Road-II, etc are in the pipeline, the DDA official said that an impact study will be done while planning the new sectors.“The consultant will study and analyse the existing as well as proposed amenities, infrastructure, transportation, green areas etc. of the identified area. As part of the study, a detailed infrastructure plan, along with cost estimates, will be prepared,” said the official.Transportation is going to be a key focus area of the plan. “A transportation plan will be prepared to ensure conflict free movement within the complex and around it. There is a proposal to develop a cycle sharing facility at the hub,” said the official.

04-09-2021||Mumbai||OBC reservation in Maharashtra: Collect data soon, state tells panel||The Maharashtra government will direct the Maharashtra State Commission for Backward Classes (MSCBC) to try to collect empirical data necessary to restore reservation for the Other Backward Classes (OBC) in the state in the next few months. The unanimous decision was taken in the all-party meeting called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to resolve the issue on Friday. The commission will be asked to adopt the fastest way, so that the empirical data can be collated in the next three-four months. It was also decided that the polls for local bodies be postponed until empirical data is not collected. It is further planning to bring in an amendment in the legislation to provide reservation to the OBC within the 50% reservation cap mandated by the Supreme Court. The political reservation of Other Backward Classes (OBC) in local bodies is on the verge of getting scrapped, following an Apex Court verdict. While scrapping the OBC reservation in local bodies, it had asked the state to collect empirical data of the community to decide on the reservation quota, which means the community will not get reservation until it is collected. This is the second meeting held by the chief minister in the past one week to resolve the issue. The exercise started after the state election commission recently directed to start preparations for local bodies’ polls due early next year and hold elections without OBC reservation. The move would create unrest in the community which is politically damaging for the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. “The directives will be issued to the MSCBC to complete the process of collecting empirical data as early as possible. They will also be asked to take the help of state advocate general (Ashutosh Kumbhakoni),” Thackeray said. “It was also unanimously decided that if there is a delay in getting the desired data then the proposed local bodies’ polls be deferred,” the chief minister said in a statement issued by the chief minister office (CMO). “The state will work on multiple alternatives. While directing the MSCBC to collect the empirical data in less time, we will continue our legal battle in the Apex Court, where we have already filed a petition seeking caste-based census data from the central government,” said Chhagan Bhujbal, food and civil supplies minister, who is also an OBC leader. The state government has filed a writ petition in the Apex Court seeking Socio Economic Caste Census, 2011 data from the Centre. The next hearing is going to be held on September 23. “In addition, the state may come up with an ordinance to provide reservation to the OBC community without breaching the 50% reservation cap mandated by the SC. The option will be used if there is a delay in obtaining empirical data and local bodies’ elections cannot be deferred,” Bhujbal explained. The state is planning to bring in an amendment in the local bodies acts that provides 27% reservation to the OBC community. It is of the view that the existing amendment be tweaked saying that 50% cap will not be breached and the OBC will get remaining percent reservation after providing quota to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities. Section 12(2)(c) of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961, provides a 27% quota for persons belonging to backward classes, which was challenged in the court of law. The legislation for the local bodies in Maharashtra provides reservation to the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities based on their population in those particular bodies, whereas in case of OBC this population data is not available as their last census was conducted in 1931. As a result, there are many districts where the combined reservation of all the communities exceeds 50% cap. Even after amendments, there are three to five districts where OBCs will not get reservation benefits. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said that around 15% seats will be reduced in the local bodies’ polls in the absence of empirical data. “The state law and judiciary department has taken a positive stand on bringing in the amendment in the legislation to provide reservation to the OBC community in case there is a delay in getting empirical data. Despite that, there are around three districts where the OBC community will not get reservation. Of the total 5,200 seats reserved for the OBC community, around 4,500 seats can be saved by bringing in the amendment, according to the chief secretary (Sitaram Kunte),” Fadnavis told reporters after the meeting at Sahyadri guest house, Malabar Hill. If empirical data is collected in the next 3-4 months, the issue will be resolved as elections are going to be held only after that, he added. On March 4, the Supreme Court ruled that the reservation in favour of the OBC in local bodies should not result in exceeding the 50% cap in reservation quota mandated by it. It has directed the state to appoint a dedicated commission for collecting empirical data, based on which the reservation quota of the community be fixed and also allowed the state election commission to hold local bodies polls without having reservations for OBCs. It means no seat will be reserved for OBC community candidates for any local body elections until empirical data is made available. On July 5, the state legislature also passed a resolution seeking empirical data by the Centre, collected under Socio Economic Caste Census 2011, for restoration of political reservation to OBCs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/obc-reservation-in-maharashtra-collect-data-soon-state-tells-panel-101630693940664.html
04-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC asks officials to reduce number of Afghans protesting outside UN office||The Delhi high court on Friday asked the Delhi government and the city police to “suitably reduce” the number of Afghan nationals protesting outside the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), observing that when marriages in Delhi permit only 100 people, how can 500 people be allowed to protest.Justice Rekha Palli, while hearing a plea by the residents of Vasant Vihar seeking removal of the Afghan protestors protesting outside the UNHCR office in the area, said that there can be no exceptions for the refugees and the law has to be the same for everyone.“…your difficulties cannot stand in the way of law and order. Even if somebody wants to perform the marriage only 100 are allowed, and these are 500 people sitting there conveniently. They are refugees, we have full sympathy with them. and there can be no question of being unduly harsh on them. But the law has to be law for everyone,” justice Palli said.“How are you permitting 500? I will have to then considering passing an order limiting it to be 100. Please sort it out and reduce the number of protestors, otherwise I will have to pass directions. …What is this exception? The citizens of Delhi cannot collect in more than 100 but the refugees are allowed to gather in 500. What is the explanation?” the judge asked.Remarking that the city cannot be put to risk, the court said, “In the meantime, respondents 3 and 4 (Delhi Police and Delhi government) will ensure that Covid-19 protocols are strictly maintained and also ensure that the number of people protesting at the site be suitably reduced”.The court’s order and remarks came while hearing the plea by Vasant Vihar Welfare Association that the foreign nationals (refugees/ asylum seekers) have gathered outside the UNHCR office at B Block in Vasant Vihar since August 15, including lanes and parks adjoining it, and residents are facing difficulties due to this.The plea had said besides the problems in mobility, the protestors were not adhering to the social distancing norms and not wearing masks.On Friday, advocate Satyakam, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, informed the court that the protestors do not have any permission to protest there. He said that an FIR has also been registered against them for not following the orders of social distancing or exhibiting Covid-appropriate behaviour.The central government’s standing counsel Ajay Digpaul told the court that the situation was unprecedented and any action against the refugees in distress will have international ramifications. He said that the issue must be seen from a humanitarian angle, and urged the court to grant some more time to take a holistic view for resolve the issue.The court granted time and listed the matter for further hearing on September 7, saying if the matter is not resolved by then, it will be constrained to pass an order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-asks-state-govt-police-to-suitably-reduce-number-of-afghan-nations-protesting-outside-un-office-in-vasant-vihar-101630693880801.html

Even if we give two minute per questions, there won’t be enough time because many of these questions are application-based and assertion-reasoning questions... Students will only learn time management by practice.”Rannu Pathak, the senior coordinator at Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said, “Students will need to have clarity of concepts to be able to answer the questions in the given time. The sample paper released for different subjects has come at the appropriate time and we will start discussing these papers soon so that students have enough time to practice.”In July, CBSE announced that it will hold two sets of board exams this academic year to prepare for any unprecedented situation arising out of Covid-19 pandemic. Along with the division of syllabus between the two terms, the board had also changed the paper pattern for this year.While the first board exam will have multiple choice questions (MCQ), including case-based MCQs and MCQs on assertion-reasoning type, and the duration of the test will be 90 minutes, the second board exam in March-April will be two hours long and have questions of different formats including case-based or situation based, short answer or long answer type.For instance, in the sample question paper for Class 12 English Core subject, the students will have to read the comprehension and answer case-based MCQs on it for their reading skills and select appropriate titles and body text for notices for the writing skills based on a given context. In the literature section too, students are given extracts of poems or prose and then asked to answer MCQ-based questions on it.Several government school principals said they will also distribute the printed copies of the sample papers from the school fund to needy students.Rakesh Semalty, head of Government Boys Senior Secondary School in West Jyoti Nagar, said, “Since this is a completely new pattern introduced during a difficult year, we will be pracitising these papers with students in October. For now, we will be discussing this in between lessons as students have just come back to school. We will engage in thorough practice in October so that students are confident of appearing for their exams under this new pattern.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbsereleases-sample-papers-for-class-10-12-board-exams-101630693822083.html

04-09-2021||Delhi||Charges against Khalid reads like script of web series, his lawyer tells court||Former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student leader Umar Khalid, who is seeking bail in the conspiracy case of the north-east Delhi riots, on Friday told a Delhi court that the charge sheet filed against him “read like the script of a popular web series or the 9pm TV news” and was a result of the “fertile imagination of the police officer who drafted it”.Senior advocate Trideep Pais, representing Khalid, told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat, “It reads like the 9pm TV news on channels. Those news channels say anything they want. They want to give something a slant like this, they will do so. They have absolutely no responsibility.” Khalid, along with several others, was booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for his alleged role in orchestrating the north-east Delhi riots of 2020, which claimed 53 lives and left over 400 injured. Pais said the charge sheet makes hyperbolic allegations against his client without any factual basis. Drawing parallels between the statements carried in the charge sheet and the villain of Harry Potter series, Lord Voldemort, Pais stated that the final report filed by the police was “rubbish”.Referring to a line in the charge sheet which said, “Khalid kept a safe distance from Delhi as he knew that Delhi would be thrown into the fire”, Pais said the only way the police officer could have known this was if “he was inside Khalid’s mind”.“The last person who got into a person’s mind was Voldemort in Harry Potter. This police officer must have been inside his (Khalid’s) mind to have known this…The charge sheet is the result of the fertile imagination of the police officer who drafted it and the witnesses who were procured. He is not writing the script of Family Man (web series on Amazon Prime), this is a charge sheet,” Pais said.He said there was nothing in Khalid’s speeches that led to lawless action, sedition, hatred, or illegality of any sort.“This charge sheet is not a charge sheet. It is an exercise in pamphleteering and defaming people and brushing them with the colour of criminality when there isn’t any,” the senior advocate said.Pais contended that “witness statements are being fabricated” and not a single witness had testified against Khalid.“Not a single witness says that Umar Khalid, Yogender Yadav agreed to use social media and mobilisation of youth to protest and cause a chakka jaam (blockade)... No press release, no pamphlets, no joint social media post were made by these people. If there is no basis for these facts and you put it in your charge sheet, and newsrooms carried it day in and day out, who communalised this country? Not me, it is the police,” Pais said.“One of the biggest theories is that there was a conspiracy on January 8. The protected witness, Saturn, either speaks under pressure or with a forked tongue,” Pais told the court adding that the protected witness has “made a different, inconsistent statement in another FIR”, and the person’s statements cannot be taken seriously.Pais said several statements carried in the charge sheet cannot be relied upon while considering the bail plea and read out another line, which said, “Umar Khalid, a veteran of sedition”.“There is no way these statements are consistent with each other and meet the test (of criminality) under UAPA,” he added.The matter will be heard next on September 6, 2021.Delhi Police recently said Khalid’s bail plea had no merit and that it will demonstrate before the court the prima facie case against Khalid by referring to the charge sheet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/charges-against-khalid-result-of-cops-fertile-imagination-reads-like-the-script-of-a-web-series-his-lawyer-tells-court-101630693400679.html
04-09-2021||Delhi||‘Protest fundamental in democracy’: Bail for 5 booked in Delhi riots cases||The Delhi high court on Friday granted bail to five people booked for the murder of head constable Rattan Lal during the riots in February last year, noting that the right to protest and express dissent is fundamental in a democratic polity, and added that just the act of protesting should not be employed as a weapon to justify incarcerating those exercising this right.Justice Subramonium Prasad, while ordering the release of Furkan, Suvleen, Tabassum (all of whom go by single names), Mohammad Arif and Shadab Ahmad, said that every member of an unlawful assembly cannot be booked for the murder only on the basis of “general and vague allegations” and they cannot be left to languish in jails.“There cannot be an umbrella assumption of guilt on behalf of every accused by the court, and every decision must be taken based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances in the matter therein. This principle, therefore, gains utmost importance when the court considers the question of grant or denial of bail,” the judge said while granting bail to the five accused.Furkan, Arif, Ahmad, Suvleen and Tabassum were arrested on April 1, March 11, April 6, May 17 and October 3 last year, respectively. In five separate verdicts, Justice Prasad said no substantial evidence has been obtained against the accused to keep them in prolonged incarceration. He said that the principle of bail attempts to bridge the gap between the personal liberty of an accused and ensuring that public order remains intact.“It is egregious and against the principles enshrined in our Constitution to allow an accused to remain languishing behind bars during the pendency of the trial”.“Therefore, the court, while deciding an application for grant of bail, must traverse this intricate path very carefully and thus take multiple factors into consideration before arriving at a reasoned order whereby it grants or rejects bail,” the court said.According to the police, on February 24, 2020, a crowd carrying various weapons convened at the main Wazirabad Road and refused to abide by the police’s orders to disperse.The police, represented by additional solicitor general SV Raju, argued that the crowd soon got out of control and started pelting stones at officers and more than 50 personnel suffered injuries, while Lal was shot dead. He had added that the protests turned violent, and the agitators burnt vehicles, and other properties in the vicinity.The court, however, said that a fourth charge sheet has been filed in the case and trial in the matter is likely to take a long time and so it was not prudent to keep the accused behind bars for an undefined period of time.The judge said that merely because Ahmad and Tabassum were one of the organisers of the protests and were in touch with other participants, it is insufficient to justify that the duo were involved in the pre-planning of the alleged incident.It said the accused have roots in society, and, therefore, there was no danger of them absconding and fleeing and directed them to furnish a personal bond of ₹35,000 each and a surety of the like amount.Regarding the role of woman accused, Tabassum, the high court said the record revealed that she has not been caught on any video footage in the vicinity of the protest site, and the contention that a few women wearing burqas have been caught assaulting police officials in a video does not have any weight at this juncture as she cannot be identified in the clip.With respect to Furkan, the court said that there was no electronic evidence to establish that he was present at the scene of the crime and his call detail records are inconclusive as he was a resident of the local area.The court also said that accused Arif was not visible in the CCTV video relied upon and clothes similar to that of his have been worn by multiple others.It held that Ahmad’s CDRs and cell ID details pointed that he had reached the scene of crime after the commission of the alleged offence, i.e, the murder of Rattan Lal.“At this juncture, it appears that the statements of the police officers that have been recorded are wholly contradictory to the CDR and cell ID details that are on record,” it said.The court directed the accused to not leave the national capital without permission of the court and not tamper with the evidence or influence witnesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/protest-fundamental-in-democracy-bail-for-5-people-booked-in-delhi-riots-cases-101630693286201.html
04-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi assembly to throw open ‘secret’ tunnel to public by Independence Day, 2022||The Delhi assembly plans to renovate a ‘faansi ghar’ (execution chamber) in the state assembly and throw it open to the public along with a secret tunnel discovered in the premises in 2016 by Independence Day next year, assembly speaker Ram Niwas Goel said on Friday.Goel said that the assembly has already floated a tender for the restoration of the room where executions were conducted, adding that they will also lay down SOPs for visitors to see the tunnel. Goel said that since 2017, people from Delhi and other cities are allowed to visit the Delhi assembly on January 26-27 and August 14-15 without any permission. “They will be allowed to visit the tunnel and the faansi ghar and learn about the history of the assembly once the makeover is done by next year,” said Goel.The execution room is a two-room suite outside the assembly chamber that can be accessed via a wooden staircase. The rooms contain old pictures, files, and worn out furniture.“The faansi ghar was reopened three months ago. It’s not in a good condition. Now, we will renovate it and give it a good makeover. Designs for the renovation have already been prepared and a tender has been given to the PWD,” said Goel.Goel claimed that the tunnel runs between the legislative assembly and the Red Fort, and was used by the Britishers to move freedom fighters. The legislative assembly building was initially a court and the tunnel allowed British to move freedom fighters to the building without attracting public attention. So far, there is no documentary evidence that sheds light on the history of the tunnel or supports the claim that it connects to the Red Fort. “After 1926, the premises were being used as court for trials of revolutionaries. I can’t say if the tunnel was made in 1926 or 27. However, the tunnel was used for the movement of revolutionaries from Red Fort till the court here. In my estimation, one end of the tunnel opened at the Red Fort and prisoners were taken to the court for hearing on the other end, and later to the faansi ghar,” said Goel. The Vidhan Sabha was once the seat of British India and housed both the Central Legislative Council (today’s Parliament) and a temporary Central Secretariat when the capital of British India was shifted from Kolkata (then Calcutta) to Delhi in December 1911.Many historians have, however, expressed doubts about Goel’s claims about the tunnel. “It’s highly improbable that any tunnel would be made in the 1920s that led to the Red Fort. It would have been much shorter and for some more mundane function,” said Safvi, adding that she had not visited the tunnel and more details could only be ascertained after that. “Till I see the tunnel, I will be difficult to comment on details,” said Safvi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-assembly-to-throw-open-faansi-ghar-and-secret-tunnel-in-premises-to-public-by-independence-day-next-year-101630693100611.html
04-09-2021||Delhi||Baijal chairs meeting on waterlogging, asks for technology driven solutions||Lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal on Friday helmed an emergency meeting to discuss the problem of waterlogging, which has been plaguing the national capital over the past week due to incessant rain, and directed officials to prepare a master plan to tackle this chronic and seemingly irresolvable issue. He also asked every agency concerned to set up an internal committee to find better flood control measures and response mechanisms, while deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia directed the constitution of an expert committee to come up with a holistic strategy to deal with the problem in the short and long term. Earlier this week, Delhi roads, shops and even hospitals were inundated for at least two consecutive days, Tuesday and Wednesday, in the aftermath of heavy rain. Friday’s emergency meeting was attended by Sisodia, PWD and irrigation and flood control minister Satyendar Jain, chief secretary Vijay Dev and all senior officials from the departments and agencies concerned, including the Delhi Development Authority, the three municipal corporations and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). Senior officials said the L-G was of the opinion that the situation needed to be handled with better and updated engineering solutions. “He noted that despite the excuse of excessive rain, the situation needed to be addressed and better preparedness could have been put in place. The need for a short, medium and long term action plan to address the issue was reiterated,” said a senior official who attended the meeting, on condition of anonymity.A second official, who also attended the meeting, said Baijal asked each agency to constitute an internal committee of experts to evaluate the problem, and chalk out a plan of action based on past experiences. “It was felt that the annual pre-monsoon drain de-silting exercise was not enough. He (Baijal) directed that de-silting of drains, nallahs and catchment areas must be done continuously to prevent waterlogging. Agencies were also advised to explore and adopt the latest mechanised methods for achieving permanent solutions,” the second official said. Later, it was decided that all agencies concerned will now identify areas vulnerable to waterlogging, conduct a fresh survey and prepare a master plan to tackle the issue. After the meeting, Sisodia said, “The responsibility to mitigate this (waterlogging) will be with the primary agency (under whose jurisdiction the waterlogged area/drain/road lies)with the rest of the agencies providing support. This time, Delhi received more rain than in previous years and as a result faced waterlogging in many places. To eliminate the problem, it is important that all agencies work together to draw up short- and long-term plans and execute it.” Pointing to the problem of waterlogging at two major points, the ITO and NH-24, Sisodia directed officials to come up with a technology-driven solution at the earliest. “Whenever it rained this year, a pond formed near ITO and on the slip road of NH 24. But, this problem can be solved only when all agencies, including NHAI, MCD and PWD, work together,” he said. A Delhi Jal Board official present in the meeting said waterlogging near ITO was caused by water and sewer pipelines of the DJB overflowing or bursting. The L-G’S office did not issue a statement on the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/baijal-chairs-meeting-on-waterlogging-asks-officials-to-find-technology-driven-solutions-101630692320494.html
04-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Governor refuses exemptions for PM Modi’s bullet train project||Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari has rejected the state government’s request to provide exemptions sought from mandatory approvals from eight gram sabhas to acquire grazing land in Palghar district for the bullet train project, a pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The land parcels covering eight villages fall in the alignment of the project and are regulated under the Panchayats (Extension of Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act. It means prior acquisitions need approvals from the concerned gram sabhas. The state revenue department had requested the Governor to add a provision in PESA Act that vital projects of the government such as bullet train etc. be exempted from the process, but the proposal was not approved by the Governor, the officials confirmed.The exemption from the Governor was sought on March 6, 2019, following a request made by the National High-Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) to speed up the acquisition process. “The proposal was not approved by the Governor. Now, meetings of the gram sabhas have been scheduled for the same to complete the process. I was told meetings of some gram sabhas were scheduled on August 15 and the proposal may have been discussed there,” said Nitin Kareer, additional chief secretary, revenue department.“It also means land acquisition for the project will start only after completing the entire process. The idea behind asking for exemption was to expedite the project but the delay has defeated the purpose,” said a revenue official, wishing not to be named.Santosh Kumar, secretary to the Governor, did not respond to calls and text messages.“The proposal was discussed in a meeting held on October 22, 2019, in which, the governor said he is not in favour of giving exemption and also suggested the state government give compensatory land to the gram sabhas against the acquisition of grazing land. This is because grazing land is very important for the villages. People living in scheduled areas are too poor and their livelihood depends upon grazing land. If there is no land available then they should be compensated as per norms. The governor also suggested checking with the Gujarat government how they resolved issues related to PESA areas, in case alignment, is passing through such areas,” said a senior official.As per section 22A of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code (MLRC) 1966, a gram sabha is a competent authority to preserve and safeguard the grazing land and it cannot be diverted prior consent of the concerned gram sabha. The provision to this effect was made by the then governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao by issuing a notification on May 9, 2017.“Notwithstanding anything in sub-section (1) to (6) or any other provision of this Act, gram sabhas shall be competent to preserve, safeguard and manage Gairan land in Scheduled Areas; provided that, no Gairan land in the Scheduled Areas shall be diverted or disposed of without the prior informed consent of the Gram Sabhas concerned,” states the provision.The Fifth Schedule of the Constitution empowers the governor to make regulations related to scheduled areas. Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) or PESA is a law enacted by the Government of India to cover the “Scheduled areas”, which are not covered in the 73rd amendment of Panchayati Raj Act of the Indian Constitution.“Exercising the powers conferred by the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution, the governor can provide an exemption from obtaining mandatory approvals, but if allowed it will be opened for other major infrastructure projects as well,” another official said. According to NHSRCL, the project required around 6.83 hectares (16.86 acres) from eight villages in the Palghar district. The villages are — Virathan Khurd, Varkunthi, Rothe, Kamare, Poman, Rajavali, More and Gokhivare. “We will follow the process for land acquisition,” said a senior NHSRCL official, wishing not to be named.Officials said after the governor refused to grant exemptions, the resolutions for land acquisition were again submitted before the concerned gram sabhas. Dr Kiran Mahajan, deputy collector, Palghar district, confirmed three gram sabhas have approved the acquisition of grazing land and some have called meetings in the coming days. “Poman, Rajavali, Gokhivare villages have approved to give the land for the project and have also cleared the resolutions. Kamare has also cleared the proposal but officially we have to get the resolution from the gram sabha. Rothe and Varkhunthi are yet to clear the resolutions. We have not received any request for Virathan Khurd village,” Dr Mahajan said.Palghar collector Dr Manik Gursal did not reply to calls and text messages.PM Modi and his Japanese the then counterpart Shinzo Abe laid the foundation stone for the ₹1.08 lakh crore (17 billion dollar) high-speed rail project on September 14, 2017, which will connect two cities — Mumbai and Ahmedabad. It will also be India’s first high-speed rail line.The Narendra Modi government has further set an ambitious deadline of completing the project by August 15, 2022, when India marks 75 years of Independence. NHSRCL that is implementing the project, however, expects to open a section of the network by then and complete it by December 2023.The 508.17km rail corridor project comprises 348.04km in Gujarat, a 155.76km stretch in Maharashtra, and 4.3km in Dadra and Nagar Haveli.According to section 22A of the MLRC Act, the state government will have to provide double the size of land required for a project. “The Gairan (grazing) land may be diverted, granted or leased for a public purpose or public project of the Central Government or the State Government or any statutory authority or any public authority or undertaking under the Central Government or the state government (hereinafter in this section referred to as “Public Authority”, if no other suitable piece of Government land is available for such public purpose or public project. The compensatory land to be transferred to the state government under sub-section (3) shall be in the same revenue village have area equal to twice the area of the Gairan land and its value shall not be less than the value of the Gairan land so allotted under sub-section,” stated the provision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-governor-refuses-exemptions-for-pm-modi-s-bullet-train-project-101630690940458.html

The agency has cited in all around 200 witnesses to bring home the guilt of the accused. Statements of 20 important witnesses have been recorded before metropolitan magistrates and they are declared by the federal agency as “protected witnesses.”Special NIA judge Prashant R Sitre then directed the agency to serve the copies of the charge sheet to the accused personally and take their acknowledgement. The court also granted the NIA permission to continue the investigation.“Today (September 3), NIA, filed a charge sheet in NIA special court, Mumbai under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, Arms Act, Explosive Substances Act and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against the 10 arrested persons,” said NIA in a statement.“During the investigation, incriminating evidence came to fore against the 10 arrested accused involved in various stages of conspiracy of placing explosive-laden Mahindra Scorpio vehicle, its theft and commission of murder of Mansukh Hiran,” said the statement. Others arrested in the case are Vaze’s former colleague at the criminal intelligence unit of Mumbai crime branch, Riyazuddin Kazi, Vaze’s friend and dismissed crime branch inspector Sunil Mane, cricket bookie Naresh Gor and dismissed police constable Vinayak Shinde, an accused in Lakhan Bhaiya encounter case. Earlier on August 30, the special NIA court had rejected NIA’s demand for custody of Vaze and Mane in connection with the Antilia bomb scare and Hiran murder cases.Presently, both Vaze and Mane are in judicial custody at Taloja prison. Vaze has been admitted to Surana Sethia Hospital at Bhiwandi for open-heart surgery.The case pertains to the recovery of an explosives-laden green Mahindra Scorpio near Antilia, the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani, on Carmichael Road in south Mumbai on February 25. A note threatening to kill certain members of his family was also recovered from the vehicle. On March 5, the body of the vehicle owner and Thane-based auto parts dealer, Mansukh Hiran, was found in a creek at Reti Bunder near Mumbra.The NIA subsequently took over the investigation and arrested Vaze in connection with both cases. Vaze was dismissed from service in May. The investigating agency later also arrested encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma and four others - Santosh Shelar, Anand Jadhav, Manish Soni and Satish Mothukari - in connection with the murder case. The agency claimed that the four accused acted on the instructions of Vaze and others, and allegedly strangled Hiran to death in a vehicle, along Ghodbunder road, and dumped the body in the creek.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-case-charge-sheet-filed-against-all-10-accused-101630685900256.html

On Friday, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a response to the bail plea and said Kumar’s medical condition was stable and was improving. The bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh said, “The medical report shows appellant is being fully attended to. Even medical board was constituted.

04-09-2021||World||Worry over refugee crisis can pave way for common migration policy: EU||Ever since the evacuation of Afghan citizens commenced after the country fell into the hands of the Taliban, the question of the influx of these refugees and their resettlement have been part of many discourses. Now, European Commissioner Margaritis Schinas has said the situation in Afghanistan and the events associated with it could pave the way for the formation of a common migration policy.Speaking to an Austrian daily Wiener Zeitung, Schinas said, “It is true that we are now in a major crisis, but the European Union (EU) did not cause the situation, yet we are once again called upon to be part of a solution.”He further said that he wanted to “avoid a reflex” that takes Europe back to the crisis year 2015 “before it is even clear how the situation will develop.”Following the re-emergence of Taliban, several thousands of Afghans have been flown out of their homeland either to neighbouring Asian countries or to the US and Europe. The UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) has said that up to 500,000 Afghans could escape by the year-end. Meanwhile, many countries, including Russia, Austria and Greece, among others, have directly or indirectly, dismissed the idea of welcoming Afghan migrants, even as Europe is still recovering from the enormous refugee influx after the 2015 Syrian war.Austria’s Chancellor Sebastian Kurz reiterated his decision to not take migrants, saying that a potential Afghan wave in Europe must not take place. This comes after his stand against welcoming Afghans because the European nation has taken in a “disproportionately high” number since 2015, when one million people entered Europe from Asia, Africa and the Middle East.In the interview, Schinas said that the EU was better prepared this time, with stronger external border protection and financial resources to help Afghanistan’s neighbours, while the EU states’ policies were “increasingly converging.”Also Read | Don't want Afghan militants arriving under cover of refugees: Putin“Therefore, I see now as the moment to agree on a common European migration and asylum policy, as we proposed in the EU Commission in September,” he told Zeitung, according to Reuters.The European Commissioner further said that migration has long foiled the unity among the 27 members of the EU, with strong resistance to a deal among the “populists on the right and left fringes.” However, he added that he did see a window for a solution after the French presidential polls in May 2022 – by when Germany would also have a new ruling dispensation.The EU, on the other hand, has floated a plan to spend 300 million euros ($355 million) to resettle nearly 30,000 Afghans refugees inside the bloc in an attempt to avoid a migration crisis. According to a diplomatic note – seen by Bloomberg, the European Commission made the proposal to EU ambassadors at an August 26 meeting. Additional funds for the resettling purpose can also be made available, the Commission added according to Bloomberg.The EU had another meeting on August 31 – regarding the resettlement of Afghans and the situation in Afghanistan. Following the meeting, EU commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, informed on Twitter that she will “convene a high-level Resettlement Forum” in September to “discuss concrete priorities with member states and provide sustainable solutions” to those Afghans who are most vulnerable, such as women and children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worry-over-migration-crisis-can-pave-way-for-common-migration-policy-eu-101630777911731.html

He would sell the rights to a real estate developer, who subsequently would negotiate with hotel companies that would manage and rebrand it, the website reported, citing people familiar with the transaction. The lease is likely to fetch less than the $500 million the Wall Street Journal said Trump was seeking in 2019, Axios said. Trump signed the lease for the building in 2013, and the General Services Administration oversees the contract. The hotel opened in September 2017, about eight months after he took office. The Trump International Hotel became one of the former president’s most successful property projects, generating revenues from foreign governments that rented space for events and favor-seekers eager to be seen there.Trump owns the hotel through his trust, which holds all of his business interests, and ultimately profits from it. The hotel has become a magnet for high-powered Republicans in Washington, from lobbyists to lawmakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-in-talks-to-sell-leasing-rights-to-his-washington-dc-hotel-report-101630775590257.html

Not above Modi, Merkel||Several polls have shown that the approval rating of US President Joe Biden has significantly dropped after the troops’ withdrawal from Afghanistan leading to a humanitarian crisis. The latest survey by global data intelligence Morning Consult suggests that at least half of the respondents disapprove of how Biden’s foreign policy and handling of national security in the aftermath of chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.Biden, whose approval rating remained over 50% since he took the office in January, is now looking at an approval rating of 48%, an all-time low in few months of his presidency. With 26% of respondents citing terrorism and foreign policy as major issues influencing their vote for federal office, the survey suggests that the last time these issues gained such prominence was when the US-Iran tensions escalated following the killing of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani.“While it’s far too early to tell whether concerns about security will prove decisive at the ballot box next year, the numbers suggest that the chaotic U.S. exit from Afghanistan has given Republicans an opening to move the midterm conversation to a more [favourable] playing field in the near term,” the report says.Also Read | PM Modi's approval rating is 70%, highest among 13 global leadersThe fall in Biden’s approval rating has pushed him below German chancellor Angela Merkel on the list of global leaders’ approval.

The fall of Afghanistan is not only shameful for US President Joe Biden, but also the whole of Western civilisation because everybody knows that Pakistan is running the show, Amrullah Saleh wrote. As he has earlier said, he reiterated that he will not surrender to the Taliban and his security guard has been sworn to shoot him twice in the head in case he gets injured, as he will never surrender to the Taliban, he wrote.The account comes at a time when the Taliban have claimed that they have captured Panjshir province, the only Taliban-free province of the country. Panjshir residents are fleeing their homes and choosing other Taliban-ruled provinces to avoid death in the massive clash that is still going on in the valley. “The Taliban's spokesperson receives directions, literally every hour, from the Pakistani embassy. It is the Pakistanis who are in control as a colonial power”@AmrullahSaleh2 spoke to me about his patriotic fight to save Afghanistan. In @DailyMailUKhttps://t.co/eE9Z7jcEQY‘Pakistan is running the show’Reiterating his theory of strong Pakistan support to the Taliban rise, a factor which former president Ashraf Ghani reportedly mentioned during his last phone call, Saleh wrote the Talian were receiving instruction from the Pakistan embassy. "The Taliban's spokesperson receives directions, literally every hour, from the Pakistani embassy...The betrayal of Afghanistan by the West is colossal...Your politicians know that Pakistan is running the show. They know al Qaeda is back in the streets of Kabul. And they know the Taliban have not reformed. They have been displaying their suicide vests in Kabul," Saleh wrote.Night before Kabul fellThe night before Kabul fell, there was a revolt inside the prison and Taliban inmates were attempting to escape, the then vice president was informed. He tried to contact the non-Taliban prisoners and faced counter-revolt. The next day, Amrullah Saleh woke up at 8am to numerous calls from family, friends. He said he tried to contact the minister of defence and the interior minister and their deputies. But they were not reachable. The police chief of Kabul informed him that he could hold the front for an hour. " But in that one desperate hour, I was unable to find deployable Afghan troops anywhere in the city," Saleh wrote."I messaged our National Security Adviser to say we have to do something. I got no response from anyone. And by 9am that morning of August 15, Kabul was panicking," Saleh wrote.As the Taliban firmed their hold on Kabul, Saleh messaged Ahmad Massoud who was also in Kabul. "I then went through my home and destroyed pictures of my wife and my daughters. I collected my computer and some belongings," Saleh wrote adding that he made his chief guard Rahim swear by Koran that he will have to shoot Amrullah Saleh if he gets injured. "I don't want to surrender to the Taliban. Ever," he wrote.Why Amrullah Saleh did not flee AfghanistanAs Saleh recounted, he was offered an escape even before the fall of Kabul. But he refused to be one of those politicians who 'betray people' and then drop a Twitter or Facebook post from posh hotels abroad, he wrote. "They stay in these hotels and villas abroad. And then they call on the poorest Afghans to revolt. That's craven. If we want a revolt, the revolt has to be led," he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/destroyed-photos-of-my-wife-daughters-amrullah-saleh-recounts-how-he-left-kabul-101630766122137.html

He adds that “this is why we are in contact with countries in the region.”Kurz spoke after meeting Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic. Thousands of migrants from the Middle East, Africa or Asia have been stranded in Serbia and neighboring countries situated on the so-called Balkan migration route toward Western Europe.Kurz has long taken a tough approach to migration issues.

04-09-2021||World||These armyworms are marching across US. Experts say it’s a ‘perfect storm’||Large swaths of armyworms—specifically the fall armyworm—have been invading lawns, eating up grass and plants in an infestation, which experts say they have not seen in decades, reported across the US. Rick Brandenburg, an entomologist at North Carolina State University, said the insects are laying siege to areas such as North Carolina, Texas, Michigan and northeastern states, which rarely see such significant armyworm populations. "This year is like a perfect storm. In my 40 years, I have never seen the problem as widespread as it is this year,” Brandenburg told USA Today.Entomologist Thomas Kuhar said this was the largest infestation he has seen in 30 years, and “perhaps the most unique”. Kuhar, a professor at Virginia Tech, said armyworms are often found in crops such as corn, rice and sorghum, but this year’s outbreak is selectively targeting lawns and some hayfields. “That’s not a normal fall armyworm behaviour. They should just be devouring things in their path,” he told Bloomberg.Eric Rebek, an Oklahoma State University entomology professor, said these pests return to Oklahoma every year in late summer and early fall as they travel in large swaths from one food source to another until the winter frost kills them. "They can easily munch their way through whatever, whether it's a lawn or a park or a golf course. They just lay waste to everything in their path, moving through just like an army on the move," Rebek told USA Today.What are fall armyworms?According to Rebek, there are two kinds of armyworms: the true armyworm and the fall armyworm. The fall armyworms, which are indigenous to the US, are the larval stage of the fall armyworm moth. The caterpillars grow up to two inches long and can be green, brown or black in colour. Rebek said they can be identified by an inverted white "y" on their head capsules. A single female can lay as many as 1,500 eggs.What damage do armyworms inflict?Rebek said fall armyworms eat up grass of all kinds, adding the extent of the damage depends on the type of grass. "For warm-season grass, is mostly an aesthetic issue. But if you have cool-season grass, you probably want to treat your lawn,” he said.What’s the reason behind the widespread outbreak?According to experts, it could be a number of factors, including a warming climate, wetter weather or changes in natural enemies such as predators, parasites and pathogens."It's hard to point your finger at any one thing… It's likely a very complex interaction that is occurring this year that leads to this outbreak," Rebek said.Brandenburg said while climate change has the potential to increase the likelihood of tropical pests like fall armyworms infesting lawns, it's difficult to make a direct link between the two because so many factors are at play.How can armyworm attacks be prevented?People can’t do much to protect their lawns from armyworms and Rebek warned homeowners to be watchful. “It's hard to deter them. And it's hard to predict where they'll land and prevent that from happening,” he said adding that people must check the label on their insecticide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/these-armyworms-are-marching-across-us-experts-say-it-s-a-perfect-storm-101630762944280.html
04-09-2021||World||India-US 2+2 meeting to be held in November||The next round of India-US 2+2 ministerial dialogue is expected to take place in November and “there is some talk” of a summit meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the first in-person summit-level meeting of the leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad).Indian foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla told reporters on Friday, at the end of two days of meetings with US officials and business leaders, that the dates for the 2+2 are still being discussed. He also spoke of the tentative bilateral summit as he qualified it as something under discussion.It’s US’s turn to host the annual meeting of the foreign and defence ministers of the two countries and it will be the first meeting of this format with the Biden administration. The last meeting was held in New Delhi October 2020 with MikePompeo and Mark Esper, secretaries of state and defence in the Trump administration.The upcoming meeting will be between India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar and defence minister Rajnath Singh and US secretary of state Antony Blinken and defence secretary Lloyd Austin. All four of them have had in-person meetings before; and several times with Jaishankar and Blinken.An in-person summit of the Quad - with leaders of Japan and Australia - is also being discussed following up the virtual meeting in March. Modi and Biden could meet for their first bilateral at the time according to discussions currently under way.Also, President Biden’s special envoy on climate John Kerry is headed for India, for his second visit in this capacity.Shringla met almost the entire leadership of the state department including secretary of state Blinken and deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman, and top leaders at the department of defence and the national security council at the White House.The situation in Afghanistan figured in all his conversations predictably and the foreign secretary said the US position of “wait and watch” tracked closely with India’s own approach.Shringla said the US has adopted a “wait and watch policy” and that they will calibrate their actions depending on how the situation evolves. “That’s also similar to what we ourselves conveyed in the parliamentary briefing that was held a few days ago. We said we will have a wait-and-watch policy, which does not mean you don’t do anything,” Shringla said, adding, “It simply means … the situation is very fluid on the ground, you have to allow it to see how it evolves. You have to see whether the assurances that were made publicly are maintained on the ground.”India’s ask list, the foreign secretary said, was as “we have told them that we want them to be cognisant of the fact that there should be no terrorism that emanates from their territory against us or other countries. We want them to be mindful of the status of women, minorities and so on so forth.”The foreign secretary was referring to repeated assurances the Taliban gave Indian diplomats in their first official contact some days ago after the insurgent group took control of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indiaus-2-2-meeting-to-be-held-in-november-101630760004386.html

Here's why||New Zealand officials on Saturday confirmed the name of the attacker who stabbed seven people at an Auckland supermarket before he was shot dead by police. The officials said that Ahamed Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen, 32, was the Islamic State-inspired extremist killed by police on Friday, reported Associated Press.Samsudeen was 22 when he arrived in New Zealand in 2011 on a student visa. Police took notice of him in 2016 when Samsudeen expressed sympathy for terrorist attacks and advocated violent extremism on Facebook. His online activity related to extremist stuff continued even after the police spoke to him twice.Samsudeen was finally arrested in May 2017 at Auckland International Airport as police believed he was heading to Syria. He was charged for possession of restricted publications, to which he pleaded guilty. While on bail, he bought a knife and was arrested again. The attacker spent months in prison but the police couldn't keep him there any longer as they failed to lay an additional charge under the existing Terrorism Suppression Act for the knife and online posts. They had to release Samsudeen in mid-July this year but kept tracking his every move.Watch | ISIS-inspired terrorist goes on stabbing spree in New Zealand mallUndercover officers sprang into action as the attacker went on a stabbing spree at an Auckland supermarket. They shot Samsudeen dead within a couple of minutes of him beginning the attack.“As you can see, agencies used every tool available to them to protect innocent people from this individual,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told a press conference Saturday. “But we owe it to everyone to have other people look at the facts of this case too, to analyse them, to see what was done, and what more could have been done.”Ardern had earlier confirmed that five of the stabbing victims were in a hospital, of whom three were in critical condition. While Ardern said she can provide the details about the attacker's criminal history, she didn't reveal his name.“I am also unable to share his name, but I would note, this is not something I had any intention of sharing regardless of the court ruling. No terrorist, whether alive or deceased, deserves their name to be shared for the infamy they were seeking,” the New Zealand prime minister had said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-pm-didn-t-want-to-reveal-the-now-confirmed-attacker-s-name-here-s-why-101630755717031.html

Within a month, the Afghan government fell and as the Taliban proceeded to rule the country, it said China is the most important partner of the Taliban. China has also promised to keep its embassy in Afghanistan open as a time when other countries are mulling relocating their embassies to the UAE. The Taliban claimed that China will also increase its humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. China, meanwhile, said it expects the new establishment to dissociate from terror groups.Here is what the recent statements from China and Taliban about each other indicate'Pass to markets all over the world'Taliban want to maintain diplomatic relations with all countries, they have already clarified. But they consider China as the most important partner as China represents an opportunity to rebuild Afghanistan, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.There are "rich copper mines in the country, which, thanks to the Chinese, can be put back into operation and modernised. In addition, China is our pass to markets all over the world," the spokesperson said.Taliban hold the New Silk Road, the infrastructure initiative of China in high regard, the spokesperson said.'Open inclusive political structure'China has been reiterating the point of the Taliban taking a 'clean break' from terrorism and form an open and inclusive government that follows moderate policies to get international recognition. China is seeing the Taliban takeover as Afghanistan's break-free moment from foreign military intervention. "...facts show that in realising economic development we need an open inclusive political structure, implementation of moderate foreign and domestic policies and clean break from terrorist groups in all forms," Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said earlier.In the July meeting, the Taliban committed to China that it will not allow the Uygur Muslim group -- the East Turkistan Islamic Movement -- to operate from Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talibans-most-important-partner-china-hopes-new-govt-will-stay-away-from-terrorism-101630755375292.html

The team flew into Afghanistan’s capital on Wednesday, making their aircraft the first to land since the evacuations ended earlier this week.According to Al-Jazeera, the ambassador said the runway at the airport has been repaired in cooperation with authorities in Afghanistan. Al-Jazeera also reported that two domestic flights operated from Kabul to the cities of Mazar-i-Sharif and Kandahar. Qatar’s foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said on Thursday that his government is talking to the Taliban and working with Turkey for potential technical support to restart operations at the airport.After the recent takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban, the Kabul airport witnessed chaotic evacuations by several countries and a devastating attack on August 26 which left 13 United States military personnel and more than 160 Afghans dead.Last week, the United States forces carried out a drone strike that blew up a vehicle carrying suicide bombers of the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan. The vehicle was aiming to attack the Kabul airport. And on Monday, five rockets were fired at the airport which was intercepted by a missile defence system, a US official said.The airport had been out of operations after the US withdrew all its troops from Afghanistan on August 31 (Tuesday). A person told AFP on condition of anonymity on Thursday that the objective of reopening the airport was to resume flights both for humanitarian aid and to provide freedom of movement, including the resumption of evacuation efforts.Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from Afghanistan till now even as more are trying to flee from the war-ravaged country, which is now under the Taliban’s rule. The Taliban had earlier promised safe passage for those who were willing to leave Afghanistan.Meanwhile, the Taliban have again postponed the formation of a new government in Afghanistan, with the group’s spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid saying on Saturday that the announcement about the new cabinet will be made next week.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-airport-reopens-to-received-aid-civilian-flights-to-start-soon-qatar-101630754093901.html

The reports, however, suggest that the insurgents have been struggling to shape an inclusive administration acceptable to the international community."The Taliban can form a government of their own but they are now focussing to have an administration in which all parties, groups and sections of the society have proper representation," PTI quoted Khalil Haqqani, a member of the committee tasked to negotiate talks with different groups over the government formation, as saying.Also Read | Who is Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, set to lead new Afghanistan government?Khalil Haqqani, who is in charge of the security of Kabul, revealed that former Afghanistan’s prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and brother of ousted Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, Hashmat Ghani Ahmadzai, will be given representation in the government, reported PTI. Hashmat Ghani had recently indicated that he’ll support a Taliban-led government.“Taliban are well capable of bringing security but running a functional government requires the input and collaboration of younger, educated Afghans. The so called expired politicians should be sidelined completely so that the failed experience of coalition government is not repeated,” he wrote on Twitter.On Friday, US secretary of state Antony Blinken reiterated the expectations from a Taliban-led government, including the formation of an inclusive government, rejecting reprisals and upholding the basic rights of Afghans. The top US diplomat was responding to the reports of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar getting the charge of the new government.“There is an expectation that any government that emerges now will have some real inclusivity and that it will have non-Talibs in it who are representative of different communities and different interests in Afghanistan,” said Blinken, who is set to visit Doha on Sunday.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-taliban-had-to-postpone-government-formation-in-afghanistan-for-second-time-101630752777449.html

During the meeting, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres will also appeal for "full and unimpeded humanitarian access to make sure Afghans continue to the essential services they need,” spokesperson Stephane Dujarric announced on Friday."One in three Afghans do not know where their next meal will come from. Nearly half of all children under the age of 5 are predicted to be acutely malnourished in the next 12 months," Dujarric said and added that the UN has appealed for $1.3 billion for 2021 to help more than 18 million people.She also expressed gratitude to Denmark, Kazakhstan, North Macedonia, Pakistan, Poland, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and the United States on the behalf of the UN chief for assisting in the temporary relocation of UN staff in Afghanistan.Afghanistan is under major turmoil after the US and Nato troops withdrew from the country, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban returning to power. The group was ousted by the US forces in 2001 in anti-terrorist operations. The war-ravaged nation is now facing a severe economic crisis as western nations pulled out the financial support and the looming political uncertainty.Meanwhile, the Taliban is set to announce their own government which will likely be led by its co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.

He recommended boosters eight months after the second shot.However, those agencies are awaiting critical data before signing off on the third doses, with Moderna's vaccine increasingly seen as unlikely to make the September 20 date.According to one official, Moderna produced inadequate data for the FDA and CDC to approve the third dose of its vaccine. The FDA has requested additional data that is likely to delay those boosters into October.

Tolo, one of the first commercial television networks in Afghanistan, kept broadcasting even as Kabul fell to the Taliban on the evening of August 15. While the Taliban have asked the Afghan media to operate as usual, many are apprehensive given the history of the hardline Islamists who banned TV during their rule from 1996-2001."We're scared, I'll be honest with you, we are nervous," Saad Mohseni, CEO of Tolo's parent company Moby Group, told the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). "Everyone is having sleepless nights, but what the viewer is experiencing is not that different."Reporters Without Borders (RSF), an international media watchdog, had remarked in a report before Kabul’s fall that women journalists “continue to be vulnerable in a country where they are among the leading targets of fundamentalist propaganda, which circulates widely in several regions.” The organisation had raised concern that basic freedoms, including the freedom of women journalists, could be sacrificed for the sake of a peace deal.Also Read | Taliban scouting porn sites to compile kill list of Afghan prostitutes: ReportWith frequent interviews, the Taliban have taken a different approach this time to reveal their stance on television and women’s rights while they continue to insist on a “genuine Islamic system.” One Taliban official recently gave an interview to a woman host on Tolo News, projecting a softer image than the one they had created two decades ago. But an RSF report exposed the Islamists replacing a female anchor at state-owned Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA), who was told to “stay at home for a few days.”Mohseni has pledged to keep women on-air even as the company lost many female employees after the Taliban’s return. But the director of Tolo News, Lotfullah Najafizada, acknowledged the difficulty of keeping the news operations alive under the Taliban rule.

Unvaccinated children under 12 travelling with vaccinated adults are also allowed in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-mandates-full-covid-19-vaccination-proof-for-american-tourists-101630747120643.html

Pakistan is globally accused of aiding the Taliban. But now that the United States somewhat needs Pakistan's cooperation to fight ISIS, al Qaeda, Pakistan wants more public recognition, Politico reported.Here is what the leaked documents are and what they revealThese leaked documents are mostly discussions between Pakistan and US officials, sensitive but unclassified cables.On August 26, the day the Kabul blasts took place killing over 170 people including US officials and Afghans, US State Department official, Ervin Massinga and Pakistan's ambassador Asad Majeed Khan exchanged messages.“Acknowledging the tragedy, Mr Massinga underscored the mutual interest Pakistan and the United States have in targeting ISIS and al Qaeda," the description of what transpired in the meeting said. In response, the Pakistani ambassador “acknowledged ISIS-K was a common enemy for the Taliban as well.”"At one point in the talk, however, Ambassador Khan intimated the Pakistani government would also appreciate public acknowledgement for the country’s assistance on the evacuation front," the document revealed.In another discussion, Asad Majid Khan told US officials that the Taliban were not seeking retribution and they were going home to home to assure Afghans that there will be no reprisals.Has anything changed between Pakistan and the US?An August 20 statement of gratitude from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to several countries for their help in the evacuations did not mention Pakistan. In another statement released early this week, US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland included Pakistan on a list of countries that provided "critical support" to the US efforts in evacuation.Other than this, there has not been much improvement as US President Joe Biden has not spoken with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Pakistan’s General Qamar Javed Bajwa. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, met with his Pakistani counterpart, Moeed Yusuf, in late July.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/isis-common-enemy-us-secretly-wants-pak-help-islamabad-demands-recognition-reveal-leaked-documents-101630747093414.html

04-09-2021||World||China with Pak support has advantage in Taliban ruled Afghanistan||This week US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan was asked whether Taliban was the enemy, the Joe Biden aide said that it was hard to put on a label on it, partly because we (US) are yet to see what they will be now that they are in complete control of Afghanistan.The democratic world is dealing with a peculiar situation in Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan where ruling Taliban is neither a UN nor US designated terrorist entity but more than 120 of its top leaders are listed as global terrorists under the 1267 UNSC committee including projected president of the Emirates, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. The al Qaeda, Haqqani Network, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, all global terror entities under UN 1267 committee and US State Department, have sworn allegiance (bayat) to the Taliban and its supreme leader Mullah Hibatullah Akundzada. By this yardstick, the democratic world is playing with semantics when it is engaging Taliban without breaking its policy of not negotiating with terrorists and terror organizations. In fact, countries like China and United Kingdom have sought support of mentor Pakistan to engage the Taliban by throwing the moral principles book out of the window.With differences among the Taliban holding the announcement of the new Afghan government, the Pakistani super spy Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, DG, ISI, reached Kabul today. While the visit is hush-hush, Kabul watchers say that Gen Hameed will help the Taliban leadership to shed their differences and announce the government soon. It was Rawalpindi, which had facilitated the meeting of Mullah Baradar and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in China last July.In fact, the real gainer of the military revolutions this year is China, true practitioner of realpolitik, as it engages junta in Myanmar and Taliban in Afghanistan while democratic world is still hoping that the Sunni Islamist group will give them an inclusive government window to legitimize them.This poses real threat to India as it has pro-China regimes on the eastern and western borders. Besides the legitimate concerns of Taliban affiliate groups trying to create internal trouble in Kashmir and hinterland, India is faced with Chinese increasing its already large footprint to Afghanistan and Central Asia through its friends in Russia and Iran.The Taliban has actually thrown the western calculations in the trash bin by openly seeking economic ties with China rather than question them on treatment of Sunni Uighurs in Xinjiang. The Al Qaeda statement on August 31 talked about liberating so-called Islamic lands all over the world including Palestine, Maghreb, Syria, and Kashmir but did not utter a word about the Xinjiang Uighurs. So the theory that Taliban 2.0 would turn against China due to brutal repression in Xinjiang is still born.It is quite evident that China will extend its Belt Road Initiative to Afghanistan and exploit its Lithium and Copper resources in return for infrastructure development by liking it to CPEC. This will allow China to not only evacuate Afghan minerals from Gwadar port in Balochistan but also through the Karakoram Highway. It will also have a close look at the abandoned US military equipment including Black Hawk helicopters, IED proof all-terrain vehicles, tactical drones, area weapons and body armor for reverse engineering.China will use the Pakistani deep state as a trump card in its engagement with the Taliban as the entire leadership of the Sunni Pashtun Islamists including Mullah Akhundzada, Mullah Yaqoob and Sirajuddin Haqqani has been nurtured and nourished by Rawalpindi. The same Pakistan card is being played by the British, who brokered a peace deal with US in favor of the Taliban boys, as described by UK Chief of Defence Staff Gen Nick Carter. The democratic world with feckless and tired US leadership surely has a weak hand in comparison to China and Taliban is no friend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-with-pak-support-has-advantage-in-taliban-ruled-afghanistan-101630743525798.html

There are various elements that are supported by Pakistan -- so its role has to be seen in that context."Experts believe that Pakistan has been a key player in removing the elected Afghan government from power and establishing the Taliban as a decisive power in Afghanistan.Recently, a UN Monitoring report has said that a significant part of the leadership of Al-Qaida resides in the Afghanistan and Pakistan border region.Almost all foreign members of ISIL-K and al-Qaida have entered Afghanistan via Pakistan and the leaders of these outfits along with those of the Taliban have been living in Pakistan, the UN report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-taliban-close-to-forming-govt-pak-intelligence-chief-reaches-kabul-101630743105230.html

Don't change our culture'||Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen told an American news outlet on Friday that the United States should not impose upon Afghanistan its views on women's rights, insisting that it would be regarded as interfering with their “culture”. The idea that women can have “education without [a] hijab” is a ‘Western’ concept that is not compatible with the cultural values in Afghanistan, Shaheen said, adding that the Taliban stand opposed to it.Also Read | As Taliban sends conflicting signals, India maintains studied silenceThe Taliban spokesperson, however, maintained that “there will be no issue about women's rights” in Afghanistan as long as they (the women) receive education and work jobs wearing a hijab. In an interview with cable media network Fox News, Shaheen said, “There will be no issue about women's rights, no problem about their education or work; but we should not be changing each other's culture.”“That you women should have education without hijab, that is a change of culture,” Shaheen was heard saying in the interview. “Within our culture, women can receive education and work with [a] hijab. This is just one example. There may be more.”The statement by the Taliban spokesperson came amid reports that the group is close to forming a new interim government in Afghanistan, days after the last of the US troops left on a flight from the Kabul airport. With this withdrawal, the United States ended its longest war, an extended two-decade-long military campaign in the war-torn nation.Referring to US military withdrawal from Afghanistan as the end of one ‘chapter’ in the country's history, the Taliban spokesperson said, “For us, it was [an] occupation, we ended that. We were staging resistance, but now it is closed and it is in the past. We have to focus on the future – that is better for them (the US) and for us.”Also Read | Taliban expected to announce new government today: 10 points“We had this destructive relation, a hostile relation, and now we will turn this into a constructive relation,” said Taliban leader Suhail Shaheen, adding that the group is looking to work the Western nations in a ‘positive way’.Notably, Taliban leaders and their spokespersons have in recent days offered widely divergent views on a number of issues, which also includes one regarding the Kashmir valley in India.Most countries around the world, however, seem to be in no hurry to recognise a Taliban government anytime soon even if it is announced. Western powers say formal recognition of the Taliban government and a resulting flow of economic aid will depend on action to safeguard human rights, the rule of law, and the media. The White House, additionally, said that the Biden administration has no current plans to release billions in Afghan gold, investments, and foreign currency reserves, which it froze after the Taliban takeover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-to-us-on-women-s-rights-education-without-hijab-don-t-change-our-culture-101630736042635.html

Both will use the stage to gain momentum for the final stretch of the campaign.As the race remains tight, that debate will be a critical platform for the leaders of the major Federal parties to make an impression upon voters, just 11 days prior to the September 20 polls. A pair of official debates will be held next week and the only such event in English, the most crucial of the cycle, will be moderated by Indo-Canadian Shachi Kurl.Kurl, who is the president of the non-profit public opinion foundation, Angus Reid Institute (ARI), will moderate the event, the only English-language Leaders’ Debate, with the participation of four senior Canadian journalists. While an unofficial French-language debate took place on September 2, the official debate in French will be on September 8, but will mainly be focused upon the Francophone province of Quebec.Kurl, who was born in Vancouver in the province of British Columbia, has roots in Uttarakhand. She was lauded for her role as the moderator of the sole debate that preceded the 2020 provincial elections in British Columbia. That was factored into the decision by the Debate Broadcast Group (DBG) to select her for the high-profile assignment next Thursday.In an article at that time, the outlet City News 1130 commented, “Online, Kurl is being celebrated as the night’s true winner, managing to ask fair questions of all three leaders, all while maintaining order - a stark difference from moderating we’ve seen in past weeks just south of the border, where a presidential election campaign is under way”.A spokesperson for the DBG said it “was looking for someone with experience in politics, television, and debates, and found an excellent match in Ms Kurl”.The factors in her favour, he noted in an email, included her “leadership role as President of the Angus Reid Institute, working with public opinion data to further public knowledge and enhance the national understanding of issues that matter to Canada and the world; her analysis in both broadcast and print media”.The debates are conducted under the auspices of the public body, Leaders’ Debates Commission, and produced by DBG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-polls-debate-trudeau-o-toole-face-off-over-public-policies-on-sept-9-101630734562749.html

The US has already evacuated tens of thousands of Afghans who were deemed at risk under the Taliban rule or people who aided America during the war.They are being moved to the US as part of an “enduring commitment" to help the people of Afghanistan, Alejandro Mayorkas said as per AP report. "Our commitment is an enduring one... this is not just a matter of the next several weeks. We will not rest until we have accomplished the ultimate goal," Mayorkas said in a briefing.After having a military base in Afghanistan for twenty years, the United States completed its withdrawal process earlier this week. The pullout led to a collapse of the Afghan government led by President Ashraf Ghani, and the Taliban seizing the power being ousted by the US forces in 2001.Former governor of Delaware, Jack Markell will reportedly be serving as coordinator of the resettlement work in what the White House is calling "Operation Allies Welcome." Markell will be working alongside the National Security Council, Domestic Policy Council, DHS, and other federal agencies "to ensure vulnerable Afghans who pass screening and vetting reviews are safely and efficiently resettled here in the United States," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House principal deputy press secretary.The country has so far airlifted nearly 130,000 in one of the largest mass evacuations of US history. The authorities are airlifting from Afghanistan and carrying out the vetting and screening work in other countries like Germany, Spain, Kuwait and Qatar.However, the US government has not released information on what is happening to those who are not making it through the security vettings at the transit points.According to a report by AP, more than 40,000 have arrived in the US so far. About 20 per cent of these are either American citizens or permanent residents, it also reported. The rest are being moved under the Special Immigrant Visa. "Our mission is not accomplished until we have safely evacuated all US citizens who wish to leave Afghanistan or lawful permanent residents, all individuals who have assisted the United States in Afghanistan," Mayorkas also said. "This effort will not end until we achieve that goal," he also said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-welcome-at-least-50-000-evacuated-afghans-as-part-of-enduring-commitment-101630732600450.html

Between August 27 and September 2, the number of daily cases averaged 3,486, almost six times the figure for late July.The modelling was released during a briefing by Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam on Friday. This was the first briefing since Federal elections were called on August 15, and the absence of these interactions, which were frequent prior to that date, have been criticised by opposition parties.The new scenario also places increased pressure upon the ruling Liberal Party for precipitating elections while a fourth wave was under way, with outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau facing constant criticism during a televised unofficial French-language debate on Thursday evening, during which he was accused of not maintaining Covid-appropriate norms at his campaign events. It also places attention on Canada’s decision to go ahead with opening discretionary travel to fully vaccinated international visitors from September 7, despite the ominous trajectory of coronavirus cases.In a statement, Tam said “the Delta-driven wave has continued to accelerate along the strong resurgence trajectory”.Vaccination rates are high in Canada with 84% of those above 12 having received at least one dose and 77% considered fully vaccinated. However, Tam urged a surge in vaccinations at this “crucial moment”. PHAC focused mainly on the 18 to 39 demographic where rates remain lowest, at 63% fully dosed.The modelling document issued by PHAC pointed out that new cases among the unvaccinated were increased at 12 times the rate for those fully vaccinated, while hospitalisations were correspondingly 36 times higher. It also noted that between December 14, 2020 and August 14, 2021, just 0.04% of those fully vaccinated were infected, with “the majority of recent cases and hospitalisations occurring in unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-could-witness-surge-in-covid-cases-by-month-end-authorities-101630731562521.html

Facebook has apologised and disabled the tool, and has also launched an investigation.The issue surfaced when some users were watching the video from a British tabloid featuring Black men. These users soon received an automated prompt from Facebook asking if they would like to "keep seeing videos about Primates".The video date June 27, 2020, was from Daily Mail. It showed an altercation between the Black men and white police officers. While humans are among the many species in the primate family, the video had nothing to do with monkeys, chimpanzees or gorillas.A Facebook spokesperson called it a "clearly unacceptable error" and said the recommendation software involve was taken offline."We apologize to anyone who may have seen these offensive recommendations," Facebook said in response to a query sent by news agency AFP."We disabled the entire topic recommendation feature as soon as we realized this was happening so we could investigate the cause and prevent this from happening again," the spokesperson further said.The issue was brought to light by former Facebook content design manager Darci Groves who posted the screenshots of the recommendation on Twitter. "Um. This “keep seeing” prompt is unacceptable, @Facebook. And despite the video being more than a year old, a friend got this prompt yesterday. Friends at FB, please escalate. This is egregious," said said in the tweet.

The state of Florida reported an additional 2,345 Covid-19 deaths in its latest weekly report on the fatality toll, which shows that the numbers have hit a new record, now clocking the highest deaths ever in a similar period than at any point in the past.The daily average rose 36% to 335, according to calculations based on data in the report. That would surpass the high for the entire pandemic shown in Johns Hopkins University data, which is based on when the death was reported, not when it occurred.People aged 65 and above accounted for 63% of the Covid-19 deaths in Florida. Cumulatively, over the entire period of the pandemic, Florida seniors have made up 79% of deaths.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released two studies on Friday which found that children are much more likely to be hospitalised as the Delta variant became widespread, but the kids do not, however, appear to contract a more serious illness. The studies show that kids, for example, do not require any more intensive care than in previous viral surges.Meanwhile, schools in Colorado have reported more than double the rate of Covid-19 outbreak this week than that of the previous. Covid-19 outbreaks in Colorado schools more than doubled in a week to 42, the Denver Post reported, quoting official state data. New clusters also popped up at nursing homes and assisted living facilities, the newspaper said.The White House, on the other hand, is expected to launch a campaign to administer more than 100 million booster shots of the Covid-19 vaccine from the week starting on September 20, later this month. But health officials have advised the Biden administration to launch the campaign initially with Pfizer vaccines.Biden has unveiled a $65 billion plan to prepare for future pandemics threats, likening the ambitious proposal to the Apollo mission to the moon. The proposal announced Friday by the White House Office of Science, Technology, and Policy and National Security Council focuses on protecting the US against potentially catastrophic biological threats, including those that are naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberately set in motion by bad actors. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-delta-variant-widespread-in-us-florida-reports-record-number-of-deaths-101630725719776.html
04-09-2021||World||Google locks down Afghan govt email accounts as Taliban look for access: Report||Google has temporarily locked down some Afghan government email accounts as the Taliban is attempting to access the former officials' emails, Reuters reported.Google said Friday it was "taking temporary actions to secure relevant accounts," but did not admit to a complete lockdown of the accounts."In consultation with experts, we are continuously assessing the situation in Afghanistan. We are taking temporary actions to secure relevant accounts, as information continues to come in," a Google spokesperson said in a statement.The person familiar with the matter told the outlet the accounts were completely locked down as the information could be used to track down former government officials the group would harm.Around two dozen officials, with some in the ministries of finance, industry, higher education and mines, used Google for official communications, according to Reuters, along with local governments and the office of the presidential protocol.An employee of the former government told Reuters that the Taliban had asked him in late July to save data on the ministry in which he was formerly employed for on servers the group could access."If I do so, then they will get access to the data and official communications of the previous ministry leadership," the employee said, adding that he is now in hiding since he did not cooperate with the request.Former government officials, activists, and vulnerable groups fear reprisal as the Taliban has taken control of Kabul.This comes despite the Taliban have tried to portray a more moderate image this time than when they last seized power in 1996.They have announced amnesty to all, including those who worked for western militaries or the Afghan government or police.However, there have been reports that reality on the ground is quite different. Days after seizing control, the Taliban brutally executed a police chief who headed the police in Bagdhis province in Herat.In July, Taliban massacred nine ethnic Hazara men after taking control of Afghanistan's Ghazni province.According to Reuters, commandeering government databases and emails could provide information about employees of the former administration, ex-ministers, government contractors, tribal allies and foreign partners."It would give a real wealth of information," said Chad Anderson, a security researcher with internet intelligence firm DomainTools."Just even having an employee list on a Google Sheet is a big problem," he said, citing reports of reprisals against government workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-locks-down-afghan-govt-email-accounts-as-taliban-looks-for-access-report-101630725234336.html
04-09-2021||World||They'll kill us' - Afghan pilots held at Uzbek camp fear deadly homecoming||The US-trained Afghan pilots and others held at a camp in Uzbekistan already feared being sent back to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. So it was little comfort when an Uzbek guard unsympathetically quipped the other day: "You can't stay here forever."The offhand warning added to an already grinding sense of unease at the camp just across Afghanistan's northern border, recounted one of the Afghan pilots who fled there with aircraft when ground forces fell to the Taliban in August as the United states and its allies withdrew their forces.What follows is the first, detailed inside account among Afghans who, for nearly three weeks, have been waiting in vain to be evacuated by the United States."If they send us back, I'm 100 percent sure they'll kill us," said the pilot, who declined to be named because of fear of reprisal.Speaking to Reuters on a cell phone that the Afghans there try to keep out of sight, the pilot described feeling like a prisoner, with highly restricted movement, long hours in the sun, and insufficient food and medicine. Some have lost weight."We are kind of like in jail," said the pilot, who estimates the Afghans held there number 465. "We have no freedom here."Late August satellite images provided to Reuters showed high walls surrounding the camp, whose housing units had been used previously to treat COVID-19 patients and is near the city of Termez. Images shared with Reuters from inside showed sparse white rooms with bunk beds and no clutter - since most Afghans arrived with just the clothes on their backs.Uzbek guards were armed, some with handguns and others with semi-automatic weapons, the pilot said.TALIBAN PRESSUREThe camp risks turning into another crisis for U.S. President Joe Biden, who was criticized left and right for the poor planning of evacuations that marked the end of America's longest war and the Islamist militant group's swift takeover.Current and former U.S. officials are critical of the failure of the U.S. government so far to evacuate the Afghan personnel and aircraft in Uzbekistan, as current and former U.S. officials warn of Taliban pressure on Uzbek authorities to hand them over.Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was "deeply concerned" about the Afghan pilots and other forces there."It is imperative that these personnel not fall into the hands of the Taliban both for their safety and the valuable technical knowledge and training they have," Reed told Reuters.John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Uzbekistan, said he believed Uzbekistan faced real and substantial pressure from the Taliban to hand them over."They want to have good relations with Taliban. They don't want to provoke them, but they also don't want to provoke us," said Herbst, now at the Atlantic Council think-tank. He called for "competent statesmanship."Retired U.S. Brigadier General David Hicks, who commanded the training effort for the Afghan Air Force from 2016 to 2017, said the State Department had failed to act fast enough after being supplied details about the Afghans being held at the camp from a network of current and former U.S. servicemembers and lawmakers."I'm not sure what they're doing at this point, to be honest," said Hicks, who is among those working to help the pilots and their families.A State Department spokesperson said the United States was coordinating with Uzbekistan on the matter but stressed that Afghan personnel and aircraft were secure. It urged all of Afghanistan's neighbors to allow Afghans entry and to respect international law against returning refugees to countries where they are likely to face persecution.Uzbekistan's government did not respond to multiple requests for comment.DARING ESCAPEEven before the Taliban takeover, U.S.-trained, English-speaking pilots had become their prime targets. Taliban fighters tracked them down when they went off-base and assassinated some pilots. https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghan-pilots-assassinated-by-taliban-us-withdraws-2021-07-09In the final days and hours before losing the war to the Taliban, some Afghan pilots staged a stunning escape by flying 46 aircraft out the country before the Taliban could take them - more than a quarter of the available fleet of about 160 planes.Most flew from Kabul but some came from a base just across the border near the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, fleeing Taliban fighters who were storming the base after ground units collapsed. In a dramatic episode, one of the Afghan aircraft collided with an Uzbek jet, forcing the pilots to eject.The Afghan pilot who spoke to Reuters estimated there were about 15 pilots who flew A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft, 11 pilots who flew UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, 12 pilots who flew MD-530 helicopters and many Mi-17 helicopter pilots.Besides dozens of pilots, there are Air Force maintenance personnel and other Afghan security forces at the camp. Some managed to cram family members onto aircraft but most are fearful for their loved ones across the border."There weren't any more ground forces. We fought until the last moment," the pilot said.One U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, commended the Afghans in Uzbekistan for taking the planes out of Afghanistan."The only thing they knew to do was to fly every aircraft out of Taliban hands," the official said, adding: "They believed in us."The Taliban did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the Afghans in the Uzbek camp.However, a senior Taliban leader, speaking to Reuters after the fall of Kabul, said his forces had captured drones and helicopters. But he longed for the return of the Afghan aircraft in Uzbekistan."Inshallah we will receive our remaining aircrafts, they are not in Afghanistan," he said.The Taliban, which had no aircraft yet won the war, have also said they will be inviting former military personnel, including pilots, to join their new security forces. It says there will be no reprisal killings.BIOMETRIC READINGSOn Wednesday, officials from the U.S. government arrived at the camp to take biometric data from the Afghan personnel there, the pilot said."Fingerprints and also checking the IDs," he said.The State Department did not respond to a question from Reuters about the visit.The appearance of the U.S. personnel lifted the mood somewhat, the pilot said, but there was still no clear indication of whether help was on its way.The further the Taliban gets in establishing its government and relations with neighbors, the more risky their situation could become, the pilot said.Experts on the region like Herbst, the former U.S. ambassador, say Uzbekistan has every reason to seek a working relationship with the Taliban. That fear is shared among the Afghans at the camp."Most of the Air Force personnel, especially the pilots, they are educated in the U.S.," the pilot said."They cannot (go to) Afghanistan and also those countries which probably ... in the future will have good relations with the Taliban."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/theyll-kill-us-afghan-pilots-held-at-uzbek-camp-fear-deadly-homecoming-101630724598684.html

One memo warns that London could be stretched to breaking point as hundreds of thousands of people make their way to the UK capital.There will be a supposedly “spontaneous” service at St Paul’s Cathedral, according to Politico, and the new King Charles will tour the four nations of the United Kingdom in the days after her death.The British prime minister and the monarch are said to be in agreement that the day of her state funeral will be a day of national mourning. It will effectively be a holiday, although not described as such.Buckingham Palace officials have declined to comment, either on the leak or the plans.In 2017, ‘The Guardian’ published a long article revealing details about Operation London Bridge, which covered how the new King - Charles – will be proclaimed at St James’s Palace amid visiting royalty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/secret-funeral-plans-for-britain-s-queen-elizabeth-ii-leaked-101630723760642.html
04-09-2021||World||Taliban expected to announce new government today: 10 points||The Taliban are likely to announce their ‘new government’ in Afghanistan on Saturday, news agencies reported, even as the last flame of resistance burns on in Panjshir Valley, with rebel fighters hitting back at the hardline Islamist militants. According to reports, Taliban co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar is set to lead the new Afghan regime, joined by Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the son of late Taliban co-founder Mullah Omar, and Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, in senior positions. Haibatullah Akhundzada, the Taliban's supreme religious leader, will focus on religious matters and governance within the framework of Islam, reported the Reuters news agency.Also Read | Who is Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, set to lead new Afghanistan government?The Taliban face the enormous challenge of shifting gears from being an insurgent group to governing power, days after the United States fully withdrew its troops and ended two decades of war. Here's what we know of the situation so far:1. The Taliban ‘government’ would comprise 25 ministries, with a consultative council, or Shura, of 12 Muslim scholars, a person close to the Islamist militant group said on Friday. They added that while the Taliban have often spoken of their desire to form a consensus government with other Afghan leaders, the interim government which is now being formed would consist solely of Taliban members.2. A Loya Jirga, or ‘grand assembly’ is also in the works, to be formed within six to eight months. This assembly is aimed at bringing together elders and representatives across Afghan society to discuss a constitution and the structure of the future government.3. While there is no definite timeframe on when the interim government cabinet would be finalised, those privy to the matter have said that it would be settled by Saturday, while others feel it could take until the middle of next week.4. Meanwhile, the Taliban are still battling the extinguish the last flame of resistance in the Panjshir Valley, which held out for a decade against the Soviet Union's occupation and also the Taliban's first rule from 1996-2001.5. Even though rumours spread on Friday in Kabul suggesting Panjshir had fallen and celebratory gunfire rang across the Afghan capital soon after, the Taliban made no official claims in this regard. Moreover, a resident told the AFP news agency, on the condition of anonymity, that the reports were false.6. It is understood that anti-Taliban militia and former Afghan security forces, who now make up the National Resistance Front based in Kabul, have significant weapon stockpiles in the Panjshir valley, which lies around 80 kilometres (50 miles) north of Kabul.7. Meanwhile, much of the world seems to have adopted a wait-and-watch strategy with regards to the Taliban and their new regime in Afghanistan. The new government's legitimacy in the eyes of international donors and investors will be crucial. Humanitarian groups have warned of impending catastrophe, and the economy, reliant for years on millions of dollars in foreign aid, is near collapse.8. Denmark's foreign minister Jeppe Kofod has told a broadcaster that the country will not recognise any Taliban government, essentially becoming the first country to take such a position. British foreign minister Dominic Raab also said that it is necessary to engage with the Taliban to ensure safe corridors for those hoping to leave war-torn Afghanistan, but it doesn't mean Britain is ready to recognise a Taliban government.9. United States, too, is in no hurry to recognise the Taliban regime. The White House said that the Biden administration has no current plans to release billions in Afghan gold, investments, and foreign currency reserves, which it froze after the Taliban takeover. Western powers say formal recognition of the Taliban government and a resulting flow of economic aid will depend on action to safeguard human rights, the rule of law, and the media.10. United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres has decided to convene a high-level meeting on Afghanistan in Geneva on September 13 to focus on humanitarian assistance for the country. The UN has already restarted humanitarian flights to parts of the country, while the country's flag carrier Ariana Afghan Airlines resumed domestic flights on Friday and the United Arab Emirates sent a plane carrying "urgent medical and food aid".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-may-announce-new-government-today-as-panjshir-puts-up-last-stand-10-points-101630718842214.html
04-09-2021||World||Biden directs declassification of documents about 9/11 attacks||President Joe Biden on Friday directed the declassification of certain documents related to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a supportive gesture to victims' families who have long sought the records in hopes of implicating the Saudi government.The order, coming little more than a week before the 20th anniversary of the attacks, is a significant moment in a yearslong tussle between the government and the families over what classified information about the run-up to the attacks could be made public. That conflict was on display last month when many relatives, survivors, and first responders came out against Biden's participation in 9/11 memorial events if the documents remained classified.Biden said Friday that he was making good on a campaign commitment by ordering the declassification review and pledged that his administration “will continue to engage respectfully with members of this community.”“The significant events in question occurred two decades ago or longer, and they concern a tragic moment that continues to resonate in American history and in the lives of so many Americans,” the executive order states. “It is therefore critical to ensure that the United States Government maximizes transparency, relying on classification only when narrowly tailored and necessary."The order directs the Justice Department and other executive branch agencies to begin a declassification review and requires that declassified documents be released over the next six months.Brett Eagleson, whose father, Bruce, was among the World Trade Center victims and who is an advocate for other victims' relatives, commended the action as a “critical first step.” He said the families would be closely watching the process to make sure that the Justice Department follows through and acts "in good faith.”“The first test will be on 9/11, and the world will be watching. We look forward to thanking President Biden in person next week as he joins us at Ground Zero to honor those who died or were injured 20 years ago,” Eagleson said.Still, the practical impact of the executive order and any new documents it might yield was not immediately clear. Public documents released in the last two decades, including by the 9/11 Commission, have detailed numerous Saudi entanglements but have not proved government complicity.A long-running lawsuit in federal court in New York aims to hold the Saudi government accountable and alleges that Saudi officials provided significant support to some of the hijackers before the attacks. The lawsuit took a major step forward this year with the questioning under oath of former Saudi officials, and family members have long regarded the disclosure of declassified documents as an important step in making their case.The Saudi government has denied any connection to the attacks.Fifteen of the hijackers were Saudi, as was Osama bin Laden, whose al-Qaida network was behind the attacks. Particular scrutiny has centered on the support offered to the first two hijackers to arrive in the U.S., Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, including from a Saudi national with ties to the Saudi government who helped the men find and lease an apartment in San Diego and who had earlier attracted FBI scrutiny.Though many documents examining potential Saudi ties have been released, U.S. officials have long regarded other records as too sensitive for disclosure. On Thursday, victims' families and survivors urged the Justice Department's inspector general to investigate the FBI's apparent inability to locate key pieces of evidence they've been seeking.The Justice Department revealed last month that the FBI had recently completed an investigation examining certain 9/11 hijackers and potential co-conspirators, and that it was working toward providing more information.Under the terms of the executive order, the FBI must complete by Sept. 11 its declassification review of documents from that probe, which it has referred to as the "Subfile Investigation.” Additional documents, including any phone and bank records and reports with investigative findings, are to be reviewed with an eye for disclosure over the course of the next six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-directs-declassification-of-documents-about-9-11-attacks-101630722205819.html

It is the first coronavirus-related death in the country since mid-February."Every death is a reminder of the damage Covid-19 can cause when it gets into our community," Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in the statement."Our older New Zealanders and those with underlying health issues are by far the most at risk from the virus and one of the reasons lockdowns are such an important tool to stop its spread."New Zealand appears to be breaking the chain of transmission of the highly infectious Delta variant, with Saturday's numbers backing a lowering trend seen in recent days.About 1.7 million people in Auckland, the nation's largest city, have been in strict level 4 lockdown since mid-August. Curbs have been eased in the rest of the countries but schools and offices as well as cafe, restaurants and all public venues remain shut. Most New Zealanders have been asked to stay indoors.Active cases of the current outbreak stand at 782, with 765 in Auckland and 17 in Wellington, the capital.New Zealand, a nation of five million, has reported 3,392 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 27 related deaths since the pandemic began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-reports-first-death-from-delta-variant-of-covid19-101630721461750.html
04-09-2021||World||Expect to have real, inclusive government in Afghanistan: Antony Blinken||The United States and the international community expects the Taliban to form an inclusive government with representations from different communities and interests, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday.“As we've said and as countries around the world have said, there is an expectation that any government that emerges now will have some real inclusivity, and that it will have non-Talibs in it who are representative of different communities and different interests in Afghanistan,” Blinken told reporters at a news conference.The Taliban is expected to soon announce the formation of a new government after the takeover of the country last month.“We will see what, in fact, emerges, but I have to tell you that as important as what the government looks like is, more important still is what any government does. And that's what we're really looking at. We're looking at what actions, what policies any new Afghan government pursues. That's what matters the most,” he said.The expectation is to see inclusivity in government, but ultimately the expectation is to see a government that makes good on commitments that the Taliban have made, particularly in freedom of travel, not allowing Afghanistan to be used as a launching ground for terrorism directed at the US or any of the allies and partners, upholding the basic rights of the Afghan people, including women and minorities, and not engaging in reprisals, Blinken said.“These are the things that that we're looking at. And, again, not just us, many countries around the world,” he said.The United States, Blinken said, is committed to looking at everything done from day one through the present and draw lessons from it. “I think that there also needs to be, including across the State Department, a look back at the entire 20 years to understand the entire course of this war and engagement with Afghanistan and to ask the right questions and to learn the right lessons from that,” he said.Blinken said American diplomacy with allies and partners continues to intensify.“That diplomacy has already produced a statement signed by more than 100 countries and the UN Security Council resolution that makes clear the international community's expectations of a Taliban-led government, including freedom of travel; making good on its commitments on counterterrorism; upholding the basic rights of Afghans, including women and minorities; and forming an inclusive government and rejecting reprisals,” he said.The Secretary of State will be travelling to Qatar and Germany to hold meetings to intensify diplomacy with its friends and allies on the current evolving situation in Afghanistan.“On Sunday, I'll be heading to Doha where I'll meet with Qatari leaders to express our deep gratitude for all that they're doing to support the evacuation effort. I'll also have a chance to meet with Afghans, including our locally employed staff from the Embassy in Kabul, who are now safely in Doha preparing for their journey to the United States,” he said.From there, Blinken will be heading to Ramstein Air Base in Germany where, he will have a chance to meet Afghans awaiting processing to head to the US and the Americans who are staffing that effort.“I'll also meet with Foreign Minister Heiko Maas of Germany, and we'll hold a ministerial meeting on Afghanistan with him live and then virtually with other partners that'll include more than 20 countries that all have a stake in helping to relocate and resettle Afghans and in holding the Taliban to their commitments,” he said.Later, Acting Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Dean Thompson told reporters that Blinken has no plans to meet the Taliban leadership in Doha.“There's currently no plans to do any meetings with the Taliban in Doha. This is very much focused on our relationship with Qatar, thanking them for the incredible support that they've given, as well as on the German side. That'll be a fundamental message throughout the trip,” he said.The US, he said, is watching very carefully and closely the evolving developments in Afghanistan.“I think it’s too early to make a firm judgment. Reports that we receive of violations of basic human rights and particularly reports about restrictions on women, girls, anything of that nature is of great concern and something we would definitely continue to raise,” he said.“At the same time, I would note that there was cooperation with the Taliban in order to affect the huge operation of the last few weeks, and so I think as we’ve said, the Taliban has made some good statements – or some positive statements is a better way to say it – but their actions are what is going to matter,” he said.“We are going to continue to really assess that. And I think even more broadly than that is they’re not just the actions of any one individual but their ability to ensure that across the country they live up to their commitments that they’ve made,” Thompson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expect-to-have-real-inclusive-government-in-afghanistan-antony-blinken-101630721129848.html
04-09-2021||World||US Covid-19 booster shot campaign to start with only Pfizer: Report||A White House plan to offer Covid-19 booster shots will most likely start this month only with the vaccine made by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech , a narrower initiative than anticipated, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday.President Joe Biden had expected to launch a campaign to administer 100 million booster shots on September 20. But U.S. vaccine makers other than Pfizer have lagged in seeking authorization of an additional dose.Moderna Inc only started submitting data for regulatory approval of a booster shot on Wednesday and said on Friday it had completed its submission.A panel of experts that advises the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on vaccines plans to meet on Sept. 17 to discuss additional doses of Pfizer's shot.Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser, told MSNBC in an interview on Friday that it did not appear the information needed for Moderna would be available in time for a Sept. 20 rollout."It may be a delay for a few weeks. We don't know," Fauci said.Johnson & Johnson has not yet asked regulators to approve a booster for its one-dose shot, and last week said it was in discussions with the FDA on the subject.Earlier, the New York Times reported that the officials told the White House on Thursday to scale back a plan to offer the booster shots to the general public later this month.As infections from the Delta variant rise, the Biden administration is concerned that Covid infections among people who are fully vaccinated are a sign that vaccine protection is waning. It has pushed boosters as a way to rebuild immunity."We are awaiting a full review and approval by the FDA" and advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), White House spokesman Chris Meagher said."When that approval and recommendation are made, we will be ready to implement the plan our nation's top doctors developed so that we are staying ahead of this virus."Dr. Janet Woodcock, acting FDA commissioner, and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC director, told White House Covid coordinator Jeffrey Zientz on Thursday their agencies may be able recommend boosters by late September only for certain recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the source familiar with the discussions said.U.S. health officials had said in August that a third shot would be made widely available on Sept. 20 to Americans who received two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines at least eight months earlier.The U.S. booster plan is dependent on the FDA determining that a third dose of the two-dose vaccines is safe and effective and a favorable recommendation from CDC advisers.FDA and CDC spokespeople referred questions to the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-booster-shot-campaign-to-start-with-only-pfizer-report-101630719440570.html
04-09-2021||World||Taliban indicated they'd be reasonable in addressing Indian concerns: Shringla||India and the United States are closely watching Pakistan’s actions in Afghanistan, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Friday.In the limited engagement that India has had with the Taliban, the new Afghan rulers have indicated that they would be reasonable in addressing New Delhi’s concerns, the foreign secretary added.“Obviously, like us, they're also watching carefully and we have to watch Pakistan’s actions with a fine tooth comb,” he told a group of Indian reporters at the end of his three-day official visit to Washington DC adding that the US will have a wait-and-watch policy with regard to how the situation evolves in Afghanistan.India also has a similar policy. “That doesn't mean you don't do anything. It simply means that you have to... the situation is very fluid on the ground, you have to allow it to see how it evolves. You have to see whether the assurances that have been made publicly are actually maintained on the ground, and how things work out,” he said.“Our engagement with them (the Taliban) has been limited. It's not that we have (had) a robust conversation. But for whatever conversation we've had so far, they've been sort of. At least, the Taliban seem to indicate that they will be reasonable in the way they handle this,” Shringla said.He was responding to a question about the recent meeting that India’s Ambassador in Qatar had with a senior Taliban leader in Doha.“In our statement, we have said that we have told them that we want them to be cognisant of the fact that there should be no terrorism that emanates from their territory directed against us, or other countries; that we want them to be mindful of the status of women, minorities and so on so forth. And, and I think they have, also, you know, made reassuring... from their side,” he said.The top Indian diplomat was in Washington DC for a series of meetings with his American counterpart and top officials of the Biden administration in addition to interaction with representations from the industry and think-tanks.On Thursday, he had called on the Secretary of State Antony Blinken.Observing that the situation in Afghanistan is very fluid and moving fast, Shringla said that both India and the US are keeping a close watch on it. “Look on 15th of August, you had a situation where (Afghan) President (Ashraf) Ghani suddenly left. You had the Taliban come in. The situation is moving so fast it's so fluid that is difficult to comment at this point of time on anything,” he said.Shringla said the US is watching the situation in Afghanistan very closely. “They will obviously see how different players get engaged in the situation in Afghanistan. Pakistan is a neighbour of Afghanistan. They have supported and nurtured the Taliban. There are various elements there that Pakistan supported,” he said.At the same time, he noted that the UNSC resolution on Afghanistan adopted during India’s presidency makes mention of the proscribed entities in the UN sanctions list, including the Jaish-e-Mohammed and the Lashkar-e-Taiba. “We do have concerns about the free ingress that these two terrorist groups have had in Afghanistan, their role and we will watch that carefully. The role of Pakistan has to be seen in that context,” Shringla said.Responding to a question, the foreign secretary said the Americans have always said the Taliban has committed to them that they will not allow Afghan territory to be used again in any manner that is detrimental to any country outside Afghanistan.The US has made it clear to the Taliban that they would hold them accountable if any terrorist activities are emanating from Afghanistan. The international community is on the same page, he said.“We are obviously very much engaged with US on Afghanistan on the situation there, the role of Pakistan there, and of course looking at how the situation would evolve in that country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-indicated-they-d-be-reasonable-in-addressing-indian-concerns-shringla-101630715867101.html

So far, about 500,000 people have been displaced in Afghanistan this year, but there hasn’t been evidence of people entering neighbouring countries, nor has there been significant movement towards the bloc, according to an EU diplomatic note seen by Bloomberg.Pontecorvo, who took part in the effort to evacuate Afghan civilians from Kabul in August, said the end of the US presence is expected to free up Islamic State-Khorasan’s territorial claims in the country. “That is a risk that the Taliban will have to deal with,” he said.2nd evacuee boy dies of mushroom poisoningA second child of an Afghan family evacuated from Kabul to Poland died on Friday after eating soup containing death cap mushrooms, which the family had unknowingly gathered in a Polish forest outside their quarantine centre.The six-year-old boy had received an emergency liver transplant but doctors were unable to save him. His five-year-old brother was pronounced dead on Thursday at Poland’s main children’s hospital, where both were treated. The boys’ 17-year-old sister was treated at the hospital and released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/militants-may-use-chaos-to-infiltrate-us-eu-says-nato-101630707015676.html
04-09-2021||World||Last pocket of resistance captured, claim Taliban||The Taliban forces have taken complete control of Afghanistan including the Panjshir valley where opposition forces had been holding out, three Taliban sources told Reuters on Friday as heavy celebratory gunfire was heard in the Afghan capital of Kabul.“We are in control of the entire Afghanistan. The troublemakers have [been] defeated and Panjshir is now under our command,” one Taliban commander reportedly said.It was not immediately possible to confirm the claims of the Taliban sources. The country’s former vice-president Amrullah Saleh, one of the leaders of the opposition forces, told Tolo News television station that reports he had fled the country were untrue.The BBC, however, reported that National Resistance Front (NRF) spokesman Ali Nazari said that anti-Taliban forces had actually pushed the insurgents back earlier in the day.“The Taliban’s propaganda machine keeps publishing the same claims that Panjshir has fallen - we have seen it for the past week that it is false, and it’s the opposite - that it’s the National Resistance Front that has caused them to retreat,” Nazari told the BBC.Other possible reasons for the gunfire in Kabul include a top Taliban leader entering Kabul or co-founder Abdul Ghani Baradar being appointed head of state, the BBC report speculated.In a separate development, Afghanistan’s 250 female judges are particularly afraid of men they jailed who have now been freed by the Taliban. “Four or five Taliban members came and asked people in my house: ‘Where is this woman judge?’ These were people who I had put in jail,” a judge who had escaped to Europe said from an undisclosed location.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/last-pocket-of-resistance-captured-claim-taliban-101630706801152.html
04-09-2021||World||Taliban make it loud and clear: China is our top ally||Describing China as its “most important partner”, the Taliban group has said that it looks up to Beijing for support as war-ravaged Afghanistan faces widespread hunger and the possibility of a major economic collapse.Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said the group supports Beijing’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative that aims to link China with Africa, Asia and Europe through a network of ports, railways, roads and industrial parks.“China is our most important partner and represents a fundamental and extraordinary opportunity for us because it is ready to invest and rebuild our country,” Geo News quoted Mujahid as saying in an interview to an Italian newspaper on Thursday.There are “rich copper mines in the country, which, thanks to the Chinese, can be put back into operation and modernised. In addition, China is our pass to markets all over the world,” said Mujahid.China, too, has been making positive statements on the Taliban ever since it came to power in Kabul, and has expressed hope that the insurgents will follow moderate domestic and foreign policies, combat terrorist forces, live in harmony with other countries, and live up to the aspiration of its people and the international community.Afghan situation likely on BRICS summit agendaThe aftermath of the Taliban toppling the US-backed government in Kabul is likely to be discussed during a BRICS summit scheduled for later this month, Beijing indicated on Friday. The 13th BRICS summit will be held virtually under the chairmanship of India.“BRICS is an important platform for cooperation between emerging markets and developing countries.

New Jersey governor Phil Murphy said in a tweet at least 23 people from that state had perished in the storm. Among the fatalities, three people were found dead in a basement in the New York City borough of Queens, while four residents of Elizabeth, New Jersey, died at a public housing complex flooded by 8 feet of water.US President Joe Biden declared that an emergency exists in the states of New Jersey and New York and ordered federal assistance to supplement local response efforts due to conditions resulting from the remnants of Hurricane Ida, the White House said on Thursday.Roadways were transformed into river-like torrents in minutes as the downpours struck on Wednesday night, trapping drivers in quickly rising floodwaters. Scores of vehicles were found abandoned on area roadways on Thursday.Subway services in New York City remained “extremely limited,” transit officials said, and commuter rail services to the suburbs were largely suspended. About 370 flights were canceled at New Jersey’s Newark Liberty Airport.The damage came three days after Ida, one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to strike the US Gulf Coast, made landfall on Sunday in Louisiana, destroying entire communities. But the loss of life in the Northeast dwarfed the confirmed storm-related death toll of nine in Louisiana.Climate change is here, say officialsThe storm and its death toll served as grim reminders that as the climate changes, weather once considered freakish strikes with regularity, threatening the viability of all coastal economic centres.Ida’s remnants brought 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20cm) of rain to a swath of the Northeast from Philadelphia to Connecticut and set an hourly rainfall record of 3.15 inches for Manhattan, breaking one set by Tropical Storm Henri less than two weeks ago, the National Weather Service said.“Climate change is happening right now,” New York governor Kathy Hochul said via Twitter. “It is not a future threat. It is a current threat.”The number of disasters, such as floods and heat waves, driven by climate change has increased fivefold over the past 50 years, according to a report||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-ida-s-record-rain-leaves-49-dead-in-u-s-northeast-101630700443956.html
04-09-2021||World||Global meeting aims to protect species on the brink||The world's leading global conservation congress opened on Friday, with warnings that humanity must tackle the grave risks of biodiversity loss and climate change together.The key message from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is that disappearing species and the destruction of ecosystems are no less existential threats than global warming."The battle for the climate -- against climate change -- is twinned with the battle to preserve and restore biodiversity," said French President Emmanuel Macron in a speech at the opening ceremony in the French port city of Marseille.But efforts to stem the losses of the world's wildlife had fallen behind, he warned.How to reverse relentless habitat destruction, unsustainable agriculture, mining and a warming planet will dominate discussion during the conference."We are facing huge challenges. We are seeing the climate changing and impacting hugely our societies," said IUCN chief Bruno Oberle in a speech before the congress opened."We are seeing biodiversity disappearing and the pandemic hitting our economies, our families, our health."The meeting, delayed from 2020 by the pandemic, comes ahead of crucial UN summits on climate, food systems and biodiversity that could shape the planet's foreseeable future.Previous IUCN congresses have paved the way for global treaties on biodiversity and the international trade in endangered species.But efforts to halt extensive declines in numbers and diversity of animals and plants have so far failed to slow the destruction.In 2019 the UN's biodiversity experts warned that a million species are on the brink of extinction -- raising the spectre that the planet is on the verge of its sixth mass extinction event in 500 million years.Protesters in Marseille, with banners that read "Nature is not for sale!" and "Change the system not the climate!", urged more urgent action."It's hard to read the headlines: floods, fires, famines, plagues and tell your children that everything is alright," said actor Harrison Ford, who has become a vocal environmental campaigner, the opening ceremony."It's not alright. Dammit, it's not alright!"'Our right to exist'The nine-day IUCN meeting will include an update of its Red List of Threatened Species, measuring how close animal and plant species are to vanishing forever.Experts have assessed nearly 135,000 species over the last half-century and nearly 28 percent are currently at risk of extinction, with habitat loss, overexploitation and illegal trade driving the loss.Big cats, for example, have lost more than 90 percent of their historic range and population, with only 20,000 lions, 7,000 cheetahs, 4,000 tigers and a few dozen Amur leopards left in the wild.The IUCN will also, for the first time in its seven-decade history, welcome indigenous peoples to share their knowledge on how best to heal the natural world as voting members.Oberle thanked indigenous groups for joining the IUCN's membership and bringing a "wealth of experience" on how to have a different relationship with the planet.Recent research has warned that rampant deforestation and climate change are pushing the Amazon towards a disastrous "tipping point" which would see tropical forests give way to savannah-like landscapes.Rates of tree loss drop sharply in the forests where native peoples live, especially if they hold some degree of title -- legal or customary -- over land."We are demanding from the world our right to exist as peoples, to live with dignity in our territories," said Jose Gregorio Diaz Mirabal, lead coordinator for COICA, which represents indigenous groups in nine Amazon-basin nations.Motions on the table include protecting 80 percent of Amazonia by 2025, tackling plastic in the oceans, combating wildlife crime and preventing pandemics.Macron has said the conference should lay the "initial foundations" for a global biodiversity strategy that will be the focus of UN deliberations in China in April next year.The international community is trying to frame interim goals for this decade as well as longer-term aims for 2050.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-meeting-aims-to-protect-species-on-the-brink-101630693550650.html
04-09-2021||India||Bihar looks to simplify road accident claims, fast-track ex-gratia||PATNA: Bihar is set to become the first state to simplify claims of road traffic accident (RTA) insurance by removing the victims or their dependants from the litigation process and paying them an interim ex-gratia amount of ₹5 lakh within 15 days in the event of a death, officials aware of the matter said.The state will also take the onus to contest the case in court, on behalf of the victim, if the insurance firm of the accused vehicle owner decides to challenge the order, the people quoted above said.From September 15, the state is to set implement the new amendment to the Bihar Motor Vehicle Rules that empower the state transport appellate tribunal to settle all such accident claims within 60 days. The new amendment was notified in the Bihar gazette on August 11 after a cabinet order.So far, road traffic accident insurance claims are tried in the civil court and cases can linger on for years.“This is the first of its kind initiative in India to simplify accident claims,” said Bihar’s transport secretary, Sanjay Kumar Agarwal.The new rules allow immediate payment of ₹5 lakh as interim compensation in case of a death and ₹50,000 for grievous injury to dependants or victims of road traffic accidents involving vehicles that are insured, uninsured or involved in hit-and-run cases. The compensation for grievous injury is proposed to be increased from ₹50,000 to ₹2.5 lakh.As part of the new rules, victims or their relatives will not have to run from pillar to post for the settlement of claims, people quoted above said. The state will pay the interim compensation and also take the responsibility of fighting a legal suit on behalf of the victim if an insurance firm were to challenge its order.“We have set up a revolving corpus of ₹50 crore under the Bihar motor vehicle accident assistance fund through which such payments will be made,” said Agarwal.In case of insured vehicles, the state will pay the compensation to the victim or their dependants through the corpus fund and recover the amount from the insurance firm after the tribunal settles the case within the stipulated 60 days, he added.For uninsured vehicles, the state will recover the compensation amount by auctioning the vehicle if its vehicle owner is unable to pay the compensation to the victim’s family. Should the amount realised through auction be less than the compensation fixed, the state will bear the difference amount through the Bihar motor vehicle accident assistance fund, said Agarwal.Nearly 20% of about 1.4 million registered vehicles in the state till 2019-20 do not renew their insurance, according to estimates. “We will start a special drive to check for insurance of motor vehicles soon,” he added.For hit-and-run case, the compensation amount will be borne through the state’s corpus fund and replenished partially by the Centre through insurance companies, which pay ₹50,000. The state will bear the remaining ₹4,50,000 in deaths involving hit-and-run cases.Under the changed rules, all sub-divisional officers (SDO) will be the accident claim inquiry officer and district magistrates (DM) the accident claims assessment officer. The SDO conducts the inquiry on the basis of site inspection done by the police and the motor vehicle inspector.“The changed rules do not mandate any site inspection or examination of witness at the trial stage. If challenged, the case will be adjudicated on the basis of a summary trial based on the petition of the victim or their relatives, deposition by the insurance firm and reports by the police, the SDO and DM,” said Agarwal.In case the tribunal or a higher court awards a higher compensation, the difference of the amount already paid as interim compensation would be credited into the bank account of the victim’s family. However, in case of an adverse order for the government, the interim amount already paid as compensation to the family of the victim will not be taken back but adjusted through the Bihar motor vehicle accident assistance fund.Bihar ranks 15th in India in terms of road accidents and ninth in terms of fatalities arising out of them, as per data released by the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRT&H) in 2019.Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat are among states which rank higher than Bihar both in terms of number of road accidents and deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-looks-to-simplify-road-accident-claims-fast-track-exgratia-101630779280045.html
04-09-2021||India||CID summons Suvendu Adhikari for questioning over alleged suicide of bodyguard||The West Bengal Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has asked Bharatiya Janata Party leader Suvendu Adhikari to appear before it on Monday for questioning in connection with the alleged suicide of his security guard in 2018, officials said. Interestingly, the Enforcement Directorate has also summoned West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee to Delhi for questioning in connection with the multi-crore coal smuggling case on the same day. Even though Adhikari didn’t respond to calls and messages, a BJP spokesperson said that it was vendetta politics as Adhikari had defeated Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram in the recently held assembly elections. “When the security guard died, Adhikari was a minister in the TMC government. Back then he was God. Now that he has joined the BJP and has defeated Mamata Banerjee he has become a demon. The TMC is not being able to digest the defeat of Mamata Banerjee. This is nothing but vendetta politics,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson. In July the CID had initiated a fresh probe into the death of Adhikari’s security guard who reportedly died by suicide in 2018. According to the police, the victim, Suvabrata Chakraborty, allegedly shot himself with his service revolver in October 2018. Chakraborty was the former security guard of BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari, who was then transport minister in the Mamata Banerjee administration. The guard died two days later. In July, after the TMC came to power for the third time, the victim’s wife lodged a three-page complaint with the local police in East Midnapore district demanding a fresh probe into her husband’s death. Adhikari had sided with the BJP in December 2020 just ahead of the state assembly elections. Though the TMC returned to power with a thumping majority, chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who contested from Nandigram in East Midnapore district, was defeated by Adhikari, her protégé-turned-adversary. Adhikari is now the leader of the opposition in the state legislative assembly. “BJP is continuously resorting to vindictive politics. The way, Abhishek Banerjee and a few others are being attacked in the name of investigation; people of West Bengal won’t accept it. It has been proved that such steps are not above vindictive politics,” Partha Chatterjee, state minister and Trinamool Congress’ secretary general had told the media when ED had summoned the CM’s nephew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cid-summons-suvendu-adhikari-for-questioning-over-alleged-suicide-of-bodyguard-101630779264692.html

04-09-2021||India||Covid-19 pandemic under control in Kerala, says CM Pinarayi Vijayan||Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday said the Covid-19 situation in the state is under control and there has not been any big spike in infections after the Onam festival as feared. The CM said though the number of patients increased, hospital admissions came down in the last three weeks and the situation would stabilise soon. He said in mid-August, the hospitalisation rate was 5.99 per cent of active cases but it came down to 5.23 per cent between August 28 and September 3. “There is not as big a hike as we feared after Onam. Hospitalisation rate is coming down slowly. Even in the recent experts’ meeting all lauded the state’s containment strategy,” he said. The Kerala government had called a meeting of experts on September 1. Vijayan said the night curfew and Sunday lockdown will continue till the situation stabilised. Many experts have criticised the night curfew saying movement was minimum during night hours. He said the state has vaccinated 75 per cent of the eligible population and out of this 27.4 per cent got both doses even as the Union government ensured proper supply of vaccines. The CM also flagged off a new campaign “Be the Warrior” exhorting youngsters and volunteers to participate in a big way in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the opposition Congress and BJP said the government’s containment measures remained only confined to slogans and public relations exercises. “Now the government is taking refuge in experts’ meeting to paint a rosy picture. Instead of admitting that its containment strategy had failed it is looking for alibis,” said BJP leader S Suresh. Kerala on Saturday added 29,682 new Covid-19 cases with a TPR of 17.54 per cent after 1,69,237 samples were tested. It also reported 142 deaths with the death toll rising to 21,422. Active cases now stand at 2,50, 065. Thrissur district topped with 3,474 cases followed by Ernakulam with 3,456 and Malappuram with 3,156 cases. North Kerala’s Wayanad and Kasaragod districts reported less than 1000 cases. In the last 24 hours the country reported 42,618 new cases with 330 deaths. The national TPR is below 3% and the active caseload stands at 4,05,681.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-pandemic-under-control-in-kerala-says-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-101630774164528.html

04-09-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: Sept 5, 1976 — Viking-2 lands on Mars, sends photos||Pasadena, California- The first two photographs of Mars sent back by Viking-II today show a desert terrain similar to the landing site of the earlier probe, Viking-1, Mission Control announced here. A spokesman said all communications with both modules of Viking-II were restored, and the first two pictures showed a sandy surface strewn with boulders of various kinds, some sharp-edged and others round and sponge-like in appearance. The fact that the pictures were transmitted successfully indicated that the main antenna on the orbiting section was again directed towards the earth and the communications problems were solved, he added. The section was thrown out of position yesterday at the moment of separation of the two parts and the antenna was pointing to space, cutting off normal communication between earth and the landing module. The first photographs were very clear, showing that the first camera on the module was working well. They consisted of a shot of the landing spot showing one of the module’s legs and a panoramic view. Over the next few days, Viking II will continue to take photographs of the area around the site and will not begin biological experiments in the search for life until a week’s time. Dr Carl Sagan, an astronomer on the Viking team, said that the rocks liberally strewn across the landscape appeared to come from a nearby crater. He said that racks pitted with holes, around the foot pad of the Viking lander, appeared to be lava from a volcano 2nd success Viking-II’s touchdown was the second major success for the US space programme within six weeks, following quickly on the heels of the almost-flawless mission by Viking-I now sitting 4,000 miles away near the Mars equator. Viking II, which set down in a valley called “Utopia,” will be looking for confirmation of signals sent back by Viking-I that microscopic forms of life may exist in the sticky, red Mars soil. Fog and lee are both present near the “UtopIa” region and scientists think it is much more probable that life will be found where there is water. “We’re at the right place at the right time as far as water goes,” one Viking project scientist said shortly before touchdown. Tension was high at the laboratory’s command post as radio contact was lost for 45 minutes shortly after the lander capsule shot away from the orbiter 11,000 miles above the planet’s surface. Confirmation that Viking II had landed almost exactly at the planned time of 3-38 p.m. local (2238 GMT, 0408 IST) came when the feeble signal from the orbiter showed that the lander had switched to the higher radio frequency it was to use on the Martian surface.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-sept-5-1976-viking-2-lands-on-mars-sends-photos-101630769844958.html

04-09-2021||India||PM Modi’s upcoming visit to US maybe linked to holding of Quad Summit||A visit to the US by Prime Minister Narendra Modi this month is being linked to greater clarity on the holding of the first in-person summit of Quad leaders following Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s decision to step down, people familiar with developments said on Saturday. The first face-to-face meeting of leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, after their maiden virtual summit in March, was being seen as the centrepiece of a visit to the US by Modi. However, Suga’s surprise move led to confusion and uncertainty about plans for the Quad meet to be hosted by Washington, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. The Indian side has already begun advance preparations for a possible visit by the prime minister, and some of the grounds were prepared during foreign secretary Harsh Shringla’s three-day visit to Washington this week. There has been no formal announcement from the Indian side, though dates between September 22 and 27 were being looked at for the visit. If the visit does go ahead, Modi is also expected to address the annual UN General Assembly in New York and hold his first bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden. “There is some amount of confusion and lack of clarity on whether the Japanese prime minister will travel to the US following his decision to step down. The Indian side has begun the spade work but a call will have to be made at a higher level,” one of the people cited above said. The people said the Japanese side had proposed holding the Quad Summit in a hybrid format, with Suga joining virtually. There have also been suggestions for holding the summit after the election of a new Japanese prime minister. It is learnt that not all Quad members are interested in holding the summit in a hybrid format. The people also noted the US recently asked more than 150 countries planning to send a leader or a minister to speak in person at the UN General Assembly to consider giving a video address in order to prevent the meeting from becoming a super-spreader event. The Quad comprises India, Australia, Japan and the US. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected to travel to the US in September to join Biden for events commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Australia, New Zealand and US Security Treaty, or ANZUS Treaty. On Friday, Suga announced his decision not to seek re-election as leader of the ruling Liberal Democrat Party (LDP) in the face of mounting criticism over his handling of the Covid-19 crisis. Suga took over just under a year ago after Shinzo Abe resigned citing ill health. Opposition to his leadership among LDP lawmakers has diminished his chances of winning a second term. Even if Suga were to go ahead with a visit to the US, he has to return to Japan before September 29, when LDP will hold its presidential election. Suga is also expected to be preoccupied with campaigning for the party election, which will begin on September 17. His successor must call a general election by November 28. The political developments in Japan have also raised the possibility of the annual bilateral summit with India being cancelled for the third straight year. The meet couldn’t be held in 2019 because of violent protests against the amended citizenship law in Guwahati, the proposed venue, and it wasn’t held last year because of the pandemic. The planned Quad Summit was aimed at giving fresh impetus to several key initiatives, including the grouping’s vaccine partnership and measures to ensure an open and free Indo-Pacific. The four countries plan to distribute one billion doses of US-developed vaccines produced in India across the Indo-Pacific but the move hit a road block after India was hit by a devastating second wave of infections. In March, Biden hosted the first virtual Quad leaders’ summit that pledged to work for an open and inclusive Indo-Pacific anchored by democratic values and unconstrained by coercion, an apparent signal to China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-upcoming-visit-to-us-maybe-linked-to-holding-of-quad-summit-101630769184332.html

Panchjanya has carried a four-page cover story on the Bengaluru-based IT services company, with Infosys founder Narayana Murthy’s picture on it and text which reads 'Saakh Aur Aghaat' (Reputation and Damage).The article criticising Infosys’ handling of the project wonders whether any "anti-national power is trying to hurt India's economic interests through it". Dubbing the company as 'Unchi Dukan, Phika Pakwaan' (great cry and little wool), Panchjanya noted that the regular glitches have "brought down the trust of taxpayers in the Indian economy"."Due to glitches in both GST and Income Tax return portals developed by Infosys, the taxpayers trust in the country's economy has taken a hit. Is it that any anti-national force via Infosys is trying to hurt India's economic interests," the article wondered.While the weekly admitted that it doesn’t have any concrete evidence to back the serious allegation, it said the company has been multiple times accused of helping the "naxalites, leftists and tukde-tukde gangs".Also Read | I-T portal glitch: Finance ministry 'summons' Infosys CEO Salil ParekhSenior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that the article attempts to shift the blame from the government and is “actually anti-national”. Taking to Twitter, the Rajya Sabha MP and former Union minister said that IT companies like Infosys have transformed the country and the article deserves to be “wholeheartedly condemned.”The scurrilous attack on Infosys in a RSS publication is outrageous and actually anti-national. Companies like Infosys have transformed India and its standing in the world. The article is an attempt to shift the blame from the Govt and deserves to be wholeheartedly condemned!The scathing piece targeting Infosys came days after Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman held a meeting with the company’s MD & CEO Salil Parekh to convey “deep disappointment and concerns” of the government as well as the taxpayers about the issues in the e-filing portal. Sitharaman has given Infosys a September 15 deadline to resolve all the issues faced by taxpayers on the portal.

Since the insurgent group came to power in Afghanistan, both the LDF and the UDF have been playing a different sort of politics, the state BJP leader charged. He said that the pro-Taliban stance is to whitewash 1921's Malabar Rebellion in Kerala.The Malabar rebellion still courts controversy as the BJP and the RSS consider this as one of the first manifestations of the Taliban mindset in India, while both the Congress and the LDF consider this as an anti-imperialist movement.Many insurgents who left Kerala to join ISIS in 2016 have been released from Kabul prisons after the Taliban captured Kabul and announced an amnesty for everyone. At least 14 of them reportedly joined the Islamic State of Khorasan Province, the IS branch, which claimed the responsibility of the airport blasts.Earlier, CPI(M) politburo member MA Baby opined that the Taliban victory increases the possibility of radical Islam becoming a magnet for more citizens, including Keralites. In reply to this, IUML leader Abdu Rabb said CPI(M)'s ideological partner China has already made overtures to the Taliban leadership.IUML MLAMK Muneer had complained of receiving an anonymous threat letter after he made an anti-Taliban post on Facebook soon after the Taliban captured Kabul.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijayans-party-udf-vying-to-support-taliban-says-kerala-bjp-chief-101630762834050.html

04-09-2021||India||Third BJP legislator joins TMC in five days in West Bengal||In another blow to the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, Soumen Roy--- the party’s MLA from Kaliaganj in north Bengal--- joined the ruling Trinamool Congress on Saturday. Roy is the third BJP MLA to switch sides in five days and the fourth since the TMC came to power for the third consecutive time in May this year after a sweeping victory in the assembly elections. “Roy approached our party chief Mamata Banerjee and also held talks with the party’s national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee,” said Partha Chatterjee, state minister and secretary general of the TMC. Earlier in June, Mukul Roy, who was BJP’s national vice-president, had returned to the TMC. On August 30, Tanmay Ghosh, who had won the Bishnupur seat in Bankura district on a BJP ticket in the recently held polls, joined the TMC. A day later Biswajit Das, BJP’s MLA from Bagda constituency in North 24 Parganas, joined the TMC. Both Roy and Das, after joining the TMC, hinted that more BJP legislators could join the ruling party in the near future. “I have been associated with the TMC for long. I, however, contested the elections on a BJP ticket. But my heart was with the TMC. I got misguided and made a mistake. I apologise to my party,” said Roy while speaking to the media at the TMC headquarters in Kolkata. The TMC had won 213 seats, while the BJP had managed 77 seats in the assembly polls held earlier this year. The party’s strength, however, had dropped to 75 as two MLAs did not take oath and had resigned to retain their Lok Sabha seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-bjp-legislator-joins-tmc-in-five-days-in-west-bengal-101630753703517.html
04-09-2021||India||By-poll schedule for 4 assembly seats including Mamata Banerjee’s announced||By-polls to four assembly seats, including West Bengal’s Bhabanipur where Mamata Banerjee is expected to contest as she needs to get elected to the state assembly by November to continue as the chief minister, will be held on September 30, the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced on Saturday.Banerjee, who took oath as the chief minister on May 5, needs to be elected within six months to retain the post. Her Trinamool Congress (TMC) swept to power for the third time this summer. But Banerjee lost the March-April assembly polls from Nandigram to her protégé-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). TMC has been pressing for holding the by-polls as soon as possible. It has been critical of the ECI over the delay in announcing the schedule for them. In June, Banerjee said the election watchdog was awaiting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s instructions to hold the by-elections. A delegation of TMC parliamentarians met the ECI on July 15, seeking the by-polls at the earliest.The by-poll schedule was announced days after the ECI sought inputs on 30 constituencies across the country from concerned chief secretaries and disaster management authorities in view of the pandemic. Apart from Bhabanipur, the by-polls will be held to Jangipur, Samerganj (West Bengal), and Pipli (Odisha) seats. The ECI has allowed 14-day campaigning in Bhabanipur while curtailing the electioneering in other constituencies as per the pandemic situation. “Campaigning is allowed but it has been notified according to the pandemic (situation)...,” a person familiar with the matter said on the condition of anonymity.The ECI said public gatherings will be prohibited during the nomination process. “Only three vehicles (will be) permitted within a periphery of 100 meters of RO’s (returning officer) office. No procession for nomination shall be permitted,” the ECI said in an order.For indoor campaigns, 30% of the allowed capacity or 200 persons, whichever is less, will be permitted. A register will also be maintained to count the number of people attending the meetings. The daily count of Covid-19 cases shot up from around 200 on February 26, when the eight-phase elections in Bengal were announced, to more than 27,000 on April 29 when the polls ended. Health experts linked the surge in infections to political rallies that violated the Covid-19 protocol.Elections in two constituencies in West Bengal’s Murshidabad were cancelled when the candidates contesting them died of Covid-19 in April during the staggered assembly polls. Two BJP members of Parliament, Nisith Pramanik and Jagannath Sarkar, resigned after winning assembly polls. Two other TMC legislators died after contracting the Covid-19 infection. TMC lawmaker from Bhawanipore, Sovan Deb Chatterjee, resigned to vacate the seat for Banerjee to contest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bypoll-schedule-for-4-assembly-seats-including-mamata-banerjee-s-announced-101630745604342.html

According to farmer leaders, discussions will be held on issues concerning farmers, including the contentious three laws passed by the Centre last year.Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions spearheading the anti-agriculture law stir, has claimed that farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Maharashtra will take part in the Mahapanchayat."It is expected that lakhs of farmers will take part in the Kisan Mahapanchayat that will inaugurate Mission Uttar Pradesh of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, on 5th of September in the city's GIC Ground," SKM said.The farmers' body said that mobilisation meetings have taken place in several places in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.The SKM also said that if cases against farmers were not withdrawn by September 8, an action plan for a larger protest will be decided on the day after a meeting among the protesting farmer unions.The Uttar Pradesh government has made elaborate security arrangements in view of the farmers' gathering. Six companies of the provincial armed constabulary (PAC) and two companies of rapid action force (RAF) are being deployed in Muzaffarnagar.DIG of Saharanpur range Preetinder Singh said on Saturday that the event will be videographed while five SSPs, seven ASPs and 40 police inspectors will be posted on security duty.The farmers' protest against the three contentious laws has been going on for more than nine months at the Delhi borders. The farmers have been demanding the repeal of the laws which they claim will do away with the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.More than 10 rounds of talks with the government that has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms have failed to break the deadlock between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kisan-mahapanchayat-in-muzaffarnagar-on-sunday-up-govt-beefs-up-security-101630738421221.html

As per the report, PM Modi will visit Washington where he is likely to hold a bilateral meeting with President Joe Biden.He will also visit New York for the 76th session of the annual United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).

04-09-2021||India||Covid R-value rises amid threat of third wave: All you need to know||As states across India race to control the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) ahead of an expected third wave in October, there is a more worrying factor in the form of rising R-value. The R-value in the last week of August rise to 1.17 as against 0.89 between August 14-17, according to the researchers at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.The R-value determines how rapidly the Covid-19 pandemic is spreading."Not only is it greater than one, it is much higher than the last time there was a scare of a third wave (it was 1.03 at that time)," Sitabhra Sinha, who is leading the team of researchers, told news agency PTI."This is driven by several states having their R-value go over 1 in the last few days of August - most notably Kerala and Maharashtra, but also Mizoram and Jammu and Kashmir," Singh added.Why is R-value important?The Reproduction number or R denotes how fast an infection is spreading. When a wave is at its peak, it is evident that the virus is spreading at a faster rate. But at a time when the wave is receding, a slight increase of R-value can indicate an impending upward trend in the wave again.If R is greater than 1, the number of infected people is increasing in each round - this is what is called the epidemic phase. In other words, it tells how 'efficiently' a virus is spreading.States with highest R-valueThe R-value of Kerala stood at 1.33, which is the highest number of active cases in the country, according to the Institute of Mathematical Sciences. It was 1.36 for Mizoram, 1.25 for Jammu and Kashmir, 1.09 for Andhra Pradesh and 1.06 for Maharashtra.R-value during the second waveWhen the second wave swept through the country between March to May, the R-value was 1.37 (between March 9 to April 21).From May 15-June 26, the R-value stood at 0.78. However, it slowly started increasing - it was 0.88 from June 20-July 7, 0.95 from July 3-22, 0.96 from July 24-27.It breached the value of 1.03 for the first time after the second wave during July 27-31. However, since then it has slowly started to decline.The R-value was 0.92 from August 6-9, and rose to 0.99 between August 12-14. But it slipped to 0.89 between August 14-17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-r-value-rises-amid-threat-of-third-wave-all-you-need-to-know-101630724602492.html

In an interview with ANI news agency, the minority affairs minister said that the only scripture that is followed in India is that of the Constitution, and that worshippers in mosques here are not killed by bullets and bombs, nor are girls stopped from going to the school.Also Read | Taliban may announce new government today as Panjshir puts up last stand: 10 pointsNaqvi indicated that there is a marked difference between the way India and Afghanistan are governed and thus the Taliban would do better than to speak for the Muslims in this country.“I appeal to them (the Taliban) with folded hands that spare the Muslims of India,” the minister told ANI. “Here worshipers praying in mosques are not attacked with bullets and bombs. Here girls are not stopped from going to school, their heads and legs are not cut off.”“The scripture of the governments of this country is the Constitution and the country functions following it,” Naqvi added.Notably, in an interview with BBC Urdu this week, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen had said, “As Muslims, we also have a right to raise our voice for Muslims in Kashmir, India or any other country.” The statement came as a marked contrast to what another Taliban leader, Anas Haqqani, had said in a recent interview with the CNN-News18 network: “Kashmir is not part of our jurisdiction and interference is against our policy.”Also Read | Taliban indicated they'd be reasonable in addressing Indian concerns: ShringlaZabiullah Mujahid, yet another Taliban spokesperson, had also not brought up any mention of direct interference in Kashmir and instead told a Pakistan-based channel that India and Pakistan ought to sit together to resolve all issues. Although Taliban leader Shaheen's comments raised concerns within certain sections in India that the group could now set their eyes on Jammu and Kashmir, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Friday that in the limited engagement that India has had with the Taliban, the new Afghan rulers have indicated that they would be “reasonable” in addressing New Delhi’s concerns.“Obviously, like us, they're also watching carefully and we have to watch Pakistan’s actions with a fine-tooth comb,” he told a group of Indian reporters at the end of his three-day official visit to Washington DC, indicating that India will adopt a wait-and-watch policy with regard to how the situation evolves in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-bullets-and-bombs-here-union-minister-naqvi-asks-taliban-to-spare-muslims-of-india-101630716289092.html
04-09-2021||India||'Karbi Peace Accord' to be signed today; Amit Shah, Assam CM likely to attend||The Centre is set to sign a tripartite "Karbi Peace Accord" on Saturday and the agreement is expected to be signed in presence of the Union Home Minister Amit Shah, the Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and the representatives of Karbi outfits here in the national capital, sources said.The accord is expected to be signed at the North Block office of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in the afternoon.The accord is significant as the insurgency by Karbi -- a major ethnic community of Assam -- groups, dotted by several factions and splinters, has had a long history in Assam, marked by killings, ethnic violence, abductions and taxation since the late 1980s.It is learnt that nearly 200 Karbi militants, who were part of those 1,040 militants surrendered before the Assam government on February 25 this year, will be present during the signing of the agreement, said sources.These surrendered militants are learnt to have arrived in Delhi and are staying at different hotels.Assam Chief Minister will be in New Delhi by late Friday night to participate in the tripartite peace accord.A total of 1,040 militants of five insurgent groups of Karbi Anglong district ceremonially laid down arms at an event in Guwahati on February 25 in the presence of then Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, a development which further bolsters the 'terrorism-free Assam' image of the current BJP-led government. Among the surrendered militants was Ingti Kathar Songbijit, a primary accused in multiple cases of militancy and ethnic violence in the state.The surrendered militants belong to Karbi Longri NC Hills Liberation Front (KLNLF), People's Democratic Council of Karbi Longri (PDCK), United Peoples Liberation Army (UPLA) and Kuki Liberation Front (KLF).They submitted a total of 338 weapons, including 8 light machine guns with 11,203 bullets, 11 M-16 rifles and 58 AK-47 rifles.The militants of the five organisations had come to surrender their weapons after a year when the BJP signed the Bodo Peace Accord to end the long-run violence in Bodoland. The Bodoland region is an autonomous territorial region that is administered by the elected body - Bodoland Territorial Council. The Bodo Accord was first signed in 2003 to maintain peace in the region, later it was extended by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government in 2020.These outfits originated from the core demand of forming a separate state. The Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council (KAAC) is an autonomous district council, protected under the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution.The Karbi National Volunteers (KNV) and Karbi People's Force (KPF) came together to form the United People's Democratic Solidarity (UPDS) in the late 1990s. In November 2011, UPDS gave up arms and signed a tripartite memorandum of settlement with the Centre and the Government of Assam, settling for enhanced autonomy and special packages for the KAAC. The then general secretary of the UPDS, Horen Sing Bey, is now the BJP MP from the Autonomous District Lok Sabha constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karbi-peace-accord-to-be-signed-today-amit-shah-assam-cm-likely-to-attend-101630714889566.html

04-09-2021||India||International Vulture Awareness Day: Know its history and aim||International Vulture Awareness Day (IVAD) falls on the first Saturday in September every year and is a way to show the human kind's appreciation for vultures and the ecosystem services they provide. The initiative is run jointly by the Birds of Prey Programme of the Endangered Wildlife Trust in South Africa and the Hawk Conservancy Trust in England.Through IVAD, both the organisation try to raise awareness about the threats that vultures are facing today and promote a co-ordinated international effort to publicise the conservation of vultures to a wider audience.Vultures are under severe threat in recent years, particularly due to poisoning. Globally, 75% of all vultures are threatened with extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. A new analysis of data from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and BirdLife International found that 30 per cent of 557 raptor species worldwide are considered near threatened, vulnerable or endangered or critically endangered. Eighteen species are critically endangered, including the Philippine eagle, the hooded vulture and the Annobon scops owl, the researchers found.Of threatened birds of prey that are active mostly during the day — including most hawks, eagles and vultures — 54 per cent were falling in population, the study found. The same was true for 47 per cent of threatened nocturnal raptors, such as owls.History of International Vulture Awareness DayThe International Vulture Awareness Day began in South Africa and the UK. The first IVAD was observed in September 2009. LAst yea,r the day coincided with the Teachers' Day in India on September 5.Aim of International Vulture Awareness DayThe aim of International Vulture Awareness Day is for each participating organisation to carry out their own activities that highlight vulture conservation and awareness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-vultures-awareness-day-know-its-history-and-aim-101630712237938.html

04-09-2021||India||It cannot be unending story: SC to police over delays in Religare probe||The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police to give a timeline for completing its probe into former Fortis Healthcare promoter Shivinder Mohan Singh in a case of alleged misappropriation funds of Religare Finvest Ltd.“How much time should it take to complete the investigation? It cannot be an unending story,” observed a bench headed by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana as it took a petition by Singh against cancellation of his bail in May.Appearing for Singh, senior counsel Sidharth Luthra complained that his client has been made to suffer for the inability of the EOW in completing the probe. “I (Shivinder) have been in jail for 23 months. If the agency is dragging its feet and not filing its final chargesheet, how can I be at fault? After all, this is an offence with seven years in jail as the maximum punishment. Due to this continuous incarceration, I cannot defend myself,” said Luthra.Luthra said it was not a case where an accused was never considered entitled to bail but the high court had decided to cancel the relief even though there was no change in circumstances. At this point, senior advocate R. Basant appearing for Religare, pointed out that the case related to siphoning off of around ₹2,400 crore.But the bench said the investigation must come to an end at some time and decided to issue a limited notice to the EOW. “We are not passing any order at this stage. Let the agency come and tell us when they are going to complete the investigation,” the bench told the counsel while adjourning the case by two weeks.In May, the Delhi high court had cancelled Singh’s bail, noting that his detention was necessary to unearth the “conspiracy hatched by him” and trace the alleged siphoned off money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-cannot-be-unending-story-sc-to-police-over-delays-in-religare-probe-101630711650949.html

In their complaint, the woman’s family said the accused had been harassing the deceased. The woman even complained to the youth’s family but in vain, police said.Her family registered a complaint against the 19-year-old accused, his father and one Vijay Kumar. “A case of abetment to suicide was registered.

04-09-2021||India||Bidar school sedition case: Take action against errant cops, formulate norms, says HC||Bengaluru: The Karnataka High Court (HC) on Friday directed the state home department to initiate disciplinary action against errant police officers linked with case involving a school in Bidar and also asked that guidelines be formulated to avoid a repeat of such incidents. The observations came after DL Nagesh, Bidar’s superintendent of police in his affidavit said that he has written to the Director General and Inspector General of Police to initiate action against officers who are alleged to have violated the Juvenile Justice Act. In the affidavit, Nagesh said that on examining the photographs of the said interrogation, he prima facie found that the Investigation Officer (IO) “ought to have ensured the strict compliance” of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules 2016. “I further state that the investigation officer was in mufti (not in uniform). However, the photographs show that his subordinates who are seen in the photographs were in uniform. I state that when I orally enquired, it was informed that they did not interact with any of the children and they have entered the hall only for the purpose of assisting the Investigation Officer,” Nagesh said in his affidavit. A division bench headed by acting chief justice of Karnataka, Satish Chandra Sharmaand Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum pulled up the state home department on Friday almost three weeks after the HC specifically asked the government to formulate guidelines that would serve as a law for police to follow in cases involving minors. On August 16, the court asked the concerned officials to submit an affidavit on what action they will take against the officers.Pictures of uniformed police officers allegedly carrying weapons interrogating students of classes 4, 5, and 6 at the school had gone viral on social media in January last year. The students were interrogated after Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad activist Neelesh Rakshyal in January 2020 filed a case against the school authorities over the play. Rakshyal objected to the reciting of “Hum Kaghaz Nahin Dikhayenge (we will not show our documents)”, a popular poem against the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act. He complained against the school after a parent streamed the play on a social media platform. Rakshyal accused the school of anti-national activities, spreading “negative opinion” about the law among the students, spreading “communal tension”, and “inciting the public” to oppose the legislation. The police slapped sedition charges on the school authorities and arrested a parent and teacher besides interrogating the students.“They (Karnataka home department) have submitted an affidavit saying that they will take disciplinary action. (The) court said that just stating to take action will not be enough and you (government) have to show that you have started the process and comply with the earlier order,” said one advocate for the petitioners, requesting not to be named. The petitioners moved court on February 7 last year. In their petition, the petitioners said: “In blatant violation of Rule of Law and various provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, and Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, and Rules, 2016, Responded no. 3 and 4 have interrogated the students aged merely from 9 years to 12 years of the school in Bidar, creating mental trauma and fear in the children’s state of mind.”Nagesh DL said he sent a report on August 30 to the state police chief recommending departmental inquiry in the matter.Bhagwanth Khuba, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party Member of Parliament from Bidar who has since become a Union minister, in January 2020 sought action against the school authorities while accusing them of using students to spread false information about Modi. He even suggested the blacklisting of the school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bidar-school-sedition-case-take-action-against-errant-cops-formulate-norms-says-hc-101630700060225.html
04-09-2021||India||Memorial will be built in honour of Ayothidasa Pandithar: Stalin||ChennaiA memorial will be built in honour of social reformer Ayothidasa Pandithar (1845-1914), chief minister M K Stalin announced on Friday in the Tamil Nadu assembly.Reformist leader Thanthai Periyar had hailed Pandithar as a pioneer in social reforms and rationalism, the chief minister said and recalled the quote of the 19th century reformist that divisions like caste and religion were the stumbling blocks to India’s progress.Pandithar was a writer, researcher, historian, doctor, orator and in essence a multi-faceted personality, the CM said in a statement in the House.In Tamil Nadu, no one could do politics without using the words “Tamilan and Dravidam” (Tamilian and the Dravidian land) and it was Pandithar who changed these two words into an idea that defined the political landscape of the region, he added.The reformer used these words as a weapon of wisdom and Tamil Nadu politics continued to function in the path shown by him, Stalin said.In commemoration of the 175th (birth) anniversary of Pandithar and in his honour a ‘manimandapam’ would be built in North Chennai, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/memorial-will-be-built-in-honour-of-ayothidasa-pandithar-stalin-101630698920223.html
04-09-2021||India||CBI files second charge sheet in Bengal post-poll violence case, arrests one||Kolkata: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday filed its second charge sheet in the ongoing probe into post-poll violence in West Bengal and accused four people of murdering a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker at Bhatpara in North 24 Parganas district on June 6, said lawyers aware of the development. The charge sheet was filed in the Barrackpore court. CBI also arrested a man in connection with the murder of a BJP worker’s mother in Jagaddal area of North 24 Parganas district. The victim, Shovarani Mondal, 64, was hit on the head by a stick, allegedly by Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers who came looking for her son on May 3, a day after the assembly polls results were announced. Meanwhile, the Calcutta high court on Friday said a parallel probe into offences other than murder and rape will be supervised by former chief justice of the high courts of Calcutta and Bombay, Justice (retired) Manjula Chellur. On July 19, the court ordered a CBI probe into alleged murders and rapes and a parallel probe by a special investigation team (SIT) comprising Indian Police Service (IPS) officers posted in Bengal. On Thursday, the state government named 10 officers for the SIT. CBI’s second charge sheet came within 24 hours of the first one filed at Rampurhat court in Birbhum district. The victim at Bhatpara, Jaiprakash Yadav, died in a bomb attack by motorcycle-borne assailants. One of the four CBI teams touring the state visited Yadav’s home thrice since August 26 and recorded statements of his family members and neighbours. On August 27, CBI officers asked Yadav’s family to identify the victim’s blood-soaked clothes that were kept in the custody of Bhatpara police station. “This was done because Yadav’s face was mutilated beyond recognition. The bomb hit him on the head,” a CBI officer stationed in Kolkata said on condition of anonymity. Arjun Singh, BJP Lok Sabha member from Barrackpore seat, has alleged that Yadav was murdered because he worked hard to ensure the victory of Singh’s son, Pawan, from Bhatpara assembly seat in the recent polls. A CBI team on Friday talked to the family of BJP worker Debabrata Maity, who was attacked, allegedly by TMC workers on May 3, at Nandigram in East Midnapore district. He died at SSKM Hospital in Kolkata on May 13. CBI lodged a case in this connection on August 31. The TMC on Friday commented for the first time on the ongoing probe, calling it “politically driven”. “The Calcutta high court ordered the probe on the basis of a report given by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). The report was politically biased. The CBI is only meeting families of BJP workers. It is not probing the deaths of the 13 TMC workers killed in violence,” said Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, TMC Rajya Sabha member. “The CBI and Enforcement Directorate are being used to target TMC leaders and ministers. They have not only targeted TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee but his wife as well,” said Roy, referring to the summons sent by ED to the chief minister’s nephew and his wife in the coal smuggling case. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, however, countered Roy. “What was the state police doing all these months? Why were charge sheets not filed and arrests not made? The TMC leadership is rattled because the CBI is acting tough and fast,” Ghosh said. On June 21, a five-judge bench of acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal and Justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar dismissed the state’s petition seeking recall of its June 18 order that asked the NHRC to probe the allegations of violence. Dismissing the plea for recall, Justice Bindal observed that the conduct of the state did not inspire confidence of the court. In its report, the NHRC panel slammed the state government saying the violence “shows a pernicious politico-bureaucratic-criminal nexus”. It recommended a CBI probe and said trials should be conducted outside Bengal. The NHRC report said at least 1,934 police complaints were lodged between May 2 and June 20. These included 29 murder charges, 12 complaints relating to rape and sexual assault and 940 complaints of loot and arson. The report said that out of the 9,304 people named as accused, less than 3% are currently in jail. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee dismissed the NHRC report, calling it distorted. The high court on July 19 ordered a CBI probe into all allegations of post-poll murder and rape and asked the agency to file its report in six weeks. CBI has so far registered more than 30 cases in the districts and one murder case in Kolkata. The agency has formed four teams for the probe, with each team comprising deputy inspector generals and superintendents from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Karnataka and other states. Every team is headed by a joint director. The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is providing security for the officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-files-second-charge-sheet-in-bengal-post-poll-violence-case-arrests-one-101630698081228.html
04-09-2021||India||Visva-Bharati students move protest away from VC residence after HC order||Students of West Bengal’s Visva-Bharati University ended their agitation outside the campus residence of vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty on Friday afternoon after the Calcutta high court, while virtually hearing a plea from the university, passed a strongly worded order asking the local police to remove the agitators after 4 pm.“All demonstrations, banners, barricades and obstruction outside the residence of the vice-chancellor shall be forthwith removed by the officer-in-charge, Santiniketan police station. The vice-chancellor of the university in addition to his own security guards shall also be provided with three constables from the Santiniketan police station for his protection,” Justice Rajasekhar Mantha said in his order, a copy of which HT has been.Set up in 1921 by Rabindranath Tagore at Santiniketan in Bolpur town in Birbhum district, Visva-Bharati is Bengal’s only central university and the Prime Minister is its chancellor. The agitation had been going on since August 28 when three students were expelled on disciplinary ground. The VC was confined to his on-campus residence since then as the students blocked the gates.Asking the police to break all locks allegedly placed by the students, the order said, “No demonstration shall be conducted by any students or any persons within a distance of 50 metres of any portion or part of the university, particularly, the schools, classrooms, the residence of the vice-chancellor, teachers, professors, officials, staff library, the administrative buildings laboratories etc.”The judge also banned the use of loudspeakers on campus and said no teacher or employee can be prevented from entering any department or office. He also ordered the police to stop outsiders from entering the campus.“This court notes with anguish that the functioning of a university, which grooms the citizens of the future, has been disrupted,” the order said.Soumya Majumder, the university’s lawyer, told the court that the VC was wrongfully confined. He added that the VC was unwell but doctors were not allowed to examine him.“The students are being used as a front by some influential persons,” said Majumdar.Appearing for the state, advocate Amitesh Banerjee denied the allegations and said the VC was never prevented from moving in and out of his residence. He said medical officers sent by the state to examine the VC were refused entry by his family.Advocate Shamim Ahmed, who represented the agitators, told the court that the three students were expelled in violation of rules and were not given any opportunity to appeal. The advocate also accused the VC of functioning in a high-handed manner against the former registrar and some professors and teachers.Justice Mantha observed during the hearing that a students’ agitation cannot resemble a trade union movement, said advocate Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee, who represented the university.The judge said he will hear all the parties on September 8.By late afternoon, the students moved the stage of their agitation 50 metres away from their previous location and started a fresh protest sans loudspeakers.“Our movement will continue,” said Rupa Chakraborty, one of the agitators.Visva-Bharati did not make any statement till 9 pm.Members of the Students Federation of India (SFI), the students’ wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), are spearheading the agitation.The agitators regularly sent food items and vegetables for the VC and his family but he refused to accept these. After Chakraborty lodged a police complaint on August 30, four constables and a sub-inspector were deployed outside his home. The VC has been ordering food online since Wednesday.The three students, who were suspended in January last year, took part in agitations against several actions taken by Chakrabarty and visits by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders such as Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta in 2020 and Union home minister Amit Shah before the March-April assembly polls.The SFI has alleged that the VC was acting on behalf of the Rashtriya Shayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The BJP state leadership, however, reacted to anti-RSS posters put up on the campus.In January last year, there was a students’ protest when Swapan Dasgupta was invited by the authorities to speak on the Citizenship Amendment Act at a seminar.A month later, Chakrabarty triggered a controversy when he said those who gather at Delhi’s Rajghat donning white caps on Gandhi Jayanti are “the country’s biggest thieves.”A section of faculty and staff members are also unhappy with the VC as disciplinary action and suspension orders have been passed against many of them over the past two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visvabharati-student-move-protest-away-from-vc-residence-after-hc-order-101630697240134.html
04-09-2021||India||TDP seeks NHRC intervention into arrests of protesting party workers||Hyderabad: Days after police action against some of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) workers protesting against rising fuel prices, the party on Friday wrote to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), urging it to order a probe into alleged human rights violations of peaceful protesters in Andhra Pradesh.In his letter, TDP Politburo member Varla Ramaiah asked the NHRC to take action against officials responsible for the “deterioration of law and order” in the state, ruled by chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s YSR Congress Party (YSRCP). Ramaiah alleged that the state government and police violated people’s fundamental right to speech and expression. “They were suppressing all voices of dissent and scuttling democracy at every step. If the erring officers were not made accountable to their suppressive actions, they would cause further erosion of democratic values in the state,” read Ramaiah’s letter.On August 28, TDP workers staged a protest against the rising prices of petrol, diesel, and essential commodities, and raised slogans against the state government and CM Reddy. Police arrested several workers of the opposition party at various places.“Several FIRs were registered against TDP leaders in Kotabommali, Dendulur, Pulivendula and Bommanahal police stations. More FIRs were registered in order to threaten people from expressing their dissent in a peaceful manner,” Ramaiah said in the letter.One of the TDP leaders to be arrested was former MLA from Denduluru seat Chintamaneni Prabhakar, who was reportedly taken into custody while he was attending a wedding. Earlier, TDP national president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu also wrote to the state’s director general of police Gautam Sawang to release his party members. He claimed that the protests were held in a peaceful manner, by adhering to Covid-19 guidelines. He further claimed that the ruling party “unleashed” its police force to arrest TDP leaders, cadre and the general public.The ruling YSRCP, however, dismissed the TDP’s allegations, saying law was taking its due course on this issue. YSRCP spokesperson and Denduluru MLA Abbaya Chowdary Kothari said Chintamaneni Prabhakar had staged a protest with 150 people and disturbed a government review meeting. The ruling YSRCP is numerically in a strong position after it won 151 out of the state’s 175 assembly seats and 23 out of 25 Lok Sabha constituencies in the 2019 general and state elections.Stating that Prabhakar has 74 cases registered against him for various offences, Kothari claimed the TDP leader has a history of attacking government officials, including police personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tdp-seeks-nhrc-intervention-into-arrests-of-protesting-party-workers-101630696280118.html

Almost all districts are suffering the scarcity. The Centre has been asked to provide more vaccine doses for the smooth continuation of the drive,” George said.Pointing out that many people are reluctant to take Covaxin, she said there is no need to worry about receiving the country’s indigenous jab and both vaccines are effective as well as safe.George said the state has achieved another target in the vaccine drive as 75% of people, aged above 18 years, have been given the first dose.This would comprise 2,15,27,035 people of the total 30.58 million population of the state, she said, adding that of them, 27.74% people (79,60,935) had received the second dose also.According to the estimated population of 2021, it is 60.81% and 22.49% respectively. With this, a total of 2,94,87,970 people have received either the first dose or both doses of vaccine. “Over 86 lakh (8.6 million) doses could be given in the month of August alone. The government is aiming to complete the vaccination of those aged above 18 years this month itself. This requires more vaccine doses,” the minister added.Kerala’s overall Covid cases breached 4.1 million as its consistently high daily numbers showed no signs of a let-up, with the state once again witnessing over 30,000 new infections on Thursday.The state, which recorded the country’s first coronavirus case in early 2020, reported 32,097 new COVID-19 infections and 188 deaths on Thursday, which pushed the total infection count to 41,22,133 and the fatalities to 21,149.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-facing-vaccine-shortage-asked-centre-for-more-doses-health-minister-101630696225184.html
04-09-2021||India||NIA files charge sheet against ‘IS member’||Bengaluru The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday filed a supplementary charge sheet in a special court here against a suspected ISIS terrorist for his alleged involvement in collecting and supplying arms and ammunition in Mumbai as part of a larger conspiracy of the terror group, an official said.Shihabudeen has been charged under sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Arms Act and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.The case was registered in January last year in Bengaluru against Mehboob Pasha, a resident of Bengaluru’s Gurappanapalya, and 16 others.Pasha, in association with Khaja Moideen who is accused in several cases registered in Tamil Nadu related to terrorism and murder of Hindu leaders, formed a terrorist gang by recruiting young Muslims in south India, the official of the premier investigation agency said.They formed the Al-Hind module and selected Bengaluru as their base and conducted several criminal conspiracy meetings in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu since April, 2019, the NIA official said.They had propagated the ideology of the proscribed terrorist organisation, the Islamic State or the ISIS, and conspired to collect arms and explosives for murdering police officers and Hindu leaders, the official said.Shihabudeen was part of the larger conspiracy and on the directions of Moideen, he had collected and handed over arms and ammunition to other accused in Mumbai, the NIA official said.These arms were further used in the murder of Special Sub-Inspector Wilson of the Tamil Nadu Police, the official said, adding that further investigation in the case was underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-files-charge-sheet-against-is-member-101630696160782.html
04-09-2021||India||Chennithala bats for Chandy amid row over new leadership of KPCC||Kottayam The two powerful groups in the state Congress -- one headed by Ramesh Chennithala and another by Oommen Chandy -- joined hands here on Friday to launch a scathing attack on the new leadership of the KPCC headed by its chief K Sudhakaran and leader of opposition in the state Assembly V D Satheesan over their “arrogant” style of functioning.Expressing displeasure over the new leadership for ignoring him and Chandy in organisational matters particularly in the selection of 14 DCC chiefs, Chennithala described himself as “just a four annas (25 paise)” member of the party but said Chandy was a senior leader and AICC general secretary and all the decisions of the state Congress should be taken after consulting with him.A day after the Congress leadership asserted in Kannur that PCC chief K Sudhakaran will be the “last word” on organisational matters in the state and spoke about bringing discipline in the party, Chennithala took a dig at the new leadership, indicating that many of them had violated discipline in the past and asked what would happen, if it is implemented retrospectively.“I am not saying that matters in the Congress should be discussed with me. I am just a four annas (25 paise) member of the party. But Oommen Chandy is the general secretary of AICC. So (they) have an obligation to discuss the matters with him,” the Haripad MLA said at a party function here in which Nattakom Suresh took charge as Kottayam DCC president.Attacking the style of functioning of the current leadership led by Sudhakaran and V D Satheesan, Chennithala said when he and Chandy led the Congress for 17 years, they had never used the language of “arrogance”.“When we got the power (in the organisation), we never used the language of arrogance. Instead we carried all the people together. We had put party interest over personal interest,” said Chennithala, who is also the former leader of opposition in the state assembly.At this stage, it is the responsibility of the leadership to hold all in the party together, he said.Chennithala also criticised the new leadership for branding him as a senior Congress leader, saying he was not a veteran and was only 64.In an apparent dig at PCC chief Sudhakaran, who is 73, he said those who have crossed the age of 74 or 75 are calling him senior leader.Attacking the new power centre in the state Congress, senior leader K C Joseph said no one came forward to help Chandy when he came under cyber attack recently.Joseph, who is a strong supporter of Chandy, also flayed the KPCC decision to suspend former MLA K Sivadasan Nair from the Congress in the name of party discipline.Nair and former KPCC general secretary K P Anilkumar were suspended temporarily early this week for publicly expressing displeasure over the selection of the party’s district chiefs by the All India Congress Committee.Although Chandy was not present at the function held in Kottayam on Friday, it became a venue of joint protest by both the ‘A’ group headed by Chandy and ‘I’ group led by Chennithala against the new power centre in the state Congress.The two groups have been active in the state unit since the times of veteran leader K Karunakaran and senior leader AK Antony.The KPCC leadership refused to react to the comments of Chennithala at Kottayam, the stronghold of Chandy.“No comments,” Satheesan said when the issues raised by Chennithala were brought to his notice by the media. He, however, asserted that Sudhakaran will have the last word on organisational matters in the state Congress.The development comes even as the central leadership of the party was trying to mollify Chandy and Chennithala describing them as the “pillars of the party” in Kerala.AICC general secretary (in-charge Kerala), Tariq Anwar has said all decisions on organisational matters will be taken after consulting them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennithala-bats-for-chandy-amid-row-over-new-leadership-of-kpcc-101630696105933.html
04-09-2021||India||Siddaramaiah urges Karnataka government not to implement NEP||Bengaluru: The intention behind the new decision to implement the new National Education Policy (NEP) is to indoctrinate students with the idea of communalism through education, said senior Congress leader and Leader of Opposition in Karnataka assembly Siddaramaiah on Friday. “It (NEP) promotes privatization leading to inequality and social injustice. The intention is to indoctrinate students with the idea of communalism through education. NEP is unscientific and will push lakhs of students to darkness,” read a communication from the former chief minister’s office. Siddaramaiah asked the government to withdraw the implementation of the policy, adding that NEP infringes upon the autonomy of states over education and universities. The former chief minister was responding to a letter written by the office of minister of higher education C N Ashwath Narayan informing about the implementation of the new National Education Policy and seeking an appointment with the Leader of Opposition to discuss the same. “It is to be noted that the government has already decided and inaugurated to implement the said policy from the current academic year, without any discussion with the students, teachers, education experts or opposition. It is not correct to call for discussion now after inaugurating the implementation,” Siddaramaiah said in his letter to Narayan. Claiming that detailed deliberations should have been initiated democratically before drafting such issues with wide implications, Siddaramaiah added, “India has a high student-to-teacher ratio which should come down for the benefit of students. Also, the government allocation for education as a percentage of GDP is very low. The NEP also recommends the allocation to education to be at 6% of GDP. So then Karnataka should allocate about ₹1.08 lakh crore,” read his letter. Suggesting that the government should have discussed and debated these issues before the implementation since NEP decides the future of many students shaping their next 70-80 years, Siddaramaiah said that the implementation of NEP is a violation of federal arrangements and infringes upon the autonomy of states over education and universities. “Education is a tool for social elevation for many marginalized sections. Has BJP implemented NEP to prevent this elevation of social status among marginalized sections?... If there has to be a debate about NEP in good spirit, I urge the government to withdraw the implementation of NEP immediately and we will come for discussion about that. If, after deliberations, NEP is found to be good, we will support the government to implement NEP,” he added.

04-09-2021||India||Bommai faces quota, caste census challenges from dominant groups||Bengaluru The dominant communities in Karnataka have started to mobilize support on the promises made by the Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) on reservation as well the contentious caste census. The Vokkaliga-Lingayat-Veerashaiva Sourdha Vedike, a collective group of people from the two dominant communities are holding a meeting on Saturday in Bengaluru to assert their demands not to release the findings of the 2015 caste census report commissioned by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government. “We (Lingayats and Vokkaligas) have always been number one and two (in terms of percentage of population) and they (Siddaramaiah) have made it into fourth and fifth,” BS Nataraj, the convener of the forum said. The statements come at a time when extremely backward and marginalized caste groups have openly demanded that the government don’t accede to the Panchamasali, the largest sub-sect of the Lingayats, who are seeking to be included to the 2A category as well release the findings of the 2015 caste census. The Panchamasali have threatened to revive their stir post September 15 if their demands of being reclassified into 2A is not fulfilled by the BJP government as promised by former chief minister BS Yediyurappa. It also leaves Bommai with difficult choices to make as he has to find a middle ground between the two demands as it includes communities who have traditionally backed the BJP and those that the saffron party is actively pursuing to enhance its chances of returning to power on its own in 2023 . Nataraj said that the state government does not have the powers to conduct such a survey and that it comes under the Centre to do so. He added that there should be an inquiry on where the Siddaramaiah government spent ₹160 crore which it allegedly claims was the cost of the month-long exercise. MC Venugopal, the president of the The Athi Hindulida Vargagala Jagruthi Vedike, on Friday said that though everyone in society has the right to demand better reservation status, it can be done so only after the findings are released. “This report has been made by spending around ₹160 crore of the tax payers money. How can it not be released without even discussing it or knowing its contents,” Venugopal said. The forum has even taken the legal route to get the data released and have secured the backing of former chief minister Siddaramaiah who himself has a lot to gain from mobilising more backward communities under his AHINDA (Kannada acronym for minorities, backward classes and Dalits) support base. The case is scheduled to come up on September 8.The Panchamasali had earlier demanded that a member of their community be chosen to replace Yediyurappa as chief minister but the BJP chose Bommai, who is from a smaller sub-sect (Sadar) of the Lingayats, aggravating the community and its seers. On Friday, Congress leader MB Patil said that they will mobilize support to revive the separate minority religion status for the Lingayats which was initiated just before the 2018 assembly elections. Siddaramaiah had approved to accord a minority religion status on the Lingayats, which analysts and political leaders said was aimed at splitting one of the biggest support base of the BJP before the 2018 polls. However, the decision to distinguish between Lingayats and Veershaiva, terms which are used interchangeably and also the latter as a sub-sect, had proved costly for Siddaramaiah and the Congress who lost power in the assembly elections. “After the elections (2023) we will move forward together,” Patil said on Friday.Speaking to reporters at his palatial home in Sadashivnagar, one of Bengaluru’s most expensive residential localities, he said that there were very poor sections within the Lingayat and its 99 sub-sects and demanded that the community be included under 2A category. He said that there is no relation between the Lingayat agitation and the Congress. “There is no middle ground as such for Bommai. It will be more beneficial for the BJP to not antagonize the two dominant communities (Vokkaliga and Lingayats) than the fragmented backward classes,” said one Bengaluru-based political analyst, requesting not to be named. He said that the backward classes are also not known to support any political party en masse and the BJP stands to benefit from continuing its strategy of backing the demands of the dominant groups and refrain from releasing the findings of the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bommai-faces-quota-caste-census-challenges-from-dominant-groups-101630695863154.html
04-09-2021||India||Madras HC asks police to quiz EPS, Sasikala in Kodanad case||Chennai The Madras high court on Friday asked the police in Nilgiris district to summon former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami, V K Sasikala, and others for examination before a trial court, which is hearing the 2017 Kodanad Estate heist-cum-murder case, which has come to haunt the former CM, who accidentally came to the top post after J Jayalalithaa’s death and solidified his position in the AIADMK.After the party’s defeat in the assembly elections, the four-month-old DMK government closing in on him on cases related to his regime and the 2017 Kodanad Estate heist-cum-murder case is the latest among them.The usually cool-headed Palaniswami has been visibly anxious since the Niligiris police last month questioned a key accused, K V Sayan, who has previously linked Palaniswami with the case. Since then, the Nilgiris district police formed a special team to further investigate the case. And the Niligiris sessions court on Thursday granted four weeks’ time for the prosecution to submit a report on the status of the inquiry.Palaniswami in at least two press interactions has been constantly telling reporters that Stalin is out to frame him in the case. “I’m hearing from reporters that they took a secret statement from Sayan to frame me and others,” he said. The AIADMK walked out of the assembly over this issue, protested, and complained to the governor. In a step ahead, an AIADMK functionary who is a prosecution witness filed a plea in court seeking for the further investigation in the case to be stopped which the court denied. “Palaniswami is taking legal aid in the case,” said a senior AIADMK leader close to him and not wishing to be named. The party is rattled. “They’re giving him (Palaniswami) mental torture,” AIADMK spokesperson D Jayakumar told reporters last week. Palaniswami who was on the periphery of politics came into the limelight and directly occupied the chief minister’s chair in a coup led by Jayalalithaa’s close aide VK Sasikala who wanted the post for herself but had to hand it in to someone she trusted after being convicted in February 2017 in the disproportionate assets case. In the party where Jayalalithaa was the only power centre and Sasikala managed it all behind the scenes, the latter’s absence gave room to several factions, particularly the one led by deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam. Even as Palaniswami and Panneerselvam have kept Sasikala out and the party together with their dual leadership, the factions are still not fully settled.Palaniswami comes from a humble background with no mentor is politics and hails from a Gounder (Other Backward Class) farmer family in Salem in the western region of Tamil Nadu. During his four years as chief minister, he nurtured his community and leaders from the west within the party that challenged the predominant community of Mukkalathors to which Panneerselvam and Sasikala belong. These moves ensured that Panneerselvam, who was Jayalalithaa’s choice for chief minister thrice in her absence due to being jailed and hospitalised, became sidelined. The tension between the two spilled over publicly several times but somehow the decisions always went in Palaniswami’s favour. He was the AIADMK’s CM candidate and when they lost, he got the next best position, the leader of opposition.“Despite so many problems and factionalism, Palaniswami consolidated his position and he even managed to bring Panneerselvam to his side,” says political analyst Maalan Narayanan. “Even in future polls, he is the only contender for Stalin, so they would want to weaken him. But not all that is happening is purely political. In the Kodanad case, there are glaring gaps in investigations.”The sensational case refers to the break-in at Jayalalithaa’s 900-acre tea estate in Kodanad in April 2017, which had resulted in the murder of a security guard and several other mysterious deaths. The timing of the crime is also intriguing as it happened following Jayalalithaa’s death in a Chennai hospital in December 2016 and Sasikala’s imprisonment in February 2017 in the disproportionate assets case and when Palaniswami was chief minister. He had told the assembly the day after the incident that it was a case of robbery gone wrong. “The AIADMK cadre are still concerned over Jayalalithaa’s death so if the investigation proves that Palaniswami had a hand in the Kodanad case, he is doomed forever. If he’s proved innocent, he can once again solidify his place that DMK was targeting him. But I don’t think the DMK would have walked into this without having some strong clues,” said Narayanan. Stalin has also played this subtly. While he hasn’t openly criticised Palaniswami, the government agencies are going about anti-corruption raids and conducting fresh investigations. In the assembly, Stalin has dismissed allegations that this is out of political vendetta and justified that this is the DMK’s poll promise to bring the culprits to book. “We are not bringing up any new cases, are we? They’re paying for their actions over the last 10 years,” said a DMK leader not wishing to be named.After the DMK settled down after firefighting the second wave of Covid-19, the action began when the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) began to file corruption cases against former AIADMK ministers, including Palaniswami’s close aide SP Velumani (ex municipal administration minister). The AIADMK began to get jittery and formed a special legal team to advise their party leaders who they said were being targeted by DMK out of political vendetta. “Palaniswami and Velumani are from the western region which is the weak link for the DMK,” says Naraynana. “So their targets have started from the western region to neutralise AIADMK’s power.” A speculation making the rounds is that the DMK would prefer to have Panneerselvam compared to the stronger Palaniswami as the lone leader of the AIADMK. “It could be possible,” says Narayanan. “MGR once called DMK an evil force. And they’ve continued to criticise the DMK but Panneerselvam isn’t highly critical and he has gone to the extent of even praising the DMK. But Palaniswami continues to speak from an anti-DMK stance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-asks-police-to-quiz-eps-sasikala-in-kodanad-case-101630695862076.html
04-09-2021||India||35% increase in private vehicles on Bengaluru roads: Officials||Bengaluru: The Bengaluru city police is grappling to control vehicular traffic as the city continues to witness a steady rise in the usage of private vehicles. According to an informal survey conducted by the Bengaluru police, there is a 35% increase in the number of private vehicles on the road post lockdown, said joint commissioner of police(traffic) BR Ravikante Gowda on Thursday. The joint commissioner also added that the increased traffic along with various civic works continuing across the city, the job of traffic policemen has increased exponentially. “Except for east Bengaluru, in all divisions, the traffic is back to normal. Our officers are reporting that there is a considerable increase in the number of private vehicles. Although we did not conduct a formal study, an informal survey conducted across the city showed an increase of 35% in the number of vehicles on the road. There is a huge increase in the number of two-wheelers,” said Gowda. Gowda added that during their recent interaction with commuters, many had expressed concerns over using public transport. “Because of the pandemic, people are hesitant to use public transport. The Metro and BMTC are yet to pick up numbers. In Bengaluru, commute is already dominated by private transport and the pandemic has increased those numbers. We are trying to spread awareness,” he said. The data shared by the state transport department shows that the total number of vehicles registered in Bengaluru has nearly breached the 10 million mark as of January 2021, despite the pandemic and lockdown. Out of these, 6.4 million are two-wheelers, and 2.3 million are private cars. Bengaluru which added about 600,000 new vehicles each year since 2018, added nearly over 1.1million vehicles in 2020-21, which is double the number. Despite this increase in vehicular population, the number of traffic policemen in the city remains understaffed. The number of traffic police in Bengaluru has been below its sanctioned strength and according to a study by the Bureau of Police Reforms and Development (BPR&D), the sanctioned strength of traffic police in several cities in the country, including Bengaluru, should be much higher than the current numbers. According to official records, the Bengaluru traffic police have a sanctioned strength of 5,262 personnel to regulate traffic across 44,000 intersections and they are 600 men short of the sanctioned strength. The joint commissioner said that there was indeed a shortage of staff in the department and the government is trying to fill the gap at the earliest. “...but over the years we have increased the use of the technology in our enforcement, which has been a boon for us. The various cameras across the city have been instrumental in capturing more than 50% of the city’s traffic violations,” Gowda said. While the top brass relies on technology, traffic policemen in the city say technology has its shortfalls, especially in traffic management. “There are around 44,000 intersections in the city. Out of this, there are only 388 junctions with signals and only around 500 have policemen manning them. Deployment is stretched in the outskirts of the city, and it becomes difficult to manage all major roads. We believe if we are able to regulate traffic on more roads and intersections the traffic situation can be improved,” said a senior officer in the traffic department. Meanwhile, civic experts say there is a need to create a new system in Bengaluru rather than going back to the old days of traffic jams. V Ravichandar, a civic expert said that the city should and will have a ‘5 km city’ in the coming days. “The work from home culture will enable people to work and live in a 5km radius. Such a system will make Bengaluru a pandemic-proof city to some extent. One thing this pandemic has taught us is that cases happen in bubbles and travel results in the spread,” he added. He said that a combination of hybrid work culture (combination of work from home and office) and removal of the need for cross-city travel would not only decongest Bengaluru but also improve reliance on public transport. “Once the need for long-distance travel within the city is limited, we will see people walking or using cycles more in the 5 km hubs,” Ravichandar added. Such a move, however, requires a change in the government’s thought process. Ravichandar has urged that the city’s master plan be relooked with a new outlook.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/35-increase-in-private-vehicles-on-bengaluru-roads-officials-101630695800757.html
04-09-2021||India||Drug resistance to fungal infections increasing: ICMR report||There has been a sustained increase in drug-resistant pathogens, according to the latest annual report of the Antimicrobial Resistance Research and Surveillance Network released on Friday, which surveys infections in large hospitals, and has found an increase in the number of cases that were hard to treat with currently used antimicrobials. The findings reinforce concerns around the overuse of antimicrobials and found that one of the pathogen that showed increased drug resistance in the study is also one that causes secondary infection in many serious Covid-19 cases. The pathogens include klebsiella pneumoniae (that causes pneumonia) and acinetobacter baumannii (that cause pneumonia, urinary tract infection) -- these are usually found at tertiary care hospitals.  The study, however, also highlighted a slight recovery in susceptibility of one of the most commonly found pathogens -- E Coli -- to Imipenem, one of the broad-spectrum antibiotic drugs (that act against wide range of disease-causing pathogens), from 63% in 2019 to 72% in 2020. “This is only a slight recovery and that too for one antimicrobial. On the other hand, we also have pathogens such as acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae in which drug resistance has been increasing. This is especially concerning because K pneumoniae is the commonest pathogen causing secondary infection in Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Kamini Walia, a scientist with the epidemiology and communicable diseases department at ICMR. The report, which is based on 60,000 isolates collected from 30 tertiary care centres across Delhi, categorises the highly drug-resistant pathogens into three groups and provides actionable steps on how to treat each of the pathogen and how to prevent the spread of the infection within hospitals. The report further warned against a surge in fungal infections, including those due to rare species, among hospitalised patients. “There are several factors as to why we are seeing an increase in fungal infections – there is an increase in antibiotic and steroid use, the patients with co-morbidities are living longer because of better medical care, there is an increase in immunosuppression therapies and the changing environment. Most fungi used to thrive at 25oC, however, they seem to be overcoming the temperature barrier and infecting humans. There used to be 200 species of fungi that caused human infections when I was studying, now we have more than 700 to 800 species,” said Dr Arunaloke Chakrabarti, head of the department of microbiology at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh. The study, which was conducted during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, does not mention mucormycosis -- a fungal infection that shot up among Covid-19 patients during the second wave of the pandemic earlier this year.“This report pertains to last year when the problem of mucormycosis was not as acute,” said Dr Walia. “There is a lot of emphasis on candida due to which most centres were sending those isolates; not many were sending in isolates of mycelial fungi and mucormycosis is a mycelial fungi,”  Chakrabarti added. Asked whether the indiscriminate use of antibiotics such as azithromycin and doxycycline during the pandemic will lead to more resistance in the future, Walia said, “Changes due to such overuse of antibiotics happen at a molecular level, it takes time for us to see the phenotypic changes. Also, the overuse of these antibiotics happened at a community level, our report focuses on hospital-based infections.” The report calls for urgent antibiotic stewardship programmes in hospitals to cut down on unnecessary prescription of antimicrobials and a diagnostic stewardship to ensure that appropriate antimicrobials are used after identifying the pathogen to reduce antibiotic pressure on the pathogens that is the key driver of antimicrobial resistance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drug-resistance-to-fungal-infections-increasing-icmrreport-101630695321440.html
04-09-2021||India||India capable of becoming global green hydrogen exporter: Jitendra Singh||India has the geographic advantage and potential to switch from a net fossil energy importer to a clean energy exporter with focus on green hydrogen, science and technology minister Jitendra Singh said on Friday.Speaking at a climate summit organised by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Singh said projections for potential demand for green hydrogen by 2030 show global annual export potential for green hydrogen was expected to be around 10.4 million tonnes in East Asia and European Union, which is a $20-billion market.“We are one of the first nations of the world that has a green hydrogen mission. Green hydrogen can be produced with solar energy to split water in an electrolyser with oxygen as only by-product. The abundance of solar irradiance and water in India is an advantage with us. Green hydrogen can help India to become self-reliant in our energy needs at the same time keeping our commitment on climate change,” Singh said, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi while referring to various subjects during his Independence Day speech repeatedly underlined the importance of technology and hydrogen.“When we talk of climate change and green hydrogen we have to understand the responsibility that India has. World is looking up to India as a country which can play a frontline role. We with a huge population, unless India participates in the fight against climate change, the world will not be able to achieve optimum results. More than 65% of our population is below the age of 40 years and incidentally more than 90% of our energy demand is met by imported fossil fuel and therefore the problem of climate change in the world cannot be resolved unless India reduces its emissions, which is both a responsibility and obligation to the world,” he said.Singh added that in spite of our renewable energy increasing, renewable electricity can help abatement of only 45% to 50% of the carbon dioxide emissions. He said India can have an aspirational goal of ‘Hydrogen 212’ where green hydrogen generation cost is of less than $2 per kg; hydrogen storage plus refuelling cost of less than $1 per kg and replacement of end use technology with green hydrogen technology in less than 2 years.After finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the launch of a hydrogen mission in February, Ulka Kelkar, director, Climate Program, World Resources Institute, India, had said, “The Hydrogen Energy Mission will be critical because hydrogen may be the only way to have zero carbon emissions from heavy industries like cement and steel - provided that hydrogen is produced by electrolysis from renewable electricity.”PM Modi in his Independence Day speech said green hydrogen production and exports will lead India towards a clean energy transition. “Green Hydrogen is the future of the world. Today, I announce the setting up of the National Hydrogen Mission. We have to make India a global Hub for green hydrogen production and export,” the PM had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-capable-of-becoming-global-green-hydrogen-exporter-jitendra-singh-101630695140702.html
04-09-2021||India||Centre defends new IT rules in 2 HC affidavits||The Union government have filed two counter-affidavits before the Madras High Court, defending the constitutional validity of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 or IT Rules, and said that “common users are protected”. The government was responding to two different petitions challenging the IT Rules, 2021 and pending in the Madras HC --one filed by Carnatic vocalist and Ramon Magsaysay awardee TM Krishna and the other by the Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) comprising 13 media outlets and journalist Mukund Padmanabhan. The Madras high court had disapproved of the Centre’s repeated delay in filing the counter. On August 25, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) filed the counter stating that the delay was because they wanted to ensure ‘consistent defence’ as there are various challenges before different High Courts across the country which had challenged different parts of the new IT Rules. There are a total of 19 writ petitions pending across high courts in the country and each emanate out of a unique set of circumstances, the MEITY submitted. But all cases commonly seek to declare the IT Rules 2021 ultra vires the Constitution and the IT Act, 2000, the ministry noted. MeitY defended the new rules while the Ministry for Information and Broadcasting (MIB) filed a separate 115-page counter-affidavit on August 26 supporting the stance of the former ministry seeking to dismiss the petitions. MeitY said that there is no chilling effect on speech and expression as it does not impose any penalties on users who post content in contravention of the IT Rules. The 23 page affidavit also said that the right to privacy is not absolute and when an “important countervailing interest is shown to be superior, the right to privacy can be intruded upon.”The only ramification is the removal of such content or the termination of user’s access by the intermediary, which may be challenged by the user under the grievance redressal mechanism specifically set out in the IT Rules or by way of judicial review, the affidavit read. The affidavit added that content can be removed only if it is unlawful and after a court order and after being notified by the authorised agency. “No other executive other than the appropriate government or its agency is empowered to issue an order for removal of content,” it assured.The affidavit said that the IT Rules 2021 were in consonance with the Constitution of India and the notion “welfare of the people is the supreme law” has been taken into prime consideration while framing the rules. “Businesses must be legally complaint to the law of the land,” the affidavit said, asking the court to dismiss the petitions. Expanding on this, the MIB in its affidavit submitted that it’s well within the scope of the Information Technology Act (IT Act), 2000 and the Constitution.The Madras HC’s first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice PD Audikesavalu posted the next hearing in the case for September 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-defends-new-it-rules-in-2-hc-affidavits-101630695080769.html
04-09-2021||India||Fill up 6,000 vacant teaching posts on mission mode by October: Minister to VCs||In his first formal interaction with the vice-chancellors (VCs) of around 45 central universities on Friday, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan urged them to fill up the 6,000-odd vacant teaching posts on a ‘mission mode’ by October. In a veiled reference to the students’ protests, the minister also asked the VCs to be “accommodative” and “flexible” in the democratic set-ups of universities.During a virtual interaction, Pradhan informed the VCs that 6,229 teaching posts were lying vacant across the central universities. Of them, 1,012 are in Scheduled Caste category, 592 Scheduled Tribe, 1,767 other backward classes (OBC), 805 economically weaker sections and 350 in Divyang (people with disabilities) categories.“We urge all the universities to fill up these 6,000-odd posts in a mission mode between September and October. Let’s do that in a campaign mode. All the central universities should publish the advertisement of their vacancies by next week,” Pradhan said.Emphasising that various stakeholders have to be “accommodative” and “flexible” in a democratic set up of universities in the country, Pradhan said there should not be any compromise on teaching and learning. Even as he did not name any university, the minister’s comment came a day after he intervened to resolve the ongoing crisis at the Visva-Bharati University in West Bengal, and advised the administration to form an internal committee to have a dialogue with students, who were agitating over the rustication of three students in connection with an act of vandalism and misconduct that took place on the campus in January.“We all, at some point of time, have been students. There will be students’ rebellion at the campuses. But everyone has to work with discipline and under the Constitutional framework. We have to be a little accommodative and flexible in a democracy. However, there cannot be any compromise with teaching and learning. The VCs are custodians of the University and they should take care of it,” Pradhan told VCs.A vice-chancellor, who attended the meeting, said Pradhan told all university heads to “encourage all kinds of ideas and views” on their campuses. “The minister asked the VCs to create a space where all kinds of views and ideas are encouraged. He said there may be some incidents of student protests or agitation over any issue at the campuses, but the academic work should not get hampered because of it,” the VC said, adding that universities have also been asked to keep the ministry “in loop” in case there is any “untoward incident” reported on campus.The minister also said that VCs should play “pioneering roles” in outlining plans to implement several initiatives under the new National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, including four-year undergraduate programmes, multiple entry-exit points, and academic banks of credits, among others. He encouraged the universities to offer Japanese language as an additional skill subject to enhance the “employability” of students.During the interaction, universities updated the ministry about their plans of implementing the NEP-2020. “Over 40 universities informed that they have started implementing several initiatives including the introduction of the academic bank of credits that will allow students to earn credits for different courses,” a senior ministry official said.Minister lauds JNU courseMeanwhile, Pradhan appreciated Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) for introducing a new course on counter-terrorism meant for engineering students, and lauded VC Jagadesh Kumar for the initiative.“Recently a colleague from the Parliament wrote to me asking why JNU has introduced a course on terrorism. Our engineers today are not just engineers. They are involved in building social products. So, if a course helps engineering students understand the kind of hindrances they could face, then I congratulate JNU VC Jagadesh Kumar and his team for introducing such a course,” Pradhan said.After JNU’s decision to introduce a course titled ‘Counter Terrorism, Asymmetric Conflicts and Strategies for Cooperation among Major Powers’, Communist Party of India’s (CPI) Rajya Sabha member Binoy Viswam on Tuesday wrote to Pradhan demanding the course must not be allowed to be taught.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fill-up-6-000-vacant-teaching-posts-on-mission-mode-by-october-minister-to-vcs-101630694960737.html
04-09-2021||India||SC asks CBI to disclose ‘success rate’ in prosecuting cases||The Supreme Court on Friday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to give an account of its “success rate” in prosecuting cases across the country while underscoring that the “premier investigating agency” cannot simply launch prosecutions and then not bother about their outcome. A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh said that it is important to know the extent of success of the CBI in cases where investigations and prosecutions have been carried out by the agency because there has to be some accountability as well. “We want a complete chart of how many cases you have been prosecuting in trial courts and in the high courts. We will examine the success rate of the premier investigating agency. Also tell us how many cases have been pending in different courts and for how long. Let an analysis be done,” the bench told additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain, who was appearing for CBI. The ASG, however, sought to dispute the proposition on the success rate of the agency. “In an adversarial system where the accused also have rights to be defended, is the success rate really important?” he asked. The bench retorted in affirmation. “Yes, indeed. Such assessments are done all over the world. If you have no case, what is the fun in launching an investigation or a prosecution. Let us not forget that investigation is the most important part of a trial, and you are supposed to be the premier investigating agency,” it told Jain. Observing that the “success rate” is an empirical tool and an important indicator, the bench added: “We are saying this with our experience; a lot more is required to be done.”With the writing on the wall, the ASG pleaded for sufficient time to collect the relevant data. The bench gave him six weeks to do so. The court was hearing a matter arising out of the CBI’s appeal from a 2018 judgment of the Jammu & Kashmir high court. By this judgment, the high court let off some lawyers from the charges of fabricating false evidence against a few security forces personnel to frame them in a case of rape and murder. While the two girls from Shopian had died due to drowning in March 2009, the CBI claimed, some lawyers and doctors created false evidence of rape and murder to implicate personnel of security forces. However, it took CBI more than a year to file its appeal against this order. In January, the top court sought an explanation from the department noting the delay in filing the case “shows clearly gross incompetence in the legal department of the CBI which raises serious questions of its efficacy to prosecute the case”. When the agency submitted its explanation for the delay in February, the bench was livid and called it “a saga of gross negligence in performing duties while asking, this time, the CBI director to file his personal affidavit as to what steps are being taken to ensure proper functioning of prosecution of legal cases. Subsequently, then CBI director Rishi Kumar Shukla filed his affidavit in March 2020 apologising for the inordinate delay in filing the appeal. The director pointed out that a new set of instructions with stipulated timelines have been issued to streamline the process of filing and monitoring of appeals filed by the agency. The affidavit stated that “not only the responsibility of in-house officers has been fixed for strict processing of the matter within timeline but they have also been tasked with coordinating with the ministries so that appeals may be filed within the prescribed time limit.” On Friday, the bench perused the affidavit of the former CBI director’s director but asked the ASG about the number of cases the agency has been prosecuting and the conviction rate. “You have to put your house in order. At the same time, you submit details of the cases pending in the trial court and the high court along with the cases where you have succeeded. You give us the year-wise data on this. Let us see how you have done,” it told the law officer. HT reached out to CBI officials but they were not available immediately for a response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-cbi-to-disclose-success-rate-in-prosecuting-cases-101630694845458.html

They also lag in infrastructure development.About 11.2 million or 38% of all households in regions of the country deemed Japanese-encephalitis endemic have access to clean piped water critical to improving health outcomes, up from about 2.9% in 2019, an official said, requesting anonymity.Under the flagship water mission, another 11.8 million households, or 35% of the total, have been provided with tap water connections in the aspirational districts, up from 7.9% in 2019, the latest data shows.The Jal Jeevan Mission-Har Ghar Jal scheme aims to provide every rural household with a functional tap water connection by 2024. Over 120 million households in India lack access to clean water near their homes, the highest in the world, according to a UN Water report of 2014.India has 189 million rural households, according to Census data. Across India, slightly over 80 million or 42.5% of total rural households have been covered under the piped drinking water mission so far, official data shows.The country has had several public programmes to bring clean water to rural residences, such as the National Drinking Water Mission launched in 1986, but the goal of providing piped drinking water to every household entered a “mission mode” with the Har Ghar Jal programme (water for every home) under the Jal Jeevan Mission.Poor-quality water causes diseases such as diarrhoea, the third leading cause of childhood mortality in India, according to researchers Subitha Lakshminarayanan and Ramakrishnan Jayalakshmy, who work at Puduchery’s Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research and Indira Gandhi Medical College, respectively.The Gajendra Shekhawat-led Union Jal Shakti ministry oversees the implementation of the rural household water mission.“As per the very design of the scheme, aspirational districts have a priority when comes to laying water infrastructure. Similarly priority is also accorded to areas with Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes population. This has led to a faster rate of implementation in priority areas,” an official with said, requesting he not be named.The Union budget allotted ₹10,001 crore in 2019-20 for the national rural drinking water mission. In 2020-21, ₹11,500 crore was provided. The Union budget 2021-22 allotted ₹50,000 crore for the mission.Experts say a key challenge is to maintain sustainability of water supply sources. In previous attempts to provide drinking water supply, villages connected with water sources fell back to “no-water” status after a few years due to non-availability of water.Maintaining sustainability will require work on different aspects altogether. These include groundwater recharge, water conservation and, critically, cutting down the overuse of water in agriculture, which hogs 90% of available supply, mainly because farming isn’t efficient.“Agriculture’s demand for water is disproportionately huge. One of the reasons is free electricity and lot of incentives for crops such as paddy. India has to bring down its farm-water use to optimal levels for greater sustainability of groundwater,” said Alok Nath, a former water specialist at the Indian Council for Agricultural Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/record-80m-rural-households-now-have-piped-drinking-water-under-jjm-101630694662721.html

The state government has deployed 15 more doctors in Firozabad and a special cleanliness drive will be conducted in the entire state from September 5 to curb mosquito-borne diseases,” Sehgal said in a press conference in Lucknow.He added that in each district a nodal officer will coordinate the cleanliness campaign and blood samples of patients were being tested at the King George’s Medical University in the state capital.“Patients are being provided free-of-cost treatment. The chief minister has met patients and their families,” said Sehgal.Firozabad chief medical officer Dr Dinesh Kumar Premi confirmed 50 deaths in the district. Premi recently joined as CMO after Dr Neeta Kulshrestha was shunted from the post on September 1. Schools in the western UP district are closed till September 6 for students up to Class 8.There are 36 active camps in the district and 3,719 people, including those who have fever, are undergoing treatment there, the CMO said.“Most of the deaths in Firozabad, particularly those in recent days, were because of dengue. The reason for deaths in the early part is not yet clear. Patients are responding to treatment for dengue,” said Dr AK Singh, additional director (Health) at Agra.Firozabad, about 50 km from Agra, has witnessed a surge in fever deaths all through August and the initial days of September.Meanwhile, hospitals have started preparing facilities to cater to fever patients in case they come in big numbers. Lok Bandhu and Balrampur hospitals in Lucknow have prepared a separate dengue ward each with mosquito nets for each bed.Lok Bandhu hospital has set up 10 beds while Balrampur Hospital has prepared 20 beds in their respective dengue wards.“Keeping dengue patients separate from other patients is necessary. Hence, we have arranged separate ward with mosquito net on each bed in the ward,” said Dr Ajay Shankar Tripathi, medical superintendent of Lok Bandhu Hospital.Doctors warned against mosquito breeding and said stagnant water in and around houses should immediately be removed.“Even a spoonful of stagnant water is enough for mosquito breeding. Water even in flowerpots should be changed every day,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/firozabad-deaths-due-to-dengue-not-mystery-disease-upgovt-101630694600576.html
04-09-2021||India||Collegium resends 9 names despite Centre’s objections||The Supreme Court collegium on Friday overruled the objections of the Union government and reiterated nine names for appointment as judges in different high courts, recommending 68 people in total across 12 high courts.The reiterations include four names for the Calcutta high court; two for the Jammu & Kashmir high court; two for the Karnataka high court, and one for the Rajasthan high court.“The Supreme Court collegium in its meeting held on 1st September, 2021 has, on reconsideration, resolved to reiterate its earlier recommendations for elevation of the advocates as judges in the high courts,” stated the resolution published on the Supreme Court website on Friday night.The three-member collegium comprises Chief Justice of India, NV Ramana, and justices Uday U Lalit and AM Khanwilkar.Apart from the reiterations, the collegium also recommended 59 names for judges in 11 high courts across India. This the highest number of names recommended for appointment as HC judges.Among the 68 names cleared in total, 44 are lawyers while 24 are serving judicial officers. There are 10 women names among the recommendations. In yet another first, a woman judicial officer belonging to the scheduled tribes was recommended for appointment in the Gauhati high court. As reported by HT on August 31, the Centre declined to accept 14 names for appointment in the high courts as judges, asking the collegium to review its recommendations. This included the oldest recommendation made by the collegium back in July 2019 for the Calcutta high court.Similarly, one name for the Jammu & Kashmir high court was pending for almost 21 months; another one not accepted by the government for the same court was forwarded in March this year after additional inputs sought by the government regarding the advocate’s legal practice.The government had also demanded reconsideration of two names meant for the Karnataka and Kerala high courts. Of the two names returned for the Karnataka high court, one was initially recommended in October 2019 and reiterated in March this year.There is, however, no resolution yet on the four names sent back by the government for the Delhi high court and one name for the Kerala high court.The memorandum of procedure (MoP), which guides the appointment of judges in the higher judiciary, makes it clear that the government is bound by the decision of the collegium after the names are reiterated.The resolutions published on the website also stated that three names of judicial officers were being sent againfor appointment as judges in the Allahabad high court apart from fresh recommendations for 13 new names.Three judicial officers and three lawyers have also been recommended for appointment in the Rajasthan high court, while five judicial officers have been sought to be elevated as judges in the Jharkhand high court.In addition to reiteration of old recommendations, six fresh names have been sent for appointment in the Calcutta high court.For appointments in the Kerala high court, four names each from among lawyers and judicial officers have been recommended by the collegium. One name for the Madhya Pradesh high court and four names for the Madras high court have also been forwarded to the Centre.Two fresh names for the Jammu & Kashmir high court; two for the Chhattisgarh high court; five for the Gauhati high court and four names for the Punjab & Haryana high court have also been recommended.As of August 1,455 posts of high court judges were lying vacant in 25 high courts across the country, translating to more than 41% of the total strength.The high courts of Delhi, Allahabad, Calcutta, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Patna, Punjab and Haryana, Rajasthan and Telangana face shortage of more than one-third of their total judges’ strength.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/collegium-resends-9-names-despite-centre-s-objections-101630694540009.html
04-09-2021||India||Chennai horror: Poverty the link in sordid sex abuse story of 7 minor girls||Kumaran Nagar is nothing more than a cluster of ramshackle houses by the polluted Cooum river that runs through Chennai. It is located within the middle- and upper-milddle class borough of Anna Nagar, where many peoplework as domestic helps or do odd-jobs. Others have small businesses, if they can be called that.The 30-year-old woman who is one of the lead actors in a sordid saga playing out right now in the city was a flower seller. Most days, S Kanchana, who lives in the same area, would see her, and her daughter, a nine-year-old, selling flowers by the roadside.Last weekend, Kanchana watched as the police descended on the area and arrested the mother, and then took the girl away to a children’s home. The mother’s crime -- allowing her daughter to be sexually abused in return for money, sometimes in her own home; and perhaps luring other girls, friends of her daughter. Kanchana says she still can’t believe it. “We hear of such crimes happening in far off places, but you would never imagine someone you’ve lived next to and known for decades would be capable of such things.”Also arrested is the 30-year-old woman’s younger sister, 28, who allegedly allowed her daughter to be abused too. The abuser, A Perumal, 48, who runs a ration store in TP Chatram in the city has also been arrested; in all, he is accused of abusing seven minor girls. The police suspect there may be more. They believe the assaults took place either in his hole-in-the-wall store, or in the home of the 30-year-old woman. He filmed all the assaults.Perumal has been booked under section 376(rape), and various provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012-- section 5 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault), 6 (punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault), 9 (aggravated sexual assault), 13 (use of child for pornographic purposes), 14 (punishment for using child for pornographic purposes), and 16 (abetment of an offence).Senior police officials say the two arrested mothers received between one and two thousand rupees every time Perumal sexually assaulted their daughters.The assaults were discovered by accident .The city police were cracking down on the illegal sale of chewing tobacco or gutka, banned in Tamil Nadu. Based on a tip-off, they seized 30 packets of gutka from his shop, and then asked for Perumal’s phone. Piqued by his resistance in handing it over and hoping to trace his supplier, they seized both his mobile phones. On one, they found something much worse than the contact details of his supplier. The phone was filled with pornographic videos, many of which showed him sexually abusing different girls, including the seven minors; all the victims are between the ages of 9 and 17. The police then brought in an all-women police team, which primarily deals with domestic violence and POCSO cases. The team decided to visit Kumaran Nagar, five minutes from the ration shop after inquiries with local residents.“We changed into plain clothes because we were going to try and find the children; we first identified the 9-year-old girl. We were stumped when she said the other girls in the video are her younger (cousin) sister and friends,” said inspector E Rajeshwari.Within hours five girls were rescued. Later they identified two more girls from the videos but are yet to locate them, Rajeshwari added.The 28-year-old woman who has been arrested lives in Ezhil Nagar, a resettlement colony where cramped homes stand cheek by jowl, its residents displaced by both the tsunami in 2004 and most recently, the 2015 Chennai floods. She moved there three years ago with her husband, a painter, their young daughter, and two sons. Neighbours say even the father did not know what was happening.According to one neighbour, K Madurai: “He (the husband) only knew that she often took her daughter to Anna Nagar because her mother and sister lived there.”In this colony too, most families earn their incomes through daily wage work, and there is now fear about their own children. “We all have several children at home and when she did this to her own daughter, we cannot allow her to come back here,” said another neighbour who asked not to be named.The pandemic and the restrictions necessitated by it have not been kind to the people of Kumaran Nagar or the resettlement colony. Daily wage work has dried up, for instance. It’s a fertile ground for trafficking, experts warn.“Global trends during any emergency or disaster have proved that children are the worst hit,” said Andrew Sesuraj, convener of Tamil Nadu Child Rights Watch. “The government data has acknowledged that the pandemic and the ensuing lockdown has led to loss of livelihood, especially in the unorganised sector. The loss of livelihood invariably will lead to increased child labour child marriage, child trafficking. In the given situation, the announcement by the education department to track the children who have not returned to schools after reopening is a welcome move by the state,” he said.Senior police officials said all five minor victims have been sent to a government-run children’s home in Chennai, at least until investigations are complete. Thus far though, they believe, that only mothers of two of the girls were involved. On Wednesday, the families of two other victims waited desperately to meet their girls outside the children’s home, and said that they had been caught completely unaware. Both families are in the flower business too, but say they did not know how their wards knew Perumal, who’s shop was at least 5km away from Anna Nagar.The aunt of one of the victims, who is 17, said that the girl finally opened up about the abuse to the police and that even the victim had no idea Perumal was filming his assault.Before moving in with the aunt, the girl lived with another aunt in the same area, whose 15-year-old daughter is also among the victims. The family told HT that both girls had dropped out of school, and sold flowers for a living. “The only time my daughter has been alone is when she has to give flowers to people’s homes who give us a monthly payment. It’s that time of the year when flower sales are brisk because of festivals such as Janmashtami, Onam and Ganesh Chaturthi,” said the mother of the 15-year-old.Perumal, it turns out, was also a customer.On Tuesday night, three days after they were picked up, the child welfare committee brought the 15-year-old to meet her parents in a police vehicle, with the girl refusing to eat at the children’s home.Investigators suspect that Perumal may also have circulated the videos of his sexual acts, and his phone has been sent for forensic analysis. “We found that he has been receiving a steady flow of money so we will be freezing his bank account,” said an officer investigating the case who asked not to be named.The police said they are reconstructing the chronology of the events. Thus far, they believe that Perumal’s wife and two adult children were not in the know, and that Perumal first entered into a physical relationship with the two women, 30 and 28, and that their daughters were assaulted at a later stage.What is clear is that the victims came from poor homes and most of their parents were flower vendors. It has also emerged that all the families have been hit hard economically by the pandemic, and that none of the victims attend school. Most dropped out at some stage.As did the two women arrested.In Kumaran Nagar, a tailor recalls stitching school uniforms for the 30-year-old, and also the girl. Everyone here is poor and has always been so, she said, but what happened to the girls is not right.“How will the children ever heal?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennai-horror-poverty-the-link-in-sordid-sex-abuse-story-of-7-minor-girls-101630694479973.html
04-09-2021||India||Day after farmers-police clash, SAD suspends poll campaign||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday suspended it’s election outreach programme by six days in view of ongoing protests by farmers against the party. The 100-day campaign, which began on August 18, was put on hold till September 10. Besides this, the party also announced the formation of a three-member panel to talk to the protesting farmers and “remove all misunderstandings”. “@Akali_Dal_ core committee has decided to reschedule #GallPunjabDi campaign by 6 days. We have formed a 3-member committee comprising BS Bhundar,Prof PS Chandumajra & MS Sirsa to talk to farmer orgs & remove all misunderstandings. Campaign will restart from Amloh on Sept 10,” party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal tweeted. On Thursday, at least 50 farmers and seven policemen were injured in clashes which erupted after protesters allegedly tried to disrupt a SAD rally led by the party chief in Moga district. Badal alleged the protesters were “not farmers but owed allegiance to the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party”.Requesting the leaders of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions spearheading the protests since November, not to disturb peace in Punjab, Badal said: “We request the leadership of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha not to disturb the peace in Punjab. Our team is ready to answer any question posed by them regarding our policies.” The SAD chief also denied making any remarks against the ongoing farmers’ movement.“I hold the kisan sangharsh (farmers’ movement) in utmost esteem. The SAD has backed all calls given by the Samyukt Morcha. My statement was aimed at Congress and Aam Aadmi Party workers who masqueraded as farmers to incite violence at SAD functions in the past one week. We feel the Samyukt Morcha is alive to these facts and will also clarify that the protests were conducted by Congress and AAP workers,” Badal told reporters after a meeting of the party’s core committee. Badal also condemned the manner in which Punjab Police was being used by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh allegedly to disrupt peace in the state. “SAD has always remained in favour of the farmers and we advocate the decision favouring farmers. However, it is Captain’s (Amarinder Singh) government which has implemented the three farm laws in Punjab,” he said.AAP Kisan Wing Punjab president and MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan said: “He (Sukhbir) should first answer the questions raised by farmers as the Badal family has always called itself a benefactor of the farming community.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-farmers-police-clash-sad-suspends-poll-campaign-101630694420787.html
04-09-2021||India||Statue resembling CM Mamata with 10 hands set to share pandal space with Goddess Durga||A statue resembling West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, with ten arms akin to that of Goddess Durga, will be placed along with the idol of the Goddess at a Durga Puja pandal in Kolkata. The life-size statue would not just resemble the chief minister but would also have the same height (5’4”) as her, organisers said. It won’t be worshipped though. “Idols of the Goddess and her entire family will be there. We will worship the clay idol of Goddess Durga as usual. It is just that our theme for this year is Tumi Bhorsha (You are the hope), so we are creating a statue of Mamata Banerjee,” said Indranath Bagui, president of Nazrul Park Unnayan Samity. The decision, however, has had the Bharatiya Janata Party fuming with senior party leaders saying that it is an insult to the Goddess and hurts the sentiments of Hindus. “This deification of Mamata Banerjee, who has blood of innocent Bengalis on her hands, following the gruesome post-poll violence in Bengal, is nauseating. This is an insult to Goddess Durga. Mamata Banerjee must stop this. She is hurting the sensibilities of Hindus of Bengal,” tweeted Amit Malviya, national head of the BJP’s IT cell. The TMC, however, has shot back saying that there is no harm if someone shows respect to woman-power. “The BJP won’t understand such sentiments because they worship Nathuram Godse. What is the harm if someone respects women power?” asked Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson and the party’s state general secretary. Puja organisers said that unlike the Goddess, who holds weapons in her ten hands, Mamata Banerjee’s idol would hold logos and names of various schemes launched by her government, which returned to power for the third consecutive term this May in Bengal. “She would be holding placards and logos of various government welfare schemes such as Kanyasree, Ruposree, and Lakshmir Bhandar among others in her hands,” said Bagui. The puja organizers said that at least two other local puja committees have joined hands with them during the pandemic to come up with the pandal. This is their 38th year and the total budget would be around three lakh rupees. The organisers said that they have already sent an invitation to Banerjee through the local legislator to inaugurate the puja. The chief minister inaugurates dozens of pujas every year. Last year most of them were inaugurated virtually because of the pandemic. This is, however, not the first time that a puja committee has made such efforts – making statues of Mamata Banerjee and keeping them in the pandal. In 2016, a puja committee in Bhawanipore, the traditional assembly seat of Banerjee, kept an idol resembling her in the pandal. A few years back a puja committee in Nadia district’s Chakdah also made similar efforts where the face of the Goddess resembled the chief minister. In 2017, a puja committee had come up with a statue of Mamata Banerjee which was taller than the Goddess, triggering a controversy. “Work on the idol has already started and the model is complete. As it will be a statue of fiberglass it will not be sent for immersion. The organisers will keep it with them,” said Mintu Pal, the 54-year-old who is making the idol at his workshop in Kumortuli, Kolkata’s idol making district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/statue-resembling-cm-mamata-with-10-hands-set-to-share-pandal-space-with-goddess-durga-101630694121097.html
04-09-2021||India||CVC suggests mentorship scheme in govt depts||The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has recommended that all government departments and ministries adopt a formalised and well-constituted mentorship scheme where a senior, as a mentor, acts like a “friend, philosopher and guide” to the newly inducted officers, people familiar with the development said.For now, the recommendation is for the newly inducted officers of all-India services like Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service, Group ‘A’ officers and their equivalents in other organisations, public sector undertakings and public sector banks. Guidelines for this have already been issued to all the departments/ministries, people cited above said.According to the apex vigilance body, the ‘mentor’ in government departments can help the mentee (new officers) with the correct public service attitude, impart key professional skill sets, and provide guidance on expected norms of personal conduct in public life through experience sharing.This, the CVC feels, would elicit better emotional responses to challenges in service and support officers to achieve their potential in contributing as public servants. Also, the new officers will know the procedures and functioning of their department.“The Commission is of the view that for a new entrant in service, the guidance, support and positive orientation provided by senior can go a long way in developing personal and professional traits, which ultimately result in the development of leadership qualities, improved performance at the workplace, and the capability to face professional challenges,” said an official, who didn’t want to be named.There are approximately 31.1 lakh regular central government civilian employees, according to the data of the ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions. There is no centralised data for the number of officials who join the central government every year, but it runs into thousands.Former Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman R S Sharma termed the step “extremely laudable”. “This is an excellent idea and extremely laudable. What happens at present is that new inductees aren’t aware of the systems, procedures and culture of their organisation (s) concerned. Direct guidance from the immediate senior will not only increase the efficiency but also lead to better coordination,” Sharma said.Sharad Kumar, former acting CVC, agreed. “Senior government officials — be it IAS, IPS or others — used to act as mentors earlier, but lately it was noticed that either seniors do not have time for the new inductees, or they don’t want to share their knowledge and experience. Having a mentor-mentee relationship will go a long way in achieving the targets in public service”.The CVC has also recommended ‘attitudinal change’ in government employees, for which they need to be exposed to good practices through induction and mid-career training programmes.To achieve this, the CVC has finalised a five-day exposure visit module for induction training and a three-day exposure visit module for mid-career training of government officials.Further, to expose the government employees to village life, the Commission has involved rural self-employment training institutes or RSETI set up by the department of rural development.The village visit will include interaction with farmers, self-help groups, primary health centres, and village panchayat, and familiarisation with the village scheme, a socio-economic survey by the participants, etc., said another officer cited above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cvc-suggests-mentorship-scheme-in-govt-depts-101630694119929.html
04-09-2021||India||India, Russia tie-up can bring stability in energy market: PM Modi||The India-Russia energy partnership can bring stability to the global energy market, while the International North-South Transport Corridor will bring the two countries closer, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday. In a virtual address at the plenary session of the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF) being held in Vladivostok, Modi said the friendship between India and Russia has “stood the test of time”, as reflected by recent cooperation during the Covid-19 pandemic, including in the field of vaccines. EEF is an international meet held annually in Vladivostok to encourage foreign investments in Russia’s resource-rich but underdeveloped Far East. Russia has actively wooed India to invest in the region, and Modi had announced a $1-billion line of credit for the Far East while speaking as the chief guest at the last EEF meet in 2019. “Energy is another major pillar of our strategic partnership. India-Russia energy partnership can help bring stability to the global energy market,” Modi said in his address. Noting that petroleum and natural gas minister Hardeep Puri is in Vladivostok to represent India at EEF, Modi said Indian workers were participating in gas projects in the “Amur region, from Yamal to Vladivostok and onward to Chennai”. He added, “We envisage an energy and trade bridge. I am happy that the Chennai-Vladivostok maritime corridor is making headway. This connectivity project, along with the International North-South [Transport] Corridor will bring India and Russia physically closer to each other.” Modi said state-run Mazagon Docks Limited, one of India’s largest shipyards, will partner with the Russian ship-building facility at Zvezda to build “some of the most important commercial ships in the world”. India and Russia are partners in space exploration through the Gaganyaan programme, and the two sides will also partner in opening the Northern Sea Route for international trade, he said. Lauding President Vladimir Putin’s vision for developing the Far East, Modi reiterated India’s commitment to act as a reliable partner for Russia as part of the “Act East” policy. Modi stressed the importance of greater economic and commercial engagement between the two countries in line with their special and privileged strategic partnership. He highlighted the health and pharmaceutical sectors as important areas of collaboration that emerged during the pandemic, and referred to other potential areas of economic cooperation such as diamonds, coking coal and rare earth minerals. Puri is leading a delegation that includes representatives of leading Indian oil and gas companies to attend the India-Russia business dialogue within the EEF framework. A virtual meeting between Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani and the governor of Russia’s Sakha-Yakutia province was held on Thursday on the margins of EEF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-russia-tie-up-can-bring-stability-in-energy-market-pm-modi-101630693820816.html
04-09-2021||India||Have right to raise voice for Muslims in Kashmir: Taliban||A Taliban spokesman has said the group reserves the right to speak out in support of Muslims in Jammu and Kashmir, remarks that run counter to senior Taliban leader Anas Haqqani’s contention that the organisation would not interfere in Kashmir.Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen was quoted by BBC Urdu, in a report published online on Thursday, as saying that the group does not have a policy of taking up arms against any country. In this context, he referred to the terms of the agreement signed by Taliban and the US in February 2020.However, Shaheen said the Taliban, as Muslims, have the right to raise their voice for Muslims in Kashmir, India or any other country. “We will raise our voice and say that Muslims are your own people, your own citizens. They are entitled to equal rights under your laws,” he was quoted as saying.Shaheen’s remarks are completely contrary to the stance taken by Haqqani Network leader Anas Haqqani, a member of the Taliban’s 14-member negotiating team, in an interview aired by News18 channel on Wednesday.Haqqani said in the interview that Kashmir was not an issue for Afghanistan. “We have a clear policy that when something is not an issue for our country, we cannot interfere in another country,” he said, speaking in Urdu.He also described reports about the Haqqani Network supporting Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which are active in Kashmir, as “propaganda”.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Shaheen’s remarks.As reported by Hindustan Times, Haqqani has been engaged in an outreach towards India, along with senior Taliban leader Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai, who is expected to be given a senior position in the government to be formed by the Taliban.Haqqani said in the interview that the Taliban have a policy of not interfering in the internal matters of other countries. “Our desire is that we don’t negatively interfere in internal problems. Our doors are open to the whole world for political relations and humanitarian aid, we want good relations with all countries,” he said.He contended that the Indian government has supported the Taliban’s opponents in Afghanistan for 20 years, adding, “But we don’t want to remember the past and we want good relations with all countries, including India.”People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the narrative being presented by Taliban leaders such as Shaheen and Anas Haqqani has to be seen in the context of the Taliban’s long-standing ties with Pakistan, and the channels of communication between India and the Taliban.“There is a constituency in Pakistan that the Taliban have to satisfy,” one of the people cited above said.On Tuesday, India’s ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, met Stanekzai, the head of the Taliban’s political office, at the Indian embassy in Doha following a request from the Taliban side.In his interview with BBC Urdu, Shaheen claimed the “propaganda” against the Haqqani Network was based on “mere claims”. “The Haqqanis are not a group. They are part of the Islamic emirate of Afghanistan.”Shaheen also raised the issue of the 1999 hijacking of Indian Airlines flight IC-814 from Kathmandu to Kandahar.The Taliban were then in power in Kabul and Indian officials have long contended that the Taliban helped the Pakistani terrorists who hijacked the airliner to force India to release three terrorists, including Masood Azhar, who went on to create the terror group, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).Shaheen contended the Taliban didn’t play a role in the hijacking and that the Indian government should be “grateful” for the help the group provided in Kandahar. The Indian side told the Taliban that the airliner was short on fuel and the group provided assistance for the release of the passengers, he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-right-to-raise-voice-for-muslims-in-kashmir-taliban-101630693285120.html
04-09-2021||India||Cameras turned off before Tihar murder||Between 9.30am on August 3 and 4.50pm on August 4, the time when top Uttar Pradesh gangster Ankit Gujjar got into a scuffle with jail officers and was found unconscious in another part of the prison, CCTV cameras inside ward 1 and 5A of Tihar jail 3 were switched off for “maintenance work”, according to a prison report seen by HT.With allegations being aired that Gujjar, 29, was murdered because he was a whistle-blower and was providing information on an alleged extortion racket run by prison officials, the CCTV footage from the two wards could have been crucial evidence in establishing the sequence of events.Meanwhile, a prisoner in his statement to the police, which HT has seen, alleged that jail officers switched off CCTV cameras on the afternoon of August 3, after which around “50 guards armed with lathis” attacked Gujjar and two other prisoners.Delhi Police have registered a case of murder but are yet to arrest the main accused, deputy superintendent Narendra Meena. Suspended after the incident, Meena is currently in police protection. Last month, police claimed to have thwarted an attempt by Gujjar’s accomplices to murder him.In the past month, this is the third case in which the officials of the country’s biggest prison have come under probe for allegations of corruption, custodial torture, and helping prisoners access banned items. Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana is already conducting an inquiry on role of prison officers who allegedly helped two jailed builders run an underground office in south Delhi from inside the jail. In another case, police arrested two jail officers for helping conman Sukesh Chandrashekhar dupe the wife of a top businessman (who is currently in jail) by spoofing phone numbers and posing as a law ministry officer.In the Gujjar murder case, in a status report filed before the high court on Thursday, Delhi Police said that they sought CCTV footage as part of the murder probe, but that jail officers said there was none. The prison department wrote to the police that the cameras were switched off on the morning of August 3 until the afternoon of August 4, because there were technical problems faced during installing of cameras in other parts of jail 3. As part of increasing surveillance in jails, the prison department is installing CCTV cameras all across the prison compound.“As a result of such technical problems, the cameras between ward 1 and 5A were switched off,” reads the prison department’s report to the police.Ward 1 is the place where Gujjar was shifted to and later found dead after the scuffle with jail officers -- at around 6am on August 4 -- and ward 5A is where the scuffle happened the previous day. Prison officers said that they used “minimum force” to contain Gujjar and his two cell mates after they were caught with a cell phone, data cable, and a knife.The post-mortem report by a medical board, however, showed that Gujjar had at least 12 injuries on his head, neck and other parts of the body. The Delhi high court on Thursday noted that the injuries and absence of CCTV footage indicated that Gujjar’s death was a case of “custodial violence and torture”.The case of the missing CCTV footage assumes significance in the backdrop of a statement by an eyewitness Vikas alias Veeru (identified only by one name), also an inmate of jail number 3. Vikas has claimed to be a “sewadar” who was helping jail officers at the control room.Sewadars are prisoners chosen to help jail officers manage the prison.Vikas, in his statement, said that at around 5.10 pm, deputy superintendent Narendra Meena and other jail officers conducted a search inside Gujjar’s cell and found a cell phone and a data cable. He has claimed to be part of Meena’s search team. Vikas has alleged that during the search, Meena slapped Gujjar, after which Gujjar slapped him back. “Thereafter Narendra Meena, deputy superintendent turned off CCTV Cameras and called more staff. In few minutes other staff Vinod Meena, Dinesh Chhikara, Harful Meena, Line Officer Naveen, Deepak Dabas, assistant superintendent, Ram Avtar Meena and others came and they started beating all three under trial prisoners -- Ankit Guj jar, Gurpreet and Gurjeet -- due to which they sustained injuries. They were taken to jail hospital where Dr Devender referred them to DDU Hospital, but Narendra Meena, deputy superintendent did not take them to DDU Hospital and instead all three UTPs were lodged in separate cell in ward No 1 of Jail No- 3,” reads his statement.Until his arrest in August 2020, Gujjar was one of western Uttar Pradesh’s most wanted persons. Accused in at least eight murder cases, Gujjar carried a reward of ₹1.25 lakh on his head at the time of his arrest -- ₹1 lakh announced by Uttar Pradesh police and ₹25,000 by Delhi police.Gujjar’s mother Geeta Devi, said that the family has requested the High Court for a CBI-monitored probe. “A day before he was murdered, my son complained against the extortion attempt by the jail officers. He had told my daughter that while he paid ₹50,000 to the jail officers, he was unable to pay the remaining amount of ₹50,000. We have submitted the phone recording to the police. This is also part of the FIR.”Tihar jail officers declined to comment, saying that the investigation in the case is on and is being heard in courts.The Supreme Court on August 26 directed Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana to personally conduct an inquiry on how Unitech’s former promoters violated prison rules and in connivance with jail officers ran a “secret underground office” in south Delhi from inside Tihar jail. Delhi Police have started the probe and sought details of all officers who were posted in jail 7, where the Unitech promoters were lodged. The Supreme Court also ordered the transfer of the two builders to Arthur road jail and the Taloja jail in Maharashtra.Last month, Delhi Police also arrested a deputy superintendent of another sub jail for helping inmate Sukesh Chandrashekhar . Police have registered a case against Sukesh and two prison officers for allegedly duping the wife of Shivinder Singh, former promoter of Fortis and Religare Enterprises, who is currently in jail. Singh was arrested in October 2019 in a case pertaining to alleged misappropriation of funds at Religare Finvest Ltd (RFL), a subsidiary of Religare Enterprises. Police said his wife, Aditi Singh, was allegedly duped of an undisclosed amount by the conman, who posed as a senior government officer, and promised to bail Singh out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cameras-turned-off-before-tihar-murder-101630693039910.html
04-09-2021||India||Amrapali projects: Relief in sight for homebuyers as 6 banks form consortium to set aside funds for stalled projects||Over 40,000 homebuyers of Amrapali Group can expect relief as a consortium of six public sector banks has agreed to set apart substantial funds towards the stalled construction of the housing project being monitored by the Supreme Court and built by the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC). The six banks forming the consortium are Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, Bank of India, UCO Bank, and Punjab & Sind Bank. Submitting this information to the Supreme Court on Friday, court-appointed receiver, senior advocate R Venkatraman, said, “Six public sector banks have agreed to form a consortium, the documentation of which will be completed this month and by Dussehra (which falls on October 15), the loan amount will be disbursed.” A bench of justices UU Lalit and Ajay Rastogi recorded the statement of the receiver and requested him to apprise the court of further developments. People familiar with the development said the amount expected to be released by the consortium will be “substantial”. In addition to this, funding of ₹650 crore has already been sanctioned from the Union government-sponsored SWAMIH (Special Window for Affordable & Mid-Income Housing) Investment Fund for six Amrapali projects. During a hearing on August 13, the top court had noted progress on funding by banks and addressed some of the concerns raised by them by passing suitable orders. The banks wanted the funds given to Amrapali to be categorized under the priority-funding sector with a reduced capital charge, among other conditions. Tapping further fund sources, the bench directed the receiver to engage an expert and conduct valuation of five properties of the Amrapali Group and its CMD Anil Kumar Sharma in Noida and Greater Noida. For the homebuyers, advocate ML Lahoty informed the court that five private persons have expressed interest in buying the said properties, estimated to be worth over ₹19 crore. The court directed the valuation exercise to be completed by the receiver in three weeks. The court asked the receiver whether homebuyers were paying their due instalments on time after Lahoty said the NBCC required nearly ₹200 crore to hand over possession of nearly 2,500 flats by this year-end. The bench was prompted to pass a direction asking homebuyers to clear their dues (except those at the time of handing over possession of flat) by October 15, failing which they could be defaulters and the flats could be put to sale. But the concern of the court was put to rest after Venkatraman said, “By and large, flat buyers attached with the Amrapali projects are paying up with the exception of some who have sought exemption under medical grounds.” However, the bench said, “Homebuyers should not be under the impression that courts will arrange the funds and we will consider putting in our money after NBCC has completed construction. They have to make payment and cannot be lethargic sitting on an armchair, thinking finances will be arranged from somewhere.” The bench, while dealing with the issue of ‘delay possession compensation’ urged by homebuyers on account of Amrapali’s delay in delivering possession, made it clear that homebuyers cannot ask for “malai” on “lassi”. The Court said, “We are trying to salvage something for you which is possible. Do not ask for malai on lassi.” On August 13, Venkatraman had told the court that owners of 15,748 units across Amrapali projects have not been paying their instalments. Of them, 9,538 flat buyers have not provided the customer data, a record of which is maintained by the receiver’s office.Following this order, Venkatraman informed that many homebuyers have come up to make payments. He said that on further scrutiny, some names out of the 9,538 have been weeded out as they have either applied for refund or taken possession of flats in existing projects. He said a public notice will be issued as a final opportunity for 9,000-odd homebuyers, following which the flats in question could be included in the unsold inventory.NBCC counsel and senior advocate Sidharth Dave informed the court that for the sale of unused/excess FAR and unsold inventory of Amrapali projects, it had floated tenders for appointing a channel partner to carry out aggressive marketing but that has been challenged before the Delhi high court. The bench allowed the NBCC to move a transfer petition to shift the petition from the high court to the Supreme Court.Lahoty also requested the court to consider resolving the cases of homebuyers stuck under subvention schemes entered between the developer, homebuyer and banks by which the developer was supposed to pay instalments on default of delivery of flats. As Amrapali defaulted on payment and arrears became substantial, some of the banks threatened homebuyers with recovery proceedings. The court directed the concerned banks to respond within a week failing which their objections will not be considered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amrapali-projects-relief-in-sight-for-over-40-000-homebuyers-as-six-banks-form-consortium-to-aside-funds-for-stalled-projects-101630692982941.html
04-09-2021||India||CBI files second chargesheet in Bengal post-poll violence, one held for murder||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday filed its second chargesheet in the ongoing probe into post-poll violence in Bengal and accused four people of murdering a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker at Bhatpara in North 24 Parganas on June 6, said lawyers aware of the development. The chargesheet was filed at the Barrackpore court. The CBI also arrested a man in connection with the murder of a BJP worker’s mother in the Jagaddal area of the same district. The victim, Shovarani Mondal, 64, was hit on the head by a stick, allegedly by Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers who came looking for her son on May 3, a day after the assembly polls results were announced. In a parallel development, the Calcutta high court on Friday said the probe into offences other than murder and rape will be supervised by retired Justice Manjula Chellur, former Chief Justice of the Calcutta and Bombay high courts. On July 19, the court ordered the CBI probe into alleged murders and rapes and a parallel probe by a special investigation team (SIT) comprising IPS officers posted in Bengal. On Thursday, the state government named 10 officers for the SIT. The CBI’s second chargesheet came within 24 hours of the first one filed at Rampurhat court in Birbhum district. The victim at Bhatpara, Jaiprakash Yadav, died in a bomb attack by motorcycle-borne assailants. One of the four CBI teams touring the state visited Yadav’s home thrice since August 26 and recorded statements given by members of his family and the neighbours. On August 27, CBI officers asked Yadav’s family to identify the victim’s blood-soaked clothes which were kept in the custody of Bhatpara police station. “This was done because Yadav’s face was mutilated beyond recognition. The bomb hit him on the head,” a CBI officer stationed in Kolkata said on condition of anonymity. Arjun Singh, the BJP Lok Sabha member from the local Barrackpore seat, has alleged that Yadav was murdered because he worked hard to ensure the victory of Singh’s son, Pawan, at the Bhatpara assembly seat in the recent polls. A CBI team on Friday talked to the family of BJP worker Debabrata Maity at Nandigram in East Midnapore district. Maity was attacked, allegedly by TMC workers on May 3. He died at SSKM Hospital in Kolkata on May 13. The CBI lodged a case in this connection on August 31. The TMC on Friday commented for the first time on the ongoing probe and called it “politically driven”. “The Calcutta high court ordered the probe on the basis of a report given by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). The report was politically biased. The CBI is only meeting families of BJP workers. It is not probing the deaths of the 13 TMC workers killed in violence,” said Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, a Rajya Sabha member. “The CBI and Enforcement Directorate are being used to target TMC leaders and ministers. They have not only targeted TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee but his wife as well,” said Roy, referring to the summons sent by ED to the chief minister’s nephew and his wife in the coal smuggling case. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh countered Roy. “What was the state police doing all these months? Why were chargesheets not filed and arrests not made? The TMC leadership is rattled because the CBI is acting tough and fast.” On June 21, the five-judge bench of acting chief justice Bindal and Justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar dismissed the state’s petition seeking recall of its June 18 order that asked the NHRC to probe the allegations of violence. Dismissing the plea for recall, Justice Bindal observed that the conduct of the state did not inspire the confidence of the court. In its report, the NHRC panel slammed the state government saying the violence “shows a pernicious politico-bureaucratic-criminal nexus”. It recommended a CBI probe and said trials should be conducted outside Bengal. The NHRC report said at least 1,934 police complaints were lodged between May 2 and June 20. These included 29 murder charges, 12 complaints relating to rape and sexual assault and 940 complaints of loot and arson. The report said that out of the 9,304 people named as accused, less than 3% are currently in jail. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee dismissed the NHRC report, calling it distorted. The Calcutta high court on July 19 ordered a CBI probe into all allegations of post-poll murder and rape and asked the agency to file its report in six weeks. The CBI has so far registered more than 30 cases in the districts and one murder case in Kolkata. The CBI has formed four teams for the probe. Each team comprises deputy inspector generals and superintendents from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Karnataka and other states. Every team is headed by a joint director. The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is providing security for the officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-files-second-chargesheet-in-bengal-post-poll-violence-one-held-for-murder-101630690941770.html
04-09-2021||India||Modi likely to launch Sansad TV this month||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to launch Sansad TV, the integrated broadcaster of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha TV, this month, nearly two years after the plan was conceptualised, senior parliamentary officials familiar with the matter said on Friday.The plan to set up Sansad TV was proposed by an expert committee headed by Prasar Bharati CEO Surya Prakash in 2019. It was aimed at cutting costs, streamlining channel management and rejigging content to make it attractive for viewers and advertisers. Both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha TV are profit-making entities with advertisements primarily from public sector giants and central ministries.“There is a possibility of PM inaugurating the TV channels as early as September 15. But definitely the channels will start running before October 2,” said a senior Lok Sabha official.Sansad TV will have two channels to ensure live streaming of both Houses when Parliament is in session. A Rajya Sabha official said, “The preparations for the channels are over and these are ready for launch. The authorities are waiting for time from the PM to launch the new channels.”Officials said the Rajya Sabha TV establishment—that runs from a rented public property adjacent to the Talkatora stadium—will be merged with LSTV’s infrastructure to create the new entity.Former textiles secretary Ravi Kapoor has been appointed as the CEO of the new entity on contract for a period of one year, an internal order of the Lok Sabha secretariat said.“During the recess, the two channels would run current affairs programmes in English and Hindi as well as other programmes,” said a senior official involved in the plan.“The integrated plan would be a major cost-saving exercise as RSTV shells out ₹10-12 crore on rent alone for its office and studio on Talkatora Road,” a senior official of the Rajya Sabha said.Sansad TV will operate from a small bungalow at Mahadev Road, managed by the Lok Sabha secretariat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-likely-to-launch-sansad-tv-this-month-101630689923940.html
04-09-2021||India||101 sterilisations within 8 hrs: Chhattisgarh orders probe||One doctor, eight hours from late evening to well into the night, 101 sterilisation procedures on poor tribal women.The Chhattisgarh health department has served notices to two doctors, one of whom allegedly conducted over a hundred tubectomy surgeries in a matter of eight hours in the Surguja district of Chhattisgarh, in violation of government norms. The mass sterilisation reportedly took place at the Narmadapur community health centre between 7 pm and 3 am on August 26.Two days later, the district Chief Medical and Health Officer(CMHO) of the district, Poonam Singh Sisodia sent a show-cause notice to Dr Jibnus Ekta who allegedly conducted the surgeries, and Dr RS Singh, the block medical officer of Mainpat district, who was present.“We have issued a show-cause notice to two doctors, including the surgeon, and are waiting for their formal reply. Due to a one-day strike called by nurses under the banner of the Chhattisgarh Adhikari Karamachari Federation, protesting an increase in dearness allowance, the reply is taking a little longer. If they are found guilty, strict action will be taken,” the CMHO said.On Friday, the health secretary of the state took cognisance of the matter and ordered an enquiry. “ It is a fact there were 101 sterilisation operations that were carried out by one surgeon who is currently posted in Surguja. Fortunately, all women are healthy and sound but because the number of sterilization operations has crossed the stipulated guidelines, I am ordering an inquiry into the matter,” said Alok Shukla, health secretary, Chhattisgarh said.Under the central government’s guidelines for the National Family Welfare Programme, a doctor can conduct a maximum of 30 sterilisations in a day.Health department officials said that the women, mostly tribals, were from the Mainpat block of the district. Ram Kumar Ravi, who was with his wife when she was operated on in the camp said, “I did not count the women who were at the camp ... My wife is healthy and has no issues after the sterilization operation till now.” His wife told HT she was operated on at around 10 pm in the night. None of the sterilisations was forced.The state health secretary said that the surgeon had indeed sent him a written response. When asked to explain how so many surgeries had been conducted in such a short span, Dr Ekta, the minister said, explained that he had been asked to do so by the villagers themselves. “He claimed he was pressurised by the villagers who told him that they had travelled long distances and it would be difficult for them to come again. This, however, doesn’t mean that the surgeon should flout government guidelines and therefore an inquiry has been ordered into the case,” Shukla said.Asked why the surgeries were done in the middle of the night, Shukla said that the surgeon has denied this thus far, and claimed that the surgeries took place between 12 noon and 6:30 pm in the evening. Despite repeated attempts, both Dr Ekta and Dr RS Singh were not available for comment.District officials said that there have been a total of 30 camps held in Surguja this year, the home district of health minister TS Singh Deo, which have together seen 821 sterilisations.The incident is a hark back to a botched sterilization camp at Sakri in Bilaspur in 2013, when 13 women died, in a case that caused a national furore. At the time, Dr RK Gupta, the Block Medical Officer of Sakri conducted 83 surgeries in six hours in an unused and unsanitary health centre and was arrested a year later, after going on the run. Gupta alleged pressure to meet targets and suggested that substandard medicines were behind the deaths.Health activists believe that Chhattisgarh has not learnt from previous tragedies and the same violations are occurring again. “What has happened in Narmadapur is a clear violation of both government and court orders on quality standards to be maintained during female and male sterilisation. The Supreme Court banned such sterilisation camps in 2016,” said Dr Sulakshana Nandi, joint national convener, Jan Swasthya Abhiyan.The Supreme Court judgment, dated September 14, 2016, and issued by a bench led by Justice Madan Lokur called sterilisation camps “perverse products of the Centre’s population control campaigns driven by informal targets and incentives”.The Chhattisgarh health secretary said that government regulations state that ₹1,800 is transferred to the account of women who undergo sterilisation surgery, under the National Family Welfare Programme.Nandi further said that the Chhattisgarh government must take strict action against the officials and doctors who took the decision to go ahead with such a camp, and against the District Quality Assurance Committee (DQAC) members whose responsibility it is to monitor and ensure the guidelines are followed.“There is always a demand for family planning in rural Chhattisgarh but due to COVID, the demand has increased. In last one-and-a-half years, women could not reach health centres for sterilisation surgeries and now want the surgery done due to family pressure or other reasons. The government must chalk out a plan for accumulated sterilization surgeries in rural areas,” said Dr Nandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/101-sterilisations-within-8-hrs-chhattisgarh-orders-probe-101630689140359.html
04-09-2021||India||‘Abuse of process’: SC junks Bengal plea on DGP appointment||The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed the West Bengal government’s plea to allow it to circumvent the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) for appointing a new director-general of police (DGP), terming the request an “abuse of the process”.A bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao observed that the state government was “wasting so much of its time” in filing applications such as this and that states must refrain from flooding courts with such pleas.“We can’t permit this [application]. This is an abuse of the process. You are forcing us to say all this... Let us be very frank about this. Please, do not file applications repeatedly, especially since you are the state,” the bench, which also included justices BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna, told senior counsel Sidharth Luthra, who was representing the Mamata Banerjee government.Luthra, on behalf of the state government, asserted the state’s right to appoint its DGP by modifying the court’s 2018 order in the Prakash Singh case on police reforms, which made it mandatory for the state governments to appoint the DGP from a panel of three most senior police officers forwarded to them by UPSC.But the court pointed out that it had by an order in January 2019 rejected the same plea by various states, including West Bengal, and therefore, the current endeavour was a repeat of the previous application.“Your application was already rejected in 2019. The points you are making in this application are exactly the same that you made then. Why are you wasting so much time on an application like this? This is improper,” the bench told Luthra.The state’s lawyer, on his part, tried to persuade the bench that the 2019 order had left open the points regarding the authority of a state to appoint DGP in terms of their power of superintendence over police officials.But the bench remained unimpressed. “What’s left open? The point you urged has already been rejected. There is nothing left open... Our pain is this. As it is, we have individuals filing petitions which should not be filed. If states are also going to file petitions like this, it will be a problem. When will we have the time to hear the important cases?” it asked Luthra.At this, Luthra agreed not to press the application any further but requested the bench to allow the state to appear and argue in public interest litigation initiated in 2013 at the instance of amicus curiae and senior advocate Harish Salve, challenging the validity of various laws passed by states allegedly to overcome the Supreme Court’s directions in the Prakash Singh case. The bench accepted this request and said that the West Bengal government will be heard in that case.Advocate Prashant Bhushan appeared for petitioner and former DGP of Uttar Pradesh and Assam, Prakash Singh. Bhushan complained that the court’s repeated directions, in that case, were not implemented by the states and the top court should take up this matter to monitor compliance. “Due to the pandemic, this case has not been heard in the last two years. Unfortunately, most of the states haven’t complied with the directions of this court,” submitted Bhushan.Agreeing with Bhushan, the bench remarked: “You are right. This has to be heard. We are aware that despite directions passed in 2007, those have not been implemented. We will hear this case in October.”Under the 2018 order, states need to send names of DGP candidates to UPSC, which picks three candidates from the eligible names based on seniority, experience, service record and other criteria. The state government then selects any of the top three candidates, provided that the candidate has a minimum of six months of service left.The developments come amid a stalemate over the appointment of a new DGP in West Bengal, which named Manoj Malviya, the most senior officer in the Indian Police Service cadre in the state, as interim DGP on Tuesday. On July 2, UPSC wrote to Bengal chief secretary HK Dwivedi seeking a list of eligible officers for the post. Roughly 10 days later, the West Bengal government prepared a list of 21 names for UPSC.In its application filed before the top court while the appointment of the police chief remained in limbo, the West Bengal government emphasised that police and public order are subjects exclusively within the jurisdiction of the state, and hence UPSC had neither the jurisdiction nor the expertise to consider and appoint the DGP.“Each state has, therefore, the exclusive power to legislate in regard to its police system and also have full administrative control over the police in the state...the direct involvement of the UPSC in the appointment process of the DGP of a state would tantamount to curtailment of the legislative powers of a state,” stated the plea.It added that the Constitution of India does not vest UPSC with the power to assess the respective merit of the officers holding the rank of DGP for determining the fitness since it is the state government that can have the proximate opportunity to assess the fitness of officers of that rank who had rendered service to the state in the state cadre.The application also comes against the backdrop of a near-complete breakdown in relations between the Centre and West Bengal. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which heads the Union government, and the Trinamool Congress, fought a bitter battle in the assembly elections earlier this year. The BJP hoped to wrest the state but it was the TMC that won by a landslide. Since then, the BJP has accused the TMC of unleashing violence on the former’s supporters, something the latter has denied, but which is now being investigated under court supervision by two teams, including one from the Central Bureau of Investigation. The TMC, meanwhile, has accused the BJP of being a sore loser and using central agencies such as CBI and the Enforcement Directorate to target its leaders.The West Bengal government highlighted that even the Supreme Court should not curtail the legislative powers of a state under the principles of judicial review or in the exercise of the court’s extraordinary authority under Article 142 (power to issue orders for doing complete justice).“The state government has the autonomy to select and appoint the DGP in the state without having to refer the names for empanelment to the UPSC, and to resultantly appoint the DGP from the panel prepared by the UPSC...the ultimate power to therefore exercise superintendence, extended to the selection of the DGP is therefore vested with the state government and cannot be taken away,” stated the application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abuse-of-process-sc-junks-bengal-plea-on-dgp-appointment-101630688960458.html
04-09-2021||India||SC tells Centre to frame guidelines for Covid-19 death certificates by Sept 11||The Supreme Court on Friday gave the Union government a “last opportunity” till September 11 to report compliance on the issuance of death certificates for Covid-linked fatalities and to frame a national insurance scheme for disaster-related deaths.The two directions mentioned above were part of a landmark June 30 top court order that entitled people who died after being infected with Covid-19 to an ex-gratia amount under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The court, at the time, granted the Centre six weeks then to fix the amount. This period was extended by four weeks on August 16, when the court also gave the Union government two weeks to report compliance on its other directions.Appearing for the Centre, solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta told the court on Friday that the Centre was in the process of complying with the June 30 order, and required another week to file its response.To this, a bench of justices MR Shah and Aniruddha Bose remarked: “By the time you will take steps, even the third wave [of Covid cases] will be over. Our orders directing correction of death certificates was passed long back. You agreed to file a response on our directions by today. We will now grant you a last opportunity.”The court asked that the affidavit be filed by September 11, and posted the matter for hearing on September 13.Advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal, who filed the public interest litigation (PIL) resulting in the June 30 order, told the court that the Centre should respect the court’s verdict. “It is unfortunate that the Centre is delaying compliance,” Bansal said.An intervention application, filed by people seeking benefit of ex-gratia payment for Covid deaths, informed the court that the last date for framing the ex-gratia scheme was September 8. “As regards ex-gratia, we had extended time on the last occasion (August 16). It is up to the Centre to comply with our orders,” the bench said.The June 30 judgment held that the kin of people who died due to Covid would be entitled to ex-gratia compensation under Section 12(iii) of the DMA 2005 since the coronavirus disease was declared a notified disaster under the Act. Although the family members of people killed in notified disasters are entitled to a sum of ₹4 lakh ex-gratia according to an April 8, 2015 letter issued by the Union home ministry, the court did not fix the quantum of compensation in this case, leaving it for the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).Two other key directions passed by the Court included simplified guidelines for the issuance of death certificate, stating that the cause of death in such cases should specify “due to Covid-19”; and the court said that people who died within two to three months after being found Covid-positive must be included in the ‘Covid deaths’ category . For those who already obtained death certificates, the court directed the Centre to provide a mechanism for affected family members to get corrections done.The court also directed the Centre to take appropriate steps in line with the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission by providing for a National Insurance Scheme for disaster-related deaths. According to the Finance Commission, such programmes could work as social protection scheme without increasing the financial burden on the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-tells-centre-to-frame-guidelines-for-covid-19-death-certificates-by-sept-11-101630688840429.html
04-09-2021||India||Covid vaccines’ export may not resume before 2022||Covid-19 vaccine exports from India are unlikely to be resumed before the end of the year when most of the country’s adult population is expected to have been covered, people aware of developments have said. India was among the biggest exporters of coronavirus vaccines till April, dispatching 66.4 million doses as part of commercial commitments and grants. But it then prohibited doses from being sent abroad as a second wave of infections swept across the country.“It is still some time before India again starts exporting Covid-19 vaccine doses; does not look like it will happen before the year-end. Though the situation is far better now and looks like the new cases are somewhat stabilizing, still, there is no question of dropping our guard,” said a senior official from the central government, asking not to be named.“The question of resuming Covid-19 vaccine exports has cropped up in government meetings; but with the fear of the third Covid-19 wave looming and a significant at-risk population, it makes sense to cover a substantial portion of the country’s population first before thinking of resuming exports,” added the official. The Union secretary for health and family welfare, Rajesh Bhushan, in a press conference on Covid-19 updates on Thursday, also said that preference will be given to the country’s at-risk population first before exports are resumed. He, however, clarified there was no ban on vaccine exports as neither the health ministry, commerce and industry ministry, department of promotion of industry and internal trade, nor the directorate general of foreign trade has issued any formal orders asking to bar the export of Covid-19 vaccines from the country. “There has been no trade embargo in place as such; however, each country functions with the aim to ensure that it keeps its population, economy, and social system safe. Therefore, public health response with respect to Covid-19 is also governed by these factors. Once these targets are met we will look into what is the best time to share our vaccine doses with the other countries,” said Bhushan. The Indian government earlier announced that India was going to vaccinate all its adult population by end of this year. India has close to 940 million people in the category.As of Friday, India has administered 676,500,301 doses, almost all of which are from the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech – two Indian companies.Vaccine doses exported by India have been shipped to as many as 93 countries as well as for health care workers with the United Nations and their peacekeepers, as per the ministry of external affairs data. Vaccine manufacturers such as SII have been in talks with the government regarding the resumption of exports since they have supply commitments. To meet the demand, and with limited supplies, the government had to make use of supplies meant for exports. In SII’s case, for example, close to 5 million Covishield doses meant to be exported to the UK were utilised to vaccinate the country’s own population. “The risk isn’t still over so it makes sense to tread cautiously. It sure is a topic of debate whether countries are doing the right thing to give preference to their own population for Covid vaccination, but everyone seems to be doing the same, including the big countries such as US,” said a public health expert, on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccines-export-may-not-resume-before-2022-101630688785979.html
04-09-2021||India||Top court stays Kerala’s offline Class 11 exams amid ‘alarming’ Covid-19 crisis||Not willing to compromise with the safety of children in Kerala amid an “alarming” Covid-19 situation, the Supreme Court on Friday stayed the decision to hold physical examinations for Class 11 students beginning Monday and demanded that the state government explain what scientific study was undertaken before putting children of tender age at such risk. “There is an alarming situation in Kerala. With over 30,000 cases reported daily, the state alone accounts for nearly 70 per cent of Covid-19 cases reported in the country. Children of tender age cannot be exposed to any risk in this situation,” remarked a bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Hrishikesh Roy and CT Ravikumar. The bench was hearing an appeal by a lawyer A Rasoolshan who lost before the Kerala High Court on August 27 and had approached the top court to stay the examination amid the prevailing Covid-19 situation in the state. The exams are scheduled from September 6 to 27. The concern of the petitioner was acknowledged by the bench. It said, “Prima facie, we find force in the submission made by the petitioner that the state government has not seriously considered the prevailing situation before deciding to conduct physical examination (for Class 11).” The Court issued notice on the petition to the Kerala government and put the examination on hold till September 13, the next date of hearing. The state has been battling a serious crisis on the Covid-19 front with the past seven-day average of the test positivity rate (TPR) in Kerala recorded at over 18.5 per cent. More than 21,000 people have died so far in the state due to Covid-19 and in the past three days, the state has recorded more than 30,000 Covid-19 cases daily. The Kerala government represented by advocate CK Sasi submitted that offline examinations for Class 10 and 12 students were successfully conducted in April. Recently, he pointed out that entrance examinations for professional courses were also held in the state. “Is the TPR then in April and now the same,” the bench asked, putting further questions to the state counsel on whether any scientific study was conducted before taking this decision. “Can you assure us that not a single child will be infected? Even if one case gets reported, we will hold you accountable,” the bench remarked. Advocate Sasi said that such an assurance cannot be given. The bench in its order said, “As we could not get any satisfactory response from the state government, we grant interim relief staying the offline examination till the next date of hearing.” The bench directed the state government to file its response before September 13. Advocate Prashant Padmanabhan who appeared for the petitioner informed the Court that children were under mental stress of appearing physically for the examinations. He stated that there was no vaccination yet for this age group. On the bench were two judges having first-hand experience of serving in the Kerala High Court. Justice Ravikumar was a judge of Kerala High Court till his recent elevation to the Supreme Court on August 31. Justice Roy served as Chief Justice of the Kerala High Court from August 8, 2018 till his elevation to the Supreme Court in September 2019. The bench remarked, “Kerala has one of the best medical infrastructures in the country. Despite this, the state has not been able to contain the number of cases (due to Covid-19).” The Court felt that allowing children from different parts of the state, who are yet to be vaccinated, to gather together at the examination centre could be a potential “super spreader” of the Covid-19 pandemic. This is not the first instance where Kerala has been hauled up by the top court for its potentially dangerous decisions to spread Covid-19. In July, the state government’s decision to relax lockdown restrictions in view of Bakrid festivities was challenged before the top court. The Court slammed the state’s decision as “extremely alarming” and said that if the decision of the state resulted in any untoward spread of the Covid-19 infection, any member of the public would be free to approach the Court after which action will be accordingly taken. As two days of restrictions got over by the date when the order was passed, the state government decided not to continue with further relaxation of lockdown curbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-court-stays-kerala-s-offline-class-11-exams-amid-alarming-covid-19-crisis-101630685720846.html
