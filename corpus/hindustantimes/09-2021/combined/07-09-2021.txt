They said they survey the area to identify the violators. The government had earlier permitted property owners to build up to four floors on a plot over 180 square yards area with stilt to allow for vehicle parking. However, these floors could not be divided into flats. DTCP officials said they had received multiple complaints that this rule was being violated. In some cases, eight to 12 flats of 2BHK and 3BHK size, were constructed on 500 square yard plots and offered for rent and sale, they claimed. According to the complaints, said the officials, blocks E, C2 and F were particularly affected and residents fear that such properties would put immense pressure on scarce infrastructure of the colony. District town planner (enforcement) RS Bhath said that in March, action was taken against such properties and FIRs were registered against owners of four such plots in C2 block of Palam Vihar. “We have received information regarding construction of more such flats and a survey would be conducted soon. We will lodge FIRs against the owners of such plots and illegal constructions would not be allowed,” he said. Bhath further said that occupation certificates of such buildings would also be cancelled. “We appeal to the buyers to not invest in properties built in violation of rules. FIRs will not only be registered against plot owners but also against contractors and architects who assisted in these violations,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/town-planning-dept-to-take-action-against-illegal-flats-in-gurugram-s-palam-vihar-101631039155448.html

The survey will also have a different methodology compared to the two other surveys conducted last year when the vaccination drive had not been rolled out, said officials aware of the development.According to health officials, this will help them plan a targeted vaccination strategy and enhance their preparations for a possible third wave of Covid-19 infections.A serological survey finds the level of antibodies in a given population that may have developed either after an infection or after being administered a dose of the vaccines.Both the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and state governments conduct separate serological surveys.Wednesday’s survey will cover children aged six to 17 years too for the first time. This is a population currently not covered under the Covid-19 immunisation programme.“The study will analyse the percentage of antibodies developed in people, either through vaccination or by contracting the coronavirus infection. It will give an insight into the development of antibodies in people of all age groups,” said Dr Virender Yadav, Gurugram chief medical officer. Yadav on Tuesday attended the official launch of the survey by Haryana health minister Anil Vij over video conference.Over 36,520 blood samples will be collected across the state, out of which about 3,600 would be from children aged six to nine years and about 11,000 from those between 10 and 17 years. The sample size is considerably higher than the 18,500 samples covered in the last survey held in October last year.Over 2,200 medical staff across districts will conduct the survey and the results will be declared two weeks later, according to health officials.In Gurugram, about 3,000 samples will be tested, of which at least 1,800 will be of adults. According to state nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Dhruva Chaudhry, the third round of the survey will follow a different strategy. “The state has been divided into three zones based on the second serosurvey results. Districts that had less than 5% seropositivity are under the A zone. Districts with 5-15% seropositivity are in the B zone, while districts above 15% are under the C zone. The samples size will vary depending on the category and population,” he said.The data will also have results from people who did not get infected but had got both shots of a vaccine, he said.“It will help to estimate the percentage of adult population who remained asymptomatic but developed antibodies after vaccination. These multiple aspects will assist in planning a strategy to focus upon clusters for vaccination and to fine-tune our preparedness for the third wave of Covid-19,” said Dr Dhruva Chaudhry. He hinted that a phase-2 of the study to understand the post-Covid 19 symptoms in the population could be in the works.In the first state survey in August 2020, the state showed a seropositivity of 8%, while the second round had a positivity of 14.8%. Gurugram in the first round had a seropositivity of 18.5% and 5.7% in the urban and rural population, respectively, in the first survey. In the second round, the district had a 25.9% seropositivity in the urban sector, while it was 10.1% in the rural sector.Till Tuesday, the state had administered over 17.3 million doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/third-serosurvey-in-gurugram-to-check-antibodies-in-vaccinated-groups-kids-101631039154921.html

Of the approximately 400 houses constructed in the colony, around 200 were demolished on the day, they added.The drive comes a month after encroachments were removed from Khori village, which too was on Aravalli land, in the district. The drive had the backing of a Supreme Court order and almost 10,000structures were cleared.Tuesday’s demolition drive started at around noon and continued till 4pm, said the officials. Four earthmoving machines were deployed, and the drive went ahead without much trouble from residents, they added. The administration had attempted to rid the land of encroachment in 2019 too but stopped following protests from the residents.In the last week of August this year, a four-member team from the Faridabad police inspected the area and confirmed the encroachment. Following that, the residents were served a notice in this regard and asked to vacate the colony. Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) commissioner Yashpal Yadav said that the demolition drive will continue till all forest land is reclaimed. “Encroachments on land notified under Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) was razed on Tuesday. This action follows the orders of the Supreme Court, and all such encroachments will be removed from Aravalli land ,” said Yadav. The official added that demolition drive will move to four to five more villages set on Aravalli land and that encroachments were being identified. In July, the Supreme Court, while hearing a case about the illegal constructions in Khori village of Faridabad, observed that “the direction to remove all unauthorised structures standing on the forest land applies to all such structures without any exception.” After the court issued directions, the forest department started preparations to raze all illegal structures, including farmhouses, banquet halls and institutes, constructed on forest land. So far around 10 farmhouses that were set up in the Aravallis have been demolished in Faridabad, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/around-200-houses-demolished-in-faridabad-s-jamai-colony-set-on-aravalli-land-101631039094877.html

The truck driver has been arrested, police said.The accident took place around 10.30pm in the Masuri area of Ghaziabad, police said, adding that the victims were returning from Haridwar in an Alto car.Police identified the deceased as Ashish Sinha, 33, his wife Shilpi Sinha, 30, their one-year-old son, Dev, Ashish’s brother-in-law Sonu Kumar, 35, and Sonu’s daughter, Kavya, 11. Sonu’s wife Nidhi, 28, and their other daughter, Shivi, 4, suffered critical injuries in the incident and are undergoing treatment at Sarvodaya Hospital in Kavi Nagar, police said. “The car collided head-on with a mini truck that was driven on the wrong side. We have arrested the truck driver. He is not able to say clearly how he ventured to the wrong side of the expressway,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic). Ashish’s family is a native of Lucknow while Sonu’s family resides at Makanpur in Ghaziabad’s Indirpauram. Sonu’s relatives said that the two families had gone to Haridwar to perform ‘mundan’ of Ashish’s son. They also alleged that the jewellery worn by the women were missing, while the men’s purses were empty.“When we checked the bags and purses of the victims, they were empty. Even the jewellery of the women was missing. We told the local police about it, but they asked us to give a complaint. As we had to take bodies to our native places, we did not file a complaint,” said Pappu, Sonu’s brother.“The family from Lucknow had come to Ghaziabad two days ago. The two families left for Haridwar in Sonu’s car around 4am on Monday. After the accident, some passersby helped the victims reach the hospital. Ashish and his one-year-old son died on the spot, and they were left behind in the car. Ashish’s wife and one of Sonu’s daughters succumbed in the hospital, while Sonu died at 4am on Tuesday,” he added. Dr Manoj Jain, medical superintendent of Sarvodaya Hospital, said that the two victims succumbed during treatment. “Ashish’s wife Shilpi and Sonu’s daughter Kavya died due to critical injuries while we were treating them. Sonu was also critical, but he succumbed to multiple injuries on Tuesday morning. His wife is still critical and on ventilator support while his daughter is in ICU, but stable,” Dr Jain said. The incident took place at an isolated spot on the expressway near the border area of Masuri and Bhojpur police stations in Ghaziabad, police said. Police identified the truck driver as Bablu Singh, a native of Amroha, who was on way from Ghaziabad to Rishikesh in Uttarakhand. Pawan Kumar, senior superintendent of police (SSP), said that the issue of missing cash and jewellery will be investigated. “Such things get reported during accidents and it is a cause of concern. There was no deployment of traffic police at the incident site. It could be due to lack of resources. We have booked the truck driver under IPC Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) instead of Section 304a (causing death due to rash or negligent acts) which is generally levied in cases of accidents,” the SSP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/five-die-as-speeding-truck-rams-car-on-delhi-meerut-expressway-101631039034987.html

Within two days of the district administration extending the ICCCC services to people suffering from dengue or vector-borne-diseases, the centre has recorded more than two dozen phone calls.“ICCCC’s services have now been extended to patients suffering from various vector-borne diseases, in order to provide them a one-stop solution, as we did when Covid-19 was at its peak. On the very first day (September 5), when the helpline was launched, we received more than 11 calls. The number of calls increased subsequently. The callers basically enquired about the symptoms relating to vector-borne diseases, the threat of which is looming large now,” said Abhishek Prakash, district magistrate.Prakash said that callers also consulted doctors at the ICCCC. “Callers also called to avail the Hello Doctor service on which doctors give free consultation and medication to callers,” the DM said.On September 5, the administration had released a dedicated helpline number—0522-4523000 to ensure help to people suffering from dengue or other vector-borne diseases.The DM said that under the service, on getting a call, the executive at the ICCCC would take information from the person like the mobile number and address. If the person calling is showing dengue/malaria-like symptoms, the trained executive would then contact the nearest community health centre in order to get a dengue test conducted at the earliest.Meanwhile, in coordination with the Lucknow Municipal Corporation, the administration would also ensure an anti-larval fogging drive and sanitisation of the area from where the dengue patient called. Also, the ICCCC will also ensure hospitalisation of the patient, depending upon his/her condition, similar to what the centre did when Covid-19 cases were at their peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/icccc-in-lucknow-receives-more-than-two-dozen-calls-in-two-days-101631038316726.html
07-09-2021||Bangalore||Ganesh Chaturthi festivities to be restricted to three days in Bengaluru: BBMP||The Bengaluru civic agency has permitted only three-day Ganesha Pooja celebrations in the city in public places from September 10 onwards against the Karnataka government's order allowing five days' of festivities from that date in districts where the Test Positivity Rate (TPR) is less than two per cent, to keep Covid-19 infections in check. "Ganesha festival will not be allowed for more than three days in Bengaluru city. There should not be any procession while bringing the idol or during immersion," the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said in a circular. The instruction came after Gupta had a meeting with senior district level officers and Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant.Later talking to reporters, Gupta said the BBMP had last year permitted Ganesha festival for three days, which will continue this year as well. He said the decision to have it for only three days was taken after inputs from the police that there were possibilities of large gatherings participating in the public celebrations. Gupta also said that Ganesha idols made of plaster of Paris have been banned. He asked people to immerse the traditional Ganesha idol, made up of biodegradable material in their homes in buckets or mobile tankers of the civic agency. "Idols installed at homes should be immersed at home only or in our mobile tank. Ganeshas installed at public places should be of (a maximum of) four feet height and should be immersed in mobile tanks. We are also creating immersion tanks. We have also arrived at a decision to ban immersion of idols in lakes," Gupta said. Pant said one Ganesha idol at public place in each ward would be permitted, for which the organisers will have to get the nod from the BBMP and then inform the deputy commissioner of police of the area. A BBMP official said Ganesh Chaturthi falls on September 10 and the immersion should take place by September 12 night, exactly on the third day of installing it. He said the number of infections in the city is still on the higher side and hence it was decided to limit public celebrations to a maximum of three days.On September 6, the government had allowed five day Ganesh festival celebrations from September 10 onwards in those districts where the TPR was below two per cent. The government, however, prohibited any cultural events and processions while bringing the idols to the pooja pandals or during immersions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ganesh-chaturthi-festivities-to-be-restricted-to-three-days-in-bengaluru-bbmp-101631037327353.html
07-09-2021||Lucknow||UP government to fund folk artistes’ instrument purchase||In order to help folk artistes in these difficult times, the state directorate of culture has announced a scheme under which the state government will provide funds to folk artistes for the purchase of instruments.Under the ‘Lok Kalakar Vadya Yantra Kraya Yojana’ the state government has kept a fund of ₹1 crore to help folk artists whose income have suffered during the time of the pandemic. However, there is a rider: no artiste will be given more than ₹20,000 as aid for purchase of folk instruments, said culture director Shishir (he goes by one name).Artistes who earn below ₹1.20 lakh per year will be eligible for the scheme. Besides, the artiste must be 35 years or more in age and registered in the e-directory of the directorate of culture. A committee which includes a teacher of Bhatkhande, along with two officials of culture directorate will deliberate and decide on the applications of beneficiaries. The last date for submitting the form for aid is September 30.Shishir said, “The idea is to help the maximum number of folk artists over 35 years of age. The artistes can apply for monetary help for purchase of instruments by filling a form. This scheme is expected to help a number of artistes who are unable to purchase expensive instruments.“The directorate will help in the purchase of instruments like flute, chikara , nakkara , ektara, dholki, naal, tabla, alghoza, dhaad, dotara, duggi, dhol, manjhira, nagada, pena , pipa, pipri, etc. We know that during the pandemic the income of folk artistes has suffered. They are not able to get programmes hence have lost their earning and many of them want to purchase new folk instruments but are short of funds. That’s why we decided to help our artistes purchase instruments so that they can earn their bread and butter with respect.“Such a scheme has been initiated for the first time in the state and we hope ₹1 crore will be distributed among deserving artistes who are recognised by the department of culture. An amount not exceeding ₹20,000 artiste will be transferred directly into their accounts for the purchase. They will have to furnish a receipt of the instrument purchased along with a written declaration that they have purchased the instrument with the money provided by the department.”Gulab Khan, a nagada artist, said, “We must welcome this gesture from the state government. After all, here is someone who thinks about the problems of folk artistes too.”Professor Kamlesh Dubey of Bhatkhande Music Deemed University said, “Due to inflated ego, folk artistes don’t share their problems with anyone. Most of them are not well off. Folk artistes must take advantage of such schemes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-government-to-fund-folk-artistes-instrument-purchase-101631037415809.html

07-09-2021||Lucknow||UP elections: Mayawati assures security, dignity to Brahmins if voted to power||Blowing the bugle for the 2022 UP assembly polls, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Tuesday said a high-level inquiry will be set up to probe the “wrong actions” taken by the BJP government against the Brahmin community if her party came to power in the state next year. “Strict action will be taken against the officers found guilty. The BSP government will ensure justice to the victims and economic losses suffered by the community will be also compensated for as well,” she said while addressing a Brahmin conference— Prabuddh Varg Vichar Goshti—organised in the party’s state unit office. This marked the culmination of the intellectuals’ conference launched by the BSP at Ayodhya on July 23. It was her first public appearance after the Covid pandemic started in March 2020.Amid blowing of conch shells by the members of the Brahmin community during which they raised a slogan “Brahmin shankh bajayega, haathi badhta jayega”, Mayawati said, “I promise that when BSP forms the government (in UP) in 2022, it will take care of the dignity, security and welfare of the Brahmin community in the similar manner as was done after the formation of the BSP government in 2007.”In a bid to woo farmers, the BSP chief also announced on coming to power her government would not only ensure that farmers get genuine price of their products, but it would also be ensured the Centre’s three farm laws were not implemented in UP. “The farmers’ protest has been continuing for a long time now and the BSP has extended its support to their movement. Some 500 farmers have died so far but the BJP government has remained unmoved,” she claimed. “The BSP government will also constitute a commission for the implementation of teachers’ demands. They will get honourable salary and service rules for the teachers working in unaided institutions will be drafted,” Mayawati announced. “The BSP government will also give aid to Sanskrit institutions that has been stopped by the BJP government. The vacant posts in the Sanskrit institutions will be filled on priority,” she said. “Instead of constructing memorials, parks and museum in the name of Dalit icons, the BSP government will focus on changing the image of Uttar Pradesh to make it a developed state. Under previous BSP governments, memorials, parks, museums in the name of the Dalit icons who worked for the society based on equality have been constructed at NOIDA and Lucknow. The BSP is working for the equality of and justice for all communities,” the BSP chief said.“The other communities who want that their icons should be given respect, the BSP government will fulfil their demands. The BSP will organise Muslim, backward and Kshatriya community conferences across the state,” she added.Terming the “Prabuddh Varg Vichar Goshti” a big success, Mayawati said, “The large turnout in the meetings in all 75 UP districts has caused panic in the camps of rival parties. They have also started organising Prabuddh Varg conference. But the Brahmins have made up their minds to bring the BSP to power in UP next year.”“I appeal to the people coming from various castes and communities that they should support the BSP for a better future of their children, dignity and security of their families,” she said.“In the second round, the Brahmin community supporters will organise meetings in the cities, towns and villages in each assembly constituency to extend the base of the party and to associate the Brahmin community with the BSP,” Mayawati said.“They will have to make minimum 1,000 active members in each assembly segment. These members will work in the reserved and general assembly segments. The party will organise cadre camps in each assembly segment. The BSP will organise women Brahmin conference in cities under Kalpana Mishra (BSP leader Satish Chandra Mishra’s wife),” she added.“After coming to power in UP in 2007, the BSP government had lifted the ban on the recruitment of the upper caste people in government jobs. In police department, more than two lakh posts were filled. Safai Karamacharis were posted in each village. One lakh people were employed under a special drive to fill vacant posts in various government departments. There was no discrimination or exploitation on the basis of caste under the BSP government.

Police said that the man was “disturbed” ever since his wife abandoned him one month after their marriage in 2014. The suspect was identified as Sonu Prasad who is a daily wager and a native of Patna. Police said that he came to Delhi on September 2 and started looking for a job, and also rented a room at Maharajpur, which is close to Delhi’s Anand Vihar. “We formed five teams to arrest the suspect whose images were captured in CCTV cameras. The suspect was nabbed from the railway tracks near Maharajpur and he confessed to the crime,” said Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2). Police said that they have recovered a knife from the possession of the suspect, and also found a T-shirt and a pair of shorts allegedly worn by the suspect during the two incidents. According to police, it was Sonu who stabbed Shahnaz Ansari in head on September 2 while she was sleeping and a day later, he stabbed Hasnuma Khatoon during her sleep. “The suspect told us that he went to different houses in the locality to find a room on rent. He said that when he saw the women sleeping, he got infuriated and attacked them with a knife. He was upset with his broken marriage,” said Ram Singh, SHO of Link Road police station where the two cases were registered. In the first incident, the knife got stuck in Shahnaz’s head and she had to undergo a surgery during which the doctors pulled out the knife. In the second incident, Khatoon suffered a deep wound near her eye. Investigating officers said that the locals were also sensitized about the suspect who wore a T-shirt and shorts during both the incidents. “After the two incidents, the man was still roaming around in the area, but was finally traced. Had he moved on to some other locality, it would have been difficult for the teams to trace him,” said an officer of Link Road police station.Police had registered an attempt to murder case in the first incident while they registered a case for causing hurt by dangerous means/weapons in the second incident. “We are also trying to find out if the suspect in his native place gave way to such incidents with women,” the SP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/disturbed-man-arrested-for-stabbing-two-women-in-ghaziabad-101631036934803.html

In the three hours ending at 9:30 pm, many parts of the larger Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) had already seen between 20 to 40mm of rain, with the western and eastern suburbs seeing the most intense showers.Mumbai and Thane have been placed under an orange category weather alert on Wednesday, indicating a high possibility of very heavy rain, while Palghar is placed under a red category alert, indicating chances of extremely heavy rainfall. “Areas in Konkan and western Maharashtra that witnessed flooding in July are set to witness moderate to heavy rainfall until 8 September. This will be the first major rainfall event since the July floods, so brace for a possible impact due to landslides and dam discharges,” cautioned Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, UK.Officials say it will be a rough couple of days ahead for the region, with a low-pressure area (which formed over the Bay of Bengal) moving inland and exerting influence on rainfall in central India. The system, which was set to begin passing over Mumbai sometime after midnight on September 8, is expected to bring widespread heavy showers to the region early on September 8.“There is also an east-west shear zone of easterly and westerly winds that will come into the vicinity of the low-pressure zone as it moves from Vidarbha toward the coast, and this will increase the intensity of rainfall over Mumbai,” said an official with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has also sounded an orange category weather alert for the Konkan districts of Raigad and Ratnagiri today, indicating a high possibility of very heavy rainfall in the region. Parts of Konkan have been witnessing heavy rains for the last two days resulting in floods in several areas, including Chiplun in Ratnagiri district which witnessed devastating floods just over a month ago. The IMD had placed these districts under a red alert on Monday.The IMD’s monitoring station in Harnai, Ratnagiri district recorded a staggering 368.4mm of rainfall in just 24 hours ending 8:30 am on September 7. The whole district recorded an average of 152.8mm of rain in the 24 hours ending 8:30 am on September 7, against the daily normal of 14mm, as per the rainfall information available with the IMD. All of the Konkan districts recorded excess rainfall in the last 24 hours ending Tuesday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-thane-on-orange-alert-heavy-rain-to-continue-on-wednesday-101631035858404.html

Similarly, Phulkumari along with her teen daughter can be spotted sitting on the floor of another room of the second storey of the camp and packing cotton buds to be supplied on order to a local marketer in nearby market of Sahabganj.Punam and Phulkumari are among hundreds of inmates, mostly jobless daily wagers, from nearby Hanumangarhi area whose lives have been turned upside down by the swollen Rapti river.

Later, I and my brother-in-law waded through chest deep water to bring my sewing machine from my partially inundated home in Hanumangarhi. I have been living here since Rakshabandhan and thought to continue my work right from this relief camp.”In another room of the second storey of school, Phulkuamri is also busy with her work of packing cottons buds. “My husband is drunkard and does nothing, so I eke out living by packing these buds and supplying them to store on order. For every kg of packed buds, I get ₹20. In a day I can pack 4-5 kgs earning round ₹100. It is better to earn some money then to sit idle here,” she said.Another inmate of the camp, Deepak Kumar, who works as salesman at readymade garment shop in Ghantaghar market, said after the floods inundated his rented home in Hanumangargi he dropped his wife and kids at her home in Bihar and continued to stay at the camp from where he regularly attends his job at shop.Rivers Rapti, Rohini start recedingRapti river receded marginally from 76.97m on Monday evening to 76.88m on Tuesday morning but was still flowing above the danger mark of 76.85m, officials of disaster management said.

Visitors or vehicles are strictly not allowed at the fort as per the government order. We will inform our higher-ups if any forest department staffers are involved in these violations.”Currently, a practice has been adopted where visitors to the banned fort site are seen travelling to the top after parking their cars at the foothills. They are ferried to the top and back by public transport vehicles at a cost of Rs200, with the express permission of the forest committee members who are supposedly in charge of the security of the fort. In sharp contrast, visitors who trek to the top on foot are stopped as they do not cough up any money to the vested interests involved in breaking the law with impunity, said Santosh Kamble, a visitor who opted to scale the fort on foot only to end up paying the price for not toeing the “official” line. Kamble has demanded an investigation into the role of the forest committee members, alleging misuse of the autonomy granted to them to make money.There have been reports of thronging at the fort since 2020 where visitors arrive in two- and four- wheelers early in the morning on weekends and reach the top by hook or crook. Meanwhile, police personnel meant to enforce discipline is still missing from the banned fort site even as the forest department and local villagers’ committee continue to claim strict enforcement on the strength of a six-strong team and a few forest guards who provide directions and other assistance to visitors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/forest-dept-staffers-under-scanner-for-crowds-at-sinhagad-fort-101631034474468.html

He claimed that the Maharashtra government has asked the central government to allow the implementation of the ‘Beed pattern’ for crop insurance in the rest of the state, under which profit can be capped. He pointed out that the Union government gave permission to Madhya Pradesh to implement this policy last month, while the request from Maharashtra is still pending. He also claimed that all arrangements in terms of fertilisers and seeds have been made by the agriculture department for the upcoming Rabbi season. “Under the Beed pattern, the profit limit of the crop insurance companies has been capped. Under this pattern, companies can keep 10% of the total premium amount deposited by the centre and state government, and farmers as administrative expenses and 10% as profit. It is only functional in the Beed district. We have asked permission to implement it in the entire state,” said Bhuse.He said that in last year crop insurance companies collected a huge amount as a profit. “In the last year under the PM crop insurance scheme, a total of Rs5,800 crore is the premium amount, including the share of centre and state governments. Till now claims of only Rs1,000 crore have been raised. It means Rs4,800 crore is profit of the insurance companies,” said Bhuse. Bhuse also said that the agriculture department has been working on a roadmap for beneficial crop patterns in the state. “Considering different geographical conditions in the various areas of the state we have started working on a roadmap for the beneficial cropping patterns for Maharashtra. It is expected to be completed in a month. The rain pattern has changed. Concentrated rains, unseasonal rains and storms have been destroying the crops. We asked experts to look into this matter and suggest the crops which were not vulnerable to these climatic conditions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/allow-beed-pattern-to-cap-profit-of-insurance-companies-in-state-dadaji-bhuse-101631033995672.html

The state administration has deployed two teams of NDRF in Chiplun and Mahad amid an orange alert for six districts and red for Palghar on Wednesday. Although no loss of lives has been reported in Konkan, Marathwada has registered 12 deaths due to rainfall in the past week.All coastal districts, including Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg; districts such as Nanded, Hingoli, Parbhani, Osmanabad in Marathwada, Buldhana, Amravati, Washim in Vidarbha; have reported heavy rainfall over the past two days.

Incessant rain lashed Chiplun, Khed, Dapoli in Ratnagiri over the past two days. The water level of rivers in Raigad and Ratnagiri has risen significantly, raising concerns when the experience of flooding in July is afresh. Villages in Chiplun were submerged on Wednesday, while a few villagers in Mahad have been shifted to safer places.One company each of NDRF has been deployed in Mahad in Raigad and Chiplun in Ratangiri as precautionary measures. “Learning lessons from the delay in reaching affected areas in Konkan, during flooding in July, we have despatched NDRF teams for Raigad and Ratnagiri. We are watching the situation closely in Konkan and other parts of the state, but it’s well under control and no major incidents have been reported. In Marathwada, too, Beed, Nanded have reported good rainfall, but no major incident has been reported,” an official from the disaster management unit of the state government said.Makrand Deshmukh, deputy collector, Konkan Division, said, “Murud in Raigad and Chiplun in Ratnagiri have received heavy rainfall, but none of the rivers in Konkan has crossed their warning of danger level.

This was challenged in Orissa High Court.In 2018, the HC said if the state government breached the upper limit of 50 per cent in the reservations, it would be unconstitutional. Though the judgment was challenged by the Odisha government in the Supreme Court, the apex court dismissed the special leave petition. This is the reason the government wants to amend existing laws,” said Jena.The panchayat polls in Odisha are due in February 2022 while the polls to urban bodies are due for the last 2 years.In every panchayat and municipality, the number of seats for scheduled tribes and scheduled castes is 22.5 and 16.25 per cent of the total seats respectively. As per the SC, Odisha can thus reserve 11.25 per cent seats for OBCs/SEBCs so as not to breach the 50 per cent mark. In earlier elections, the state government reserved 27 per cent of the seats on offer for OBCs/SEBCs which breached the 50 per cent cap.However, to get around the cap on reservation imposed by SC, last month Odisha chief minister and the Biju Janata Dal chief Naveen Patnaik said that his party will field candidates from Other Backward Castes (OBC) for 27 per cent of seats in the panchayat elections.The decision to give tickets to OBC candidates in at least 27 per cent of seats is a repeat of the party’s strategy of giving 33 per cent of the tickets to women in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. In 2019, the party demanded that a law be passed in Parliament reserving one-third of the seats in Lok Sabha for women. It later gave tickets to 7 women out of the 21 Lok Sabha seats that went to polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-assembly-passes-bill-to-limit-reservation-in-civic-bodies-to-50-101631033816133.html

He said his party would soon launch a nationwide movement against the NMP that would directly affect Uttar Pradesh. “We will not allow them sell these public properties. The Congress has set up a committee headed by senior leader Digvijay Singh and it would come out with an agitation plan against the move. Wherever possible the Congress governments may also come forward to buy assets being sold by the government. Chhatisgarh chief minister has announced that his government will buy a unit to protect jobs,” said Maken while speaking to mediapersons at Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) headquarters here. He said “Out of 20 categories of properties listed for privatisation, the ones situated in UP include the Varanasi airport, set up in the name of former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri.” He said the Varanasi airport, valued for only ₹500 crore, would obviously be renamed after an industrialist. He said besides the Varanasi airport, other properties to be privatised included eight national highways passing from the state and Sports Authority of India’s Lucknow centre. He said the SAI centre being used to train sportspersons in various disciplines to win medals at international level would be uprooted to set up restaurants, bars and weddings etc, raising a question mark on how the sports persons would get training there. He said Delhi to Prayagraj railway line was also on the list of routes set for privatisation. Maken said the public properties had been built with public funds in the past 60 years. The manner in which the Modi government had announced the scheme raised a question over its intentions. He said the Modi government’s record about building infrastructure was poor. A sum of ₹7.20 lakh crore per annum was spent on infrastructure during the 12th plan period from 2012 to 2017 while the same came down to 5 lakh crore during the tenure of the Modi government. He said the government appeared to have no intention to build infrastructure and instead intended to provide monopoly to select friendly industrial groups. The UPA government had decided not to privatise strategic assets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/modi-govt-selling-public-properties-for-a-song-maken-101631033636011.html

The state’s Covid tally now stands at 6,493,698.Health minister Rajesh Tope said, “I want to clarify that both the health department and the chief minister have not given any thought to impose curbs as of now. We are keeping a close watch on the entire situation, in terms of where and what are the reasons for the surge in the number of cases. We have the experience of both the first and second waves. Keeping this in mind, we will make the right decision.”With regards to the statement by power minister Nitin Raut on reimposing lockdown in Nagpur due to surge in cases, Tope said “The chief minister will take the decision based on his observation and figures.” He said that 70% of the total cases emerged from five districts of the state —Ahmednagar, Ratnagiri, Satara, Mumbai and Pune. “The people of these districts need to take more precautions and since it is festival time, we need to avoid gathering.

Following this, the high court had sought response from Punjab as well as Haryana. In its report, Punjab had told court that all entry and exit points and lockups in 423 police stations and 37 CIA staff buildings are covered by the CCTV cameras. However, as regards any time frame for installing CCTV cameras at all entry and exit points etc. in police posts, the response had “absolutely nothing”.

The move comes after the corporation found delays in and irregular working methods deployed for DPDC works.The PMC order issued by PMC coordinator and DPDC work and additional city engineer, Shrinivas Kandul, read, “When members of legislative council (MLCs) and members of legislative assembly (MLAs) suggest development works in the corporation jurisdiction, officials are found not using funds properly and on time. Work estimates are not prepared. Work is not divided into smaller batches. One tender is floated for many works or works are left incomplete. Bills are issued to contractors without verification of works. Funds are even used for other works.”“As per the state government’s order, funds that are not used should be returned to the finance department but this is not being done due to mismanagement. Hence, we have introduced a system to update all DPDC works,” Kandul said.Each of the seven districts has a DPDC with the district headquarters as main office. The function of the DPDC is to coordinate, monitor and review the implementation of district plans and programmes apart from making recommendations, projecting local needs and fixing priorities within the objectives of the state/national plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-develops-system-to-monitor-devp-council-s-work-101631032734289.html

The move came after Kumar said he is not ready to allow spending as an allocation under the “budget of elected members”. Despite instructions from mayor Murlidhar Mohol and standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane, the commissioner has remained firm and has cut down the budgets for wards. Rasane said, “We are confused that despite instructions from the mayor and me, the commissioner has remained firm. He has continued with the existing revenue committee which was formed during Covid given the shortage of money at the time. This committee takes a call on spending. We have already asked that this committee be scrapped as it was temporary. “ According to Rasane, PMC has earned a record revenue in the last five months - almost Rs2,800 crore.“We are hoping to get better revenue in the coming seven months and are asking the administration to start administrative work and float tenders. If there is fall in revenue, then the administration can decide on whether to issue a work order or not,” said Rasane. This is the second time the BJP has accused the PMC chief of not cooperating, the last clash being in August. Rasane said, “Last year we asked the urban development department about spending as the government had restrictions due to Covid. The state government clearly said that as the PMC is spending its own money, it can consider new projects.” An official from the administration, speaking anonymously, said that the commissioner is firm on his stand of cutting down ward-level works as “most are either a duplication or unnecessary”. A senior corporator, also requesting his name be withheld, said, “Because of the upcoming elections, elected members are getting hyper.” Another elected member, also speaking anonymously, suggested that this fighting is not for development work, but over the loss of commissions on tenders awarded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-corporators-clash-with-civic-chief-over-cut-on-ward-level-spending-101631032616631.html

Malik said that a plot is being hatched against the state ministers after the meeting and central agencies are being used to target the ministers.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has, however, said that it is an excuse by the ruling parties to cover up the misdeeds of their leaders.Malik said that the government has the information about the meeting. “Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis held secret meetings with a few IPS officers first in Mumbai and then in Delhi. The meeting was followed by allegations and action against MVA ministers like Anil Deshmukh and Anil Parab. We have the proof of the meetings. Central agencies like CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) and ED (Enforcement Directorate) are being misused to target the ministers and leaders from the ruling parties,” he said.Malik further said that the Central government has been using the central agencies against the ruling party leaders in the states which are ruled by non-BJP parties. “Supreme Court has passed strictures against the style of working of these agencies. There is unrest among the people against the action by the agencies. Ultimately, the people of the state will take corrective steps,” he said.BJP has reacted sharply to the allegations and said that it is an attempt of covering up the misdeeds of the ministers. Leader of Opposition in legislative council Pravin Darekar said, “The accusation is nothing but an excuse to hide the misdeeds and thefts by the ministers. The MVA government is busy levelling allegations against the Central government to cover up its failure and blaming people for the rise in the Covid-19 cases. The ministers facing action announce to face the inquiry but keep sulking after warrants are issued. Malik should tell people why his colleague (Anil Deshmukh) is absconding for three-four months,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mva-ministers-targeted-after-fadnavis-held-meeting-with-ips-officers-alleges-nawab-malik-101631032616042.html

Keskar has demanded that the PMC’s decision on the proposed widening of city roads from the existing six metres to nine metres, be disposed of, which is interesting given that road widening is on the BJP’s own ambitious agenda.PMC legal advisor, advocate Nisha Chavan, said, “The Bombay high court has given directives to the state government to conduct hearing and take a decision on Keskar’s application within 10 weeks.”While the PMC completed the suggestions and objections process, it was delayed due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, former BJP corporator and office bearer Keskar took objection to the proposed road widening and approached urban development minister Eknath Shinde and urban development department officials claiming that the PMC’s decision is against the law and should be disposed of. Neither Shinde nor the department officials paid any heed apart from the fact that BJP MLA Chandrakant Patil and standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne were very aggressive about implementing the road widening decision. The party suffered a major setback however when Keskar subsequently filed a public interest litigation (PIL) against the state government in the Bombay high court.Keskar said, “The PMC decision proposing the widening of city roads from six to nine metre is unlawful and not useful for common people. It has been taken for developers and builders. So, I have demanded that the corporation’s decision be nullified. We first approached urban development minister Shinde and the urban development department but they did not consider the application. Finally, we filed a PIL against the state government. The court conducted the hearing last week and has issued an order to the state government.”Sudhar Kadam, executive engineer of the building permission and development department, said, “Due to the second wave of Covid-19, there were strict restrictions on meetings and people too were reluctant to visit the PMC office for hearing. So, we stopped hearing for some time. After easing of restrictions, we conducted the remaining hearing and completed it last month. Now, after the Bombay high court order, we will take legal opinion and prepare a final report which will be presented to the standing committee.”The PMC had appealed to citizens living in those areas where road widening was proposed to register their suggestions and objections. The PMC had proposed that a total 335 roads – 255 in the old city and 80 in the suburban areas – be widened. The civic body received both positive and negative responses from about 1,800 citizens. While a majority of the bungalow societies objected to the road widening, the PMC found that there were nearly no objections with respect to the widening of around 135 roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/oppn-to-road-widening-post-hc-directive-pmc-adopts-wait-and-watch-stance-101631032614386.html

Suddenly on June 3, he developed pneumothorax (leak in lungs) that was treated. Followed by this, on July 4, blood was reported in his cough due to fungal infection.“Being in the hospital for such a long time and seeing people lose their lives had caused a feeling of despair in my heart. However, during this time, I realised how fortunate I am to have a family that loves me so much. Not only my family members but also the hospital staff has been really cooperative and caring. I’ll always be thankful to them for their sincere services. By god’s grace, I am doing much better now and I hope to be a 100% fit again soon,” said Memon.MD physician, Dr Gautam Ganvir, who treated the patient, said, “There is a need to build trust and confidence in patients. The threat of Covid is very dangerous and we tried not to reveal to the patient his report. During the whole treatment, nursing care and hygiene are extremely necessary. Due to long treatment, chances of bed sore and fungal infection may occur.”Ganvir added that Memon was very positive during the treatment, though got anxious after a long treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/64yearold-kalyan-man-recovers-from-covid-after-127-days-treatment-101631032322669.html

Another applicant, who is from Nashik, has been allocated a centre in Shirdi, around 95km away. Applicants in the city, too, said their centres were further than what they had set as preferences. Earlier, HT had reported that several NEET aspirants were unhappy with the centres allotted to them.

The Speaker had formed the six-member select committee chaired by the state labour minister Satyanand Bhokta, who tabled the committee report with amendments in the Bill on Tuesday. The bill with amendments will be taken up for adoption by the House on Thursday.“The government would form the related rules and regulations to implement it. This is a landmark law as people, especially for those who are displaced for setting up industry and are often forced to protest and hit the streets for jobs. At present, they are often threatened with cases for raising their voice. With increasing privatization and the Centre pushing for NMP (national monetisation pipeline), this law would prove to be a boon for the locals,” said CPI (ML) legislator Binod Singh, one of the members of the select committee.BJP legislator and former health minister Ramchandra Chandrvanshi, who was also a member of the select committee, said they cleared the Bill as it is in the interest of the state.Few key changes made in the original Bill includes adding “Private Sector” in the amended Bill, now named “The Jharkhand State Employment of Local Candidates in Private Sector Bill, 2021”. The Bill also increased the salary cut-off from ₹30,000 to ₹40,000 besides including a new clause vis-à-vis the public sector undertakings. The original Bill had kept these firms out of the purview of this law.“The central government of the state government shall not be included but the provisions of this Act shall apply on the organizations providing services through outsourcing to the central government or the state government organistaion/undertakings,” reads section 2(e) of the amended Bill.While the new law does not fix quota for any vulnerable group, including the displaced or social groups, as done in government jobs as affirmative action, the amended bill adds a new clause saying attention will be given for their representation. The amended Bill has also expanded the monitoring committee for implementation and addressing complaints. Now, deputy commissioner in each district would chair the committee which will have local MLAs, employment and labour department officers. Earlier, the deputy commissioner was given the sole right to settle disputes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-assembly-select-committee-clears-bill-reserving-75-jobs-in-pvt-sector-for-locals-101631029795170.html

The state had achieved its highest single-day vaccinations on August 31, having topped the national chart by administering 27,57,931 doses to beneficiaries. Vaccine hesitancy in rural Bihar seems to have turned now into vaccine eagerness, as more and more people queued up for taking the shots, said officials quoted above. Rural Bihar accounted for 15,85,006 doses out of the total 17,30,998 administered on Monday, the first day of the mega vaccination drive this month. Rural contribution was a whopping 25,30,676 as against 2,27,255 in urban areas on August 31, when the state logged the highest single-day vaccinations since the pan-India launch of the Covid-19 vaccination programme on January 16. The state health authorities were now encouraging beneficiaries to take their second dose. The department had come up with jingles to promote second dose vaccination, saying the vaccination would become ineffective if the second jab was not taken within the scheduled time period between the two doses. The state had completed 34,809,088 first dose vaccinations while the number of people who had taken both the shots was 7,222,141 out of the total 42,031,229 doses administered so far.

The Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government had announced setting up of the skill institute in 2017. The PTU acquired 42 acres for the institute and the construction work started in April this year, but it came to a halt over the map clearance fee issue. In August this year, the executive officer of Chamkaur Sahib gram panchayat asked the PTU executive engineer to deposit nearly ₹11 crore as map clearance fee and three sets of the buildings plan with the local bodies department for approval. The PTU official privy to the development said that PTU registrar-cum-additional deputy commissioner, Jalandhar, Jaspreet Singh, raised the issue with the higher authorities, contesting the panchayat demand since the building had the approval of the chief architecture of the Punjab government. “The university was to pay ₹10.81 crore as map clearance fee to the gram panchayat,” added the official. The matter was subsequently put before the director of the local bodies department. On September 2, the director of the local bodies department issued a letter to all the municipal corporations and additional deputy commissioners (urban development) that they would not stop the construction of buildings whose maps were cleared by the chief architecture of the state government. He said the department has been preparing a separate policy for such buildings. On September 3, the Chamkaur Sahib panchayat gave university the go-ahead to continue the construction work. PTU registrar Jaspreet Singh confirmed the development, saying not only the university, but other government departments will also be benefited from the decision. “The need of the hour is to invest public money properly,” said Singh, while expressing his gratitude to the senior government officers who supported the university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ptu-skill-institute-work-back-on-track-as-govt-remits-11-crore-map-clearance-fee-101631028175482.html

The successive governments of the Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress were responsible for the plight of Muslims in UP, he said.Muslims constitute 19% of UP’s population whereas the Yadav community leader became CM though they were a mere 9% of the population. Muslims were denied government jobs, he added.“Muslims have been denied share in power, education and basic facilities and have been denied justice. The community in UP is leaderless and no political party is interested in addressing the grievances of Muslims. The interest of political parties is in the votes of the Muslim community,” said Owaisi.“Due to the support of Muslims, leaders of Congress, SP and BSP became Prime Minister and chief minister. Today, Muslims feel cheated as they have been dumped by parties who sought their votes in the name of secularism,” he said.“I have been raising my voice on the floor of the Lok Sabha for justice to the Muslim community. I have challenged the might of the BJP that has 300 members in the Lok Sabha,” said the AIMIM leader.Owaisi said he had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make it clear if the Indian government considered Taliban a terrorist organisation. “The government should come out clear over the issue of Taliban as Pakistan is going to gain after Afghanistan’s takeover by Taliban. The Indian government has invested over ₹35,000 crore in the development of Afghanistan. Now, Taliban has taken over the country, which is not good for India,” he added. Earlier, addressing a press conference, Owaisi announced that gangster turned politician and former MP Atiq Ahmad and his wife Shaista Praveen had joined AIMIM. Charged in several criminal cases, Atiq is lodged in a jail in Gujarat.Replying to a question over Atiq’s joining, the AIMIM chief said several BJP leaders were facing criminal cases. While 37% of the BJP MLAs in UP had criminal cases against them, 116 MPs were also facing criminal cases, he added.Owaisi will address a ‘vanchit-shoshit’ conference in Sultanpur on Wednesday and in Barabanki on September 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/aimim-wants-to-ensure-bjp-s-defeat-in-up-polls-owaisi-101631026736104.html

The 45-year-old will remain under observation of a probation officer for this period.In 2015, Thombre was arrested by local police for the alleged possession of two 180ml liquor bottles in Chandrapur. The then government in Maharashtra had imposed complete liquor ban in Chandrapur district from April 1, 2015. The prohibition came to an end on May 28, 2021.On May 10, 2018, a judicial magistrate first class accepted the prosecution case in toto and sentenced Thombre to three years’ imprisonment and also imposed fine of ₹25,000 for flouting the ban.He had appealed in the sessions court, which upheld the magisterial order and on August 29, 2019, dismissed his appeal. The paan shop owner then approached the high court.The high court set him free after noting that it did not appear that “the applicant was involved in illegal trade of liquor.” “The liquor, which the applicant possessed, is more likely to be for personal consumption than for sale,” the high court concluded, and released him on two years probation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-sets-aside-man-s-jail-term-for-possessing-two-180ml-liquor-bottles-101631024395073.html

He also said that the court also put a stay on the two other cases in which Adhikari has been named. While one pertains to post-poll violence in Nandigram, another is a snatching case at Panskura. “In two other cases, the court has said that investigators can question him at a place of Adhikari’s choice, but would not be able to take any coercive action. In future too coercive actions can’t be taken against Adhikari without the court’s permission,” Bhattacharya added. On Tuesday, the state government moved the division bench of the Calcutta high court challenging the order. The matter is likely to be heard on Wednesday. In July, the CID initiated a fresh probe into the death of Adhikari’s security guard who reportedly died by suicide in 2018, officials said. The victim’s wife had lodged a complaint demanding a fresh probe. On Monday, Adhikari was summoned by the CID for questioning. He, however, skipped it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-govt-challenges-calcutta-hc-order-of-interim-relief-to-suvendu-adhikari-101631023556714.html
07-09-2021||Delhi||‘ICMR should look into complaints relating to private pathology labs’: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday said that ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) cannot be sitting in an ivory tower and said that it should look into the complaints relating to private pathology laboratories.A bench of Justice Najmi Waziri said ICMR should look into the complaints received against private pathology laboratories and opined that ICMR can revoke licences if there is any breach of conditions.The court noted that ICMR give licences to private labs. "The whole year has gone by. The whole nation is suffering. The whole NCR is suffering," the court said and listed the matter for further hearing for next week.In an affidavit filed, ICMR informed the Court that the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) certification is a must for enrollment of private labs for Covid-19 testing, ICMR has told the Delhi High Court adding that monitoring of the activities of online health service aggregators does not come under its purviewThe Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in its affidavit, told the Delhi High Court that monitoring the activities of online health service aggregators does not come under the purview of ICMR.ICMR has filed its affidavit in a petition seeking initiation of contempt proceedings for the Delhi government for allegedly not complying with the court's order to take action against illegal online health service aggregators operating in the national capital and to regulate online pathological labs."NABL certification is a must for enrollment of private labs for testing. NABL certifies the readiness of labs to undertake molecular testing of SARS-Cov2 before ICMR onboards them for testing. Through these parameters, it is ensured that labs meet the statutory standards for Covid-19 testing," ICMR said in its affidavit.ICMR also apprised the court that it has laid down SOPs and standard guidance for setting up Covid-19 testing labs and fourteen (14) mentor Institutes have been set up in India to guide the labs on implementing these SOPs and set up four testing labs. For Delhi, the mentor Institute is AIIMS, Delhi, ICMR said.ICMR submitted that as of August 16 2021, the ICMR has approved 134 (Govt. 35 and Private 99) labs at Delhi for RT-PCR, TrueNat, CBNAAT and Other M-NAT Testing Platforms.Advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi, who appeared for petitioner Dr Rohit Jain, had alleged that no action has been taken by the government and in fact, there is a grave violation of the Supreme Court order. He had also added that contempt is remedial jurisprudence and not adversarial and public welfare is the highest law.Petitioner has alleged that the top official of respondents is equally responsible for restraining the illegal practices of online aggregators which are freely being carried out under the eyes of these officials in utter violations of the rules and regulations laid down by statutes and the guidelines issued by the respondents from time to time ever since the outbreak of deadly coronavirus."Several illegal online aggregators are advertising freely by offering attractive packages for the body check-up, including Covid-19 test through SMSs or various online modes. The applicant/petitioner has received an advertisement of the online aggregator through e-mail for getting tested," the plea stated.It had also submitted that it is an extremely serious issue that the online aggregators are operating without any authorisation and approval. Besides, these online aggregators are not accredited by any accreditation agency. The existence of such illegal online diagnostic aggregators is posing a serious health challenge as a large number of people are falling prey to the attractive health packages being offered by these illegal online aggregators, states the plea."The acts of respondents clearly constitute the contempt of the court and appropriate contempt proceedings should be initiated against them for acting against the order dated August 6, last year of this court. The respondent's officials have been playing with precious lives of innocent people by promoting unqualified, unregistered medical practitioners to sign the pathological report and exposing the common people to the mercy of untrained and highly incompetent medical/pathological professional," the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/icmr-should-look-into-complaints-relating-to-private-pathology-labs-delhi-hc-101631022006620.html
07-09-2021||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar attacks Centre over ED cases in Maharashtra||PUNE: Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday said federal agency Enforcement Directorate’s actions against various Maharashtra leaders were an attempt to encroach on the state government’’s rights and discourage political opponents.“Never heard of so many ED actions in Maharashtra in the past. One action is going on against Khadse, another against Anil Deshmukh, also against Bhawna Gawali. There is an attempt to encroach upon the state government’’s rights case and discourage the opponents by using these agencies as tools,” said NCP chief, a key architect of Maharashtra’s Maha Vikas Aghadi government that came to power in November 2019 by stitching an alliance between NCP-Congress-Shiv Sena.Many senior leaders of the three-party coalition such as transport minister Anil Parab, Lok Sabha MP Bhavana Gawali and MLA Pratap Sarnaik (Shiv Sena), former home minister Anil Deshmukh, Eknath Khadse (NCP), among others have got notices from ED. In the case of Anil Deshmukh, both the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and ED are investigating allegations of extortion against him.To a specific question on ED searches at premises linked to Bhavana Gawali, Pawar said the raids were allegedly linked to educational institutions .“When there are allegations against these kinds of institutions, the complaints can be lodged before the charity commissioner. If not the charity commissioner, then there are state government agencies, but here, directly ED was involved,” the former Union minister said.Covid protocolOn crowds gathering at programmes attended by political leaders despite fears of a third Covid-19 wave, Sharad Pawar said, “I have seen many events happening where the (Covid-19 prevention) protocols are not being followed.”Pawar said since Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asked political parties to immediately stop agitations, meetings and other events to avoid crowding, he will not attend programmes involving large gatherings. “I will only attend programmes organised indoors with a limited number of people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sharad-pawar-attacks-centre-over-ed-cases-in-maharashtra-101631023314887.html
07-09-2021||Chandigarh||Generous in spirit, caring to the core, he defined success||It was the first week of June in 1983. The results of the Class 10 exams of the Haryana board were out a few days ago and I had done well. Schools were closed for the summer break and I along with my friends, though nervous about our future, were singing and dancing with gay abandon under a neem tree behind our ramshackle kutcha house at a village in Ambala district. Suddenly, a green Fiat car came to a halt near us. As we gaped in awe, a man in his thirties stepped out of its rear door and walked towards my house with a confident gait. As soon as I realised that my youngest maternal uncle, DL Sharma, had come calling, I rushed home. Also read: Vardhman MD Sharma dies of Covid-19After exchanging pleasantries with the elders, his eyes fell on me. “Which class are you studying in?” I told him about my matriculation exams and added in a trembling voice that I had scored 73%. A rapid round of questions followed. I was getting uncomfortable with every question but in hindsight I think he was preparing me for the UPSC interview! Having lost my father at six, it was after a long time that someone was trying to take control of my life. My mother asked him to get me employed as a patwari in the state government but by that time he had made up his mind to send me for higher studies. He suggested that I take the non-medical stream and go for engineering. Having studied in a Hindi medium government school at a nearby village, I shuddered at the thought of having to read science in English. The thought of travelling to college in the city made me nervous. My mother and maternal grandparents resisted, but my uncle’s decision prevailed. His faith wasn’t misplaced for the village boy topped the BSc I (equivalent to 10+2) exam of Kurukshetra University and went on to become an engineer and then a civil servant. I observed that my uncle was cool and composed while handling professional challenges and family matters. An axis of rotation for the whole family, everyone used to hover around him. He set higher goals, dreams and aspirations for us. He was a sincere, altruistic person with no attachment to the material world. An epitome of discipline and compassion, he was like a Godfather for me and like a banyan tree providing shade and comfort to everyone, including the extended family. Helping everyone with patience and a smile, he changed the definition and sense of every relationship. With the passage of time, he became more of a friend, philosopher and guide. Anyone from the family could call him at any time and he always had a solution for their problems. A true karma yogi, he put duty before self. As a pillar of the textile industry in Punjab and as managing director of Vardhman Yarns & Threads Ltd, Ludhiana, he never missed his official duties even during the peak of the first Covid wave. I often ponder what makes us successful. Is it wealth, professional status or power? To me, the real measure of success of a man is how much he loves his family and those around him; how selflessly he shares his resources to help others; and how consistently he offers a kind word or lends a humble ear. Since the day Covid snatched him away from us a year ago, life has turned upside down. Hardly a day goes by without remembering him. I still feel my hero is around and see him in the clouds blessing us all. During poignant moments, I go back to Richard Bach’s lines from his book, The Bridge Across Forever: “That’s why love stories don’t have endings! They don’t have endings because love doesn’t end.” Some relationships have cosmic connections; they help us grow and change the course of our lives forever. sharmaajay25@yahoo.co.in The writer is an IRS officer in Mumbai||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/generous-in-spirit-caring-to-the-core-he-defined-success-101631023134253.html
07-09-2021||Chandigarh||KLF narco-terror module: NIA court frames charges against 10 people||AMRITSAR The National Investigation Agency (NIA) special court in Mohali has framed charges against 10 people in connection with a narco-terror module linked to Pakistan-based terror organisation Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF). The accused are Jasbir Singh Samra, Harpreet Singh, Varinder Singh, Nirmal Singh alias Neeldhari, Satpal Singh, Hira Lal, Harjit Singh alias Bagga, Dharminder Singh, Rajinder Singh alias Ganja, and Jasbeer Singh alias Shera. The charges were framed under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), sections 21-25-27-27A-29 of the NDPS Act, and sections 13, 17, 18, 18-B, 38 and 40 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 by special judge of the NIA court Karunesh Kumar on Monday. The court observed that the ‘prima facie a case is made out against the accused’. The judge has fixed the next date of hearing on September 27. The case dates back to May 31, 2019, when three of the accused—Nirmal Singh, Hira Singh and Satpal Singh—were arrested by Tarsikka police of Amritsar-rural district with 500gm heroin and ₹1,20,000 drug money. Primarily, a case under various sections of the NDPS Act was registered against the accused. The police had arrested three more persons in December 2019. During the police’s investigation, a narco-terror angle with its international ramifications emerged. The NIA registered the case in January 2020 under various sections of the NDPS Act and UAPA. During further investigation, the role of Harmeet Singh alias PHd, Pakistan-based chief of KLF, a proscribed terrorist organisation, emerged in running a cross-border narco-terror network through drug smugglers, militant elements, and hawala operatives based in Punjab and other states in India. Harmeet is believed to have been killed in Pakistan last year. One of the lawyers of the accused, Jaspal Singh Manjpur, said the court framed the charges against all the accused who were nominated by the NIA. A source in Punjab Police said the accused were allegedly found to be involved in smuggling of heroin and sending the proceeds to Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and Pakistan through hawala to aid some terror organisations based in Pakistan to disrupt peace in India, including Punjab. Accused Jasbir Singh, Harpreet Singh, Varinder Singh, Nirmal Singh, Satpal Singh, Hira Singh, Harjit Singh and Dharminder Singh are currently lodged in Patiala Central jail while Rajinder Singh and Jasbeer Singh are in Amritsar and Hoshiarpur jails, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/klf-narco-terror-module-nia-court-frames-charges-against-10-people-101631022954391.html

07-09-2021||Other||Crops in 102 of 314 blocks in Odisha affected by rain deficit||Odisha government on Monday told the state assembly that standing crops in at least 102 of the 314 blocks of Odisha have been affected by the rainfall deficit even as former chief minister Hemananda Biswal conducted a puja at his village to “propitiate the rain gods”.Responding to a discussion on the rain deficit affecting crops in the state, Odisha revenue minister Sudam Marndi on Tuesday said the current situation was a matter of concern and the state government will take necessary steps. “Though the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted normal monsoon rain in the country this year, it has not proved true for Odisha. What has worsened matters for us is huge deficiency of rains in August,” said Marndi.In August alone the state saw 44% less than expected rain, rendering the fate of transplanted paddy uncertain in most of the areas. Between June 1 and September 6, Odisha saw 29% less rain with 25 of 30 districts in Odisha receiving deficit rainfall between 59% and 20% in the last three months. Due to deficient rainfall, agricultural activities have been possible only on 56.33 lakh hectares of farmland against a target of 61.96 lakh hectares.The revenue minister said while 15 small and medium reservoirs in the state are almost dry, so far only the Mahanadi delta irrigation system and Subarnarekha irrigation system are holding up. Hirakud reservoir has now 62% of its capacity filled up compared to 83% last year while Rengali reservoir has 79% filled up compared to 103% last year. “Rains in September will be crucial for Odisha,” he said.In western Odisha district of Jharsuguda, former chief minister and tribal leader Hemananda Biswal on Sunday conducted a yagna at his village of Thakurpara in Kirimira block. Biswal said August is the crucial month for farmers in Odisha, and whenever monsoon has failed in August there has been a drought.“It has been our custom to do a puja invoking Lord Indra for adequate rain. It is an attempt to propitiate the rain Ggods,” said Biswal. “I hope the state government announces drought in the state.” In Kalahandi district, hundreds of farmers on Monday morning blocked the Khariar-Bhawanipatna road demanding a declaration of drought by government.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress have visited the districts hit by lack of rains and alleged that the state government took no measures to tackle the drought situation. A party delegation of the BJP led by senior leader Manmohan Samal visited Bolangir and Nuapada districts and discussed the ground situation with farmers who have lost their crops to erratic rainfall. “We demand that the government declare drought and pay compensation to farmers from the calamity relief fund which I had set up during my tenure as the revenue minister in 2007-08,” said Samal. The Congress delegation led by chief of Congress Kisan Cell Amiya Patnaik toured Boudh, Sonepur, Bolangir and Nuapada districts, and alleged that the drought is man-made and the state government is responsible for it.Meanwhile, agriculture minister Arun Sahoo asked his department officials to keep their mobile phones switched on all the time for the necessary dissemination of crucial information for execution on an immediate basis. He said officials of the block and district level have been asked to provide data of minor irrigation facilities, rainfall and drought situation in their regions regularly. Similarly, officials have been instructed to hold block and district level review meetings on all Saturdays at 5pm.Officials, however, said there is a glimmer of hope for farmers as India Meteorological Department predicted that a low-pressure area has formed over northwest and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal off south Odisha and north Andhra Pradesh coasts.The low-pressure system has developed under the influence of a cyclonic circulation and is likely to move west-northwest wards during the next two or three days. The system is likely to trigger heavy to very heavy rainfall in several parts of Odisha in the next 48 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/crops-in-102-of-314-blocks-in-odisha-affected-by-rain-deficit-101631021514726.html

The whole district, on average, recorded 152.8mm of rain in the 24 hours ending 8:30 am on September 7, against the daily normal of 14mm, as per rainfall information available with the IMD. All of the Konkan districts have recorded excess rainfall in the last 24 hours, with the exception of Palghar and Thane, the IMD data shows.Mumbai, Thane and Sindhudurg districts, meanwhile, have been placed under an orange category storm warning on Wednesday, with experts and officials warning of very heavy rains in these areas as well. The India Meteorological Department classifies 15.6-64.4 mm as moderate rain while 64.5-115.5 mm rain as heavy, 115.6-204.4 mm as very heavy, over 204.5 mm as extremely heavy rain, and over 300 mm as exceptionally heavy rain.“Areas in Konkan and western Maharashtra that witnessed flooding in July are set to witness moderate to heavy rainfall until 8 September. This will be the first major rainfall event since the July floods, so brace for a possible impact due to landslides and dam discharges,” cautioned Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, UK.Officials say it will be a rough couple of days ahead for the region, with a low-pressure area (which formed over the Bay of Bengal) moving inland and exerting influence on rainfall in central India. The system is now expected to pass over Mumbai sometime after midnight on September 8 and will bring widespread heavy showers to the region during the night and the early morning.“There is also an east-west shear zone of easterly and westerly winds that will come into the vicinity of the low-pressure zone as it moves from Vidarbha toward the coast, and this will increase the intensity of rainfall over Mumbai,” said an official with IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/parts-of-konkan-to-receive-extremely-heavy-rains-in-next-24-hours-imd-101631016598161.html
07-09-2021||Patna||Despite prohibition, continuing hooch deaths big challenge for Bihar govt||Even after nearly five years of prohibition in Bihar, easy liquor availability is not the only issue confronting the state government as deaths caused by spurious liquor point to gaping holes in the implementation of the stringent law.Despite the Covid-19 pandemic induced lockdowns this and previous year, the supply of illicit liquor has claimed several lives in the state. From January till August 26 this year, as many as 64 people died and many others lost their sight after consuming alleged spurious liquor in Nawada, West Champaran, Muzaffarpur and Rohtas districts, police records show.As per police headquarters records, only 70 people died in Bihar after consuming spurious liquor between 2012 and 2015, with maximum 48 deaths reported in 2012 and minimum six in 2015, a year before the prohibition was enforced in Bihar. Post prohibition, between 2016 and 2019, the state reported 58 deaths due to consumption of illicit liquor.“In most cases, however, the government later denies hooch as the cause of death, while family members of the deceased change their statements under pressure to avail compensation and avoid legal action. But everyone knows the reality in the area. The denial syndrome further emboldens those involved with the illicit liquor trade,” said a social activist-cum-prominent trader Hira Prasad. In Vaishali’s Judawanpur police station area, at least five persons died over Wednesday and Thursday last week, while two others were battling for their lives in a private nursing home in the state capital after they were reported to have consumed spurious liquor.The latest alleged hooch deaths were reported from Chaksinghar village of Raghopur riverine area, where Jitendra Kumar Ram and Shiv Kumar Ram died in their houses, while Shivji Paswan breathed his last at the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital after consuming spurious liquor at a local party. Two more victims, Lakhwinder Ram and Dinesh Ram died on Thursday, last week, said Vaishali police chief Maneesh.The SP said that at least three suspects have been arrested and more than six have been detained. Earlier, on Thursday, Vaishali SP and district magistrate (DM) were told byLakhwinder’s wife Lalita that her husband consumed liquor and died after vomiting.Dinesh’s daughter Neha Devi alleged that liquor trade was thriving under the patronage of the police. In July this year, 16 persons died and several lost their eyesight in Lauriya and Ramnagar police stations area of West Champaran district in an alleged hooch tragedy. Till date police have arrested 31 persons and removed the entire police staff of Lauriya police station for inaction. West Champaran SP Upendra Nath Verma said the cause of deaths and eyesight loss has been established through scientific investigation but refused to divulge details till the arrest of an important accused. “Once police nab the last and important accused, we will be able to reply [to questions] in the case”, he added. Similarly, in Nawada, 16 persons, including a teenager, had died due to alleged hooch poisoning after Holi in March. The deceased belonged to Gondapur, Kharidi Bigha, Siswan and New area under Town police station of Nawada. Nawada SP Dhurat Saayli Savlram said that 10 FIRs have been lodged and 20 accused including two women have been arrested for deaths caused by suspected spurious liquor on Holi (March 31). Five officials, including the station house officer (SHO) of Town police station, and an excise sub-inspector, have been suspended. She said viscera reports of five persons had been sent to Patna FSL (Forensic Science Laboratory) to establish if methyl alcohol was used in making the hooch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/despite-prohibition-continuing-hooch-deaths-big-challenge-for-bihar-govt-101631015753509.html
07-09-2021||Delhi||Compassion gives courage: Happy Teachers Day||Strap: ‘I have always felt that the true text-book for the pupil is his Teacher’, says Mahatma Gandhi. On Teachers’ Day, today we bring you three different stories of ordinary people who were doing their everyday job and decided to be a light in someone’s life to brighten up their path. This Police uncle teaches street kids Constable Than Singh, Delhi Police, is a man of grit. He began teaching underprivileged kids near the Red Fort area since 2016. “It’s been more than five years since I first taught these kids. I started with only five to six and now I have more than 35 students. It was not a cake walk. These kids used to pick garbage to earn money and spend it on tobacco and drugs. Their parents are labourers and were against the classes and I had to convince them. While some of my students were a part of the classes for five to six months, some are regular for the last five years. My senior officers visit regularly to motivate these kids. Some even bring their children along and celebrate their birthday. I am doing the best I could, and Delhi Police is my strength,” says Singh, who provides masks and sanitisers to these kids who lovingly call him ‘Police uncle teacher’.Transforming his village, one student at a timeBorn in Timli, Pauri Garhwal, a district in Uttarakhand, Ashish Dabral started working in an MNC in Gurugram, but he wanted to give back to his village. “It was in 2013 when I started travelling to my village on every weekend from Gurugram. In 2016, we started a primary school, Shri Timli Vidyapeeth, to impart education. There used to be a Sanskrit school in the village owned by my great-grandfather. The primary school I started imparts Vedic education along with science and technology. Students from my school even participated in World Robotic Olympiad. I make sure my kids interact with students from other countries through video conference to know their culture, education and thought process. We even engage parents in craft activities and sell products online to generate income. I have shifted to my village to devote myself completely,” he says. Ex-BSF officer whose heart beats for kidsHe runs Birsa Munda High School, Janho-Barwaiya in the tribal region of Jharkhand. Ranjan resigned from the rank of Assistant Commandant of BSF in 2015. “Fortunately, during leave before resignation, I followed a foreigner riding a bicycle in Ranchi and met Prof Jean Dreze. We started talking extensively on various issues specially education scenario of Jharkhand. After resignation I became part of ‘Right to Food Campaign’ and started visiting the remote areas. Then I along with prof Dreze started a initiative called ‘Sahpathi’ through which we invited students of Universities to volunteer in government residential schools of Jharkhand in remote area to interact and understand problems and dreams of Poor’s students. Birsa Munda High School was started in 2018, before which the premises remained non functional for almost a decade. Now we have more classrooms, bench desk, toilets, drinking water facility, a smart TV and few laptops for smart class, playing equipment and other facilities. Most importantly, we have installed 5kv solar plant which provides power supply 24*7. Currently, more than 200 students are staying in hostel of which 70% are girls from tribal and dalit communities,” says Ranjan.

07-09-2021||Other||We have settled most of our differences: Kerala PCC chief K Sudhakaran||Last week, the Congress unit in Kerala plunged into a crisis after the release of the district office-bearers (DCC presidents) list was announced--it triggered public outbursts by several Congress leaders and a series of disciplinary actions followed. Party state president K Sudhakaran MP, a strongman from Communist heartland Kannur, in an interview with HT’s Ramesh Babu, said he is confident that everything will be settled soon, but insisted that discipline is paramount. Edited excerptsCongress in Kerala is in the news for all the wrong reasons. How long will the present stalemate continue?There is no big crisis here as portrayed by the media. In a democratic party like the Congress, it is natural that differences crop up, as is the present case. But discipline is paramount in the party. We have settled most of our differences. Leader of Opposition VD Satheesan had called on senior leaders Oommen Chandy, Ramesh Chennithala and Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan to iron out the wrinkles. I also met them. Since we settled everything, AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar does not need to visit the state now. We will hear seniors’ [grievances] properly. There is no question of any neglect or step-motherly attitude. Our aim is to strengthen the party and turn it into a well-oiled machine. A strong party is the need of hour.Can we call it a generational shift?The new leadership is a proper blend of fresh blood and experienced leaders--we need new ideas, mode and direction. It doesn’t mean seniors leaders will have to take a back-seat. The new team will take a leaf out of their rich experience to reinvigorate the party. The party is supreme and factions can take rest now. Senior leader Oommen Chandy said a couple of days back in Kottayam that the party is first, groups are second.You said the party will be semi-cadre soon. How you are planning it? Any plan to attract more youth? Yes, we will transform it to a new party in six months. It will be a semi-cadre outfit and you can see the difference soon. We will select 2,500 committed cadre--1,000 from Youth Congress and 1,500 from our trade wing INTUC. We will train and groom them. We have to attract more youth. There will be special drives at the grassroots and leaders will oversee them. All office-bearers will have to submit a performance report periodically. These posts are not showpieces--they will have to work on the ground. We will spot exceptional people and groom them. We have to strengthen our student and youth outfits. In 1970s and 1980s, a surge of youth leaders catapulted the party to new highs in the state. We need a similar move. The Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Development Studies in the state capital started regular workshops for them. The new DCC chiefs will also attend such workshop. The party will have a new look and vigour and this will be visible in six months.What do you think of the state’s tackling of the pandemic?I don’t have to say anything in detail--records tell the tale. The state continues to report over 65% of the total Covid-19 cases in the country. Another deadly threat of Nipah has also emerged. This is the third time Nipah cases have emerged--no serious study on the virus has been done. Even the source of the first outbreak in 2018 is still a mystery. My humble request to the government is to hear experts more and avoid politics. The state has the best health infrastructure in the country; despite this we are in a sorry state now. Inept handling and race for cheap publicity landed the government in such a mess. Hope the CM will realise his follies at least now and correct them.There are charges that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is taking the Congress’ space in the state. Do you agree?It is a baseless question. A desperate BJP has tried its best to widen its base but its lone account (a single MLA in the last assembly) was also closed. We played a vital role in that. Among all state units, BJP has the weakest one in Kerala--it doesn’t have a proper leader and infighting rules supreme.What we witness these days is a secret understanding between the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) and BJP. What happened to gold and dollar smuggling cases? High-profile probes stopped abruptly after the CM’s right-hand man was grilled. The Lavalin case (in which CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s name allegedly cropped up) was deferred 28 times in court and most at the initiative of the probe agency (CBI).In return, the CM is protecting state BJP leaders in highway heist and hawala cases (snatching of alleged fund meant for BJP electioneering in Thrissur in last April). The CPI(M)’s Congress-‘mukt’ Kerala will remain a dream. I am sure people will expose this unholy alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/we-have-settled-most-of-our-differences-kerala-pcc-chief-k-sudhakaran-101631015393587.html

In a tweet, Mufti said the administration has told her the situation is far from normal in Kashmir.“GOI expresses concern for the rights of Afghan people but willfully denies the same to Kashmiris. I’ve been placed under house arrest today because according to admin, the situation is far from normal in Kashmir. This exposes their fake claims of normalcy,” Mufti said in her tweet while posting locked gates of her Gupkar home ‘Fairview’ on the Twitter.Mufti had, on Monday, lashed out at the government for not allowing separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani’s family to conduct his last rites.“It’s the right of the family members to conduct the last rites of a person. Here the government didn’t allow family members to conduct last rites, instead the family members of Geelani were beaten, especially women, and also cases slapped against them. India is a very big country and this is against its culture.

07-09-2021||Delhi||Modak and more: Food to please the Vighnaharta||Call him Lord Ganesha or call him Modakapriya (the one who relishes modak), the God of all things auspicious is also known for his love for food. And hence, Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations are never complete without a scrumptious spread. As the country gears up for the festival on September 10, we take a look at all the dishes that make it a foodie’s delight.From modaks to laddoos, devotees of the pot-bellied, elephant-headed, one-tusked God prepare various kinds of sweets as a part of the festivities. “During the prayer, 21 or 101 modaks are offered to Lord Ganesha and the same is then distributed as prasad. Modak is a sweet steamed dumpling prepared with rice flour and filled with jaggery and fresh grated coconut. It is often flavoured with green cardamom and nutmeg powder, and served hot drizzled with melted pure ghee. The steamed version is known as ukadiche modak. This is the traditional way,” says Mumbai-based chef Reetu Uday Kugaji. Other varieties of the modak include flavours such as chocolate, cranberry, coconut, baked orange, boondi modak and much more.However, there is more to the festival than just modaks. “The utterly crispy, spicy multigrain pancake, thalipeeth is a must-try during the festival. The main ingredients of it are chana daal, urad daal, wheat, and rice. One can also enjoy these toothsome pancakes with ghee, butter, pickle or curd,” says chef Santosh Rawat, executive pastry chef JW Marriott Mumbai Sahar. And the list goes on. Rawat continues, “Some of the other sweets made and served include puran poli, which is a flat bread made of refined flour stuffed with sweet lentils and jaggery. Another one is the motichoor laddoo, a delicious melt-in-the-mouth laddoo made with gram flour, sugar, and spices. Amrakhand, made using yogurt and mango puree, is a refreshing variation of the classic shrikhand.” The hotel has curated a decadent box of modaks handcrafted in six flavours such as kesar mawa, rose kalakand, dark chocolate, and slivered pistachio.The feast might be lavish but the ingredients used to prepare it are often simple. Rice, puffed rice, rice flour, semolina, whole-wheat flour, Bengal-gram flour, jaggery, saffron, green cardamom, chana daal, and banana are the usual elements. While the food is sattvic in most Maharashtrian homes, there are some sections, who offer non-veg dishes. “For the Kolis and in parts of Ratnagiri, naivedyam is fish. Some parts of Malwan present a naivedyam of non-veg delicacies, especially for Goddess Gauri. It is an interesting tradition. Day two of the celebration is Rishi Panchami for which Rishi Chi bhaji is made. It consists of vegetables grown without any involvement of cattle in the farming process. I make this every year and send it to friends as it is a rare and seasonal mélange of vegetables, which is fading out,” says chef Varun Inamdar, who serves a complete Maharashtrian fare at The Heritage Street.Recipe of Shrikhand Preparation Time: 10 minutesChilling Time in Refrigerator- 1 ½ hoursServes: 04 .Ingredients and Quantity:Hung Curds- 1 ½ cupPowdered Sugar, sifted- 1/4th cupMilk – 01 tbspChironji seeds, blanched- 02 tspGreen cardamom powder- 1/4 th tspSaffron steeped in a little warm milk-  a few strandsFor Garnish:Saffron strands- 1/4th gmAlmonds, blanched, peeled and slivered / Almond flakes-10 gmPistachio nuts, blanched, peeled and slivered – 10 gmRose petals (dried & edible): 01 tsp (Optional)Pepitas, lightly toasted- 1 tspMuskmelon seeds, lightly toasted-1 tspMethod:In a food processor, add Hung curds and sugarBlend it for 30 secondsAdd milk to adjust consistencyRemove in a glass bowl add green cardamom powder, charoli seeds, saffron steeped in warm milk and mix wellChill the shrikhand in the refrigerator for 1 ½ hourServe chilled garnished with slivered almonds, pistachio nuts , dried edible rose petals and  saffron strands.Recipe by chef Reetu Uday Kugaji||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/modak-and-more-food-to-please-the-vighnaharta-101631015276472.html

The Youth Congress was holding a ‘peaceful’ agitation at the Azad Maidan in Panaji against hike in fuel prices.Around 40 members of the Youth Congress, including local youth Congress leaders, were arrested by the police. The Congress party condemned what they said was an unnecessary lathi-charge by the police and demanded the immediate release of the activists. “It is a fundamental right of the people to hold agitations and to protest. Nobody can stop this. I was a chief minister as well. Morchas used to come to my house. My private home was also not spared. Any function I used to attend, there they used to be morchas. I have faced it. I have never ordered a lathi-charge. I have faced it. Yesterday, some people who were asking questions of the chief minister were arrested. Is this democracy? What kind of democracy is this?” Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat, who was present at the site of the protest, was not arrested,” Digambar Kamat. “Yesterday, some youths who were asking questions of the Chief Minister were arrested. Is this democracy? What kind of democracy? I condemn this lathi-charge. It is a fundamental principle of a democracy that raising your voice, holding agitations and speaking out. We will not hold back and our agitations will continue,” he added. The Congress had organised a protest against rising prices, the weakening economy as well as the ‘monetization pipeline’ that was launched by the Union government. No one was seriously injured in the incident.The protest began with a meeting at the Azad Maidan from where the youth Congress members began to march to the chief minister’s official residence which is a short distance from the Azad Maidan. However, the police set up a picket and didn’t allow the members to march to the CM’s residence prompting a scuffle which resulted in a lathi-charge. “The CM of Goa has failed the people of Goa. He has destroyed jobs. He has destroyed people’s savings and income. He has destroyed the environment of Goa. He has destroyed the pride of the Goan people. We strongly condemn the cowardly action to lathi-charge the YC people who were raising their voice, the pain of the people of Goa. If the CM cannot hear the voices of the people or the YC workers who were agitating for the people of Goa then I would like to tell the CM to step down else we will pull him down,” AICC in-charge, Youth Congress,” Krishna Alluvera said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iyc-members-national-president-lathi-charged-arrested-for-fuel-hike-protest-101631014616546.html
07-09-2021||City||Bengal govt moves Calcutta HC against arrest relief to BJP MLA Suvendu Adhikari||The West Bengal government moved the division bench of the Calcutta high court on Tuesday challenging its ‘interim relief’ to BJP MLA Suvendu Adhikari from arrest in the 2018 bodyguard death case.On Monday, the Calcutta high court granted relief to the Nandigram MLA from 'coercive action' against him without the permission of the court.Adhikari approached the court seeking relief from probes into six cases registered against him in four police stations across the state, alleging that they were “politically motivated."The Crime Investigation Department (CID) had on Sunday summoned Suvendu Adhikari for questioning in connection with a case related to the probe into the unnatural death of his personal security guard Subhabrata Chakraborty, who shot himself with his service revolver at a police barrack in 2018.The CID set up a team to probe Chakraborty's death based on a complaint filed by his wife. Earlier in June, a four-member team of CID sleuths visited Adhikari's home in East Medinipur as part of the ongoing investigation, in which at least 15 people, including some police personnel, have been questioned.The CID summons on a day the Enforcement Directorate asked West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee to appear before it in New Delhi for questioning in connection with an alleged money laundering case.A former henchman of Mamata Banerjee and a prominent leader of the Trinamool Congress, Suvendu Adhikari shifted allegiance to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) last December, months before the assembly elections in West Bengal. The BJP fielded Adhikari against chief minister Mamata Banerjee from the Nandigram assembly constituency. Even as the Trinamool Congress came back to power in the state with a thumping majority for the third term, Adhikari managed to win Nandigram with a wafer-thin margin of 1,900 votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/suvendu-adhikari-west-bengal-government-calcutta-high-court-nandigram-101631011241345.html
07-09-2021||Mumbai||Thane Mayor says corrupt TMC employees hand in glove with unruly hawkers||Mayor of Thane district in Maharashtra, Naresh Mhaske said he has proof that contract workers appointed by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) to act against unruly hawkers in the city were corrupt and compromised. Several Thane corporators, too, agreed that corruption was the root cause behind the hawkers’ menace in the city.“I can give proof that the contract workers appointed by the TMC are on the payrolls of hawkers. Most of the hawkers are from outside the city...,” Mhaske said.The discussion on the irregularities in management of hawkers went on for over eight hours on Monday following the last-month attack, by hawkers, on assistant municipal commissioner (AMC) Kalpita Pingle, when she was on an anti-encroachment drive.Mhaske said that 99% of hawkers in Thane were from outside the city since only 250 of them submitted their address proofs during the registration drive. Corporators from all political parties sought a permanent solution to the hawkers’ menace in the city through speedy implementation of the hawkers’ police and dissolution of the existing hawkers’ committee. Congress corporator Vikrant Chavan made a similar point and said, “Most of those appointed on contract to demolish unauthorised structures put up by hawkers collect bribes from them and allow them to conduct business illegally, leading to an increase in the number of hawkers on the road. There is also a delay in implementing the hawkers’ policy,” he said.Shiv Sena corporator Vikas Repale added, “The hawkers are alerted well in advance about any anti-encroachment drive by some corporation employees, who are hands in glove with them.” Mayor Mhaske said he had directed officials to remove all the hawkers obstructing the roads and footpaths in the city irrespective of the structures being old or new. The general body also passed a resolution to fast track the case against the hawker, who attacked Pingle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-mayor-says-corrupt-tmc-employees-hand-in-glove-with-unruly-hawkers-101631011373215.html

07-09-2021||Mumbai||Chandiwal commission issues bailable warrant against Param Bir Singh||The Justice (retired) Kailas Uttamchand Chandiwal enquiry commission on Tuesday issued a bailable warrant for the arrest of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, as the senior IPS officer has failed to personally appear before the commission.The state government on March 30 appointed the single-member commission headed by the former Bombay high court judge to probe the allegations that Singh made in a letter to the governor and the chief minister. On March 20, three days after he was transferred out of the post of Mumbai CP, Singh shot off a letter to the governor, the CM and others, alleging that former home minister Anil Deshmukh would intermittently summon some Mumbai police officers, such as the then deputy commissioner of police (enforcement) Raju Bhujbal, assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Patil (social service branch) and dismissed assistant inspector Sachin Vaze of the criminal intelligence unit of the crime branch, to his official residence. Deshmukh would then give the officers a target to collect ₹100 crore every month from dance bars, hookah parlours and bars and restaurants in Mumbai, and even suggest that they could easily meet half of the target by simply recovering ₹3 lakh per month from each of the 1,750 establishments in the city, Singh alleged in his letter.Also Read | Corruption case: CBI arrests SI for leaking report, detains Deshmukh’s aideThe panel has been given six months to examine whether Singh submitted the proof to establish that Deshmukh or any staffer from his office committed any offence/ misconduct as alleged in the letter, and whether specific allegations levelled by Singh merited investigation by the state Anti-Corruption Bureau or any other agency.Though Singh is being represented by advocates Sanjay Jain and Anukul Seth before the commission, the one-man panel had earlier imposed a penalty of ₹50,000 on Singh for failing to appear in person and the senior IPS officer has deposited the amount in the state’s Covid Relief Fund, as directed by the panel.The commission has also directed the Maharashtra DGP to issue the warrant through a senior police officer.Advocate Shishir Hiray, who represented the commission, said while interacting with media persons, “The bailable warrant issued against Singh would be executed at the place where he is living now. To get the warrant cancelled he has to appear himself before the commission, along with a bond in the sum of ₹50,000, and only the commission can cancel the warrant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/chandiwal-commission-issues-bailable-warrant-against-param-bir-singh-101631009873289.html
07-09-2021||Mumbai||Rajesh Tope cites Kerala Covid-19 spike to warn people ahead of Ganesh Chaturthi||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday cited Kerala as an example to ask the people to follow guidelines issued to check the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the state, especially during the upcoming Ganesh Chaturthi festival.“During Ganeshotsav celebrations, everyone should follow Covid-19 guidelines issued by the government. The gathering of crowds leads to an increase in the possibility of the spread of infection.

The minister said that the state government is closely monitoring the situation pertaining to the Covid-19. “The final decision will be taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray,” Tope said.On Monday, Uddhav Thackeray urged the people of the state to avoid crowding during the upcoming festivities to avoid Covid-19 cases from rising. The chief minister also warned the political parties for demanding temples be reopened across the state. "Do not agitate for reopening of temples but do it against COVID-19," he had said.Maharashtra witnessed 3,626 Covid-19 cases on Monday — the state’s lowest daily count since February 15 — and 37 related deaths, taking the case positivity rate to 2.49%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ganesh-chaturthi-covid-19-rajesh-tope-maharashtra-coronavirus-protocol-101631006389992.html

TDP national spokesperson Pattabi Ram on Tuesday said that party MLAs and in-charges of all 175 assembly constituencies have been instructed to organise or celebrate the Ganesh Chaturthi festival in a “huge way” while following Covid-19 protocols. “We feel that it is a part of a larger conspiracy by Jagan Reddy to attack one religion,” he alleged. On September 6, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in AP also held state-wide protests demanding the state government allow public celebrations for the Ganesh Chaturthi festival. Party leaders, including state president Somu Veerraju and general secretary Vishnu Vardhan Reddy, and party workers were detained by the police.Also Read | Police detain Andhra BJP chief, gen secy during stir over idol immersion on Ganesh ChaturthiBoth Sudheesh Rambhotla, chief spokesperson for the BJP in AP, and Pattabi Ram pointed out that the ruling Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP), led by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, held a big gathering to observe the memorial of Jagan Mohan Reddy’s father and former chief minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh YS Rajasekhara Reddy on September 2.Chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy held a review meeting on September 2, wherein it was decided to continue the night curfew in AP from 11pm to 6am, keeping in mind the festival season. Based on suggestions from health department officials, it was also decided to limit Ganesh (or Vinayaka) Chaturthi celebrations within homes, instead of holding them in public places.The AP government decided that Ganesh idols cannot be installed in public places and that immersions this year, along with processions, should be avoided. Prior to this, union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on August 28 issued guidelines to chief secretaries of all states and union territories, informing them that Covid-19 guidelines have been extended till September 30.In his letter to the chief secretaries, Bhalla stated that state governments and union territory administrations have been advised to take suitable measures to avoid large gatherings during the coming festive season. He added that if required, local restrictions may be imposed with a view to curb such large gatherings. “In all crowded places, Covid-appropriate behaviour should be strictly enforced,” he wrote.Ganesh Chaturthi, to be celebrated on September 10 this year, is widely observed in cities like Mumbai and Hyderabad. As part of the celebrations, people gather in large numbers to immerse idols in lakes or other water bodies. Many also install Ganesh idols in public pandals. On September 6, AP reported 739 new cases, taking the state’s total tally to 2,022,064. Over the last fortnight, the state has recorded around 1,000 fresh Covid-19 cases everydayThe ruling YSRCP called the TDP’s stand on the issue hypocritical. “The decision was taken with regard to the third (Covid-19) wave. We took a decision based on the Central government’s guidelines. If we would have allowed it, then TDP would have said we are allowing it despite the pandemic, and now they are saying this,” said YSRCP MLA and spokesperson Abbaya Chowdary Kothari.Kothari pointed out that the BJP-ruled neighbouring Karnataka has also placed restrictions on the Ganesh Chaturthi festival. “From our perspective, we are not trying to dictate anything to anyone. Everyone will celebrate the festival, but we don’t want massive rallies or public gatherings. Why are the TDP and BJP not questioning the Centre on this?” he questioned. Political analyst Palwai Raghavendra Reddy opined that the TDP is in a “clueless” position in AP currently because the BJP is trying to take over the main Opposition space. “On these issues, the BJP is taking an aggressive stance. The Telugu Desam is struggling as it cannot do too much of Hindutva, as that will benefit the YSRCP. The former will have to identify issues which are not religiously sensitive,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tdp-to-defy-andhra-govt-s-order-restricting-ganesh-chaturthi-celebrations-101631007892971.html
07-09-2021||Mumbai||Bailable warrant issued against former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh||A bailable warrant has been issued against former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh by the inquiry commission headed by retired Bombay high court judge, Justice Kailas Uttamchand Chandiwal, on Tuesday, for failing to appear before the probe panel in-person.The Maharashtra government had formed the one-person commission in March to probe the allegations levelled by Param Bir Singh against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. In a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Singh had accused Deshmukh of asking police officers in Mumbai to collect money from restaurant and bar owners.The commission was given six months to determine if the allegations levelled by Singh needed to be investigated by the state anti-corruption bureau, if he had submitted sufficient proof to establish that Deshmukh or any staffer from his office committed any misconduct as alleged in the letter, and to offer any suggestions the commission deemed fit. Singh had filed an appeal before the Bombay high court on August 4 seeking orders to disband the commission.In his appeal, Singh stated that since both the Supreme Court and the Bombay high court ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a probe into Singh’s allegations on Deshmukh there was no need for the Chandiwal commission to continue with their inquiry.The Chandiwal commission had issued summons to Singh multiple times but he failed to appear before it. The commission had also imposed penalties of Rs.5,000 in June and of Rs.25,000 twice last month on Singh for failing to appear before it.Four First Information Reports (FIR) have been filed against Singh, of which two have been filed in Mumbai and two in Thane. On August 21, the fourth FIR was registered against Singh by the Mumbai police on the basis of a complaint filed by a businessman accusing Singh of extortion. A lookout notice has also been issued against Singh by the Thane police to prevent him from leaving the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bailable-warrant-issued-against-param-bir-singh-101631006612989.html

07-09-2021||Mumbai||Belagavi civic polls: Shiv Sena calls BJP celebration insult to Maratha martyrs||Terming the loss of the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) in the Belagavi civic polls on Monday “unfortunate”, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut slammed the Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for celebrating the party’s victory by distributing sweets. Raut said the celebration was a betrayal of the 105 hutatma or martyrs who laid down their lives for a united Maharashtra. The BJP, meanwhile, called the win in the local body polls a victory of Hindutva and Marathi manoos.With local body polls approaching early next year in Maharashtra, including in Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Nagpur, Aurangabad among others, the two former allies are targeting each other on the sons of the soil issue and Hindutva agenda. Also Read | BJP city unit demands police case against MP RautShiv Sena had extended its support to MES candidates in the Lok Sabha bypoll held earlier this year, and also during the Belagavi municipal corporation polls--the results of which were announced on Monday. The BJP won 35 of the 58 wards in the city, relegating MES, Congress and other parties to the Opposition benches.Raut, while speaking to reporters in Mumbai, said, “In Belagavi, Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress have never gone to campaign against Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti. The only exception was our old ally, Bharatiya Janata Party. Yesterday [Monday], Ekikaran Samiti lost [the polls], for which they (BJP) celebrated, distributed sweets, expressed joy. It can only be called a misfortune of the 105 hutatmas of Maharashtra that they should distribute sweets for the loss. This is against the sentiments of Maharashtra’s people.”The Sena MP said that the loss of MES was due to the sudden announcement of the polls, leaving little time for the to campaign. He also said that the government split Marathi votes by delimitation of wards. “The loss is unfortunate and the manner in which the Karnataka government is suppressing the voices of the people in the border areas is chilling,” he said.Attacking the BJP further, Raut said, “When the whole of Maharashtra was immersed in sorrow after Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was arrested in Agra by Aurangzeb, some people here were rejoicing that Maharaj has been captured. Similar joy was seen on the faces of the ones who were distributed sweets.”Responding to the attack, BJP legislator and vice-president of the party Prasad Lad said, “I wish to ask Sanjay Raut that weren’t they ashamed to distribute sweets after joining hands with Congress, which had stood against Hindutva and Marathi manoos? The victory in Belagavi is a win for Hindutva and Marathi manoos. Raut saheb should bear in mind that BJP will never forget Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s saffron flag and the unity of Marathi manoos.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/belagavi-civic-polls-shiv-sena-calls-bjp-celebration-insult-to-maratha-martyrs-101631003212652.html

07-09-2021||Jaipur||Congress maintains dominance in Rajasthan Panchayat elections||The Congress government in Rajasthan managed to maintain its dominance in the Pradhan elections for 78 panchayat samitis held on Monday. Congress won 49 panchayat samitis, and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) 25. Congress had a clear majority in 26 panchayat samitis and BJP in 14 panchayat samitis, but both were helped by independent candidates. Rashtriya Loktantrik Party, led by MP Hanuman Beniwal won two panchayat samitis. The Congress and BJP both formed their boards in three zila parishads each out of six where elections were held Monday. In a major setback to the ruling Congress party, rebel Rama Devi won the Jaipur zila pramukh seat as a BJP candidate by defeating her rival by just one vote due to cross-voting in elections. State Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasra termed the development “backstabbing and betrayal” by the party candidate and said that BJP formed the board by dishonesty. Also Read | Soldier ends life after fiancé’s suicide“Congress had got a majority in four out of six zila parishads while BJP gained a clear majority in one zila parishad and in one, it was near majority. However, the BJP has formed boards in three zila parishad and what happened in Jaipur was backstabbing by our colleagues,” Dotasra told reporters. Dotasra said that what happened in Jaipur was an example of what is taught by BJP, RSS, PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. “They grab power by strangulating and murdering democracy. They topple elected governments and this is what they tried to do in Rajasthan last year but could not succeed. BJP has managed to win the election of zila pramukh by dishonesty. It is not the BJP which has won, it is the backstabbing by our people; which has won,” Dotasra said. Rama Devi, who won the zila parishad election as a Congress candidate from ward 17 in the Chaksu assembly constituency, joined the BJP just hours before zila pramukh elections were held on Monday. The ward is part of the assembly constituency of Congress MLA Vedprakash Solanki, who is considered close to former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot. She defeated Congress’ Saroj Devi by just one vote. Enthused with the results, BJP state president Satish Poonia said that this was a trailer for the 2023 assembly elections. “The results disappoint those who feel happy with the defeat of BJP. The public has rejected Congress due to its ideology and conduct. This is a trailer of the 2023 assembly elections,” he said. BJP national general secretary and in-charge, Rajasthan, Arun Singh tweeted that the election result shows that Congress ship is sinking. Despite misusing the government machinery they witnessed defeat, which is the result of infighting as they aren’t able to manage their house, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/congress-maintains-dominance-in-rajasthan-panchayat-elections-101631000992504.html

07-09-2021||Patna||Forest officials propose vulture conservation in Valmiki Tiger Reserve in Bihar||Forest officials have sent a proposal to the Bihar government to set up a vulture conservation centre in the Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VRT) in West Champaran district on the pattern of Uttarakhand’s Corbett National Park with the aim to save the endangered flying scavengers from extinction in the region, forest officials said.HK Rai, wildlife conservator and field director of the reserve, said a recent study has revealed the nesting of vultures at a few places in Valmiki Tiger Reserve. “It is certainly an optimistic sign and there is no reason why we cannot raise their number in VTR. We are planning the recovery programme for Himalayan Griffon vulture and its habitats, among other species of vultures, whose number have dwindled,” he said, citing the reasons behind the proposal, which may cost ₹57.15 lakh to implement, if approvedIn the course of the survey, the forest department says it has spotted the vultures nesting in Madanpur, Gonauli, Harnatand and Bhikhnathori areas of the reserve. “Our study indicates that these places are conducive for the conservation of vultures,” said the wildlife conservator and field director.Emboldened by the study, the forest officials have requested for the deployment of vulture trackers for protection and regular monitoring of their population. Among other measures for their preservation, they recommend commissioning of watch towers, rescue equipment, medicines and vulture-care and disease diagnosis facilities besides creation of water harvesting structures such as bunds, waterholes and ponds.Quoting some studies, Rai said the number of vultures had dwindled in the south Asian region owing to the use of diclofenac, a non-steroidal and anti-inflammatory drug “Though diclofenac is now banned, we still need to educate the villagers about the importance of vulture species in our environment,” Rai said, sharing his future action plan.In VTR, the Udaypur forest area is also known for a number of winged creatures which include jungle bush quail, red jungle fowl, Indian peafowl, cotton pygmy goose, great crested grebe, black bittern bird, little egroot, red-headed vulture, common moorhen, grey-headed lapwing, Asian cuckoo, blue-tailed beater, Indian grey hornbill, grey-capped pygmy, wood picker, yellow-crowned woodpecker and Himalayan gold black are among others. “Each of them has their own significance in maintaining ecological balance,” said a forest official.A vulture conservation centre has come a long way at Corbett National Park Uttarakhand, raising their population. Officials describe the vultures as scavenger birds which play a pivotal role in cleaning up and maintaining ecological balance.“The most striking attributes of vultures lie in more fact than one. Firstly, their beaks are potent enough to break the bones and thereby leave nothing behind. Secondly, they do not get infected even though they feed on dead animals and infected carcasses. For, the acid in their stomach kills the pathogen and thereby they help in breaking the chain of infection,” said JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden, Uttarakhand.“Needless to say they keep the spread of harmful pathogens at bay invisibly,” he added.Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand conserves as many as seven species of vultures which include cinereous vulture, Egyptian vulture, red headed vulture, slender billed vulture, white rumped vulture, Himalayan griffon vulture and Eurasian vulture. “These all are on the red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, (IUCN) with three of them in the critically endangered zone,” said Rajiv Bhartari, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF), Uttrakhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/forest-officials-propose-vulture-conservation-in-valmiki-tiger-reserve-in-bihar-101630998471567.html

07-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi court grants relief to Ford India MD and director in cheating case||A Delhi court has granted relief to Ford India managing director Anurag Mehrotra and director David Allan Schock in a case of cheating filed by a dealer of the car maker. Additional sessions judge Raj Rani at the Rohini court, while allowing the bail application of Mehrotra and Schock on Monday, directed that “in the event of (their) arrest, applicant(s) be released on interim bail for a period of 30 days on furnishing of bail bonds in a sum of ₹5 lakh”. The judge asked them to join the investigation whenever asked by the investigating officer and not to tamper with the evidence/influence the witnesses. According to the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Delhi Police, a case was filed by Libra Cars, a Ford dealer located on GT Karnal Road, New Delhi, in November last year, alleging cheating and criminal breach of trust on the grounds that Ford India had violated the terms of the agreement between the parties by appointing another dealer within a radius of 10km from the complainant’s showroom. Also Read | Delhi HC tells govt to ensure court infra upgradedWhile advocate Vijay Aggarwal appeared for Mehrotra, advocate Rohit Kochhar represented Schock during the arguments. Aggarwal told the court that the allegations made in the First Information Report (FIR) were purely civil in nature and there was a delay of more than 18 months on part of the complainant in the registration of the case. The dealership was terminated in March 2019. Aggarwal and Kochhar further argued that Ford India has nothing to do with the alleged offences as it is not the company which cheated Libra Cars, rather the dealer himself cheated the public at large as he did not follow the terms and conditions in the agreement of dealership. While granting relief, the court observed that the investigating officer has nowhere stated that custodial interrogation/arrest of Ford India MD and director is required. “IO submitted that accused David Allan Schock, who is a resident of USA, has joined the investigation through video conferencing and Anurag Mehrotra has also joined the investigation. IO has also not stated that the specimen signature of applicant is required,” the order states. It says the reply filed by the investigating officer also states that the complaint (by Libra) is devoid of any substance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-court-grants-relief-to-ford-india-md-and-director-in-cheating-case-101630996072025.html

Such a program, especially during the ongoing political crisis, was a message to the party high command that Pilot has mass support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/political-message-in-tree-plantation-drive-across-rajasthan-on-pilot-s-birthday-101630990492750.html

The area is one of the pollution hotspots in the national capital and the tower will help bring the levels of pollutants down.Union ministers Bhupendra Yadav and Ashwani Choubey are expected to participate in the inauguration function and dedicate the structure to the public under the 'National Clean Air Program'.The tower, built by Tata Company, has a capacity of 1,000 cubic metres per second.On August 23, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated a similar structure in Connaught Place in central Delhi. The smog tower was inaugurated at Baba Kharak Singh Marg months before the pollution level spikes in the national capital due to burning of crop waste by farmers.Smog towers are structures designed to work as large-scale air purifiers. They are fitted with multiple layers of air filters and fans at the base to suck the air.After the polluted air enters the smog tower, it is purified by the multiple layers before being re-circulated into the atmosphere. This is called the downdraft air-flow model.It is also built with similar technology used to construct the Connaught Place tower. Both the towers have been built by Tata Projects Limited (TPL), with technical assistance from IIT Bombay and in collaboration with IIT Delhi.Following high pollution levels in the national capital, the Supreme Court had in November 2019 asked the Centre and the Delhi government to come up with a road map on installing smog towers in the national capital region (NCR) to combat air pollution.Delhi was the most polluted capital city in the world in 2020 for the third consecutive year, according to a report by a Swiss group (released in March this year) that ranked cities based on their air quality measured in terms of the levels of ultrafine particulate matter (PM 2.5) that can enter the organs and cause lasting damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-smog-tower-to-be-inaugurated-at-anand-vihar-today-101630972423486.html

It should continue in public interest and the sentiments of the people of Shimla should be honoured,” said Jaswinder Singh, president, Gurudwara Singh Sabha .On the other hand, senior medical superintendent Janak Raj said, “Hospitals are run as per rules and regulations, not sentiments. Activists of the Congress’ youth brigade led by Virender Singh Banshthu also staged a demonstration outside the hospital “How is it that the administration realised that the langar was being run illegally after seven years?

07-09-2021||Chandigarh||5 days after Geelani’s death, mobile internet restored in 8 districts of Kashmir||Mobile internet was restored in eight districts of Kashmir division on Monday, five days after a clampdown was imposed after separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani’s death. The services were restored after 7pm in all districts of the Valley, except Srinagar and Budgam. “Mobile internet will be open shortly today by 7pm in all districts except Srinagar & Budgam. Will review about Srinagar & Budgam tomorrow afternoon,” said inspector general of police (IGP, Kashmir) Vijay Kumar in a tweet. Businesses opened partially and traffic started plying in Jammu and Kashmir.In Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, markets and shops were opened partially, while public transport also resumed in some areas. Private vehicles were also seen plying on roads. Javaid Ahmad, who owns a shop in the city centre, says, “Many markets had opened in Lal Chowk by the afternoon, although not a 100%. Transport services have also resumed.” In the Old City, some areas remained shut. “Normal life is still partially affected. Shops remained closed in Nowhatta, Hawal and Eidgah, while markets opened in Khanyar, Rainawari and Khayam,” said Muzaffar Ahmad, a resident of Down Town. Complete shutdown in Kulgam A large number of security personnel were also deployed across Kashmir. Normality was established in Anantnag, Pulwama, Shopian and Baramulla, whereas a complete shutdown was observed in Kulgam. Authorities had imposed a clampdown across Kashmir after the death of 91-year-old separatist leader on Wednesday evening. Streets were barricaded and key roads were sealed to restrict the movement of people in a clampdown similar to the one imposed after the nullification of the region’s semi-autonomous status in 2019. Internet connections and mobile networks were snapped and only post-paid mobiles of BSNL and its broadband services were allowed to work. Mobile calling and broadband internet services were restored on Friday night and restrictions were partially eased, unannounced, in parts of Kashmir on Saturday.Geelani, who spent around two decades in jail, had died after a prolonged illness. He was buried at a graveyard near his residence in Srinagar’s Hyderpora around 4.30am on Thursday. However, his family alleged that the police had forcibly taken away his body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/5-days-after-geelani-s-death-mobile-internet-restored-in-8-districts-of-kashmir-101630962348920.html
07-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A cubicle like no other||It looks like a cave, but completely of wood. The tiny store in Old Delhi’s Galli Choori Wallan street has its doorway flanked on either side with a tall column of petis, or wooden crates. The boxy space inside the doorway is crammed on three sides by stacks of wooden slabs. And here sits Liyakatullah. It’s a sluggish afternoon and he is having his post-lunch chai. From across the street, the scene resembles a Mughal miniature painting.In his 50s, the nimble-limbed Liyakatullah makes petis for bazar merchants. “Before me, my father Barkatullah would sit here and make similar petis. Before my father, my grandfather Kifayatullah would sit here and make similar petis.”Like many people in the Walled City, Liyakatullah talks of the past as if it was something that had happened this morning, just after breakfast. “This lane used to be full of tinke wale, who would make tinke wali tokri,” he says, referring to little baskets woven out of jute grass. In the old times, he says, the shopkeepers here would have their lunch delivered from home in those quaint baskets—they are now replaced by plastic baskets. The tinke wale workers are gone too. “Only a few elderly people can tell you that this street wasn’t known as Galli Choori Wallan, or the bangle sellers street, but as Galli Tinke Walli.”As he stays perched on his heirloom seat, it is easy to reduce Liyakatullah to his cubicle. As if all of him consisted of his inherited occupation. But the modest man has transcended those limitations, and has lately earned the reputation of one of the Walled City’s most respected kabutarbaz, or pigeon trainer. It is said that a kabutar groomed by “Liyakat” can fly miles before returning to its owner’s rooftop—whereas an average pigeon might cross ten rooftops at best before returning. “I learned kabutarbazi from Ustad Sultan of Galli Bundu Paan Wali street in Urdu Bazar” he says in a low voice, as if embarrassed to talk of his distinguishing trait.By now the tea break is over, and Liyakatullah retreats to the concerns of his unique cubicle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-cubicle-like-no-other-101630961655188.html
07-09-2021||Delhi||DDA revamp drive at fault for Nehru Place flooding: Traders||Basements of several buildings in Nehru Place flooded during last Wednesday’s heavy rains, and traders have blamed the mess on poor site management by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which is undertaking a comprehensive redevelopment of one of the city’s key business hubs.Inder Kohli, a member of the Nehru Place Welfare Association, said, “Last Wednesday, basements of close to 20 buildings, including the cloth market, were flooded. Traders had to deploy people to pump out the water. DDA has dug up the market for redevelopment work. The market is haphazardly dug up and the pace of work is so slow.”Traders also alleged that DDA has not upgraded the stormwater drain network.“The rain water harvesting points are not constructed properly and are leaking. There is no drainage plan. We have the transformers in the base. It is so risky if the basements get flooded,” said Kohli.The authority started the ₹99-crore redevelopment work at Nehru Place in 2019. The work includes the revamp of plaza, facades, strengthening of storm water drain system and construction of toilets.A senior DDA official, however, said the basements of private buildings were flooded due to seepage.“DDA has close to 10 buildings in the market and no flooding was reported from there. Most of the buildings in the market have been constructed by private developers and property owners have to get the seepage problem fixed. The flooding has nothing to do with the ongoing development work,” said the official who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-revamp-drive-at-fault-for-nehru-place-flooding-traders-101630961502750.html
07-09-2021||Chandigarh||Denial of last rites to Geelani’s family against humanity: Mehbooba Mufti||Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti on Monday said that the current dispensation was afraid of the body of senior separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani and said that the government could not ask people to like or dislike a leader on gunpoint. The Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president said that the government should have allowed Geelani’s family to perform the last rites. “Instead, Geelani’s family members, including women, were beaten up and cases were slapped against them,” she said, adding, “India is respected across the world for its democracy and in a democracy everybody has right to put forth their perspective.” “You cannot ask people to Iike or dislike a leader on gunpoint,” she Mehbooba. “Without any call, people voluntarily closed their shops and business establishments. Even those who did not like Geelani’s ideology were hurt by the government’s treatment of Geelani’s body,” Mufti said. Geelani, 91, passed away on Wednesday night and his family alleged that his body was snatched by police forcibly and buried at Hyderpora graveyard without their consent. Former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti on Sunday had said that Kashmir has been turned into an open air prison. “Having turned Kashmir into an open air prison, now even the dead aren’t spared .A family isn’t allowed to mourn & bid a final farewell as per their wishes. Booking Geelani sahab’s family under UAPA shows GOI’s deep rooted paranoia & ruthlessness.This is New India’s Naya Kashmir,” tweeted Mehbooba Mufti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/denial-of-last-rites-to-geelani-s-family-against-humanity-mehbooba-mufti-101630961629101.html

It is not for luxury, it is absolutely essential... hearing of cases through online mode may have to be resorted to for an indefinite time before we are able to resume full physical functioning of courts,” the court said.“If the Delhi government turns down the proposal, it shall place before the court a complete statement of expenses incurred from April 2020 on subsidies and public advertisements,” the court added.On Monday, Delhi government counsel, Shadan Farasat, told the court that a proposal had been floated by the law department for consideration, approval and implementation of a hybrid hearing project in all the Delhi district courts, with a preliminary assessment estimating the cost at ₹227 crore.The bench said that the Delhi government cannot be seen as dithering in providing infrastructure and other facilities for functioning of trial courts through hybrid mode, adding that “this is a bullet which they have to bite”.The court was hearing two pleas by lawyers Anil Kumar Hajelay and Manashwy Jha seeking various prayers, including to conduct hybrid hearings in district courts on physical hearing days in view of Covid.On Monday, Farasat submitted that the proposal was forwarded to the Finance minister Manish Sisodia who has sent it back for discussion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-tells-govt-to-ensure-court-infra-upgraded-101630961187839.html

After such harshness the authorities are now harassing the family with FIRs and threats of arrests,” it said.The Hurriyat said the people of Kashmir stand with Geelani’s family “in this hour of grief and injustice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hurriyat-faction-condemns-fir-against-geelani-s-family-101630960847388.html

Khadakpada police officers found the husband of the victim missing and suspected that he allegedly murdered her by hitting her head with a rock. A team of officers is on the lookout for the accused.The victim , Lakshmi Mohite, a resident of Savad village in Bhiwandi, came to the locality every day to work in several households . Her body was spotted by residents around 10am, lying in a pool of blood on the side of the road that connects Kalyan city to Titwala. Most of the road is under construction.Ashok Pawar, senior inspector of Khadakpada, said that the investigation is in process. He added, “We found her head hit by a rock, which prima facie looks like the reason for her death. We have sent the body for post mortem and contacted her relatives. They informed us that the couple regularly fought with each other. Her husband is completely untraceable. We are checking the CCTV footage of the area and have begun the search for her husband Janardhan Mohite.”The woman was living with her maternal uncle and worked for a few relatives in Kalyan to repay a loan she had taken. Her husband was upset about it and would fight with her. Lakshmi was his second wife and he insisted that they live together with the first wife and add the name of the first wife in Lakshmi’s properties in her village. She refused to agree, because of which he would often allegedly hit her and tortured her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/25yearolds-body-found-in-kalyan-near-mumbai-101630960487388.html
07-09-2021||Chandigarh||Kashmir emerging as golfing paradise||The picturesque Kashmir Valley is emerging as the country’s golfing capital with the number of visiting golfers up by 15 times this year. Buoyed by the response from golfers, the J&K administration is planning to hold seven golf tournaments in Kashmir over the next two months in which 126 top golfers from the country and abroad are participating. Jammu and Kashmir has six world standard golf courses, comprising three in Srinagar, one each at Pahalgam, Gulmarg and Jammu. The army and police have smaller golf courses for their personnel at different places in the valley. An upbeat tourism and culture secretary Sarmad Hafeez says, “The golfing circuit of Jammu and Kashmir, particularly Srinagar’s iconic Royal Springs Golf Course and Pahalgam Golf Course, provides unparalleled world-class experience. Seven golf tournaments of national and international standards are to be held over two months, including the PGTI-Pro tournament.” Hafeez says golf packages are being launched to attract more golfers. “This way, tourism in Jammu and Kashmir is picking up with heritage, adventure and golf being on the enquiry list of prospective tourists.” Preparations on in full swing According to officials, the Gulmarg Golf Course is being redone. The 18-hole course located in a meadow at an elevation of 2,650 metres, is the highest green golf course in the world. After remaining closed for seven years after the devastating floods of 2014, the Kashmir Golf Course, which has been relaid, and its fairways and greens redone, was thrown open last month. An academy has come up at the golf course where young boys and girls are being trained. The Jammu-Tawi Golf course has been developed to match international standards. The scenic Pahalgam Golf course at an altitude of 2,150m is surrounded by fir-covered mountains with bare, snow-capped peaks rising behind them. Hafeez says all 100 caddies and other staff members at the golf courses have been inoculated. “Now, all major cities in the country have direct air connectivity with Srinagar and Jammu. The tourist inflow to the Valley, includes golfers.” The Royal Springs Golf Course has hosted many national and international events and its beauty always attracts ace golfers from different places. In the backdrop of Zabarwan Forest Range, the course is surrounded by forests. This 18-hole golf course has practice fairways of approximately 225m with three lakes, two marshes, a club house, and 8.5km cart path. The course is spread over 100 hectares of land. Mega golf tournament in October Chairperson of the Kashmir chapter of PHD Chamber of Commerce, Baldev Singh, said a mega golf tournament will be organised in Srinagar in October. “As many as 200 golfers from India and abroad will take part in the mega tournament at the Royal Springs Golf Course. Invitation has been extended to many ambassadors and hopefully the event will attract a good number of tourists, especially golfers to Jammu and Kashmir,” he said.Dr Jaspreet Singh, who lives in Chandigarh, had recently travelled to Srinagar with his wife to play golf in the scenic Valley. “I regularly fly to Srinagar to play golf. Two months ago, I played at the Royal Springs Golf Course and am planing to return in October. Other golfers should also visit Kashmir as it is only a 35-minute journey.” Manzoor Ahmad, a local golfer, said Kashmir has lovely courses with international standards. “Golf can be promoted as tourism sport, but there is a lot that still needs to be done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kashmir-emerging-as-golfing-paradise-101630960247485.html
07-09-2021||Mumbai||Mangroves across Mumbai to get CCTV cameras||To stop destruction and encroachment on mangroves, the chief minister-headed Mangrove and Marine Biodiversity Conservation Foundation has approved a plan to install closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras at over 100 locations in Mumbai and around the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray gave nod to the plan to set up 279 CCTV cameras in three phases, which is expected to cost ₹35 crore over the next five years. Thackeray, during the fourth meeting of the foundation held at Varsha bungalow, said mangroves should be preserved and directed officials of the mangrove cell to plant more mangroves along the coastal areas of the state. The Mangrove and Marine Biodiversity Conservation Foundation of Maharashtra is an autonomous society that assists the state government in coastal marine conservation. Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests, mangrove cell, said the recurring cost of the CCTV network is expected to be ₹5 crore per year, while the one-time expense is ₹10 crore. “There are 106 spots where 279 cameras will be put up in phases. In phase one, we will have CCTVs installed at Bhiwandi and Mira-Bhayander, which are chronic spots. In the second phase, western suburbs areas like Charkop and Malwani will get the CCTV network, while in the third phase, it will be installed in the eastern suburbs and Navi Mumbai,” Tiwari said. The CM also approved setting up of a mangrove research and training centre at Bhakti Park, Wadala. According to a statement from the chief minister’s office, at the meeting, Thackeray suggested that a large-scale public awareness campaign should be carried out to save mangroves and that they should be planted in the coastal areas.He also said areas being developed by the Mangrove Cell, the flamingo santuary in Thane Creek and other activities should be promoted to boost nature tourism. Tiwari said the council also approved the purchase of patrolling boat which is estimated to cost ₹1 crore, which will patrol coastal areas to save mangroves, dolphines, turtles, and other marine animals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/eyes-on-mangroves-nod-for-plan-to-set-up-cctvs-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-101630959287289.html

07-09-2021||Mumbai||Highest pollution levels in Chembur, Deonar, Mahul: Mumbai Climate Action Plan data||According to information presented during a public consultation on Monday – pursuant to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) proposed climate action plan for the city – the M-East (M-E) ward was found to suffer from the highest levels of air pollution out of the 24 administrative wards in Mumbai.This is not out of the ordinary, experts and officials emphasised, as areas within M-E– Chembur, Deonar, Mahul, Govandi, among others – have long been notorious for higher pollution levels owing to the presence of a power plant at Trombay, the Deonar landfill and petroleum refineries among other contributing factors.Though raw data used by the World Resources Institute (WRI), India, in arriving at this assessment is not publicly available, experts working on drafting the Mumbai Climate Action Plan (MCAP) said that M-E ward suffers from “consistently higher levels” of gaseous pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. This was based on the analysis of remote sensing data from June 2019 to May 2020, obtained from the European Space Agency’s Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite.An official with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), occupying the post of regional officer, said, on the condition of anonymity, said, “M-E ward is certainly the most polluted. There is presence of a power plant and refineries in addition to a construction boom in the past two decades which has led to illegal dumping of construction waste in open areas, contributing to air pollution. The geography of the area also does not allow for coastal winds to clean up particulate matter the way it happens on the western sea front, as Trombay hills act as windbreakers. Another major source of pollution in the area is informal recycling units, which burn waste to obtain scrappable metals from waste.”However, the problem of gaseous pollutants is not confined to M-E ward alone. WRI India’s presentation also showed other wards – M-West (Chembur), H-W (Bandra, Khar) and H-E (Bandra East, Dharavi, Mahim), G-North (Dadar), F-N (Matunga), K-E (Andheri East), L (Kurla) and N (Ghatkopar) wards –to be suffering from a high concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which emanates largely from power generation, industries and diesel use (mainly in heavy duty vehicles). Carbon monoxide pollution was also found to be high mainly in T (Mulund West), G-South (Worli), F-S (Parel) and M-W wards, while sulphur dioxide pollution was found to be highest in H-W, H-E, G-N, F-N, M-W and S (Bhandup) wards.In addition to gaseous pollutants, pollution control board and IIT Madras (IIT-M) data analysed by WRI found that south and central Mumbai suffer from the highest concentrations of PM2.5 – respirable particulate matter which is about thirty times thinner than a human hair – between June 2019 and May 2021. K-E ward (where the airport is located) was found to have an average annual concentration of around 100ug/m3 (micrograms per cubic metre of air), which is more than double the safe limit of 40ug/m3. However, the lack of disaggregated data in the WRI’s presentation makes it hard to pinpoint the distribution of PM2.5 across the city.Debi Goenka, executive trustee, conservation action group (CAG), said, “M-E ward may be the most polluted area in the city, but the BMC would have been aware of this since the early 1980s. The real question is why and who is accountable for this? Will BMC move the industries out of the area now? Authorities, including BMC and MPCB (Maharashtra Pollution Control Board), have both previously maintained that there is no air pollution in the area, especially when they wanted to set up slum rehabilitation projects in Mahul. It’s a bit too late to admit to the obvious now.”As a part of the environment status report for BMC, the Environmental Pollution Research Centre (EPRC) of King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital had carried out a respiratory morbidity survey of 2,483 patients across the city between 2015 -16, mostly focusing on workplaces and residential areas. The study stated that of the 406 residents surveyed at Mahul village in Chembur, 46.7% were unhealthy. At Bainganwadi in Deonar, more than four of every 10 respondents had respiratory problems. Chembur has also been recognised as a ‘critically polluted area’ with respect to air quality by the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) latest available Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI) assessment in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/highest-pollution-levels-in-chembur-deonar-mahul-mumbai-climate-action-plan-data-101630958867162.html

CHB had in 2019 issued a policy to allow residents to regularise unauthorised constructions in their flats. Originally, the regularisation policy was announced in 2017. But only 40 applications were received whereas CHB’s 2020 survey had revealed that 90% of its 65,000-odd dwelling units had massive structural violations.The 2019 policy is applicable only for the additions or alterations within CHB dwelling units and not encroachments. In case violations are not removed, at own cost, allotment may be cancelled and possession resumed. CHB had directed that a certificate of structural stability of the building has to be submitted. In its April 2021 order, the CHB stated action against additional constructions or alterations will be kept pending till December 21, 2021. However, allottees who do not deposit the penal charge on the basis of self-certified area, may be issued notices of demolition or cancellation thereafter.The CHB allottees complain that need-based changes allowed by the CHB didn’t resolve their problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chb-to-take-up-one-time-settlement-issue-in-sept-8-meeting-101630958629506.html

07-09-2021||Mumbai||1,700 active mucormycosis cases in Maharashtra, protect Covid patients, say experts||More than 1,700 patients with mucormycosis — an invasive fungal infection — are currently under treatment in Maharashtra. State health authorities have expressed concern and have advised doctors to take utmost care in order to reduce the possibility of Covid-19 patients catching this opportunistic infection. “The fatality rate in mucormycosis is more than 20%,” additional chief secretary (health) Pradeep Vyas said in an online conference, which was attended by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and health authorities from across the state. “The surgery often involves removal of eyes and mandible, and causes disfigurement. The overall cost of treatment of mucormycosis is also very high,” he said, adding that mucormycosis cases go up when Covid-19 is not treated properly. Commonly known as black fungus, mucormycosis is caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes that are present in the environment. These fungi attack humans who are battling illnesses such as Covid-19, when the body’s immunity is at its lowest. A large number of mucormycosis cases have been seen in Covid-19 patients, who had undiagnosed diabetes or had uncontrolled sugar levels while undergoing the treatment. Nurse-driven sugar control protocols for mucormycosis“Nearly 80% of patients who have contracted mucormycosis had poor sugar control,” said Dr Rahul Pandit from Fortis Hospital who is a member of the Covid-19 task force. Read: Maharashtra govt caps rate for black fungus treatment at private hospitals“In our unit, we did not use a lot of steroids and we ensured good sugar control of patients. Due to these measures, we did not have a single case of mucormycosis between March 2020 and May 2021,” he said. The medicines given as standard in Covid-19 care, including steroids, contribute to increasing blood sugar level. Pandit advises that hospitals should have “nurse-driven sugar control protocols” for intensive care units (ICU) and high dependency units. Nurses should be trained to constantly monitor and update sugar fluctuations in patients and alert doctors. Covid-related mucormycosis cases so farMaharashtra has recorded 10,104 cases and 1,328 deaths due to mucormycosis so far. Of the 1,718 patients currently undergoing treatment, the highest number of cases is in Nagpur at 467. Many patients travel to bigger cities for mucormycosis surgeries as hospitals in rural areas don’t have specialists and advanced surgical setups. For instance, nearly half of the mucormycosis patients treated at the civic-run KEM Hospital in Mumbai were from outside Mumbai. “One-third of the patients required at least three surgeries to remove the infected tissues,” said Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital. The hospital currently has 24 patients on treatment. During the peak in May, there were 124 mucormycosis patients being treated at one point in time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/1700-active-mucormycosis-cases-in-maharashtra-protect-covid-patients-say-experts-101630958627148.html

The agency contended that Wilson’s brother can attend the family’s prayers and the presence of the accused was not necessary at the venue. Wilson had filed the plea on Saturday through advocates Satyanarayan Iyer and Neeraj Kumar and sought temporary bail for two weeks, starting September 13.NIA, through its counsel Prakash Shetty, filed a reply to the plea. “The final rites of Wilson’s father are already over. The family prayer on death of his father can be attended by brother and other family members of the applicant. The applicant’s presence is not necessary. He is simply creating a ground for his release. Accordingly, he may carry out illicit activities and influence and tamper with the prosecution’s evidence. The application is devoid of merits,” NIA has said in its reply.Kumar pointed out to the court that recently, the Bombay high court had granted temporary bail to another accused in the case, human rights lawyer Surendra Gadling, to visit his native place and perform rites on his mother’s first death anniversary.He also highlighted that Wilson had cooperated with the investigators till now, since his house had been searched on April 18, 2018, and his arrest on June 6, the same year.The jailed activist’s father had died on August 18. Wilson, through his counsel said, at this time, if he is given the liberty to meet his family and participate in the mass, the accused could get some solace and hence, filed the bail application.Wilson has said that as per customs, a function has been organised on the 30th-day ritual that falls on September 16. Wilson has also annexed a letter from St Sebastian Church about the function.Special NIA judge Dinesh E Kothalikar has posted the matter for decision on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the court on Monday also heard the bail application filed by another accused, Vernon Gonsalves, citing the Covid-19 recommendations of the state’s high-power committee. Gadling and Gonsalves had filed for bail citing the Covid-19 guidelines, while another accused, professor Shoma Sen, has filed a fresh bail application on health grounds. Kabir Kala Manch Members Sagar Gorkhe, Jyoti Jagtap and Ramesh Gaichor along with Mahesh Raut have also filed regular bail applications, citing that they have been framed in the case and there was no evidence against them.The court has kept their pleas for hearing on September 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-nia-opposes-rona-wilson-s-plea-for-bail-to-visit-kerala-101630958507060.html

Even UT adviser Dharam Pal had highlighted the poor management of these lots.During the meeting on September 1, the MC chief had also told the parking contractors to prominently display rate lists besides “No Parking” and “No Haphazard Parking” signs wherever needed. Pictures of number plates of serious violators have to be taken and action must be initiated against them in coordination with police and MC authorities. A WhatsApp group has been created for the purpose.Contractors will also have to ensure proper quality uniform for attendants deployed at the parking lots. “The MC had got all men trained again. I have directed that all personnel be given whistles and extra manpower be provided to manage internal parking. Inspections will be carried out Friday onwards,” said Mitra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhnow-get-occupancy-updates-at-parking-lot-entrance-101630958388147.html

Also, online OPD slots at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, will be increased by 33%.UT health secretary Yashpal Garg made these announcements after a surprise visit to the two government hospitals on Monday. “At GMSH, there was a huge rush for OPD registration and it was very difficult to maintain social distancing. During the day, about 1,800 OPD registrations were done,” said Garg. He said the issue was discussed with the Society for Promotion of IT in Chandigarh (SPIC) and it was found feasible to allow registrations at Sampark Centres for nominal charges around ₹10.It was also decided that online registration should be encouraged and a separate window should be created at GMSH so that online registered patients can get barcode printed OPD cards without any hassle, Garg said. Accommodation for attendants“A front desk is also to be provided at the hospital so that all information about the indoor patients is available at one place and the visitors don’t have to run around,” directed Garg.For the attendants of indoor patients at the two hospitals, dormitory accommodation will be provided at UT Guest House No 2 (earlier known as Panchayat Bhawan) on priority.“The director hospitality is to provide such accommodation out of the available 100 dormitories, on the basis of documents relating to indoor admission,” Garg said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhopd-registration-for-gmsh-16-at-sampark-centres-too-101630958208250.html
07-09-2021||Mumbai||PMLA case: Deepak Kochhar challenges special court order against him||Deepak Kochhar, the husband of former managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) of ICICI Bank Chanda Kochhar, has approached Bombay high court (HC), seeking quashing of the January 30 order of the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court which had directed initiation of process against him being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The agency’s investigation relates to siphoning off high value loans from ICICI Bank worth ₹300 crore. Kochhar has claimed that while in 2020, the statutory adjudicating authority under PMLA had clearly stated that the said property was not proceeds of crime, ED had suppressed the fact before the special court and got an order for seizure. In light of this, Kochhar sought quashing of the PMLA court order. In the petition filed through advocate Dadhichi Mhaispurkar, Kochhar has challenged the order of the special judge which is based on the Enforcement Case Information Report of ED. Through the order, the special judge had not only taken cognisance but also summoned Kochhar as well as other accused in the offence. The petition stated that the order is without jurisdiction and was obtained by ED after suppression of the fact that on November 6, 2020, the adjudicating authority under PMLA Act had held: “The very same properties which are alleged as proceeds of crime in the prosecution complaint did not amount to proceeds of crime and thus not involved in money laundering.” Kochhar has also pointed out that in 2019 the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had not found any evidence to file a charge sheet against Kochhar or any other person. The petition stated that the special court’s order amounted to violation of his rights under Article 21 and hence sought its quashing, and also sought a stay on the operation of the order till the petition is heard. The petition will come up for hearing on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pmla-case-deepak-kochhar-challenges-special-court-order-against-him-101630958206935.html

According to the state agriculture department, all 14 blocks of Bathinda and Mansa, the two biggest cotton-producing districts of Punjab, have reported the pest attack. A total of 3.25 lakh hectares is under cotton cultivation in Punjab. Nearly 5% of the area under the crop in Bathinda (96,000 hectares) and Mansa (65,000 hectares) is under the pest attack. Agriculture officials said presently there is no serious threat to cotton production. The maiden picking of the three-picking cycle of cotton is expected to begin after September 15 whereas farmers have started harvesting in the early-sown fields.BT cotton is resistant to American bollworm, but experts say it is susceptible to the pink bollworm as has been seen in Maharashtra, Gujarat and now in Punjab for the second consecutive year. Sources said last year, traces of pink bollworm were found in few pockets of 20 villages in Bathinda and Mansa but in the last few weeks, the pest’s presence is felt in the larger area of the cotton belt.Experts and the agriculture department blame oil mills, cotton ginning units and a section of villagers for ignoring the laid-down protocol to avoid the pest.Bathinda chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh said an intense surveillance was started at the village level from Monday.“Our teams have started holding awareness and field inspection camps and the task in both districts would be completed by Saturday. At present, the economic threshold level of the pest is within permissible limits,” said Singh, who also is in charge of Mansa.Economic threshold level is pest density at which control measures should be applied to prevent increasing pest population. Agriculture development officer Ajaypal Brar said the permissible limit is five adults per cotton ball or flower and the initial inputs suggest in the most area the infestation is not critical.“The next 15-20 days are crucial to containing the infestation. Farmers have been advised for regular inspection of fields and go for spray only if the pest infestation is beyond ETL,” said Brar. Sharanjit Singh, a progressive farmer from Mansa’s Mann Khera village, said cotton growers were hoping for a remunerative season due to high prices being offered by traders but the pest attack in the region is a cause of concern.“Farmers should have completely removed cotton straw, which is used as firewood or consumed to energise brick kilns completely from the fields. Now, the use of additional sprays of pesticides means an avoidable increase in the cost of production,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cotton-growers-agri-dept-on-toes-as-pink-bollworm-pest-spreads-tentacles-in-south-punjab-101630958148259.html
07-09-2021||Chandigarh||4 ASIs booked for taking bribe for letting off men carrying unaccounted cash in Jalandhar, 2 held||Four assistant sub inspectors (ASIs) of Jalalndhar rural police have been booked under charges of corruption and extortion for allegedly accepting ₹4 lakh bribe for letting off two men who were carrying ₹25 lakh unaccounted cash at Phillaur on September 3. The accused ASIs are Husan Lal, Sukhwinder Singh, Kuldeep Singh and Parmod Kumar who were on duty at a checkpoint on the Jalandhar-Ludhiana national highway in Phillaur. While Hussan Lal and Sukhwinder have been arrested, Kuldeep and Parmod were absconding, officials said. The police have recovered ₹3.97 lakh bribe amount from the arrested accused. “The four stopped a Maruti Alto car for checking at the high-tech checkpoint, where high-resolution CCTV cameras are installed. When they found ₹25 lakh unaccounted cash in the car, they demanded ₹4 lakh from the vehicle occupants, identified as Vishal Bajaj of Abohar and Jasbir Singh of Tarn Taran. The cops let the two off after accepting the money,” a police official said. When Phillaur police station in-charge Sanjeev Kapoor learnt about the incident, he informed his senior officials and lodged a case against the ASIs. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Harneel Singh said the source of the money the car occupants were carrying will be clear once they are arrested. “Our teams are trying to trace the ASIs and the two car occupants. A case was registered against the accused cops under section 384 (punishment for extortion) of the Indian Penal Code and section 7of the Prevention of Corruption Act,” he added. Interestingly, the police checkpoint is monitored by the office of the Jalandhar senior superintendent of police (SSP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/4-asis-booked-for-taking-bribe-for-letting-off-men-carrying-unaccounted-cash-in-jalandhar-2-held-101630958146857.html
07-09-2021||Chandigarh||Bus services in Punjab hit as roadways contractual staff goes on strike||Seeking regularisation of their jobs, nearly 8,200 outsourced and contractual employees of the Pepsu Road Transport Corporation (PRTC), Punjab Roadways and the Punbus on Monday went on a strike for an indefinite period. Bus services remained largely affected in different parts of the state, causing inconvenience to the general public. As per reports, at least 80% of buses remained off the road. Only 30% of the PRTC’s 1,100 buses plied on their routes. The protesting employees staged protests at bus stands across the state. The commuters were a harried lot as heavy rush could be witnessed at bus stands and bus stops. Many were seen hiring private taxis to reach their destinations.The transport department has directed the managements of the state transport undertakings to deploy their regular staff, presently doing desk jobs, on field duties so as to minimise the impact of the strike. Harkesh Kumar, state general secretary of the Punjab Roadways, Punbus and PRTC Contractual Workers’ Union, said they held meetings with several ministers and senior officials in the last one month but nothing concrete came out.“We were told that the government would discuss the matter in a cabinet meeting in August but no agenda related to our jobs was tabled. The contractual conductors are being paid a meager ₹9,118 per month, while the drivers are getting ₹10,200. We are being exploited for the past 15 years,” he said. The union is also demanding stringent measures to check the transport mafia, streamlining of daily roaster, implementation of equal work and equal salary and to stop unnecessary harassment of employees on the pretext of daily reports.PRTC managing director Bhupinder Singh said they somehow managed to run 30-35% of buses on different routes so that people do not face any inconvenience. “We are hopeful that the situation will improve in the coming days as more regular employee will be deployed on field duties,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bus-services-in-punjab-hit-as-roadways-contractual-staff-goes-on-strike-101630958093036.html

Hindustan Times had earlier highlighted the plight of slum dwellers, especially women, who were forced to defecate in the open.Municipal corporation commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata on Monday said, “The toilet services have been restored. The sewer pipe of the particular toilet was choked, due to which it was closed. I had already written to the public health engineering department (PHED) for cleaning it and work was completed last week.” Civic affairs experts had also pointed to the violation of open defecation-free (ODF)++ status that mentioned “…not a single person is found defecating and/or urinating in the open, all community and public toilets are functional and well-maintained….” Khadgata had, however, rejected the claim and vouched for the presence of two more toilets in the area.‘It will choke again’Meanwhile, Mukesh, a slum dweller, contended that the re-opening was temporary. “The pipe will get choked again,” he said.Seconding his apprehension, ward councillor Mithun Verma said the sewer line of the toilet is not connected to any main line and so the problem will prevail in future too. “I will raise it before PHED officials,” the Congress leader said.Dinesh Gaba, executive engineer, PHED, said, “There will be no such problem in the future and the concern will be cleared out with the councillor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/defunct-toilet-reopens-in-ambala-slum-101630958090218.html

07-09-2021||Chandigarh||High court seeks Punjab’s reply on old pension for teachers hired under zila parishads||The Punjab and Haryana high court has sought a response from the Punjab government on a petition challenging imposition of the new pension scheme (NPS) on teachers recruited under the zila parishads.The response has been sought by December 14.The court was informed that 268 teachers were appointed by the department of rural development and panchayats in 2006-07 under the zila parishads on a regular basis. Their services were to be governed by Punjab Panchayati Raj Institutions Primary Teachers (Recruitment & Conditions of Services) Rules, 2006, and the Punjab Panchayat Samitis and Parishads Employees Pension and Provident Fund Rules, 2000, which entitle them for the benefit of contributory provident fund scheme and pension as admissible to the regular employees under the Punjab Civil Services Rules. It was further argued that due to the state’s policy, the services of these teachers were merged with the education department in 2014 with protection to their pay, pension etc. However, on the merger, the NPS was imposed upon them from January 2015. The NPS was introduced by the Centre in 2004 and subsequently adopted by the states.It was also argued that on February 23, 2017, instructions were issued that the employees recruited prior to July 9, 2012 would be entitled for old pension scheme under the Punjab Civil Services Rules. Since these teachers were appointed under zila parishads they are entitled for benefit of the old pension scheme and imposition of NPS upon them is illegal and unjust, it was contended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-court-seeks-punjab-s-reply-on-old-pension-for-teachers-hired-under-zila-parishads-101630958086932.html

Civic officials said there might be a further spike a fortnight after the Ganesh festival, which begins on Friday. The city has been reporting over 400 cases for nearly a week now, but the BMC has attributed the spike to relaxations given in the past one month. The BMC recently allowed shops to stay open till 10pm, opening of malls and restaurants etc. due to which there was a possibility of cases going up. Further, starting August 15, fully vaccinated citizens were also allowed to travel on suburban local trains.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We are closely monitoring the situation and are preparing to tackle the spike in the number of cases. However, the spike is not the third wave or start of the third wave. It will be very premature to say that now… The next 30 days are going to be crucial in terms of the spike. We are going to have people travel, mingle and socialise during the Ganesh festival and post that a spike is expected. It might be in the next 30 days or even by the end of September.”Read: Maharashtra Covid-19 surge: Don’t hold gatherings, Uddhav Thackeray requests political partiesFurther, the BMC has also decided to ramp up its testing, as the city has opened and is now reporting a spike. From testing around 30,000-35,000 samples daily in the first week of August, the city has increased testing to 40,000-45,000 in the first week of September. In the coming days, testing will increase further, said BMC officials. The BMC has also asked all hospitals in the city to be on alert and also started to work towards arranging oxygen cylinders, medicines and essential injections.Dr Madhav Sathe, former microbiology professor at Nair hospital, said, “There has been a slight rise in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai and Thane for the past few days, but this was expected amid the increase in travelling. In the backdrop of Ganesh festival, there has been a significant rush in markets and a lot of people are going to their native places, as many could not go last year due to the travel ban. We will not witness the third wave and if it does come, it will not be severe due to vaccination that has taken place so far. We still need to take safety precautions.”On Monday, the city reported 383 cases and five deaths, taking the case tally to 746,724 and toll to 15,998. There were 724,011 recoveries in the city with 96% recovery rate. The city’s mortality rate is 2.14% and there are 4,273 active cases in the city.Meanwhile, HT had reported on Sunday that there has been a 20% spike in Covid-19 infections in the past seven days, compared to the previous week. According to the data, between August 21 and 27, 1,893 Covid-19 cases and 22 deaths were reported in the city that took the tally to 742,763 from 740,870. Between August 28 and September 3, 2,279 cases and 15 deaths were reported in the city, owing to which the tally surged from 743,154 to 745,433 and toll increased to 15,987. However, although the cases surged, the number of deaths has gone down in the city.Dr Sonam Solanki, consultant pulmonologist and bronchoscopist, Masina Hospital, said, “It is no surprise that we are seeing an increase in the number of Covid cases right now. India is catching up with the global trend in countries that are few months ahead of us in the pandemic. Currently, due to the relaxation of lockdown restrictions, public spaces such as malls, restaurants and mass gatherings have opened up, leading to the rise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-covid-third-wave-in-mumbai-yet-says-bmc-101630957908155.html

07-09-2021||Mumbai||PMLA case against Anil Deshmukh: ED grills Nagpur deputy RTO Bajrang Kharmate||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday questioned Nagpur’s deputy regional transport officer (RTO) Bajrang Kharmate – said to be a close associate of Maharashtra transport minister Anil Parab – for seven-and-a-half hours, in connection with an alleged money laundering case in which former state home minister Anil Deshmukh is an accused. Kharmate reached the ED office at noon after he was summoned by the agency. ED sources said Kharmate was grilled over his suspected role in the alleged collection of money for ministers for securing plum postings for certain government officials. His name is said to have cropped up in the statements of some of the witnesses in the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act (PMLA) case against Deshmukh.Last week, ED had raided some places linked to Kharmate in Pune and had also recorded statements of a few witnesses. ED suspects that Kharmate has amassed huge properties in the name of his family members. He is also suspected to have owned franchises of some top brands in Pune and also has commercial properties. However, the agency is still collecting evidence to ascertain if the said properties were proceeds of the crime.Parab had also been summoned by the agency last week. However, he has sought two weeks’ time citing some important public events that he needed to attend.The money laundering case against Deshmukh was registered after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a first information report (FIR) against him on April 21. Deshmukh had in the past said that the allegations against him are false. The central agency has alleged that while serving as the home minister, Deshmukh misused his position, and through assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze – who has now been dismissed and is in Taloja jail for his alleged role in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases – collected ₹4.7 crore from Mumbai’s bars for their “smooth functioning”. Later, through hawala channels, this money was sent to two brothers in Delhi who operated bogus companies, said the agency. It claimed that at the behest of Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh, the two brothers diverted the money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, an educational trust controlled by the ex-home minister’s family. ED has also claimed that Vaze told them that a part of the amount collected from the bar owners was to go to an entity – ‘No 1’ – as well as the crime and social service branches of Mumbai Police. The anti-money laundering agency has also said that Vaze in his statement to ED said he was called to Deshmukh’s official residence and directed to collect ₹3 lakh from every bar and restaurant in the city. He was also given a list of the establishments. During investigation, ED has identified 24 private entities that are controlled by the Deshmukhs and found that huge sums of money had been transacted among them without any rationale. “From the analysis of the bank accounts of these companies, it is clear that there is no rationale for the transfers, and thus, it can be said that these series of transactions were meant for inflating balance sheets and layering of money from one company to other,” ED had stated. The agency then arrested Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and assistant Kundan Shinde on June 26, claiming that they had handled the money laundering linked to the extortions for Deshmukh. In mid-July, the anti-money laundering agency provisionally attached Deshmukh’s properties, worth ₹4.2 crore. The attached assets include a residential flat in Worli valued at ₹1.54 crore and 25 land parcels of book value ₹2.67 crore at Dhutum village at Uran in the neighbouring Raigad district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pmla-case-against-anil-deshmukh-ed-grills-nagpur-deputy-rto-bajrang-kharmate-101630957666970.html

07-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Adviser asks PGIMER to shift food vans inside campus||In a bid to make serving of free food outside the PGIMER safer and to beautify the area, UT adviser Dharam Pal on Monday asked the hospital authorities to shift the langar services inside the institution.“The area needs to be maintained better. It is an entry point to the city, and needs beautification. It is a very important part of our perception of the city. Serving of food here, on the road, is a health hazard. An area inside the PGIMER campus has been identified and I have asked the hospital authorities to shift it there,” said Pal, who made a surprise visit to the area along with senior officials on Monday.Many people, predominantly attendants of patients admitted to the hospital, take free meals distributed by NGOs through vans in the area. Pal said he had recently crossed the area and saw its “poor condition”, after which he decided to bring along other officials.Pal also pointed to the lack of maintenance of the roundabout and the surroundings, and directed the horticulture wing of the UT engineering department to beautify the area. On spotting a number of street vendors, he directed the municipal authorities to verify whether they are authorised.On the adviser’s visit, PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said: “We haven’t received any verbal or written orders yet. But if the authorities want the langar vans to be shifted inside the campus, we will definitely discuss the matter and act accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhadviser-asks-pgimer-to-shift-food-vans-inside-campus-101630957546920.html
07-09-2021||Mumbai||BMC, health workers gear up to tackle Covid third wave in Mumbai||As Covid-19 infections are once again beginning to gradually rise in Mumbai, health experts have warned of another increase after Ganesh Chaturthi festival. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has predicted around 1.25 lakh individuals in Mumbai could contract Covid-19 in the anticipated third wave, and officials are working in full swing to take preparatory measures. While emotionally exhausted healthcare workers (HCWs) are preparing themselves to serve needy patients again, they have also raised their demand to fill vacant posts that will disperse the workload.The second wave that hit the city earlier this year was worse than the first wave. In April, when the pandemic curve was at its peak, the daily Covid-19 count crossed 10,000 on three days. Although unlike the first wave, the number of beds was almost adequate, the city faced acute shortage of oxygen as the cumulative number of active patients stood at 87,698 on April 17 and the demand for oxygen surged to 270 metric tonnes per day. Now, expecting all possible scenarios, BMC has decided to increase their oxygen production from 50 metric tonnes to 250 metric tonnes before another surge. The civic body has, therefore, plans to set up 16 oxygen generation plants in hospitals by investing over ₹90 crore, to ensure that the city becomes partially self-reliant for its oxygen needs.Read: Maharashtra aims to vaccinate 20mn in September to ‘prevent or delay’ 3rd wave Nine oxygen plants have already been put in place at nine civic-run hospitals including the four major hospitals — King Edward Memorial (KEM), Parel; BYL Nair at Mumbai Central; Dr RN Cooper Hospital in Juhu; and Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital also known as Sion Hospital. Talking about the preparatory plans, Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC, said around 1.25 lakh Covid-19 infection have been predicted in the third wave. He, however, did not mention the time span. “Around 20% of these patients will require hospitalisation. The cumulative bed strength will be increased to 30,000 for severely infected patients. Along with this, we plan to keep 70,000 beds in Covid Care Centres (CCCs) for moderately and mildly infected patients and 60% beds will have oxygen support,” he said. Though medical experts are unable to predict anything about the epidemiological pattern of the virus in the third wave, they will take lessons from the United States (US) where the pandemic has worsened in the third wave. The US has been witnessing a surge in its daily figures since July, when the Delta variant of the Sars-CoV-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19 — hit the country. As of August 18, the seven-day average of daily new cases was 13.2% higher than the previous week and 1,016.8% higher than the lowest average in June 2021, as per the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “We are hopeful that the impact of the third wave will be lesser compared to the earlier waves due to mass vaccination. But it would be tough to predict anything in this situation. So, we have to be fully prepared,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the state Covid-19 task force. Meanwhile, emotionally and physically exhausted HCWs, who have been working round the clock since the outbreak in March 2020, are getting mentally prepared to face another surge.“The nurses have been the pillar of hospitals in taking care of the patients. We know that once another wave hits us, we will again have to work round the clock. It becomes overwhelming for us to handle so many patients. But we are getting mentally ready as the city is witnessing a gradual rise in cases,” said Rucha Salgoankar, senior nurse at BYL Nair Hospital.Many nurses want to take a break from work and go on a vacation to spend some quality time with their families. But due to the work pressure related to monsoon-related patients, they are unable to get one. Many nurses are also stationed in vaccination centres as vaccinators. “I had to stay away from my family for five months when the pandemic broke. I haven’t taken a day off since last year. Even before we could get a breathing space after the second wave, monsoon-related diseases like dengue, malaria, chikungunya among others surged,” said a nurse from Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital.Resident doctors are also ready to serve again, but they have raised the need to fill vacant posts in government and civic-run hospitals to lessen the burden on them which also hampers their studies. They have already lost 18 months of their postgraduate course, and if another wave strikes, their specialisation studies will again hit a roadblock.“MBBS students want to do PG as they want to gain knowledge in a specific field of medicine. We want to become competent specialist doctors. But in the past 18 months, we have been working like MBBS doctors in Covid-19 wards. We haven’t learnt anything in our subjects,” said Dr Dyaneshwar Dobale, president of central MARD. “If another wave hits the city, we will again work with full dedication to treat patients. But authorities should focus on filling vacant posts in peripheral hospitals for distribution of workload,” he said. BMC claimed they are already in the process to fill vacant posts and added that if required, they will hire private doctors like they did during the first and second waves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-health-workers-gear-up-to-tackle-covid-third-wave-in-mumbai-101630957487061.html
07-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: MC app to auto-escalate service requests, complaints||The Chandigarh municipal corporation is working on a major revamp of all citizen services and a user-friendly mobile app to avail them.The new features will be added and procedures for availing the services will be simplified and rationalised on the app “Im Chandigarh”, which jointly offers services of the MC and Chandigarh Smart City Limited.An important feature of the app will be auto-escalation of grievances and service requests to senior officials if they are not addressed on time.“All services should be citizen-friendly. Currently, a lot of issues mar the speedy and efficient delivery of these services. All 85 MC services will be simplified and rationalised so that citizens can fully benefit from them,” said MC commissioner Anindita Mitra.After joining the post, Mitra has started reviewing working of each department and the services being provided by them. The emphasis is on identifying reasons for delay in delivery of services.Two departments — booking and horticulture — have already started implementing the changes. The former takes care of booking of community centres and other such MC properties by citizens. “After a review of their working, I have directed them to makes changes within a week’s time,” said Mitra, adding that all departments and services will be covered in three months.How it will work“The time period allotted for grievance redressal or delivery of services is also being reviewed. We are trying to reduce the stipulated time for delivery of each service,” said the MC chief.Explaining the auto-escalation feature that is being added to the app, she said: “If a service is not delivered in the stipulated time by a designated officer, then after the expiry of this period, the service request or complaint will be automatically forwarded to the higher authority. This will help in ensuring accountability of officials and timely delivery of services.” For the delivery of services, if an approval is required from a senior official, it takes time as the entire process is physical with files moving from one desk to another. But under the revamped system, after the approval of the senior official, an SMS will be immediately sent to the implementing authority, so that action on the service request can be immediately initiated. The physical approval can come even later. All the services available on the app will be made bilingual. Initially, the users will be able to use the services both in English and Hindi, and if required other languages will also be added to the app.Currently, forms for services requisite, to be filled by users, have many mandatory fields to be filled. “Many of these are unnecessary. For instance, what is the need for email or Aadhaar for getting a tree pruned in front of your house. This discourages residents from availing MC services. Such unnecessary mandatory fields are being removed and minimised,” said Mitra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhmc-app-to-auto-escalate-service-requests-plaints-101630957307002.html
07-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Four injured in RBI cash vans’ pile-up on Madhya Marg||A woman constable suffered fractures in both her legs while three others were injured after three cash vans of the Reserve Bank of India were involved in a pile-up on Madhya Marg near Haryana Panchayat Bhawan in Sector 28. Five cash vans were on their way to the RBI office in Sector 17 when the mishap took place around 2pm, as the driver of the second vehicle suddenly slammed the brakes. The third van crashed into it and the fourth rammed into the third one, as drivers of both vehicles were allegedly speeding. While drivers of both these vans and a constable sitting in the third van were rescued by passersby, woman constable Pavita, who was on cash protection duty and sitting next to the driver in the fourth van, got stuck between the crashed vehicles. It took about 40 minutes for a JCB machine to reach the spot after which the rescue workers took another half an hour to pull out Pavita and rush her to hospital. Some witnesses claimed that the driver of the second van had slammed the brakes as a car had suddenly appeared in front of it. Superintendent of Police (SP, City) Ketan Bansal said they are looking into circumstances that led to the pile-up. Meanwhile, based on the testimony of constable Ram Singh (who is among the injured), the drivers of third and fourth van Tajinder and Gurbhej (who too are injured) have been booked for negligent and rash driving.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhfour-injured-in-rbi-cash-vans-pile-up-on-madhya-marg-101630957069154.html

07-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh to get 2.9 lakh vaccine doses in September||Even though the UT health department has already achieved 100% first dose coverage, the central government has allocated 2,95,810 vaccine doses to Chandigarh for the month of September.The stock will be supplied to the government sector for free inoculation. Officials believe that the vaccine will be effectively used this month as the health department is expecting a rush of people looking to get their second dose. In June, as many as 89,140 doses were supplied to Chandigarh, against the allocation of 61,940. In July, 1,50,110 doses were allocated but the health department received 2,19,160 doses. Similarly in August, 27,91,60 doses were received against the allocated 16,91,60 doses.So far, the UT health department has administered 11, 63, 844 doses to beneficiaries, including the first and second dose.According to the latest electoral list, around 7,29,822 people in Chandigarh are above the age of 18 and are eligible to get vaccinated. As on Monday, 8,31,313 (114%), including migrants, had taken their first shot while 3,32,531 (46%) were fully vaccinated. In the last seven days, around 8,000 people a day were vaccinated in the city.After the UT health department announced on August 14 that 100% of its eligible population has been inoculated with the first dose, at least one lakh more beneficiaries have been jabbed with the first dose at the city’s vaccination sites. “There is no shortage of vaccines in Chandigarh and people are welcome to walk in to the centres to get their shots, without prior registration. People from neighbouring states, especially from Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, continue to throng Chandigarh government vaccination centres. Most people getting the first dose, these days, are residents of other states,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, Chandigarh. Dr Kang added that the UT health department has already received the first batch of 98,640 vaccine doses for September. “We keep monitoring the vaccination stock and when we are left with the supply for only a day or two, we send a letter to the central government asking for more doses. Since people from other states also prefer taking the vaccine in Chandigarh, we are vaccinating more people than expected. We are still organising special evening camps and intensifying door-to-door vaccination drives, to inoculate the people who are still left out,” Dr Kang further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-to-get-2-9-lakh-vaccine-doses-in-september-101630956886633.html

So, there was a need to formulate this policy.He said at present, committees have been constituted by various departments of the government, corporations and urban local bodies organisations to determine the market rates of land.Consequently, this gives rise to multiplicity of legal complications. Thus, this policy has been made with the objective of creating a uniform criterion in determining the market price of the land for all departments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/policy-for-fixation-of-market-rate-of-government-land-comes-into-force-in-haryana-101630956830407.html

There is no solution,” said AAP leaders Harbhupinder Singh Dharor and Suresh Goyal.Daljit Singh Bhola Grewal, Madan Lal Bagga, Kulwant Singh Sidhu, Jagtar Singh Dayalpur and Manvinder Singh Gyaspura were present on the occasion.Bhola Grewal said that at present, patwari posts were lying vacant in around 8,000 villages of Punjab due to which the people of the villages were facing huge difficulties. A few days back the government had issued an advertisement for filling only 1,090 posts in this regard for which around 2.3 lakh people from all over Punjab had applied, he added.He further said that the government had decided to re-employ 1,766 retired patwaris, robbing the rights of the unemployed and reneging on its promise to provide employment to the youth. Gurdarshan Singh Kohli and Sharanpal Singh Makkar said that this decision was a big blow to millions of unemployed youth.AAP leaders demanded the Punjab government to increase the regular posts of patwaris and provide employment opportunities to the unemployed youth by restricting the re-recruitment of retired patwaris. Recalling the promise made by chief minister Amarinder Singh during the elections to provide door-to-door employment to the youth of Punjab, they said that it would be a small step towards fulfilling that promise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-aap-demands-increase-in-patwari-posts-in-punjab-101630956827995.html
07-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh airport: Sharjah, Dubai flights to resume in October||With India formalising air bubble arrangements with 18 countries, flights to Sharjah and Dubai will resume from the Chandigarh International Airport in the first week of October.An air bubble is a special bilateral agreement between two countries to enable seamless travelling with scheduled flights and a set of regulations and restrictions. Among other countries, India has signed the agreement with the United Arab Emirates (UAE).“Both international flights will be resumed in the first week of October,” confirmed Ajay Bhardwaj, chief executive officer, Chandigarh International Airport Limited, on Monday. However, the frequency and timings are still to be worked out. Flights to Sharjah and Dubai in the UAE were launched in 2016 after the Chandigarh airport got the international tag. While the Sharjah flight was operating twice a week, the Dubai one flew on all days but Sunday. The pandemic grounded these flights in March last year. Thereon, scheduled flights from Dubai remained cancelled, though arrivals continued to bring any stranded citizen. In the case of Sharjah, operations resumed in December, but were discontinued once again due to the second wave in March this year.New flights on cardsChandigarh will also get direct connectivity to Jodhpur and Ranchi next month. The airport will resume flights to Jammu and Patna too.“We are also adding direct flights to Jodhpur and resuming Jammu and Patna flights. After a halt at Patna, the flight will depart to Ranchi and will cover both cities. The new flights have been added in the winter schedule, which will be released in the second week of October,” said Bhardwaj.IndiGo had started the direct flight between Patna and Chandigarh in March last year, but it was grounded soon after. The operations resumed in January this year, but had to be suspended once again in March. Set to resume again, the flight will operate six days a week. ”Due to Covid-19 restrictions, some airlines have reduced their flights. At present, there are 30 flights operating from the airport, with a footfall of around 6,500 per day, at both the departure and arrival. In the winter schedule, we are expecting around 36 flights,” said Bhardwaj.Before the lockdown, there were around 44 flights operating from the Chandigarh airport, connecting it to major cities across the country besides Sharjah and Dubai. Dharamshala, Srinagar flights delayed on MondayThe flights to and from Dharamshala and Srinagar were delayed due to operationals reasons at the Chandigarh International Airport on Monday. The Dharamshala flight’s departure was delayed by two hours, as it took off at 10:33 am instead of 8:30 am. It led to a delay in the return flight too.

In a press conference on Monday, Shelar said, “Mud from unregistered quarries was brought for the construction of coastal road and an additional number of truck movements were shown against which bills were cleared.” Shelar alleged fraud of around ₹634 crore in 3,300,000 tonnes of filling material used for reclamation and royalty theft of ₹437 crore on procuring this filling material.He further alleged that BMC paid an additional ₹48 crore for procuring high-density filing material for reclamation, which was in violation of its own tender conditions. Shelar also claimed that the project caused loss of government revenues worth ₹81 crore due to non-payment of penalty for overloading trucks for illegally transporting construction material. Shelar said if no action is taken, he will approach the court.“I have information that 35,000 bogus rounds were shown of trucks, but in reality nothing like this has happened. The BMC or the state government needs to order an SIT (special investigation team) investigation into this or else, we will explore legal options. I have also written to BMC regarding this,” said Shelar.The BMC in a statement said, “Allegations are being spread in the media that a total of ₹1,000 crore has been embezzled in three packages in the coastal road project being constructed by the BMC. However, there is no fact in these allegations and they are baseless. There is no fact in the allegations of fraud in the coastal road works.”Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal said, “Above is the detailed clarification of BMC to various allegations made regarding alleged corruption in coastal road project as reported in certain section of the media today afternoon. All allegations are absolutely baseless and that too made on a day when 1km of tunnel length got completed under Malabar Hill.”BMC issued a point-by-point reply stating that the materials required for the filling of the beach road phase-1 have been taken from the mine approved by the consultant. Royalties are mutually paid by the mine owner. The material used for filling is as per the specification in the contract. This material has been tested from time to time. So the question of additional recovery does not arise.The coastal road project, measuring around 10-km between Princess Street Flyover and the Worli-end of the Bandra-Worli sea link, is expected to be ready by July 2023. The tunnelling work has been much delayed owing to the Covid-19 pandemic as the delivery of the tunnel-boring machine (TBM) from China arrived late. Until Saturday, BMC had completed 1-km of tunnelling work for the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-mla-alleges-scam-in-mumbai-coastal-road-project-works-bmc-refutes-claims-101630956286782.html

Mobile internet services (2G/3G/4G/CDMA/GPRS), all SMS services, including bulk SMS (excluding banking and mobile recharge), and all dongle services will remain suspended from Monday midnight.Late evening the government has also issued orders to suspend mobile internet services in the nearby districts of Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Jind and Panipat from for 24 hours from 12am on September 7. As per the orders issued by the home department the decision was taken to avoid peace and public order in these districts.This move comes in wake of talks between Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Gurnam Singh Charuni and Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar failing on Monday.Farm union leaders from Haryana had demanded registration of FIRs against Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha and police officials involved in the lathi-charge which left around 40 farmers injured, a compensation of ₹25 lakh and a government job to next of kin of farmer Sushil Kajal, who they claimed died due to police action, financial assistance of ₹2 lakh each for all injured farmers, and free treatment to them at government hospitals.BKU Haryana chief Gurnam Singh Charuni said, “The deputy commissioner could not give any satisfactory response on the demands raised by the Morcha leaders. We will go ahead with our mahapanchayat and gherao the mini secretariat as per schedule as the deadline of our ultimatum will expire this evening.”“The government may stop us even before reaching the grain market but we will protest wherever they stop us and will cross their barricades,” he added.The Karnal deputy commissioner said farmers were told that their genuine demands might be considered but their “illegal” demands cannot be accepted.“We are fully prepared to deal with any situation and nobody will be allowed to disturb the law and order situation and gherao the mini-secretariat,” said the district magistrate.He requested people to avoid travelling on NH-44 in the limits of Karnal and security personnel will be deployed on the highway to avoid traffic congestions.

He said stern action will be taken against people trying to disturb the law and order situation.The Karnal district court, responding to a civil suit filed by a Karnal resident, has restrained farm leaders from disturbing the law and order. The court of civil judge senior division Harish Goel directed the Karnal DC and SP to take all measures to ensure the law and order if anyone break the law or create inconvenience to general public by blocking highway and traffic.The court restricted eight farmer leaders, including Charuni, not to block NH-44 or any roads. It has directed the DC and SP to provide a place if the farm unions want to protest peacefully.On the other hand, Charuni urged the farmers from Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh to reach the Karnal grain market at 10am and march towards Karnal mini-secretariat after the meeting.“The administration may try to stop farmers coming in from different parts of the state. We request farmers to come on tractor-trolleys and break the barricades without causing violence,” he added. “Let the police beat you but don’t attack them as it may harm our cause,” he added.Traffic advisoryThe main NH-44 (Ambala-Delhi) may see some traffic disruptions in Karnal.

No new students are being given hostel facilities.Gaurav Kumar, a student of Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, said all activities, except offline classes are taking place on campus but the authorities have turned a deaf ear to their problems.“Online classes are not helping us. The university officials and the state government are planning to make our future darker. We did not take admission here to read notes through PDFs and appear for exams,” he added.A group of Afghan national students, who are studying at MDU, said the varsity officials had promised to open hostels for them after they were unable to contact their families.“We are forced to stay outside hostels. The officials failed to help us. We are waiting for reopening of campus so that we can avail hostel facility,” they added.Ankit Kumar, a student of Hisar’s Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology, said they have not learnt anything through online classes since the first wave of the pandemic hit.“If children, who are at high risk of the possible third wave of Covid-19, are going to school, why are our offline classes not being resumed? The government and the varsity authorities are trying to delay our next session. A year has gone by. What is the benefit of getting a master’s degree without visiting the campus? Our all-round development has been stopped. During online classes, we face internet connectivity issues and our doubts are not cleared,” he added.Pardeep Deswal, national president of JJP’s student wing Indian National Student Organisation (INSO), said the government and the varsities authorities are responsible for delaying physical classes.“This is a tactic of the government to stop students from gaining knowledge. If the government fails to open universities and colleges, we will hold demonstrations across all educational institutes in state. If all political, cultural and religious programmes are organised on the university campuses, why are physical classes being barred?” he said.“Graduation and post-graduation students are appearing for their semester exams across state. If these students are allowed to take the exams, what is the problem in resuming offline classes? Many students have to bear added expenses by staying in PGs as their examinations are on,” he added.Waiting for government approval: Varsity officialsRakesh Wadhwa, registrar of Sirsa’s Chaudhary Devi Lal University, said they are planning to vaccinate all students before reopening the campus.“We have already opened research laboratories and campus for research scholars. Today, we discussed the issue of reopening the varsity for physical classes,” he added.Rajesh Bansal, acting registrar of Chaudhary Ranbir Singh University in Jind, said they have completed all preparations regarding reopening the varsity.“Exams of all classes are on and we will open the varsity after completion of their exams. We are waiting for the government’s nod to reopen the campus. We are hoping that the new session will be started on time and students will be able to attend physical classes,” he added.Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology, Hisar registrar Avnesh Verma said they had formed a committee to take a decision regarding conducting physical classes.The registrar and vice-chancellor of Rohtak’s Maharshi Dayanand University could not be reached for a comment on the issue despite multiple attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/students-of-haryana-varsities-seek-resumption-of-physical-classes-101630955867753.html

07-09-2021||Mumbai||BMC to appoint agency for bi-annual inspection of all bridges in Mumbai||In a first-of-its-kind decision, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has proposed to appoint an agency to conduct the bi-annual structural inspections of all bridges in the city for a period of five years. The agency is required to consist of structural auditors, engineers, or consultants, and will be in-charge of conducting routine inspections twice every year and principal inspections once every five years.There are 344 bridges in Mumbai, including road and rail overbridges. BMC’s bridges department has floated tenders to appoint the agency for inspections of bridges in the Island city at an estimated cost of ₹4.11 crore. Similar tenders will be floated to appoint an agency in the western and eastern suburbs too.Regular structural audits of all bridges in Mumbai were on the cards for BMC, following the collapse of the Himalaya Bridge at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) in March 2019. BMC had also proposed to set up a bridges’ inspection authority and appoint a bridges’ inspector for periodic audits. These suggestions were a part of a preliminary report submitted by then municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta to the Maharashtra government. Following the Himalaya bridge collapse, Mehta had ordered a re-audit of all bridges in the city, even though an audit of all bridges was concluded a year prior to the CSMT incident, in the aftermath of the partial collapse of the Gokhale Bridge in Andheri. As an immediate measure, all bridges in the suburbs were re-audited by the same structural auditors and a new one was appointed for auditing the bridges in the Island city.A senior civic official from BMC’s bridges department said, “We need a rolling mechanism for regular inspection of bridges in the city. The bridges department does not have the manpower to do so annually. Hence, we are appointing consultants for the task. As of now, we have floated a tender to appoint an agency for the audit of bridges in the island city. We are working out the cost of appointing agencies for the suburbs as well, and those tenders will be floated soon.”Leader of opposition Ravi Raja said, “The administration needs to set up a mechanism to ensure its projects or any decision is implemented on a timely basis, as over two years have passed since the Himalaya Bridge collapse incident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-appoint-agency-for-bi-annual-inspection-of-all-bridges-in-mumbai-101630955507033.html

Our priority should be the lives of people. Festivals can be celebrated even next year, if everything is well at home. To protect human lives, everyone should follow health restrictions meticulously. Avoid crowding and public events. Do not encourage political meetings, rallies and even Lord Ganesha would wish so,” Thackeray said in a statement on Monday.Amid the rise in cases and high growth and positivity rates in some districts, the state authorities have termed Pune, Ahmednagar, Satara, Solapur, Sangli, Rantagiri and Sindhudurg as districts of concern.“The growth rate and weekly positivity rate in these districts are too high. Pune has clocked the highest — 6.58% positivity rate — while it’s more than 5% in Ahmednagar. With the Ganesh festival, beginning from Friday, celebrated on a large extent in these districts, there are chances of the third wave initiating or the cases in second wave increasing from these districts. The district administrations need to take utmost care in these districts,” Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary of public health department had said during a presentation on Sunday.Both Maharashtra and Mumbai has been witnessing a rise in the daily caseload over the past few days. The state and Mumbai recorded fewer Covid-19 patients due to the less number of tests conducted in the last 24 hours, owing to holidays on the weekend. State witnessed 3,626 Covid-19 new cases and 37 deaths. Mumbai recorded 383 new cases and five deaths, taking the toll to 15,998.The cases dipped on Monday as there were just 145,457 tests done in the past 24 hours. In contrast, Sunday recorded 4,057 new cases as the tests conducted were 193,193. The total active patients in Maharashtra, currently stands at 47,695. Pune tops ctive cases with 12,413 patients, followed by Thane with 7,275 patients and Satara with 6,328 patients.“I have been repeatedly appealing because the cases are on the rise and challenge is going to intensify in near future. Political parties should play an important role to ensure that the situation does not go out of hands. We have bitter experience of the shortage of oxygen during the second wave on hand. Entire country is standing on the verge of the third wave, which has started showing an indication of its arrival. US and China have been witnessing the third wave. Kerala has been reporting 30,000 patients daily. This is an alarm bell for us and if not taken seriously, we will have to pay a heavy price with respect to lives of the people,” the CM said.He said that the administration has been asked for the preparations for the third wave, but it would be better if we could avert the wave to avoid the use of it. In Nagpur, district guardian minister Nitin Raut said that the third wave has begun in the district and the curbs on public activities will be imposed in next 3-4 days. “After containing the spread of the virus for few weeks, the number of positive cases has reached in double digit. We found 10 new patients on Sunday and 13 on Monday. Of the new patients found today, 12 are fully vaccinated people and the 13th patient is a child. This is an indication of the beginning of the third wave and we have no other option, but to go for re-imposing the curbs in rural and urban parts of the districts,” he said.Raut after holding a review meeting at the divisional commissioner’s office on Monday said, “During third wave, the curbs were imposed little late, following requests by traders and hotel associations. It resulted in the situation going out of hands due to the sudden spurt in the cases. We are speaking to various stakeholders and elected representatives before imposing the curbs. The timing of the hotels, shops will be reduced, besides the curfew on weekends to avoid crowding at public places. It will come into effect in next three-four days.”Responding to the appeal from the CM, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) announced to not organise any political event which will lead to the gathering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-covid-19-surge-don-t-hold-gatherings-uddhav-thackeray-requests-political-parties-101630954735893.html

In a letter written to all these farm bodies, former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra said the SAD had always stood up the cause of farmers and supported every decision of the Samyukat Kisam Morcha (SKM). “It is with this spirit and the welfare of farmers that we wish to engage with farmer organizations and address all their concerns as well as work unitedly to ensure the repeal of the three black laws. This is also why we have postponed our campaign for one week,” he said, adding that Balwinder Bhunder and Manjinder Singh Sirsa will engage with farmers, at the time and place that their leaders will choose.The SAD leader said the Congress party in Punjab was a divided house, with the government not fulfilling promises made to citizens. He claimed that on similar lines, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had worked against the interests of Punjab, be it adopting double standards on the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) issue in Punjab or demanding action against Punjab’s farmers for burning stubble and calling for closure of the thermal plants of the state in the Supreme Court. Chandumajra said that the SAD was the only hope for the people of Punjab and that was why people were turning out in huge numbers to attend the recent party programmes. ‘CHANDIGARH AIRPORT TO HAVE CARGO FACILITY BY DECEMBER’Senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Prem Singh Chandumajra on Monday said a new cargo facility would become operational at the Chandigarh airport in Mohali in December this year. “This development will make the region a hub for export of fruit and vegetable and flowers,” he said, adding that he had taken up the issue with Union civil aviation minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, who had assured him that the cargo facility was under construction and would be completed by the year-end. “Diversification of agriculture will also get a boost. Now, our perishable goods will be transported to West Asia within hours. The farmers will earn more, with new jobs and trade opportunities an added bonus,” he said, adding that farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir will benefit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/form-panel-and-talk-to-us-punjab-sad-to-farm-bodies-101630954608092.html

In their complaint to commissioner of police Naunihal Singh, they alleged that due to the mistreatment by deputy district education officer (elementary) Kuldeep Singh and clerk Harminder Singh Romi, the school head, Sapandeep Kaur, suffered a paralysis attack.The complainants stated that a vaccination camp was organised at the school on August 31 without prior information, yet they cooperated with the health department team. On September 1, a health team again arrived, but left after finding all classrooms occupied. Minutes later, deputy DEO Kuldeep Singh and clerk Harminder Singh Romi reached the school, and rebuked the school head teacher for not accommodating the health team for organising a vaccination camp.“We told them that no information was received for the camp. Moreover, the school is already facing a space crunch and is accommodating 610 students in five rooms, with two classrooms still under construction,” said the staffers.“Still, following the order of the deputy DEO, we emptied one classroom and made the students sit on the floor. But the official insulted the head teacher, and a political leader who was accompanying him threatened her of a transfer,” he added.After sometime, the head teacher suffered a paralysis attack and was rushed to a hospital.A copy of complaint has also been marked to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, Punjab and Haryana high court chief justice, and the education department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-govt-school-head-rebuked-action-sought-against-two-education-dept-staffers-101630954366733.html
07-09-2021||Delhi||Defamation case: Will not interfere with single-judge order, says high court||The Delhi high court on Monday refused to interfere with a single judge order declining to remove the alleged defamatory statements and posts shared by BJP MLA Vijender Gupta against Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot over alleged irregularities in the procurement of 1000 low-floor buses.“We do not want to pass an order because this may have some repercussion on one or the other party,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said.“In politics...I mean….you don’t have to be so sensitive about this,” the court remarked.Gupta’s counsel verbally assured the court that till the next date of hearing on September 20, before the single judge, his client will not make any press statements or tweets on the issue.The bench, taking note of this, ordered that on the next date of hearing, none of the parties would seek adjournment and requested the judge to proceed with the matter.The court’s order came on an appeal filed by Gahlot against the single judge’s August 27 order refusing to pass an ex parte order in the civil defamation suit against the BJP MLA. The court, while issuing summons to Gupta, also gave him 30 days to respond to the suit saying that prima facie no personal allegations were made against Gahlot.On Monday, senior advocate Rajiv Nayar, representing Gahlot, argued that the approach of single judge was erroneous and that the personal allegations were made against the AAP leader by Gupta. He said an LG appointed committee has already given the government a clean chit in the matter.Nayar argued that even after filing a civil and a criminal defamation plea, Gupta released a press note stating that the high court has “rejected” all the contentions and arguments of the Delhi minister.When the court asked Gupta’s counsel Ranjit Kumar about it, he replied that it was Gupta’s understanding of the order and maybe wrongly worded.Taking note of Gupta’s lawyer’s submission, the high court disposed of Gahlot’s appeal.In the civil defamation suit, Gahlot has sought ₹5 crore damages from Gupta for allegedly making scandalous statements relating to irregularities in the procurement of low floor buses. He also demanded the removal of alleged defamatory posts by Gupta on the social media.HT reported on July 11 that the L-G-appointed panel gave a clean chit to the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) in the tendering and procurement of the buses, although it found some “procedural lapses” arising out of “a bona fide decision making”.Last month, the Union government recommended a CBI probe in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/defamation-case-will-not-interfere-with-single-judge-order-says-high-court-101630954307510.html

This March, the Delhi government proposed to increase the seed money to ₹2,000.The scheme will benefit nearly 350,000 students, Sisodia said.Sisodia also said that based on the results of the pilot project, the government may include a component of the EMC projects in its start-up policy that is currently in the works.From selling refurbished mobile phones, handmade chocolates, handicrafts, and jewellery to building low-cost bluetooth speakers, 41 students from School of Excellence in Khichripur – where the pilot was made operational – on Monday exhibited their projects at an event organised by the Delhi government.The project leaders, who are now in Class 12, said they used the lessons learned in EMC classes to turn their skills and hobbies into profitable ventures. For instance, Abhishek Soni, a Class 12 student at the Khichripur school, and a self-trained sketch artist, has been selling his artwork for over a year to pay his tuition fee. Following the EMC classes, Soni and four of his classmates got together to develop their business idea “Tap and Draw” using the collective seed money of Rs.5,000. The students said they have sold artwork worth Rs.20,000 so far.“We have also set up a sales commission of 20% to resolve conflict within the group. Each student is excited to bring in more orders. The quality of our products speaks for itself, and our business is mainly based on orders from social media or through word-of-mouth promotion,” said Soni.The students also plan to expand their ‘businesses’ to rope in members of their community to generate jobs. “We have approached women living on the streets and are collaborating with them to ensure they get some work. Since we will have our board exams soon, we can outsource the work so that both of us can gain something in the process,” said Shiza Ali and Sakshi Jha, two best friends who collaborated on the project ‘Home 2 creation’ to sell handmade handicrafts and chocolates.“We were instructed by our business coach to conduct market survey to look for quality products under affordable range. Most of the bakeries were not keen on sharing their recipe for chocolates so I had to learn through other channels, including YouTube. We hope to turn this into a profitable model so that we can rope in interested homemakers who may want to earn some money during their free time,” said Jha, who made a profit of around ₹9,500.Students pursuing masters in business administration course at the state government’s Delhi Technological University were roped to mentor the students as business coaches.The pandemic-induced economic crisis made it challenging for most students to convince their customers to go for their product. “People were facing economic hardships during the lockdown and many struggled to even get two meals per day. It was difficult to get customers and even if we did, sometimes they did not like the handmade jewellery and would return the product. We were taught by our instructors to keep all this in mind while investing in the business and marketing the products,” said Muskan Soni, who recovered her seed money and earned a profit of ₹1,865.Class 12 student Sukh Sagar, who was a part of the eight-member group MOBISITE, knew the basics of repairing a mobile phone due to a close friend working in the profession. “I learned more about the job after we decided to set up this projects. Our team members work on different areas of the business including marketing, managing content, handling social media,” he said, adding that their business of selling refurbished mobile phones made a profit of nearly ₹22,000.Other projects include selling personalised mugs, T-shirts, keychains and other accessories; cultural paintings; developing low-cost bluetooth speakers; eco-friendly compost; and a system to share subscriptions for OTT platforms at a low cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-school-children-in-classes-11-12-to-get-rs-2-000-seed-fundsisodia-101630954067719.html
07-09-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh Congress minority department targets SP over riots, promises judicial probe||The Uttar Pradesh Congress’s minority department on Monday passed a 16-point resolution promising a judicial probe into riots that took place during the Samajwadi Party (SP) government’s tenure, thereby indicating that the party is getting ready to go it alone in the 2022 assembly election in the state. The Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee’s minority department resolution also promises a law against mob lynching on the pattern of a bill passed by the Rajasthan government. It said that on coming to power the party would get a bill passed in the state legislature and send the same to the President for approval. “The UPCC minority department has passed a 16-point resolution at the convention here on Monday,” said UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu. This is yet another move by the Congress which has targeted the SP along with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee recently brought out a booklet to be distributed to party workers targeting the SP, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the BJP alike. The resolution was passed at the Parivartan Sankalp Sammelan that All India Congress Committee minority department chairman Imran Pratapgarhi and UPCC minority department chief Shah Nawaz Alam attended at the UPCC headquarters here. “We will discuss the 16-point resolution at the meetings of minority department to be held at the district level and all-important points will be incorporated in the Congress manifesto for the 2022 assembly election in Uttar Pradesh,” said Alam. Besides the promise of an inquiry into riots and law against mob lynching, the Uttar Pradesh Congress minority department resolution also promises opening of tanneries closed during the SP government’s tenure, withdraw cases registered during agitation against CAA-NRC (Citizenship Amendment Act-National Register for Citizens), the probe into irregularities in waqf properties in the past 30 years, implementation of ₹2350 crore package for minorities announced by Manmohan Singh government, Maulana Azad hostels for students of minorities, implementation of the Mathur Commission report into the 1992 riots in Kanpur and compensation to such innocent persons against whom cases under cow protection law have been rejected by the Allahabad high court. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, in an informal interaction with media persons, had recently indicated her party was open to an alliance in 2022 assembly elections. Uttar Pradesh Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu has asserted that his party would only align with the smaller parties. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has also declared that the SP will join hands only with smaller parties in the 2022 polls. Other party leaders say the Congress is not a serious contender for power in Uttar Pradesh. “The Congress is nowhere in the picture and the SP is going to come to power in 2022 elections in Uttar Pradesh,” said Rajendra Chaudhary, the SP spokesman. Speaking to media persons, Imran Pratapgarhi said the Congress organisation structure has been strengthened in the past two years and he will go door to door to bring the minorities back into the party fold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-congress-minority-department-targets-sp-over-riots-promises-judicial-probe-101630954008501.html

The Pakistan Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) and the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) are the organisers.On Monday, they held a meeting in Lahore to review preparation at the last resting place of Guru Nanak. PSGPC chief Satwant Singh said, “We know that sangat from other countries will not be able to attend this gurpurb due to global Covid-19 restrictions. Indian devotees, however, can do so through the corridor. We request the Indian government to allow devotees to attend the gurpurb through this corridor and reopen it from their side.”He added that Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur had a role to play in ensuring that this happens. “On our request, Giani Harpreet Singh is attending the gurpurb,” he added.“I have received an invitation from the PSGPC and the Pakistan government may grant me visa. It remains to be seen, however, if the Centre allows me to cross-over to Pakistan through the Attari-Wagah border. There are still restrictions on the international border.” The corridor was opened by India and Pakistan on November 9, 2019 to provide Indian devotees visa-free access to the historic Sikh shrine, which is just 4km from the international border. “It remained operational for four months before the governments of both the countries closed it in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/akal-takht-jathedar-may-attend-joti-jot-in-pakistan-101630953827249.html

Once approved in the DDA meeting, it will be sent to the Union housing and urban affairs ministry for notification,” said a senior DDA official.The policy, DDA officials said, will regulate development in green belt villages located on the city’s periphery. Currently, no new construction, either residential or commercial, is allowed in the 47 rural villages located on the city’s periphery, such as Dhansa, Mitraon, Tikri Kalan, Kapashera, parts of Rajokri, Ghumanhera, Bamnoli and Bijwasan.The policy allows educational institutions, medical facilities, agricultural activities, big parks, sports facilities and non-polluting industries, among others, to come up in the peripheral villages. A total of 70 villages in the urban extensions of the national capital will benefit from the policy once it is approved.The policy allows for construction in three grades, based on the size of the plot. The minimum land required, a senior official said, will be 600 sqm, where permitted development works will be limited to agricultural, horticultural and solar fields, among others.Farmhouses, open markets and sports facilities etc will be allowed on a minimum plot size of 4,000 sqm while educational institutions, non-polluting industries etc can come up on plots of size 10,000 sqm and above.Residents of these villages have been demanding permission to construct their houses and also give their land for commercial activities. Residents claim that due to restrictions on construction, the villages are devoid of essential infrastructure like education institutions and medical facilities, among others, and also left without much source of income.Bhupinder Bazad, president of master plan committee of Delhi Dehat Vikas Manch, an association of villagers, said, “With increase in population, residents need space to construct new houses and also look for opportunities to earn their livelihood. While we need to protect the green lungs of the city, we also have to provide avenues for villagers to earn their livelihood.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-giving-final-touches-to-policy-for-green-area-development-101630953826137.html
07-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi civic bodies dispose waste at landfills, get more than they bargained for||The three municipal corporations working on reducing the garbage at the three landfills in Delhi --- Okhla, Bhalswa and Ghazipur -- have a new problem at hand. The civic bodies are looking at ways to dispose of at least 1.8 million metric tonnes of inert waste that the processing of waste at the landfills has generated. The civic bodies have deployed trommel machines at these landfills to segregate the waste and decrease pressure on the sites. A trommel machine is a huge mechanical sieve that separates the landfill waste into three components -- municipal solid waste, construction and demolition waste or debris and soil or sand. According to the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), which manages the Okhla landfill site, at least 625,000 metric tonnes of inert waste was piling up at the site, leaving little space for moving of machines and handling the legacy waste. To find a way to dispose of this residue, the SDMC standing committee on August 31 approved the proposal to shift the inert waste to two sites, NTPC Eco Park and Tajpur Pahadi (both near Badarpur) at an estimated cost of ₹19.50 crore. “A tender for the same will be floated this month. The two sites together can accommodate 690,000 metric tonnes of waste. An administrative approval has been given. This will help in fast-tracking the bio-mining process,” said Colonel (retd) B K Oberoi, chairperson, SDMC standing committee.Since last year, the civic body, under a temporary arrangement, has been sending some of the inert material at these two sites. Some of this waste was also being used for making temporary roads at the landfill site. “Already 350,000 metric tonnes of inert waste has been removed from the landfill,” he said.Oberoi said the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which had earlier agreed to use inert waste for building of roads, has refused to use it after testing material. “The NHAI told us that the material could not be used for base-filling, as the road may sink. We are now looking for alternative ways to dump it,” he said. NHAI officials did not comment on the issue.The Okhla landfill is spread over an area of 46 acres. Currently, areas under SDMC generate approximately 3,600 metric tonnes of waste every day, almost 50% of which is dumped at Okhla landfill.North and east Delhi municipal bodies also said that piling up of inert waste was hindering their plans to deploy more trommel machines to expedite the processing of waste at the Bhalswa and Ghazipur landfill sites. According to the officials of the civic bodies, mining of the waste at the three landfills has led to significant reduction in their heights. The height of garbage dump at Bhalswa has come down from 65 metres to 54 metres, from 65 metres to 50 metres at Ghazipur, and from 55 metres to 38 metres at Okhla, officials of the three bodies said. “At the Bhalswa landfill, we plan to increase the number of trommel machines from 24 to 60 by next month. We have been using the inert waste in filling up low-lying areas such as streets of unauthorised colonies and vacant spaces in areas such as Narela, Rohini, Rani Khera, among others,” said a senior North corporation official, who asked not to be named. At least 2,500 metric tonnes of solid waste is dumped at the Bhalswa landfill daily. East Delhi Municipal Corporation officials said they were going to hire an agency to handle both processing of waste and dumping of the resultant inert waste. “We plan to increase the number of machines at the site from 20 to 30. Currently, dumping of inert material is too much to handle, and it will be more organised once a single agency is handling the entire work,” said a senior EDMC official. Experts said mining of waste has to be done in a structured manner. Atin Biswas, programme director, solid waste management project, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said a single agency should handle the processing of waste and dumping of resultant inert waste. “The cost of transporting waste is huge. While the civic bodies are employing trommel machines, they also need to get the same agency to dump the inert waste as well so that the space reclaimed from the landfill is not lost to another pile of waste. Simultaneously, the civic bodies should take steps to reduce the amount of waste is dumped daily at the landfills, and focus on segregation of waste is done at source,” said Biswas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-civic-bodies-dispose-waste-at-landfills-but-get-more-than-they-bargained-for-101630953586204.html
07-09-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 aftermath: Longer traffic jams, newer choke points in Delhi||The Covid lockdowns have had a major impact on traffic and mobility patterns in the Capital -- jams are continuing beyond peak hours, new chaos hot spots are emerging, and fewer rides are being made to public transport hubs once restrictions have been lifted, according to assessments by the traffic police and data from Google Mobility Trends.During the first lockdown imposed in March 2020 to curb spread of Covid-19, the city of cars – as Delhi is often referred to since it has over 10 million vehicles, the maximum in the country -- fell silent with its chock-a-block abruptly empty. An analysis by the Delhi traffic police shows that between March and June 2020, the travel time in the city reduced by 40-60%, depending on the location. For instance, travelling from residential localities in east Delhi to west Delhi took around 40 minutes as opposed to over an hour in the pre-pandemic days.The situation, however, changed quickly after June 2020, as people started resuming travel to workplaces, recreational spots, and to supermarkets and malls, with the government relaxing curbs as part of its unlock guidelines.New choke points The return of vehicles led to new traffic patterns emerging. Senior traffic police officials said that over the last year, at least 20 arterial stretches where traffic was not heavy have become new congestion points.“By November last year, we started noticing increased traffic jams. In fact, over the last year, there is a change in traffic patterns. We are seeing more roads turning into congestion points in addition to the existing choke points,” said a senior traffic official, who asked not to be named.Traffic police records show that stretches such as the Ring Road near Safdarjung Hospital, Sri Aurobindo Marg near Hauz Khas, Rajouri Garden (Najafgarh Road), Ajmal Khan Road (near Karol Bagh), Pankha Road (near Hari Nagar) are some of the stretches where heavy traffic jams are being reported more frequently.“A stretch emerges on our radar if there are recurrent traffic jams being reported from there over a significant period of time. The criteria is that the traffic on these roads are not caused by a temporary reason such as a vehicle breakdown or an accident, but because of high traffic volume,” the traffic official added.Heavier traffic at regular trouble spotsAs new traffic choke points were emerging, snarls on the regular chaos hot spots was getting denser too, said traffic police. Estimates show that on the busiest stretches of the city, including ITO junction, Ashram Chowk, Britannia Chowk, Mukarba Chowk, Delhi-Noida Direct Flyway, and Dhaula Kuan crossing, the traffic volume during peak rush hours increased by 10-12% over the last year compared to the pre-lockdown period. Some of these stretches are also breaking away from the original patterns of “peak hour traffic”— which was categorised by the traffic police as 8am to 12pm and 4pm to 8pm, when the traffic picked up on roads.Complaints received by the traffic department’s control room between June 1 and July 20 this year show that stretches such as the ITO intersection, Mukarba Chowk, Ring Road (from Hyatt Hotel to AIIMS flyover), Ashram intersection, Britannia Chowk, Kashmere Gate (near ISBT), Rajouri Garden crossing (Najafgarh Road), Dwarka Road (near the Palam flyover) and Outer Ring Road (near Hauz Khas metro station) are now reporting traffic jams beyond peak hours. To be sure, some of these stretches -- such as Ashram -- have peculiar problems such as haphazard construction work.At the ITO intersection, which is categorised as one of the busiest stretches in the Capital, traffic volume during the pre-pandemic days was around 250,000 to 300,000 vehicles (during peak hours). In September 2020, the traffic volume increased marginally to around 325,000 to 340,000, but jams were still limited to the four hours in the morning and four hours in the evening with relatively smooth flow during the rest of the day. Since June 10 this year, when traffic movement resumed after the second lockdown imposed in April this year, the traffic volume has been high through the day. A short-period estimate shows that the intersection has been recording around 400,000 vehicles during peak hours, and jams now continue on the stretch for almost the entire day.Mobility trendsAccording to Google’s mobility trends the city’s traffic pattern was changed by the pandemic. The tool tracks the number and length of visits people make to certain kinds of places compared to a baseline – in this case, a five-week period between January 3 and February 6 this year.After the lockdown was announced last year, Delhi saw a drop of nearly 80% in people’s trips to retail and recreational places, parks, supermarkets, pharmacies and workplaces, the trends show.Public transit, which includes places such as bus and train stations, saw the highest drop in people’s mobility in a week after the lockdown was announced, as much as 88%.This, however, has been gradually changing with the Capital easing lockdown measures over time. For example, on April 1 last year there was a 73% drop in visits to supermarkets and pharmacies compared to the baseline, but the drop was 64% on May 1, 27% on June 1, 26% on July 1 and 20% on August 1 last year.The most recent mobility trends, of July 26 this year, show that the drop in visits to retail and recreational spots such as cafes, shopping centres cinemas and libraries has reduced to 29% and to workplaces has dropped to 30%. Movement around residential areas across the city has seen an upward swing, with a 9% increase.Fewer trips to public transport hubsThe most worrying trend, according to experts, is that fewer trips are being made to public transport hubs such as Metro stations and bus stands. The mobility trends show that even after the public transport modes resumed services, there was a drop of 24% in mobility around these spots as compared to the baseline.To be sure, curbs were imposed on seating capacity in public buses and the Metro in accordance with the Covid protocols. Though 100% seating has now been allowed in DTC buses and the Metro, standing is not allowed to discourage crowding.Experts say that besides the curbs on seating capacity, the concern over health and safety in public transport also discourage people from using them. This, they said, means that even those who used their private vehicles only for shorter commutes have started using private vehicles more often, leading to a more vehicles on city roads than during the pre-pandemic days.An analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), an organisation focusing on public interest research and advocacy, showed that the mean travel speed on 12 major stretches in Delhi increased from 24 kmph pre-lockdown to 46 kmph during the lockdown. This again reduced again to 29 kmph after the lockdown between October and November 2020 as the government announced phased reopening of activities.Delhi Metro Rail Corporation said even after full seating capacity has been allowed inside the trains, the network is running at 20% of its capacity. This is also resulting in long queues outside stations.“Even though the public transport modes are now operational there is a fear among people that travelling in such close proximity with others might increase the chances of infection. This could undo the years of work that has been done in getting people to ditch their private cars and use public transport modes,” Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director research and advocacy, CSE, said.She added, “People who owned a private vehicle, but chose to travel in metros and buses, now prefer to travel via their own cars, because of safety and convenience.”This, however, is not a trend unique to Delhi. Researchers at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, predicted in June last year the possibility of a sweeping switch to “single-occupancy vehicle” dominating the roads of at least 16 US cities, resulting in the risk of extreme traffic post pandemic.Focus on congestion managementTraffic police and experts said that, in a post-pandemic world, the focus will have to be on congestion management and on coming up with innovative measures to control dependence on private vehicles.“Policing will have to focus on congestion management. As enforcers of traffic rules, it is certainly our job to ensure that traffic rules are followed and if not people are penalised, but the focus should be to manage congestion and along with it create awareness of best practices,” said Muktesh Chander, special commissioner of police (traffic).Chander said that he wrote to his colleagues in July, asking them to shift their focus on congestion management on arterial roads, as opposed to penalty-based policing.Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), said that the new commuting patterns of the city will have to be studied thoroughly so that a holistic plan can be made around it.“This is a scenario that no one in the world has seen before. The increase in congestion could be a temporary impact of the pandemic, but we must prepare for the worst and plan on how the city’s infrastructure needs to be prepared to handle this new load,” Ram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-aftermath-longer-traffic-jams-newer-choke-points-in-delhi-101630953528718.html
07-09-2021||Chandigarh||Following plaints of ‘confusion’, Chandigarh to review traffic lights on its slip roads||The Chandigarh traffic police will be reviewing the efficacy of traffic lights recently installed on slip roads in the city. The development comes after residents raised the issue of confusion caused by these traffic lights, during a recent meeting of the Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC).“New measures are introduced on roundabouts but the public isn’t made aware of them. Now, these lights have been installed on slip roads, which were meant to help traffic to slip away from the main stream of traffic. So residents are confused whether they should stop here or not,” said Pardeep Chopra, secretary, residents’ welfare association (RWA), Sector 21, adding that traffic cops are stationed at the slip road’s exit to cut challans of such unsuspecting people.FOSWAC member Rajan Brar said: “What is the point of having traffic lights at only some roundabouts. There should be uniformity. Authorities must consider having blinker lights here instead of red lights.” While FOSWAC had orally apprised the police officers about this, general secretary JS Gogia will also send a formal complaint to the department.When contacted, SP (traffic) Ketan Bansal said, “This is a genuine problem. We have asked the Children’s Traffic Park (CTP) teams to conduct awareness drives for people. We will also review how much of a difference these lights have had on the roundabouts -- whether they are actually needed or not.”City-based road safety activist Harpreet Singh added, “The traffic police can work on awareness. Even their social media handles have a lot of followers, and it will only take a few days to launch a campaign regarding this.” Singh further added that traffic cops shouldn’t hide at these spots to issue challans. “Traffic cops should be present at the front so that the rules can be followed, and people stay safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/following-plaints-of-confusion-chandigarh-to-review-traffic-lights-on-its-slip-roads-101630953526027.html
07-09-2021||Delhi||Maintenance cost of Delhi’s DTC buses nearly double in a decade, shows govt data||The maintenance cost of buses operated by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) has increased by over 98% in around a decade as the state transport unit continues to operate the vehicles beyond their shelf life, government data showed. The operational costs too shot up by around 80% in five years.On July 26, HT reported that the entire fleet of 3,760 buses run by DTC has been officially declared “overage” this year, a first in the history of the state transport utility since its inception in 1971. Data for the month of August showed that the maintenance cost, including material and spare part costs, of these buses in 2019-20 was ₹817.27 crore, which is 98.2% more than the cost of ₹412.33 crore incurred by the DTC in 2010-11.Further, operational costs of these buses have also shot up -- it rose from ₹1,019.36 crore in 2014-15 to ₹1,834.67 crore in 2019-20, marking an 80% increase in operational costs over a span of five years, a period when the number of DTC buses has been on a steady decline. Between 2011 and 2017, 368 buses were scrapped on an average annually with 2,209 vehicles being withdrawn during this period.According to DTC records, 99% of its bus fleet has crossed the technical operational limit for low-floor CNG buses. The DTC categorises a bus as “overage” after a run of more than eight years. As per the procurement contracts under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), the maximum operational life of a low-floor CNG bus is 12 years or 750,000km, whichever is later.Of the total 3,760 DTC buses currently operational, none of them is even as young as 6-8 years. At least 32 of the buses are 8-10 years old, 3,072 are between 10 and 12 years old, and 656 are older than 12 years. The number is alarming considering that the city needs 11,000 buses, according to a government affidavit submitted to the high court in 2018, and that the DTC itself is mandated to have 5,500 buses.Even if the 2,990 cluster buses, which are run by private operators, are included, Delhi’s current state run buses strength goes up to just 6,750. New buses are being added only in the cluster model. The DTC tried to float a tender for 1,000 buses, but it has been withdrawn because the procurement process is undergoing a CBI investigation.“We hoped to add new buses this year. Tendering and the entire process was complete. But then the whole process has now been cancelled due to the ongoing investigation. We are looking forward to adding around 300 electric buses next year now,” said a senior DTC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/maintenance-cost-of-delhi-s-dtc-buses-nearly-double-in-a-decade-shows-govt-data-101630953287402.html
07-09-2021||Delhi||JNU will open in a phased manner, non-PhD students need to be patient, says V-C||Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar on Monday said the varsity is working towards a phased reopening and asked students of non-PhD courses to exercise patience. Kumar, along with other officials of JNU, said this while addressing students through a Facebook Live session on the staggered reopening of the campus to PhD students. Asking students of masters and other courses to exercise patience, he said a committee on reopening was working towards the initiation of in-person classes. “Be it Jamia or other universities, we are all working on a phased reopening. If we suddenly let in a large number of students and they do not follow Covid protocols, that can lead to a situation where Covid may come back. We would like everyone (back) on campus sooner or later,” said Kumar. He said the university will be holding its convocation ceremony in the last week of this month. During the Live session, officials also informed students that the executive council of the university has decided to waive the hostel fee for all students. Officials also answered student queries ranging from admissions to scholarships and hostel allotments. On the resumption of in-person classes for all courses, Kumar said online classes will continue till the government gives permission for initiation of classes for all. Referring to the reopening of schools, he said it was important to understand that students of a university came from different parts of the country, whereas school students belonged to the local area. “We need to understand that a school has students from a local area whereas in a university, we have students from across the country. Many of our students are living in regions where Covid is still quite prevalent. Thus, it is not advisable to start offline classes as of now,” said Kumar. Professor RP Singh, the rector 3 of the university and a member of the Covid monitoring committee, said, “In the next meeting of the committee, we will be discussing the opening of the campus for final year students of masters courses who have to complete their studies, especially those who need to access labs for practicals or those who have to submit their dissertations.”The JNU students union on Monday also started an indefinite protest outside the dean of students’ office. Seeking the reopening of the university, student union members met the dean and put forth demands which included the immediate commencement of allotment of hostel rooms to 2020 and 2019 batch students, the issuance of identity card to first-year students, improvement in hostel infrastructure, and universal vaccination, among other demands. The student body has called for a protest march on Tuesday. “Upon receiving no concrete response on any of the demands from the dean of students, JNUSU has given a call for an indefinite sit-in before the dean’s office starting now ( Monday),” the JNUSU said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jnu-will-open-in-a-phased-manner-non-phd-students-need-to-be-patient-says-vc-101630953285947.html

07-09-2021||Delhi||Final-year undergrad, post-grad students of DU allowed on campus from Sept 15||The Delhi University on Monday announced a phase-wise reopening of the varsity, and said all final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students, requiring lab work or practical classes, may return to campus from September 15. The varsity has made it mandatory for all students returning to colleges and departments to be at least partially vaccinated. Department and college libraries have been allowed to reopen from Monday, DU officials said.“Laboratory or practical classes and similar activities for final-year UG/PG students may be allowed in the offline mode from September 15 with maximum 50% of the working capacity of classroom/laboratory/hall room following the principle of rotation. Only a limited number of experiments/exercises/practicals may be selected that are considered essential or important in the semester,” the university order, released on Monday, said.DU registrar Vikas Gupta, who issued the order, said teaching and non-teaching staff must be fully vaccinated at the earliest. “It is further advised that all students entering the college/department/university receive at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine. However, for hostel residents, although both doses of Covid-19 vaccine are essential but ensure that the residents have at least one dose of vaccine,” he said.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on August 30 issued the standard operating procedure (SOP) for reopening of schools, colleges, and other educational institutes, and emphasised on finalising readiness plans in consultation with parent groups, monitoring compliance of Covid-19 protocols, and according top priority to vaccination of teaching and non-teaching staff.While theory classes for all UG and PG courses shall continue in the online mode until further notification, students are allowed to return for academic consultations and placement purposes, provided their numbers do not exceed the 50% seating capacity at any point, the DU said. Attendance for all classes will not be mandatory, the university administration further said. The university has also asked libraries to ensure that they work out a schedule for issuing books or for students to visit the library to ensure that there is no overcrowding of such premises.Varsity officials, including Gupta and acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi, held meetings with college principals to discuss the reopening plans. Manoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta College and general secretary of DU principals’ association, said, “Holding online classes parallel to practical work will not be a challenge since we have a set-up in place. While students want to return to the campuses, parents are concerned about their safety due to the previous waves of Covid. It is a sensible step to continue online classes because we need to tread carefully.”Sinha also said within the DDMA and University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines, colleges can also arrange for academic tutorials, if needed. “Although the teaching workload will increase, it will be manageable. We are enabling our classrooms so that teachers can use internet facilities in college to take online classes from our premises and conduct the lab work offline, as per a fixed timetable.”Hardeep Kaur, a teacher of Zoology in Ramjas College, said, “It was difficult to manage offline and online classes when the in-person practicals resumed last year. I had to repeat one experiment six to seven times to ensure that physical distancing was maintained among students at all times. Students also need hands-on experience in conducting the experiments so that they build on their skills. However, the rising Covid-19 cases along with making these classes non-mandatory may lead to a low attendance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/all-final-year-undergrad-and-post-grad-students-of-du-allowed-back-on-campus-from-sept-15-101630953107735.html

Addressing the gathering at an awareness programme organised by the Uttar Pradesh chapter of PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry in collaboration with Arthur D Little, Chauhan said: “Farmers are backbone of the country’s economy. The state government is working towards making farmers’ income double.” The minister further stressed on using latest techniques in horticulture for increasing crops’ production. The programme was organised to educate farmers and other stakeholders about latest innovations and technological advancements in the field of horticulture to help improve their crop productivity and enhance farmer incomes. On the occasion, Chauhan also felicitated farmers. In the workshop, Alok Ranjan, former chief secretary, UP, stressed on associating farmers with entrepreneurs so that farmers were able to find good market and price for their crops. Lalit Khaitan, chairman, UP Chapter, PHD chamber, said: “Last year when economy of the state was badly disrupted, agriculture was one sector which saved the state and contributed significantly to the economy.” Uttar Pradesh has made tremendous advancement in food production, he added. Mukesh Singh, senior advisor, PHD chamber, UP chapter, assured farmers all support from the PHD chamber. Anjani Kumar Srivastava, MD, HOFED, informed that UP State Horticultural Co-operative Marketing Federation (HOFED) has several units across the state and more than 300 farmers’ groups were directly linked to the federation.

07-09-2021||Delhi||Umar Khalid files fresh bail plea after police’s objection||Former Jawaharlal Nehru University student Umar Khalid, an accused in the northeast Delhi riots conspiracy case, withdrew his bail plea and filed a fresh one after the city police objected on technical grounds, a Delhi court was informed on Monday.Senior advocate Trideep Pais, appearing for Khalid, told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat that the application seeking bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) has been substituted with one under Section 437.Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, representing the police, objected to the fresh plea and said, “In the interim application you have filed, you have made certain allegations that the objections taken by the prosecution are dilatory tactics. Therefore, to paint the prosecution by saying that it is dilatory tactics is not fair,” the prosecutor said.The fresh application was filed after Prasad submitted that the court hearing the plea is a special court designated under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and so exercises powers that are before the court of magistrate within the ambit of Section 437 of the CrPC.ASJ Rawat sought the police reply on the fresh bail application and posted the matter for hearing September 8.In the last hearing on the bail plea on September 3, Khalid told the court that the chargesheet in the case has made hyperbolic allegations without any factual basis and reads like a script from a web series and news channels.The Delhi Police had earlier said the bail plea had no merit and that it will demonstrate the prima facie case against him before the court by referring to the charge sheet filed in the case.Khalid, along with several others, has been booked under the anti-terror law in the case. They are accused of being the “masterminds” of the February 2020 violence, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured. He has sought bail in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/umar-khalid-accused-in-delhi-riots-conspiracy-case-files-fresh-bail-plea-after-police-s-objection-101630952630403.html
07-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to install 140,000 devices under second phase of CCTV camera project||The Delhi government has started the second phase of its project to install 280,000 CCTV cameras across the national capital, senior officials involved in the project said on Monday. Along with the CCTV cameras, the government is also installing Wi-Fi routers at the same spots for providing people with internet connectivity, the officials said. In the second phase, the government will install an additional 140,000 cameras at both residential and market places that have not been covered so far. The entire project will be completed in six months to a year, depending on the Covid-19 situation, officials said. The project is being carried out by the government’s public works department (PWD). The first phase of the project kicked off in June 2019 and about 140,000 cameras were installed in that phase.“Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, especially the back-to-back Covid-19 waves that Delhi witnessed, the launch of the second phase of our CCTV project kept getting delayed. Tenders and everything else were done, still it could not take off due to restrictions on non-Covid projects. Now that the ban has been lifted, we have started the second phase of the CCTV camera project wherein another 1.4 lakh (140,000) surveillance devices will be installed on the recommendations of the MLAs,” said a senior government official involved in the project, asking not to be named.Data seen by Hindustan Times shows that Delhi currently has approximately 236,000 CCTV cameras of which 140,000 are of the PWD while the remaining have either been installed by the Delhi Police or the MLAs using their local area development funds. Of the 70 assembly constituencies in Delhi, the New Delhi constituency, whose MLA is chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, has the highest number of CCTV cameras at approximately 4,000, government data showed. Along with the CCTV systems, the government is also setting up Wi-Fi networks and around 35,000 Wi-Fi routers will be installed along with cameras in the second phase. PWD officials said for every four cameras, there will be a utility box with an NVR (network video recorder), a Wi-Fi router, a UPS for power backup lasting an hour, and a SIM card to locate the cameras and for network connectivity.People who will be allowed access to the live camera feed include one resident welfare association member, PWD officials, Delhi Police and a representative of the company that is installing and maintaining these cameras. To protect the cameras from damage, theft and prevent changes in the set angle, the cameras will be put in cages. Besides, the cameras have at least five types of notification system. “The cameras can also send an alarm to the common control room whenever its angle is fiddled with; there is a power failure; the camera is covered or damaged; or there is a perimeter defying movement in high security areas,” a second official said, also on condition of anonymity. The PWD is operating a central command and control centre on the 11th floor of its headquarters at ITO where a specialised team of officials will monitor the live feed round the clock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-install-140-000-devices-under-second-phase-of-cctv-camera-project-101630952450042.html
07-09-2021||Delhi||Over 6k apply for Delhi govt’s one-time aid scheme for families of Covid victims||The Delhi government has so far received over 6,000 applications from families of Covid-19 victims for ₹50,000 financial aid, as against 25,082 recorded deaths of the infection in the city, said senior government officials. Disbursements began on September 1, and of the 6,036 applications till Monday, 660 families have received the money. Of the rest, 1,381 families are yet to be paid, despite their applications being approved, and the remaining 3,995 are pending approval, said two senior government officials who did not wish to be named. A government official said the approved claims are being processed on a ‘first-in-first-out basis’, which is causing a delay for some recipients.On June 23, the Delhi government promised one-time financial assistance of ₹50,000 for each Covid-19 victim’s family, and ₹2,500 monthly assistance for households that lost their sole breadwinner and for orphaned children. The government has also separately received 4,024 applications for monthly financial aid, after households lost their sole breadwinner to the viral infection. However, payments to such families are yet to begin. Senior government officials said such a monthly system needs more coordination among departments and the bureaucratic processes to set up..It was not immediately clear how many of these applications were cleared. A Delhi government spokesperson said, “The government, under the leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, has been working on this initiative on a war footing. Necessary directions have been issued in this regard. The government will ensure that no family, which is eligible for financial assistance under this scheme, is left out.”Even though the government has deployed teams to go door-to-door and help people complete the process, several applicants said the exercise is overly convoluted. “We did not know there would be so much paperwork. We have been told that our application is incomplete and now we are heading from one office to another to get things done so that we can complete the application and claim the money. We need it,” said Renu Tarafdar, a domestic worker based in southeast Delhi’s Dakshinpuri whose husband died of Covid-19 in April this year. Manishankar Jha, a factory worker who lives in Kirti Nagar and lost his brother to Covid-19 in May, said, “Government officials have visited our residence twice and we have managed to complete our applications along with all documents necessary. But we are still waiting for the money. When I last checked, I was told that the application is awaiting approval.” To claim financial assistance under the programme, an applicant has to submit five documents online, including death certificate, proof of death caused by Covid-19, residence proof and a document named ‘surviving member certificate’, which has to be obtained from the revenue department office concerned. “Currently, all 33 SDM [sub-divisional magistrate] offices in the city are dealing with a large number of applications for surviving member certificates and the government is trying its best to ease the process,” said the first senior government official. But there are some more issues which the government is trying to resolve, the second senior government official pointed out. “Other than documents, each application has to pass at least one more crucial test. The death certificate must specifically mention Covid-19 as a cause, as per protocols chalked out by the Union government. Every state has its format of issuing death certificates. In Delhi, the municipal corporations issue the document and in most cases the cause of death is not specifically detailed.” “If that condition is not met, then only deaths that have happened within one month of a person testing positive qualify for further verification rounds.

The BJP women’s wing must connect with these women,” the chief minister said at a women’s wing function of the party. Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya who spoke before the chief minister, had also made a similar point and urged the women’s wing to launch a mass connect campaign by talking about the various initiatives of the Modi government at the centre and Yogi Adityanath government in the state. Yogi was referring to the Muslim women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill that became a law after being cleared by both houses of parliament in July 2019. The law provides for punishment including jail term for the husband accused of pronouncing instant triple talaq divorce on his wife. It was in 2016 that in the run up to the 2017 UP polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had first promised to abolish the practice of instant triple talaq at a public meeting in Mahoba in Bundelkhand. Listing various initiatives of the Modi government to promote women, Yogi said that the Prime Minister promoted women in leadership positions. “It was PM Modi who appointed maximum women as governors. For the first time, three women judges were appointed to the Supreme Court,” Yogi said. “Do you remember how bad things were before 2017, especially in western Uttar Pradesh? Our daughters were unable to go to school, none knew if our daughters would return home safe. But today, women can go anywhere without any fear as criminals are either behind bars or on the run. The BJP women’s wing must talk about this to the people,” Yogi said.He also referred to ‘Mission Shakti’ campaign the BJP government in UP has taken up for women’s safety. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev, state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal also addressed the party women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/scrapping-of-triple-talaq-connect-with-muslim-women-who-benefited-cm-tells-bjp-women-s-wing-101630952328839.html
07-09-2021||Delhi||4 more arrested for helping conman operate cheating racket||A day after actress Leena Maria Paul was arrested for allegedly helping her husband, Sukesh Chandrashekhar, pull off a multi-crore cheating and extortion racket from inside the Tihar prison complex, Delhi Police on Monday said they arrested four more Chennai-based associates of the couple, taking the total number of arrests in the case to 13.The four arrested suspects -- identified as Kamlesh Kothari, Joel Jose Matthews, Arun Muthu, and B Mohan Raj -- and Paul were produced before a Delhi court that sent them to police custody for further interrogation in the case. While Paul, Muthu and Raj have been sent to police custody for 15 days, the others will remain with the police for a week.Police told the court that Paul was required to be taken to Mumbai and other states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala for recovery and verification of several properties purchased from the proceeds of crime.According to police, Kothari is a real estate agent who helped the couple buy a bungalow in Chennai, Matthews is Paul’s manager and Muthu helped the couple buy luxury cars. Raj is a lawyer by profession and has been representing Chandrashekhar in his cases for a long time, said a senior police officer in the Economic Offences Wing (EOW), which is probing the cheating and extortion case.Police recently also invoked stringent provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against Chandrashekhar and the others.Chandrashekhar, an alleged conman and an accused in 21 cases, is already in police custody since Saturday, when the court granted his custody to the EOW for 16 days. Police said Chandrashekhar, who was already in Tihar jail, was allegedly running the cheating and extortion racket in connivance with jail officials and some associates outside.The arrests pertain to investigation into a complaint, alleging duping of several crores, filed by Aditi Singh, the wife of former promoter of Religare Enterprises Shivinder Mohan Singh, who was arrested in October 2019 in a case related to alleged misappropriation of funds at Religare Finvest Ltd. Chandrashekhar and his associates reportedly took money from her after posing as government officials and promising to get bail for her husband.Police suspect Chandrashekhar also allegedly duped the wife of Shivinder’s brother Malvinder Singh who is also currently in jail. It is not clear if a separate case was registered by the EOW on the complaint of Malvinder’s wife.Apart from the EOW, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has also been looking into the case.ED officials had recently conducted raids at Chandrashekhar’s sea-facing bungalow in Chennai and had found a fleet of 16 luxury cars worth crores of rupees.“Investigators will confront the arrested persons with each other to know how exactly they pulled off the multi-crore cheating and extortion racket and assess their roles. More arrests are likely in the case,” said another police officer, privy to the developments in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/four-more-arrested-for-helping-conman-operate-a-multi-crore-cheating-racket-from-inside-tihar-jail-101630952085950.html

The fund when approved would be put to use for the development of the pending health infrastructure projects like hospitals, sub-district hospitals and other health infrastructure. Tope assured that over 17,000 posts vacant in the health department would be filled within this month. Tope was speaking at an event at Symbiosis Lavale institute during the inaugural function of the Symbiosis Women’s Medical College and Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre. He said, “The state government has approved the ₹5000 crore loan from Asian Development Bank which would be available at a low interest rate. The proposal is currently with the central government finance department since it is a foreign institute loan.” The minister said that despite the planning commission’s repeated recommendations to increase expenditure on health infrastructure to at least 5% of the GDP, currently only 0.9% is spent on health. “Now with Covid-19 everyone has understood the importance of health and expenditure on the same would rise. We are also filling in all the 17,000 vacant posts in the health department within a month.” The minister said that due to Covid, focus on non-communicable diseases has reduced which would now be brought back. He said, “Lifestyle diseases and other ailments, especially cancer; oral cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer would also be focused on now. We are in talks with Tata institute and one cancer unit which can provide chemotherapy, radiation and other cancer care can be set up in ₹20 crore and so with ₹200 crore saved from the MPJAY funds ten districts in the state would get cancer treatment at government centres wherein government would put in capital investment and Tata institute would provide technical support so that screening and treatment can start at the right time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/adb-approves-rs5-000-crore-for-health-infrastructure-tope-101630949204744.html

The notice has been issued for September 14. The notice was issued, after Punjab vigilance bureau filed a petition in the court through AIG Ashish Kapoor and the investigating officer DSP Harvinder Singh. In its application, the vigilance bureau alleged that Saini and his counsels made a misstatement in the court of CJM that Punjab and Haryana high court had stayed proceedings of remand of Sumedh Singh Saini on August 19 in the WWICS land fraud case, and thereby stalling the proceedings of the lower court. In the application the VB said, “It is therefore respectfully prayed that cognisance of the criminal contempt of this court committed by Sumedh Singh Saini and anyone else be taken into account and in pursuance thereof, reference be made to the Punjab and Haryana high court for taking up proceedings against the said persons for punishing them under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, in the interest of justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-cjm-issues-show-case-notice-to-sumedh-saini-for-misguiding-court-101630948065809.html

The initiative has proved a boon not only for birds that frequent the society in search of food and water, but also for residents, especially children, who can savour the greenery and beauty of their surroundings. Recalling how it all began, Sandeep Pal, a member of the society, said, “I observed during the first lockdown that many sparrows would come to our balcony every day in search of food and water. That’s when the idea struck to create a favourable environment in the society so that birds could get food and water while we could get a better living environment. All society members including the kids took active part in the initiative.”Ahead of putting up the nest boxes, the society members decided to plant fruit trees and those of pearl millet (bajra), sorghum (jowar) and maize for the birds.“We bought fruit trees that were one- or two- years’ old so they started to bear fruit after six months. Once bajra, jowar and maize started growing, birds had adequate food stock available,” Pal said.While the nest count has now increased to 181, sparrows, pigeons, kingfishers and many other colourful birds whose names even are not known to society members have become regular visitors to the society premises.Dattatray Tambe, a resident, said, “What gives us satisfaction is that most of the trees namely, chickoo, guava, mango and anjeer have started bearing fruit and the birds are enjoying them.”To make planting a continuous activity, the residents have started planting trees on special occasions like birthdays and wedding anniversaries. This in turn is increasing green cover in the society.Pankaj Shetty, another resident, said, “The children are enjoying this environment as the birds that they see in the form of pictures in textbooks or on the internet are now seen in their own society. All the children take the initiative to water the plants and place food in the nests.”Members of the society are delighted and hope that other societies in the city will also follow in their footsteps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hinjewadi-residents-plant-181-nests-in-trees-to-draw-in-birds-101630945424116.html

The bike-borne labourer had a lucky escape as he did not get hurt by uncovered iron rods after falling into the hole, according to bystanders who rescued him. “I am a daily wage worker and was going to the labour pick-up point (Majur aada) on Bhagat Singh road when the incident happened. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) is carrying out road repairs but has not put any signs near uncovered chambers. The accident has left me without work for five days as doctors have advised bed rest. There are a couple of more chambers which are open with no barricades,” said Koli. The nearby residents rescued Koli after hearing a loud noise as the bike fell into the uncovered chamber. Former Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) corporator Rajendra Jagtap, who visited the spot after the incident, said, “It is fortunate that Koli did not suffer any major injury. The civic body should take immediate steps and accept the responsibility.” Residents claim that the road repairs in Pimple Gurav under the smart area-based development project is going at a snail’s speed. “Pedestrians are daily facing inconvenience due to incomplete road words,” said resident Nitin Kadam.

Diwali falls on November 4 this year and the Yogi Adityanath government has celebrated Deepotsav the day before Diwali in the last four years since 2017.According to the Ayodhya administration, beautification work will be completed by the first week of October.The memorial will portray the journey of Princess Suriratna of Ayodhya, who had travelled to Korea and married King Kim Suro and became Queen Heo Hwang-ok in 48 AD. Many Koreans trace their ancestry to the legendary princess. The state government has allocated ₹24 crore for the project.“The memorial will also depict the cultures of both the countries through various means and journey of the Princess from Ayodhya to Korea,” said Ved Prakash Gupta, the Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Ayodhya Sadar constituency in Uttar Pradesh.This park is expected to be a major tourist attraction in Ayodhya.

07-09-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC extends Varavara Rao’s bail, NIA insists on his surrender||The Bombay high court said on Monday that activist P Varavara Rao, an accused in the 2018 Bhima Koregaon case, need not return to jail till September 25 but the National Investigation Agency continued to oppose the extension of medical bail for the 82-year-old suffering from multiple ailments. The high court extended Rao’s date of surrender because it could not hear his application for a six-month extension of temporary bail on medical grounds due to paucity of time last week. The 82-year-old activist was granted interim bail on medical grounds in February 22 this year, was scheduled to surrender and return to judicial custody on September 5. Last week, the activist filed an application seeking extension of the bail and permission to stay in his hometown Hyderabad while out on bail, saying he found living in Mumbai and accessing health facilities unaffordable.In his application, the activist said the neurological problem he faced while in Taloja jail had deteriorated and that he was suffering from memory loss due to lacunar infarcts in six major lobes of the brain. He said a urinary tract infection had not improved and he required a hernia operation, all of which would result in further aggravation of his condition if he were asked to surrender to Taloja jail.But the NIA, which is conducting a probe into the case, opposed Rao’s plea and to shift to Hyderabad from Mumbai, saying his medical reports did not indicate that he suffers from any serious medical ailment.“The medical reports filed by the applicant do not disclose any major ailment which necessitates him to take treatment at Hyderabad, neither it forms a ground for further extension (of bail).” The NIA, in its affidavit, further said the Taloja prison, located in Navi Mumbai, had adequate health care facilities and Rao could be provided with the”best medical facilities” there. The NIA affidavit also said that Taloja jail authorities provided the best medical facilities as per jail manual.“It is submitted that surgery for cataract and hernia can be done in judicial custody under the supervision of doctors of government hospitals at Mumbai and as such there is no need of supervision for four months,” the NIA told the court. The agency also said Rao should not be granted bail extension or allowed to shift to Hyderabad as he is accused of committing a “serious” offence. “They (Rao) cannot expect the Hon’ble courts to pass orders as per their convenience, especially when the accused has prima facie committed offence of serious nature,” the NIA said.But in his application, Rao contended that if he returned to Taloja jail, his health would certainly deteriorate and he might die. Another accused in the case, activist Stan Swamy, died in May while his bail application was being heard in the Bombay high court. The 84-year-old Swamy suffered from Parkinson’s disease and his death prompted Opposition politicians to criticise the authorities for opposing his bail application. On Monday, senior lawyer Anand Grover, representing Rao, told the court that after being granted bail on February 22, Rao was discharged from Nanavati Hospital -- where he was shifted earlier from Taloja jail due to health issues -- and rented a flat at Malad (East) and was living there with his wife and two servants. He said Rao had regularly been going to the hospital for check-ups and was found to be suffering from three more conditions now.When the court expressed its inability to hear the application due to other administrative commitments, Grover sought an order extending the date of surrender. The high court agreed and said Rao needn’t surrender till September 25, but added that he must continue adhering to the bail conditions until then.Rao is among the oldest of the 15 activists and lawyers arrested on charges of conspiring to foment violence at Bhima Koregaon village in Maharashtra on January 1, 2018. The village was rocked by caste clashes during the bicentennial celebration of a British-era war by Dalits.The accused are charged with making inflammatory speeches during an event in Pune on December 31, 2017 called Elgar Parishad. The prosecution claimed the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links.Rao and others have been charged under various sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Rao was arrested on January 1, 2018. (With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-extends-varavara-rao-s-surrender-date-to-sept-25-101630927902878.html

07-09-2021||World||Exhausted and abandoned: Why Afghanistan's army collapsed||When the Taliban swept into Kabul last month, capturing Afghanistan's capital without a fight, the sheer speed of the collapse of the Western-backed and trained army stunned the world.But senior officials in the former Afghan administration told AFP that the lightning victory was not entirely unexpected, and the consequence of fundamental leadership failures, rampant corruption, slick Taliban propaganda -- and a crushing "betrayal" by US-led forces with their hasty pullout.One top official close to the centre of power said that just two days before Taliban forces entered Kabul on August 15, he was present as former president Ashraf Ghani held an emergency meeting with his senior ministers, and military and spy chiefs."It was said that we had enough weapons, ammunition, and financial resources to hold Kabul for two years," said the official, who claimed $100 million in cash was available to secure Kabul."It didn't protect the city for two days," he said.'Lying'The official, who like most sources AFP spoke to for this article did not want to be identified for fear of reprisals, said he was not surprised by the capitulation."Ministers were lying to Ghani, telling him that everything was fine, so they could keep their jobs and their privileges," he said.As the Taliban raced through the country, the inner circle debated policy reforms."We didn't get our priorities right," he added."As the cities fell, one after the other, the National Security Council met to talk about recruitment and institutional reforms."Taliban forces swept across the country in just two weeks, seizing provincial capitals often without a bullet being fired.Another top ex-government official said nobody at the top showed leadership."None of them spoke to the media to reassure our men. None of them went into the field," he said.Ghani also made basic strategic mistakes, the close adviser added."I suggested we leave the south, as we didn't have enough manpower to defend it in the long term."But the president disagreed. He said that all Afghanistan belonged to the government," he said.CorruptionBut for the Afghan army, holding everywhere against the Taliban was an impossible task.Despite the billions of dollars of US-led military support, equipment and training, the army's capacity had been hollowed out by years of rampant corruption.Senior officers creamed off what they could, stealing salaries from lower ranks, as well as selling fuel and ammunition supplies.The situation worsened after Washington struck a deal with the Taliban in February 2020 for a troop withdrawal agreement."We were betrayed," said Sami Sadat, a general recognised for his bravery against the Taliban, who was brought in to lead the special forces in Kabul just days before its fall.Without the critical protection of US air support -- and with the former government's own air force grounded after foreign contractors maintaining the fleet were pulled out by Washington -- the army lost its strategic advantage.'Surreal'"The Taliban were emboldened," Sadat said, writing in the New York Times."They could sense victory... Before that deal, the Taliban had not won any significant battles against the Afghan Army. After the agreement? We were losing dozens of soldiers a day."The final days of fighting were "surreal", Sadat added."We engaged in intense firefights on the ground against the Taliban as US fighter jets circled overhead, effectively spectators," he wrote.Sadat dismissed the claim by US President Joe Biden that the Afghan had collapsed sometimes "without trying" to fight."We fought, bravely, until the end," Sadat said. "We lost 66,000 troops over the past 20 years; that's one-fifth of our estimated fighting force."For the soldiers on the frontlines, they saw little reason to die when top leaders were fleeing."When the Taliban got to the gates of Kabul, the soldiers knew the president was leaving -- that's why they didn't fight," said a former senior army officer who asked not to be named.At the same time, the Taliban deployed a savvy use of media messages to persuade soldiers to surrender, undermining morale even further."We had already lost the social media war," the first presidential confidante said."The Taliban were telling the soldiers that they were fighting needlessly, because at a higher level an agreement had already been signed."Abandoned and exhausted, soldiers saw little point in fighting on.On August 15, 2021, Kabul fell without a fight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exhausted-and-abandoned-why-afghanistan-s-army-collapsed-101631036815422.html

The US became the first country in the world to surpass the grim figure of 40 million cases and more than 649,000 reported deaths. It has remained the worst-hit country in terms of total Covid-19 cases and related deaths.The United States has been reporting new Covid-19 cases largely driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. The authorities struggled to contain the Covid wave as the vaccination drive, which showed an impressive pace initially, later hit a wall due to vaccine hesitancy. Several incentives have been announced to vaccinate as many people as possible to attain some sort of herd immunity.The health authorities have also been wary of the Delta variant spread given the reports of reduced efficacy of vaccines against the highly infectious variant first detected in India. While the US has been witnessing a significant decline in fresh infections, the daily new Covid-19 cases are still greater than most of the countries.India has the second-highest overall Covid-19 cases, followed by Brazil, the UK, Russia, and France.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-crosses-40-million-covid-19-cases-amid-delta-variant-spread-101631031059227.html

Find who’s who of the cabinet||The Taliban on Tuesday unveiled their cabinet as the group formally announced their government after taking over Afghanistan in a lightning offensive last month. In a press conference in the capital city of Kabul, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said it is just an "acting" government which will be led by Mullah Mohammad Hassan, the little-known head of the Taliban’s leadership council. Taliban co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the face of the Islamist group, will serve as his deputy.For now, the group only announced names for key departments such as foreign, defence and interior etc. "Rest of the ministers will be announced in the future when we find right the people to hold the positions," Mujahid said in the press meet.There was no evidence of non-Taliban in the line-up, which has been a big demand of the international community.The Taliban took over the capital city of Kabul on August 15 in the aftermath of the US drawdown. The chaotic exit led to a mass exodus of the people who feared the extremist regime of the Taliban.Also Read | Why Mullah Akhund emerged as top name for Taliban govt?

This is the second time that the Taliban has taken over Afghanistan. It was ousted by the US forces in 2001 in anti-terror operations by Nato allies.The announcement of cabinet appointments came hours after the Taliban fired shots into the air to disperse the crowd and arrested several journalists during the anti-Pakistan protests.Here is who is what in the new Afghan government:> Mullah Mohammad Hassan (acting Prime Minister)> Khairullah Khairkhwa (information minister)> Mullah Yaqoob (defence minister)> Amir Mutaqqi (foreign minister)> Siraj Haqqani (interior minister)> Zabiullah Mujahid (deputy information minister)> Sher Abbas Stanikzai (deputy foreign minister)> Abdul Hakim (justice minister)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-announces-new-caretaker-government-for-afghanistan-find-who-s-who-of-the-cabinet-101631028507477.html

The Taliban announced the first members of their new Afghanistan government after delaying it twice.Mullah Hasan Akhund headed the last Taliban government in the final years of its rule that ended after the US-led invasion. Abdul Ghani Baradar, head of the Taliban's political office in Doha, had led talks with the US which resulted in signing a deal between them and eventually America’s final withdrawal from Afghanistan.The Taliban spokesperson said that Amir Khan Muttaqi will be Afghanistan's acting foreign minister while Mullah Yaqoob, son of Taliban's founder Mullah Omar, will serve as the acting defence minister. Sirajuddin Haqqani, leader of the Haqqani Network, will serve as acting interior minister in the interim government.Also Read | Why Mullah Akhund emerged as top name for Taliban govt? There's a Pak connectionAlthough the group has announced the first names of its interim government after a lot of speculations, its recognition by the international community remains a worry for the insurgents. White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said Tuesday the recognition will be dependent on what steps the Islamist hardliners take.“There’s no rush to recognition...the world will be watching, the United States included,” she said.Countries like Britain and Canada have already said that they have no immediate plans for recognising the government. “We’re not a tribal force,” Mujahid said. “We hope all countries in the world will recognize the legitimacy of our government and our Islamic regime.”The government formation was twice postponed as the insurgents were reportedly struggling to shape an inclusive administration acceptable to the international community. The first names of the interim government, however, didn't include any non-Taliban, non-Haqqani Network stakeholders, a major demand from the international community. Some reports suggest that Pakistan's alleged interference in the government formation also caused the delay."It was agreed that we would announce a new government before a formal ceremony could be held," AFP quoted Ahmadullah Wasiq, deputy head of the Taliban’s Cultural Commission, as saying.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mohammad-hasan-to-lead-new-taliban-govt-abdul-ghani-baradar-to-be-deputy-101631024569573.html
07-09-2021||World||Trial of alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed resumes in Guantanamo||Accused September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others appeared in court for the first time in more than 18 months on Tuesday as US military prosecutors seek justice two decades after the world-shaking terror attacks.Mohammed, with a dense, graying red beard, strode into the courtroom in the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as the nine-year-old trial resumed after a long halt for the Covid-19 pandemic.The military tribunal courtroom was packed with prosecutors, interpreters, and five defense teams for Mohammed and alleged co-conspirators Ammar al-Baluchi, Walid bin Attash, Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Mustafa al-Hawsawi.In the public gallery, behind thick glass, were members of the families of the 2,976 people that the defendants are accused of murdering almost exactly 20 years ago.The accused face possible execution if found guilty.But the pretrial phase now in its ninth year and bogged down over what is now the central issue -- that the five were repeatedly tortured by the CIA after their capture.Without a political intervention -- President Joe Biden had pledged during his campaign to close down the military prison at Guantanamo Bay -- it could be more than a year before a full trial begins, let alone a verdict reached.- Camouflage jackets -The trial resumed Tuesday in the highly secure "Camp Justice" courtroom on a hilltop in the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay.The defendants entered one by one with military escorts, and each sat down at a table with their own defense team.Mohammed wore a blue turban and matching face mask which he removed to let free a long, flowing beard. He chatted animatedly with bin Attash while leafing through a pile of documents.Bin Attash, who allegedly helped plan the 9/11 attacks, wore a pink keffiyeh headdress and a military desert camouflage jacket, walking slowly with a prosthetic on one leg he lost in a firefight in Afghanistan in 1996.Al-Shibh, a member of the "Hamburg Cell" of hijackers, also wore desert camouflage over his white cotton pants, seemingly to reflect his days as an Al-Qaeda jihadist.Baluchi, also known as Ali Abdul Aziz Ali and the nephew of Mohammed, revealed a short, black beard under his mask and wore a Sindhi cap of his native Balochistan, along with a traditional vest over his white robe. He is accused of handling money transfers in the plot.The fifth defendant, Hawsawi, who worked together with Baluchi, entered in a Saudi thobe-style white robe. He also carried a pillow which he placed on the hospital chair reserved for him, due to rectal damage his lawyers say was incurred in the abusive interrogations by the CIA.- Eighth judge -The hearing opened under a brand new judge, Air Force Colonel Matthew McCall, who is the eighth to be named to preside.McCall opened by asking each of the defendants if they understood the guidelines for the hearing."Yes," each answered, some in English and some in their own languages.He then launched into a discussion of Covid-19 protocols, after the long delay forced by the pandemic.Already in recent weeks several people who have joined hearings in other Guantanamo cases have tested positive, despite strict requirements for vaccinations and masks.Lowering his own mask to speak, McCall said that everyone should remained masked unless they were addressing the court.Defense attorneys said they were eager to continue where they stopped in February 2019, building a case to discredit the bulk of the prosecution's evidence due to the torture the five endured while in CIA hands between 2002 and 2006.But the trial restart began slowly. The first day is focused on a procedure unique to the military commissions, a "voir dire" assessment of the judge's own background to probe for possible biases.The procedure is crucial as the judge, prosecutors and many of the defense attorneys are all part of the Defense Department legal corps.McCall said he had worked with others on both sides of the court in this case, but had no deep links or commitments to any."I shut down all my social media," he said, to avoid potential "friends" from contacting him about the case.The voir dire review of McCall will consume two sessions this week, and the other days will involve him meeting with attorneys privately on the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trial-of-alleged-9-11-mastermind-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-resumes-in-guantanamo-101631021656722.html

There's a Pak connection||Mullah Mohammad Hasan Akhund, the chief of the Taliban's powerful decision-making body, will be Afghanistan's new head of state with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and Mullah Abdus Salam working as his deputies, a Pakistani media report said on Tuesday. The Taliban’s top leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada proposed Akhund’s name, The News International reported, citing Taliban leaders familiar with the developments.Akhund’s name as the Taliban government’s head comes days after Pakistan's spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) director general Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed flew to Kabul on an unannounced visit last week. During his visit, the ISI chief had met Mullah Baradar and Hizb-e-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to what reports said was to discuss the current situation in Afghanistan.Also read | Pakistan ISI chief meets Taliban top leader Mullah Baradar: Report On Monday, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told a news conference said that a new Afghan government would be announced soon without specifying any date. Mujahid also denied there were any disagreements within the Taliban leadership about the formation of a new government. "Final decisions have been taken, we are now working on the technical issues," he said at a press conference.Before this, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar’s name cropped as the leader of the new government in Afghanistan. Baradar was a close friend of the Taliban's reclusive original leader Mullah Mohammad Omar. He served as deputy defence minister when the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan. Baradar served as a senior military commander responsible for attacks on coalition forces after the last Taliban government fell, a UN sanctions notice said.He was arrested and imprisoned in Pakistan by the ISI in 2010. He was released in 2018 and became the head of the Taliban's political office in Doha. He was one of the most prominent figures in peace talks with the United States.The Taliban have deferred the government formation at least twice amid reports of a power struggle between the group’s co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and Anas Haqqani, according to several reports. The disagreement among the Taliban leaders was over the handling of Panjshir, where resistance forces have dug out against the group.Also read | Haqqani and Baradar fight it out for power in KabulAccording to the unverified Twitter handle of Panjshir Observer, which describes itself as an independent news outlet, there was a gunfight last Friday in Kabul. "Gunfire last night in Kabul was a power struggle between two senior Taliban leaders. Forces loyal to Anas Haqqani and Mullah Baradar fought over a disagreement on how to resolve the #Panjshir situation. Mullah Baradar was reportedly injured and is receiving treatment in Pakistan," Panjshir Observer tweeted on Saturday.Mullah Akhund is the head of the Rehbari Shura or leadership council—Taliban’s powerful decision-making body—which serves like a government cabinet running all the group's affairs with the approval of the top leader. Mullah Akhund has worked for two decades as the head of Rehbari Shura and is close to Mullah Akhundzada. “He worked for 20 years as head of Rehbari Shura and earned himself a very good reputation. He is a religious leader rather than a military background and is known for his character and devotion,” one of the Taliban leaders was quoted as saying by the Pakistani newspaper.Also read | Why is ISI chief in Kabul?

He is wanted for questioning in connection with the January 2008 attack on a hotel in Kabul that killed six people, including an American citizen. He is believed to have coordinated and participated in cross-border attacks against the US and coalition forces in Afghanistan.He was also allegedly involved in the planning of the assassination attempt on the Afghan president Hamid Karzai in 2008, according to the FBI website.Mullah Yaqoob, son of the Taliban founder Mullah Mohammad Omar, will be the new defence minister, the paper said. Yaqoob was a student of Mullah Akhundzada, who earlier appointed him as head of the Taliban’s powerful military commission. He was named as overall head of the Taliban military commission last year, overseeing all military operations in Afghanistan. Considered a relative moderate by some Western analysts, he is still in his early 30s and does not have long combat experience of the Taliban's main battlefield commanders.The newspaper also said Zabiullah Mujahid, whose name was earlier proposed for information minister, will now be the spokesperson for the new head of state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-mullah-akhund-emerged-as-top-name-for-taliban-govt-there-s-a-pak-connection-101631017514901.html

The protest reportedly began outside the Pakistan embassy in Kabul, denouncing Islamabad's alleged interference in Afghanistan and its support for the Taliban's offensive in Panjshir.Videos of the anti-Taliban march were shared on social media in which protesters can be heard shouting slogans like “Long live the resistance” and “Death to Pakistan.” Witnesses said that the Taliban gunmen fired in the air to disperse a rally and arrested several Afghan journalists who were covering the protest, reported news agencies. There were no immediate reports of injuries but protesters were taken aback by the gunfire."The Islamic government is shooting at our poor people," one panic-stricken woman said in an Iranian television news video clip, reported Reuters. "These people (Taliban) are very unjust, and they are not human at all.”Afghanistan's TOLO News said the Taliban also detained its cameraman Wahid Ahmadi for covering the protest. “They made me rub my nose on the ground and apologize for covering the protest,” An Afghan journalist who was detained and later freed told The Associated Press. “Journalism in Afghanistan is getting harder," he added.Also Read | Pak ISI and Chinese proximity to Taliban queer Quad pitch for Kabul recognitionSaad Mohseni, CEO of Tolo's parent company Moby Group, took to Twitter to highlight the Taliban's earlier assurance and contrasting actions.“The Taliban have always insisted that they will respect freedom of expression and the media's right to cover events...and now this,” he tweeted.Several media reports suggest that Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) wants a puppet government in Afghanistan headed by its “own person”, which has led to a delay in the government formation.

Some of the children who left Afghanistan have been evacuated on flights to the United States, Germany, Qatar and other countries, the UN agency told reporters.Reuters reported on August 27 that 34 at least Afghan children have been placed in the US government’s custody after being evacuated unaccompanied from Kabul. Of the 34 children evacuated some 10 were later placed with close family members residing in the US while the rest were being housed in government shelters. A government official told Reuters that those who have been placed in shelters either do not have any close relatives in the US or their parents are deceased. "If their parents aren't here now but will be, we need a place for them to go in the interim and then they will be united when their parents get here," the official said.Also Read: University classes resume in Afghanistan with a 'curtain of separation'The Afghan all-girls robotics team consisting of children in the age group of 15-19, which was once heralded as a shining example of women’s advancement in the country, was also evacuated after the Taliban took over.

The protesters also showed support to the resistance forces in Panjshir, the only defiant holdout where resistance forces claim they are fighting against the Taliban.The Taliban, which took over the city on August 15 after the US drawdown, also detained some women protesters after resorting to firing in the air to disperse the crowd. Videos posted on social media of a separate rally showed more than a hundred people marching through the streets under the watchful eye of armed Taliban members. According to reports, at least three rallies were held across Kabul in a show of resistance against the Taliban, known for their brutal and radical justice system.This comes as Pakistan's intelligence chief Faiz Hameed visited Kabul over the weekend to be briefed by his country's ambassador about the escalating situation in Kabul. According to reports, Hameed has also met with Taliban officials during the visit.

He added that the US has been in contact with the Islamist militant group in “recent hours” and that they have reiterated to allow Afghans to “freely leave” their country.He was speaking at a joint press conference with his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, along with other top defence officials and diplomats of the middle-eastern country, in Doha. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin was also present at the meeting.Referring to Taliban’s take on the scenario, Blinken said the Islamist group have reiterated that they would “let people with travel documents freely depart.” “We will hold them to that,” he added."The entire international community is looking to the Taliban to uphold that commitment," the US secretary of state said, referring to a UN Security Council resolution that sought safe passage of the people wanting to leave Afghanistan.Also Read | ‘We'll not forget them’: Nato chief on Afghans left behind after US troops leftBlinken also said that Washington has identified a “relatively” small number of Americans at Mazar-i-sharif who are seeking to leave Afghanistan. He informed that the US believes there are “somewhere around 100” of its citizens still in the war-torn nation who seek to leave. The state department, however, had earlier put the estimate at between 100 and 200.This comes after the US on Monday evacuated four Americans into a bordering third country – the name of which wasn’t disclosed — through land, marking the first such operation since the country’s troops pulled out on August 31. A state department official said that the Taliban were aware of the move and did not interfere.Meanwhile, non-governmental organisations said an estimated number of people ranging between 600 and 1,300 – including girls and US nationals — are stuck in Mazar-i-sharif.Marina LeGree, the founder and executive director of an American non-governmental organisation active in Afghanistan, told AFP that the Taliban are not letting anyone through.Blinken and Austin’s visit to Qatar is to thank the Gulf country for its help with the evacuation of thousands of people after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan.Qatar has already deployed technical teams to the Kabul airport in order to assess the viability of the venue and prepare its operations to allow evacuations and the arrival of humanitarian supplies that Afghanistan desperately needs in the current situation.Turkey is also keen on helping the country resume operations to gain a foothold in Taliban-led Afghanistan. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-working-with-taliban-to-enable-charter-flight-ops-from-kabul-says-blinken-101631012485688.html
07-09-2021||World||Canada elections: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hit by stones on campaign trail||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was hit by gravel thrown at him by angry protesters during an election campaign stop in the town of London in Ontario on Monday. No injuries were reported.The incident occurred as Trudeau, the leader of the Liberal Party, was preparing to board his campaign bus. Journalists accompanying the PM reported that some of them were also hit by small stones.Justin Trudeau has been campaigning across the country for the September 20 snap polls, which he had called in mid-August in a bid to transform his existing minority government into a majority one.The Canadian prime minister later made light of the incident, telling reporters on his campaign plane, “There were little bits of gravel and I may have been hit. I had someone throw pumpkin seeds at me a few years ago.”It was the first incident of violence on the campaign trail. Trudeau has faced protests at several stops due to anger over mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations that are part of the ruling party’s agenda ahead of the Canada elections.While vaccinations have been announced for public service, with some resistance coming from unions, he has sought to make them mandatory for those seeking to travel domestically on planes and trains.Trudeau also faced similar noisy protests in Surrey in British Columbia, while a campaign event in the town of Bolton in Ontario was cancelled last month after a large number of protesters showed up. However, previous incidents have been restricted to only hurling abuses at the PM.Earlier on Monday, Justin Trudeau said he will “not allow” such “anti-vaxxer mobs” to “dictate how this country gets through this pandemic”.The incident in Ontario’s London immediately drew criticism from Trudeau’s principal rival, Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole, who tweeted, “This is disgusting and I condemn these actions in the strongest terms possible. Political violence is never justified and our media must be free from intimidation, harassment and violence.”Trudeau is not the only leader to have faced an attack during his campaign. Earlier this month, People’s Party of Canada (PPC) leader Maxime Bernier was hit with an egg at an event in Saskatoon in the province of Saskatchewan.The news agency Canadian Press reported that the crowd at the London event included several wearing PPC gear and quoted a local candidate as saying they had been building a network to mobilise at Trudeau’s campaign stops.There were no reports of arrests after the episode nor were any perpetrators identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-hit-by-stones-on-campaign-trail-101631009453043.html
07-09-2021||World||'ISI would be interested:' US-built databases a potential tool of Taliban repression||Over two decades, the United States and its allies spent hundreds of millions of dollars building databases for the Afghan people. The nobly stated goal: Promote law and order and government accountability and modernize a war-ravaged land.But in the Taliban’s lightning seizure of power, most of that digital apparatus — including biometrics for verifying identities — apparently fell into Taliban hands. Built with few data-protection safeguards, it risks becoming the high-tech jackboots of a surveillance state. As the Taliban get their governing feet, there are worries it will be used for social control and to punish perceived foes.Putting such data to work constructively — boosting education, empowering women, battling corruption — requires democratic stability, and these systems were not architected for the prospect of defeat.“It is a terrible irony,” said Frank Pasquale, Brooklyn Law School scholar of surveillance technologies. “It’s a real object lesson in ‘The road to hell is paved with good intentions.’”Since Kabul fell Aug. 15, indications have emerged that government data may have been used in Taliban efforts to identify and intimidate Afghans who worked with the U.S. forces.People are getting ominous and threatening phone calls, texts and WhatsApp messages, said Neesha Suarez, constituent services director for Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, an Iraq War veteran whose office is trying to help stranded Afghans who worked with the U.S. find a way out.A 27-year-old U.S. contractor in Kabul told The Associated Press he and co-workers who developed a U.S.-funded database used to manage army and police payrolls got phone calls summoning them to the Defense Ministry. He is in hiding, changing his location daily, he said, asking not to be identified for his safety.In victory, the Taliban’s leaders say they are not interested in retribution. Restoring international aid and getting foreign-held assets unfrozen are a priority. There are few signs of the draconian restrictions – especially on women – they imposed when they ruled from 1996 to 2001. There are also no indications that Afghans who worked with Americans have been systematically persecuted.Ali Karimi, a University of Pennsylvania scholar, is among Afghans unready to trust the Taliban. He worries the databases will give rigid fundamentalist theocrats, known during their insurgency for ruthlessly killing enemy collaborators, "the same capability as an average U.S. government agency when it comes to surveillance and interception.”Also Read | Taliban open fire to disperse anti-Pakistan march in Kabul: ReportsThe Taliban are on notice that the world will be watching how they wield the data.All Afghans — and their international partners — have an obligation together to ensure sensitive government data only be used for “development purposes” and not for policing or social control by the Taliban or to serve other governments in the region, said Nader Nadery, a peace negotiator and head of the civil service commission in the former government.Uncertain for the moment is the fate of one of the most sensitive databases, the one used to pay soldiers and police.The Afghan Personnel and Pay System has data on more than 700,000 security forces members dating back 40 years, said a senior security official from the fallen government. Its more than 40 data fields include birth dates, phone numbers, fathers' and grandfathers' names, fingerprints and iris and face scans, said two Afghan contractors who worked on it, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.Only authorized users can access that system, so if the Taliban can't find one, they can be expected to try to hack it, said the former official, who asked not to be identified for fear of the safety of relatives in Kabul. He expected Pakistan’s ISI intelligence service, long the Taliban’s patron, to render technical assistance. U.S. analysts expect Chinese, Russian and Iranian intelligence also to offer such services.Originally conceived to fight payroll fraud, that system was supposed to interface eventually with a powerful database at the Defense and Interior ministries modeled on one the Pentagon created in 2004 to achieve “identity dominance” by collecting fingerprints and iris and face scans in combat areas.But the homegrown Afghanistan Automated Biometric Identification Database grew from a tool to vet army and police recruits for loyalty to contain 8.5 million records, including on government foes and the civilian population. When Kabul fell it was being upgraded, along with a similar database in Iraq, under a $75 million contract signed in 2018.U.S. officials say it was secured before the Taliban could access it.Before the U.S. pullout, the entire database was erased with military-grade data-wiping software, said William Graves, chief engineer at the Pentagon’s biometrics project management office. Similarly, 20 years of data collected from telecommunications and internet intercepts since 2001 by Afghanistan’s intelligence agency were wiped clean, said the former Afghan security official.Among crucial databases that remained are the Afghanistan Financial Management Information System, which held extensive details on foreign contractors, and an Economy Ministry database that compiled all international development and aid agency funding sources, the former security official said.Then there is the data — with iris scans and fingerprints for about 9 million Afghans — controlled by the National Statistics and Information Agency. A biometric scan has been required in recent years to obtain a passport or a driver’s license and to take a civil service or university entrance exam.Western aid organizations led by the World Bank, one of the funders, praised the data's utility for empowering women, especially in registering land ownership and obtaining bank loans. The agency was working to create electronic national IDs, known as e-Tazkira, in an unfinished project somewhat modeled on India’s biometrically enabled Aadhaar national ID.“That’s the treasure chest,” said a Western election assistance official, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize future missions.It is unclear whether voter registration databases — records on more than 8 million Afghans — are in Taliban hands, the official said. Full printouts were made during the 2019 presidential elections, though the biometric records used then for anti-fraud voter verification were retained by the German technology provider. After 2018 parliamentary elections, 5,000 portable biometric handhelds used for verification went inexplicably missing.Yet another database the Taliban inherit contains iris and face scans and fingerprints on 420,000 government employees — another anti-fraud measure — which Nadery oversaw as civil service commissioner. It was eventually to have been merged with the e-Tazkira database, he said.On Aug. 3, a government website touted the digital accomplishments of President Ashraf Ghani, who would soon flee into exile, saying biometric information on “all civil servants, from every corner of the country" would allow them to them to be linked “under one umbrella” with banks and cellphone carriers for electronic payment. U.N. agencies have also collected biometrics on Afghans for food distribution and refugee tracking.The central agglomeration of such personal data is exactly what worries the 37 digital civil liberties groups who signed an Aug. 25 letter calling for the urgent shutdown and erasure, where possible, of Afghanistan’s “digital identity tool,” among other measures. The letter said authoritarian regimes have exploited such data “to target vulnerable people” and digitized, searchable databases amplify the risks. Disputes over including ethnicity and religion in the e-Tazkira database — for fear it could put digital bullseyes on minorities, as China has done in repressing its ethnic Uyghurs — delayed its creation for most of a decade.John Woodward, a Boston University professor and former CIA officer who pioneered the Pentagon's biometric collection, is worried about intelligence agencies hostile to the United States getting access to the data troves.“ISI (Pakistani intelligence) would be interested to know who worked for the Americans,” said Woodward, and China, Russia and Iran have their own agendas. Their agents certainly have the technical chops to break into password-protected databases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/isi-would-be-interested-us-built-databases-a-potential-tool-of-taliban-repression-101631004957042.html

07-09-2021||World||Battle for Panjshir: How Ahmad Massoud's forces were able to fight Taliban||A state of confusion persists over the status of Afghanistan’s Panjshir valley, which has been the site of a ferocious battle between Ahmad Massoud-led resistance forces and the Taliban, which seized power in Kabul on August 15. However, even as claims and counter claims continue, the National Resistance Front’s (NRF) resistance against the Taliban’s advance has been stiff.Here are a few reasons why the regime has found it extreme difficult to defeat the NRF and capture Panjshir, as reported in Hindustan Times’ sister website Live Hindustan:(1.) Up to 10,000 well-trained fighters: The resistance forces comprise armed members of the local militia and former members of Afghanistan’s security forces. Together, they number between 9,000-10,000 and, from recently released photos, seem to have been trained in an organised manner.Also Read | Ahmad Massoud safe, says NRF; Taliban ask ex-Afghan forces to integrate with govt: 10 points(2.) Supported by former Afghan vice president: Amrullah Saleh, who was the first vice president under Ashraf Ghani when the Taliban conquered Kabul, escaped to his birth place Panjshir. He was joined by members of the Afghan National Army (ANA), who did not surrender to fighters of the hardline Islamist movement. They joined hands with Massoud, and are fighting under his leadership.Also Read | Taliban claim Panjshir has fallen, resistance battles on(3.) Local leaders receiving foreign support: Massoud, who was educated in London, is the son of late Ahmad Shah Massoud, under whose leadership the resistance forces did not allow the Taliban to capture Panjshir during its first rule, from 1996 to 2001. Earlier this year, Ahmad Massoud met French president Emmanuel Macron to seek his support. It is said that many countries are indirectly supporting Massoud’s forces.Also Read | Afghanistan resistance front spokesperson killed in Panjshir: ReportsEven as the Taliban brought all of Afghanistan under its control with its swift capture of provincial capitals and, finally, Kabul, Panjshir is one province that remained away from its control.

The resistance forces, however, have said that the fight is still not over.Pictures on social media showed Taliban members standing in front of the gate of the Panjshir provincial governor's compound after days of fighting with the National Resistance Front (NRF), commanded by Ahmad Massoud, the son of Afghanistan's legendary guerrilla commander commander Ahmad Shah Massoud.Ahmad Massoud, meanwhile, called for a "national uprising" against the Taliban.Here are the latest developments on the ongoing war in Panjshir:1. The Taliban have prohibited Afghan news media from circulating Massoud's message.2. Russian news agency Sputnik further said that the Taliban have also prevented former Afghan President Hamid Karzai and former chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation Abdullah Abdullah from meeting with their fellow citizens.3. Meanwhile, in an audio message, Massoud called for national uprising against the Taliban. "Wherever you are, inside or outside, I call on you to begin a national uprising for the dignity, freedom and prosperity of our country," according to Al Jazeera, which reported aboud Massoud's message.4. The region has witnessed heavy conflict between the warring sides in the past four days. Panjshir has been the stronghold of the National Resistance Front, led by Ahmad Massoud and former Vice President Amrullah Saleh, who declared himself caretaker president.5. Panjshir was the base of the Northern Alliance resistance fighters who toppled the Taliban with US air support in 2001 after the September 11 attacks on the United States.6. On Sunday, Massoud said that he was ready to cease fighting and start negotiations if the Taliban abandoned the province.7. The Taliban have assured the people of the valley - who are ethnically distinct from the mainly Pashtun group - that there would be no "discriminatory act against them". But the situation on the ground punches holes in those promises.8. Panjshir resistance spokesperson Fahim Dashti was reported dead in a clash with the Taliban on Sunday.9. Taliban are busy in the formation of a government to rule Afghanistan, with their spokesperson saying the leadership will be announced soon.10. Asked whether the United States would recognise the Taliban, President Joe Biden told reporters at the White House late Monday: “That’s a long way off."

It also said that the night curfew will remain in effect throughout the five-day celebrations and that not more than 20 people can be present during celebrations and also the immersion ceremony.In Maharashtra, however, where Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated with utmost grandeur, state health minister Rajesh Tope ruled out any curbs and said that the ruling dispensation is closely monitoring the situation in the state.“During Ganeshotsav celebrations…gathering of crowds leads to an increase in the possibility of the spread of infection. This has been seen in other states,” Tope pointed out.Also Read | Ganesh Chaturthi festivities to be restricted to three days in Bengaluru: BBMPHe also used Kerala as an example to stress on the significance of following Covid-19 protocols.

Both doses of the vaccine should be taken from the same hospital,” the statement released by Dr Reddy’s said.The Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company also announced that it has initiated supply of the first dose component of Sputnik-V vaccine to partner hospitals across the country, and those who want to be inoculated with the Russian vaccine can visit their official site to find out if it's available in their area.The supply of the first dose component had to be suspended owing to logistical constraints from the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), the sovereign wealth fund that partnered with Dr Reddy’s to manufacture Sputnik-V vaccines in India.

07-09-2021||India||In Mohammad Akhund-led Taliban govt, several key faces from Haqqani Network||NEW DELHI: The Taliban on Tuesday announced an interim setup to govern Afghanistan that will be led by a founding member, Mohammad Hassan Akhund, and has several leaders of the dreaded Haqqani Network in key positions. A majority of the 33 members in the caretaker setup, including Akhund and his first deputy Abdul Ghani Baradar, have been sanctioned by the UN Security Council, while Sirajuddin Haqqani, who was named the interior minister, has a US bounty of $5 million on his head.The reclusive Taliban chief Haibatullah Akhundzada was named the supreme leader with the final say on religious, political and security affairs under a system that some have compared to the ruling setup in Iran.Akhund, who is believed to be in his sixties, was a close associate of Taliban founder Mullah Omar and served as his political advisor. He also served as foreign minister in the previous Taliban regime and as governor of Kandahar province, the traditional stronghold of the group in southern Afghanistan.Baradar emerged as the most public face of the Taliban because of his leading role in negotiations with the US and other countries.Despite several assertions by Taliban leaders in recent weeks that the proposed setup would be inclusive, all the 33 members of the so-called caretaker cabinet were members of the Taliban hierarchy or the Haqqani Network. Many of them also served in similar capacities in the Taliban regime that ruled in Kabul in the 1990s.Most of the 33 leaders are Pashtuns and the setup included two Tajiks and one Uzbek.Akhund will have two deputies – Baradar and Abdul Salam Hanafi, who was a deputy education minister in the previous regime.Maulvi Amir Khan Mutaqqi, a former education minister, was the surprise pick for foreign minister, with Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai, who recently held a meeting with India’s ambassador in Qatar and has been involved in back-channel contacts with the Indian side for some years, was named the deputy foreign minister.Mullah Muhammad Yaqoob, the eldest son of Taliban founder Mullah Omar, was named the defence minister. Yaqoob is among the very few leaders in the setup who isn’t subject to UN sanctions, but there have been reports that during the Taliban’s recent campaign against the former government of President Ashraf Ghani, he was directly coordinating with Lashkar-e-Taiba commanders fighting alongside the Taliban.Mullah Abdul Haq Wassiq, a UN-sanctioned Taliban leader who earlier served as deputy minister of security was named the intelligence chief, with Mullah Rahmatullah Najib and Mullah Taj Mir Jawad as his deputies. Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa, a former prisoner at Guantanamo with whom the Indian side opened channels of communication, was named information minister, with long-standing Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid as his deputy. Mujahid said the 33-member setup will serve as “acting” leaders and he didn’t rule out the possibility of changes in future.All the UN-sanctioned Taliban leaders are subject to an assets freeze, arms embargo and travel ban. About 15 of them, including Baradar, were granted exemptions to travel restrictions to allow them to travel to Qatar and various other destinations for peace negotiations. The UN Security Council is set to meet on September 21 to consider the further extension of these exemptions. India currently heads the UN’s 1988 Sanctions Committee that oversees sanctions on the Taliban till December. If the travel-related exemptions aren’t extended, the sanctioned leaders will effectively be unable to travel out of Afghanistan and engage with the international community. This could complicate the Taliban’s efforts to seek international recognition for its setup, especially at a time when many Western countries have linked recognition to the group’s ability to deliver on commitments to protect human rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-mohammad-akhund-led-taliban-govt-several-key-faces-from-haqqani-network-101631036159570.html
07-09-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: Sept 8, 1952 Egypt under virtual military dictatorship||Cairo- Gen. Naguib, in a pre-dawn swoop with troops and armoured cars, today arrested almost every prominent personality in Egypt outside the Government and, as new Premier, became virtual dictator in Egypt. Armoured cars patrolled the streets of Cairo tonight when Gen. Naguib and Ministers of his new 16-man Cabinet drove to the Abdin Palace to be sworn in by the Regency Council. Most of the 16 are non-party men. Less than seven weeks after Egypt’s strong man launched his ‘Coup d’etat ‘ against ex-King Farouk, he took complete control of the Government after the biggest mass arrests in the country’s turbulent history. He imprisoned over 50 politicians and leaders, including two ex-Premiers, at a stroke, and accepted the resignation of Mr Aly Maher and his Government. The Regency Council asked the General to form a Military Government, a spokesman of the outgoing Maher Cabinet said, but Gen. Naguib told reporters at his General H.Q.: “I am going to form a Cabinet mostly of civilians.” The new Cabinet is as follows: Prime Minister, War, Marine and C.-in-C.-Gen. Naguib; Vice-Premier and Minister for Interior- Soliman Hafez; Foreign Minister -Ahmed Farag Tayeb (now Minister to Jordan and Iraq); Finance -Dr Abdel Gelil Amary; Public Works-Murad Fahmy; Education-Ismail el Kabbany; Propaganda Fathy Radwan (extreme Nationalist Party leader); Communications -Dr Nureddin Tarraf (also leading member of extreme Nationalist Party); Wakfs (religious foundations)-Sheikh Ahmed Hassan el Bakkour (one of the Muslim Brotherhood leaders); Agriculture -Abdel Aziz Abdullah Salem; Commerce, Industry and Supply- Dr Mahmoud Abu Zed; Public Health-Dr Mohammed Sabay; Reconstruction and Building-Dr Ibrabim Bayyoumi Madkour; Social Affairs-Prof. Mohammed Fuad Galal; Municipal Ties-Abdel Aziz Aly; Justice-Abdel Hamid Soliman. Gen. Naguib is the only soldier in the new Cabinet. Wearing smart khaki uniforms, he led his Ministers dressed in grey morning coats and red tarbushes into the stately Palace. He and Soliman Hafez conferred privately with the Regents for about 15 minutes before the other Ministers were summoned to be sworn in. Later, Gen. Naguib’s party posed momentarily for Press photographers outside the Palace before driving to the Presidency. There they began their first formal Cabinet meeting, which is expected to pass the Army’s land reform measures into law without delay. The political leaders were arrested for failing to carry out “purges” in their ranks ordered by Gen. Naguib. They included ex-Premier Ahmed Naguib Hilaly, Fuad Serag el Din, Wafdist Party leader, held “administratively responsible” for Cairo’s riots on January 26, and Hafez Afifi, former Chief of Farouk’s Royal Cabinet. Mortada Maragi, a former Minister of the Interior, and Ibrahim Abdel Hady, former Premier and leader of the Saadist Party, were also reported to be among those arrested. Meanwhile, a prominent Wafdist said the Army placed the Wafd leader and former Premier, Mustafa el Nahas, under house arrest. Wafdist sources said Nahas had been confined by the Army in Alexandria. ARMY’S ACTION The Army went into action while Cairo slept. Troops, armed police and armoured cars swept through the city and cordoned off the leaders’ residences to make the arrests, which were carried out while the leaders of the factory riots last month at Kafr el Dawar were being executed at Alexandria, 100 miles away. After informing Mr Aly Maher of his action, Gen. Naguib demanded immediate action to be taken to promulgate the reform programme, which seeks to close the immense gap between Egypt’s few wealthy landowners and the mass of poverty-stricken population. Mr Maher refused to rush through the reforms which, he claimed, were too far sweeping and likely to lead to economic collapse. Mr Aly Maher told Gen. Naguib in a 45-minute interview this morning that he was resigning because of the Army’s mass arrests. After the interview Mr Aly Maher told correspondents: ‘’My resignation has been accepted by agreement with the Army.” Mr Maher said afterwards: It is in the best interests of the nation that power be transferred to a single hand.” Apart from reinforcements of steel-helmeted police who patrolled the Cairo streets, the Army’s seizure of overall power passed off with few outward signs. There were no major troop movements and no large massing of crowds. Life in the capital looked little different from a normal Sunday afternoon with most inhabitants taking their usual siesta in sweltering heat. OFFICIAL STATEMENT A statement from Gen. Naguib’s G.H.Q. said: The Army revolt was not only against the King but against corruption, of which the King was only a symbol.” “The movement was also against at those, who co-operated with the ex-King and exploited close relations with him. We have repeatedly asked political organizations in the country to purge their ranks so that Egypt may enjoy a clean and healthy political life.” “But the parties were reluctant to comply with this appeal and today we had to arrest certain individuals held in suspicion.” Mr Aly Maher’s Cabinet, reorganized and expanded two days ago, was in session at the Presidency at noon when the Army H.Q. issued its statement. The Cabinet, which was reported to have been discussing the proposed Land Reforms Bill, then suspended its meeting. The arrested leaders were placed under guard in a large store house, less than a quarter of a mile from Gen. Naguib’s H.Q. An Army spokesman said that Mr Aly Maher “has been unable to keep pace with the new mentality of the nation.” The Army regime is now facing its most serious crisis since its coup nearly seven weeks ago. There are now practically no political leaders willing and able to form a Government under Army Control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-sept-8-1952-egypt-under-virtual-military-dictatorship-101631031776232.html

But our Constitution has given us the right to express ourselves,” Singh told reporters on Tuesday.Akhtar, a former Parliamentarian, had compared the Islamist militant outfit Taliban with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) during a television appearance on September 3. "Just like the Taliban want an Islamic State, there are those who want a Hindu Rashtra. These people are of the same mindset -- be it Muslim, Christian, Jews or Hindus," he said."Of course, the Taliban is barbaric, and their actions are reprehensible, but those supporting the RSS, VHP and Bajrang Dal are all the same,” he added.Akhtar had also said that he has “total faith in the basic sensibility of an average Indian.”“The majority of this nation is extremely decent and tolerant. That must be respected. India will never become a Talibani country,” the iconic lyricist said.Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Ram Kadam criticised Akhtar for his comments on the RSS, and demanded he apologise for making such a comparison. Kadam warned that Akhtar’s movies will not be allowed to run if he does not apologise to the RSS.“We will not allow any of his films to run in this land of Ma Bharti till he apologises with folded hands to the functionaries of the Sangh who have dedicated their lives to the nation," he said in a video message.Shiv Sena had defended RSS against Akhtar’s comments and accused the latter of “disrespecting Hindu culture” in an editorial published in the party mouthpiece Saamana.Digvijaya Singh, whose party has formed the government in Maharashtra along with Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party, invoked satirist Sampat Saral’s words, stating that “Satirist Sampat Saral had once defined Taliban and gave an equation that politics plus religion is equal to the Taliban.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/constitution-has-given-us-the-right-to-express-ourselves-cong-leader-digvijaya-singh-on-javed-akhtar-s-taliban-remark-101631023047819.html

Soon after, an 11-member delegation went to meet the district administration to discuss their demands. The officials attempted to dissuade them from marching towards the secretariat.“Our talks with the administration failed as they did not agree to our demands,” senior farmer leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan told news agency PTI.The leaders then urged the assembled farmers at the mahapanchayat to march peacefully towards the mini-secretariat, situated around 5km away, in Karnal town.The rally was attended by the leaders of various farmer unions, including Rakesh Tikait, Balbir Singh Rajewal, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, Darshan Pal and Yogendra Yadav.  The leaders told the farmers not to enter into any confrontation with policemen, and squat in protest wherever they are stopped. Responding to the call, thousands of farmers marched towards the secretariat carrying union flags crossing barricades put up on the route.However, Yogendra Yadav tweeted later in the evening that the police detained him and Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait along with other leaders of the SKM on their way to the secretariat. Soon after, in another post on Twitter Yadav said the leaders were let off under the pressure of the gathered farmersPolice also used water canons to disperse the marching farmers. किसानों के भारी दबाब और प्रदर्शन के कारण में पुलिस ने सभी साथियों को बसों से उतार दिया है। सभी नेता पैदल आगे बढ़ रहे हैं। https://t.co/LV14NWpNaBThe state government ordered suspension of internet and SMS services in and around the venue of the mahapanchayat till Tuesday midnight even as police tightened security arrangements and imposed Section 144 in the district.On Sunday, hundred and thousands of farmers from across the country gathered at Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh to set the stage for ‘Mission Uttar Pradesh’ and continue discussions on issues plaguing them.Last week, Haryana police personnel baton-charged a group of protesting farmers in Karnal. The incident drew flak from several quarters after videos of Karnal sub-divisional magistrate Ayush Sinha ordering to “break the heads” of any protesters who "cross the barricades" went viral on social media.The leaders of farmers unions from Haryana demanded registration of FIRs against Ayush Sinha and police personnel involved in the lathicharge, as well as financial assistance of ₹2 lakh for those injured in the incident.ALSO READ | NHRC seeks report from Karnal DC, SP over lathi-chargeAddressing the mahapanchayat earlier in the day, social activist Yogendra Yadav said, “We have come to ask the government which Constitution, which law gives an IAS officer permission to give orders to break the farmers' heads.”“Under which law are police allowed to carry out brutal lathi-charge resulting in the death of one and injuries to several others,” Yadav added.Ayush Sinha has since been transferred and posted as the additional secretary in the Citizen Resources Information Department of Haryana government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kisan-mahapanchayat-karnal-farmers-protest-ayush-sinha-farm-laws-101631019513924.html
07-09-2021||India||Footfall at Mumbai airport improved in August, festive season expected to be better||With the onset of the festive season and with countries across the globe easing travel restrictions, August witnessed a surge in the number of passengers travelling through Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA). Over 1.5 million passengers flew in and out of CSMI airport in August, in comparison to 400,000 passengers who travelled in August 2020. With the Covid-19 pandemic affecting the aviation industry at large, airports and airlines saw poor passenger movement over the past year and a half. At first, air services were shut for two months (from March-end to May 2020). It was only when the government began air services in a phased manner and the number of Covid-19 cases drastically reduced that air traffic picked up from October last year. Due to the second wave in the country in April this year, travelling again took a backseat. However, the situation improved from June. As per CSMIA data, Doha and Dubai emerged as the top international destinations last month. While Doha saw approximately 41,410 passengers travel to and from CSMIA, Dubai and Male saw 37,126 and 18,190 passengers respectively. Amid the festive season, 1,587,150 passengers across domestic and international destinations were recorded at the city airport in August (1,402,369 domestic passengers and ,184,787 flew international locations).“About 785,479 passengers arrived at CSMIA in the month of August, while 801,677 passengers departed to various domestic and international destinations. CSMIA registered Delhi, Bangalore and Goa as the most travelled domestic destinations from CSMIA with 242,085, 111,026 and 95,089 passengers respectively,” a CSMIA spokesperson said. Indigo, Air India and Vistara carried the highest number of passengers on domestic routes while Qatar Airways, Indigo and Air India catered to the majority of passengers internationally. “With festivals like Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami and Onam being celebrated during weekends in August, CSMIA witnessed an upward trend of passengers travelling over the weekend. CSMIA registered Goa as the highest travelled destination with 22,078 passengers, which was followed by Srinagar, Jammu and Leh during the weekend of August 2021. Moreover, an upward trend in the number of passengers travelling for leisure locally and internationally is expected in the coming months, with a lot of festivals and holiday season coming up,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/footfall-at-mumbai-airport-improved-in-august-festive-season-expected-to-be-better-101631020254192.html

In a report by the news agency ANI, Thakur said he will also meet the Bihar assembly speaker to press for his demand. "All sections of society are equal before the Constitution,'' he said while raising his demand for a separate room to chant Hanuman Chalisa, as per ANI report."If a room is allocated (in the Jharkhand assembly) to offer namaaz in the secular country, why shouldn't there be room to chant 'Hanuman Chalisa'? '' he asked according to the report.On September 2 , the Hemant Soren government in Jharkhand issued an order for the allotment of "namaaz hall" in the assembly premises. The order, which became public two days later has now snowballed into a controversy, prompted demand from the BJP to build a Hanuman temple and places of worship of other religions in the assembly premises. The speaker Ravindra Nath Mahto has allotted room number TW 348 for offering namaaz.The leaders also created a ruckus in the Jharkhand assembly on Monday as they constantly disrupted the proceedings by raising slogans. Some BJP leaders also trooped into the well of the assembly and shouted: "Jai Shri Ram" (Glory to Lord Rama). Some also sat on the stairs at the entrance of the assembly chanting Hanuman Chalisa and 'Hare Rama' with placards.The agitation was criticised by Soren saying, "this kind of mentality is a barrier to the state's development," while speaking to reporters.The opposition leaders are demanding withdrawal of the order pertaining to the allotment of the namaaz room.Meanwhile, on Sunday, the BJP workers burnt the effigies of chief minister Hemant Soren and the speaker during protests across the state against the decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-namaaz-hall-row-bjp-mla-demands-room-to-chant-hanuman-chalisa-101631019379335.html

It fills me with hope to know that we can connect, based on love and compassion, and speak about freedom in kindness Chile,” said Riuz. Rangayan said the motto of Kashish remained to award some of the best queer-themed films, take them to festivals across the world, and hopefully release them on OTT platforms. “Kashish continues to be a strong platform to nurture the nascent Indian LGBTQIA+ cinema movement, by not only exhibiting, but also producing and distributing Indian LGBTQIA+ content.” He added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/films-from-chile-argentina-win-top-honours-at-kashish-mumbai-int-l-queer-film-fest-101631019654054.html

The move came at a time he seemed to have lost a battle of perception with state RJD chief Jagadanand Singh, a close of aide Yadav's younger and more powerful sibling Tejashwi Yadav.Also read | Until you get justice, I'll sit on protest: Tej Pratap tells aspiring teachersSingh had earned the wrath of the mercurial elder brother recently when he sacked Akash Yadav as the state president of Chhatra RJD. Though there was no official word on the reasons behind the removal of Akash, one of the few close friends of Tej Pratap Yadav, it was widely believed that the blame fell on him when posters came up in the city recently in which images of Tejashwi – now the party’s de-facto leader – were conspicuous by absence. Sensing that it could further diminish his clout, Tej Pratap had reacted furiously, likening Jagadanand Singh to 'Hitler', who refused to visit the party office for days in protest, until he was, understandably, mollified by Tejashwi.Also read | BJP’s ‘sidelined’ barb at Tej Pratap Yadav after he opens a shop. RJD respondsMeanwhile, Akash realised that time was up for him in the RJD, where he was seen as aligned with a leader who did not have power despite pedigree, and joined the Lok Janshakti Party. RJD rank and file, which has been witness to Tej Pratap’s tantrums for awhile, viewed the development with bemusement.Sources said the volatile leader had reacted similarly during the Lok Sabha polls of 2019 when he floated a “Lalu Rabri Morcha” when his cronies were denied tickets. They agree that the fact of being the son of Lalu Prasad and rustic mannerisms reminding the masses of his legendary father make Tej Pratap Yadav more than a pushover.Nonetheless, few in the party believe that he can muster the tenacity of purpose which was required if he wished to emerge as a credible centre of power since the RJD seems to have reconciled itself to Prasad having anointed the younger son as his heir apparent.The fresh episode in what looks like an unequal war of succession has brought some glee to the BJP, which sees the RJD as the main hurdle in its quest for becoming the numero uno political force in Bihar."Tej Pratap is fighting for his survival and we sympathise with him. His father has treated the party as a personal fiefdom and failed to do justice to his own son," state BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said in a statement here.He also added that "it is ironic, and a poor reflection on the RJD that Tej Pratap Yadav, who never cared to educate himself, shall be floating a students' body. No wonder the party has lost trust of the people".(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tej-pratap-floats-new-youth-outfit-claims-to-have-father-s-blessings-101631013301307.html
07-09-2021||India||46% rise in complaints of crimes against women in 2021; UP, Delhi top list: NCW||The country saw a rise of 46 per cent in complaints of crimes against women in the first eight months of this year as against the corresponding period of last year, the National Commission for Women (NCW) said on Monday. According to data, the NCW received 19,953 complaints of crimes against women from January to August this year. The number is up from the 13,618 complaints reported in the same period of time in 2020. The NCW received as many as 3,248 complaints in the month of July, which is the highest in a month since June 2015.More than half of these complaints came from the state of Uttar Pradesh alone, the women's body also informed. Among states and Union territories, the highest number of complaints were received from Uttar Pradesh (10,084). It was followed by the national capital with 2,147 complaints. Haryana reported 995 and 974 came from Maharashtra, the commission also said.Explaining the steep rise in the cases, NCW chief Rekha Sharma said it was because the commission is regularly conducting awareness programmes and the public is now more aware of its work, hence the jump in complaints. "Also, the commission has always made it a point to launch new initiatives to help women. Keeping in line with this, we have launched a round-the-clock helpline number as well to provide support services to women in need where they can also register a complaint," news agency PTI quoted Sharma as saying.Of the total complaints, the highest number of 7,036 were recorded under the right to live with dignity clause, followed by 4,289 complaints of domestic violence and 2,923 complaints of harassment of married women or dowry harassment, NCW informed. As many as 1,116 complaints have been received regarding the offence of outraging the modesty of women or molestation, followed by 1,022 complaints of rape and attempt to rape and 585 complaints of cybercrimes, as per the data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/46-rise-in-complaints-of-crimes-against-women-in-2021-up-delhi-top-list-ncw-101631013445931.html
07-09-2021||India||Hindustan Paper Mills workers to vacate quarters after dues are paid||The employees of the two closed paper mills under Hindustan Paper Corporation Ltd have agreed to leave their official quarters following payment of dues from a ₹570 crore relief fund announced by the Assam government on Monday to clear their pending salaries.The two paper mills located in Morigaon and Hailakandi districts of Assam have been non-functional since October 2015 and March 2017 respectively and workers have not received their salaries since then. The proposed relief fund will clear their salaries of the last 28 months along with payment of pension and other funds. The protesting employees have assured that they will release the quarters they have been occupying since their working days after receiving their dues.On December 23, 2019 Hindustan Paper Corporation’s liquidator ordered the employees of both the paper mills to vacate their quarters by January 31, 2020. The order was stayed by Delhi high court following a petition by Cachar Paper Project Workers Union.The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) also asked the Central government in 2019 to consider these two Paper Mills as “going concerns”, suggesting they were viable entities and their employees should not be asked to leave.But on September 4 this year, Hindustan Paper Corporation’s liquidator Kuldeep Verma issued a fresh order asking the employees to vacate the quarters within 15 days. “The order was issued under Section 33(7) of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016. “The employees are asked to release the quarters voluntarily, otherwise we’ll be bound to use forces to vacate them,” Verma wrote in his order.The employees cited the petition in Delhi high court and declared that they were ready to face use of force by authorities but won’t vacate their quarters.The impasse was solved in a three-hour long meeting held between the Assam government and the paper mill employees on Monday evening in Guwahati after the state proposed a relief fund of ₹570 crore to clear their pending salaries and pensions.“After discussing with the paper mill employees, the state government has decided to provide rupees 570 crore as a relief amount to the employees and workers of the Hindustan Paper Corporation Ltd. It has further been decided that the modalities for payment, approval of NCLT etc would be discussed and decided in due course of time after approval of Assam chief minister,” a statement released by the government said after the meeting.The employees welcomed the proposed relief fund but said they will vacate the quarters only after receiving the money. Nobendu Dey from the family welfare forum of paper mill employees said, “In the past, we got several assurances but we didn’t receive anything. This time, the state government has assured to clear [our] 28 months’ salary, pensions and other pending amounts. Once we get the money, we will leave the quarters.”Utpal Dutta Chaudhari from Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh said, “This is a welcome step which will give at least some relief to families for now. But this is not the permanent solution and we are going to meet Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sharma in the coming days.”Manabendra Chakraborty said, “Our case will continue in Delhi high court till we get everything we deserve. But more than that, we want the production of these two mills to resume, because apart from the direct employees, thousands of people are indirectly dependent on its production. The employees, who have not retired yet, deserve to be relocated in other industries if the government decides to close production of these two mills.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hindustan-paper-mills-workers-to-vacate-quarters-after-dues-are-paid-101631013533460.html

Agarwal said he was produced in a court and sent to jail. The 86-year-old Nand Kumar Baghel was booked last week for allegedly saying that Brahmins should be boycotted. According to officials, a case for promoting enmity between different groups was registered against the CM’s father on the complaint of the Sarv Brahmin Samaj. “A case was registered under Indian Penal Code Sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language) and 505(1)(b) (with intent to cause, or likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the state or against public tranquillity) against Nand Kumar Baghel (86),” Ajay Yadav, a senior police official, said on Saturday.The Sarv Brahmin Samaj lodged the complaint against Chhattisgarh CM’s father, saying Nand Kumar Baghel urged people to “boycott Brahmins” and termed them “foreigners” during an event in Uttar Pradesh.The chief minister said that “nobody is above the law” after his father was booked. “Nobody is above the law in my government even if he is the chief minister’s 86-year-old father,” Bhupesh Bhagel said.“Every person is equal before my government. Everyone knows about my ideological differences with my father. Our political thoughts and beliefs are different. I honour him as his son but as a CM I cannot forgive him for such statements which disturb public order,” he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-cm-s-father-sent-to-judicial-custody-over-hate-speech-101631011491770.html

07-09-2021||India||Pak ISI and Chinese proximity to Taliban, queer Quad pitch for Kabul recognition||Replying to a question on whether US would recognise Taliban government in Kabul, President Joe Biden said that it was a long way off. The conundrum faced by the democratic world, particularly the Quad, over recognizing Emirates of Afghanistan is whether the Taliban is a nationalistic Sunni Pashtun force ruling Kabul or is it a fundamentalist Islamic force out on a mission of global jihad or merely a stooge of the Pakistani ISI for extending the CPEC into Afghanistan.With the Haqqani Network faction of the Taliban pushing back those in charge of Doha political process, it is quite evident that the Taliban government will represent the aspirations of fundamentalists Pashtuns, whose total population is around 30 per cent in the country. This means that the Kabul government will have no truck with the minority Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks, what to talk of women and other groups.The statement that Taliban will the voice of (Sunni) Muslims throughout the world, as indicated by their spokesman, indicates that they will weaponize Islam to achieve their ends through violence and politicizing the region. That Taliban refuses to end its filial ties with Salafi groups like Al Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba is a sure indicator that they want to be the real shoulder or true representative of Sunni Islam with Shia Iran being the other one. With their ideological Deobandi brothers, Tehreek-e-Taliban and Jaish-e-Mohammad, part of their operations on either side of the Durand Line, the spurt in Islamic fundamentalism as during their earlier avatar is a given.The Taliban issue gets murkier considering the presence of Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, DG, Inter-Service Intelligence, in Kabul over the weekend, helping out the Sunni Pashtuns take out the resistance in Panjshir Valley with Pakistan Army commandoes in mufti. While Pakistan with the covert support of British intelligence is the via media between the Taliban and the western world, the presence of ISI super spy in Kabul shows that the Islamists are mere proxy of Rawalpindi. The British role particularly that of Chief of Defence Staff Nick Carter and its external intelligence is also under the scanner as Kabul watchers believe that the Joe Biden administration was led up the garden path by Whitehall in stitching out a one-way peace deal in favour of the Sunni force.With confusion prevailing in Kabul over government formation, the Quad powers will take a considered call on the Taliban government at the summit meeting in Washington on September 24. While usual suspects China, Russia, Pakistan, Turkey and Qatar may join the swearing in ceremony of the Taliban regime, Quad is in no hurry as they are in first verify and then trust mode. Clearly, the Taliban leaning towards China via Pakistan for support will be a deciding input for Quad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-isi-and-chinese-proximity-to-taliban-queer-quad-pitch-for-kabul-recognition-101630999882321.html

"Gwalior has reported 16 confirmed cases of dengue. We are keeping an eye on the situation,” Dr Manish Sharma, chief medical and health officer of Gwalior, told ANI. "In coordination with the municipal corporation, we are doing contact tracing and door-to-door survey. The hotspot zones where we had the highest cases of dengue are under strict observation.

Sanitisation and fogging are being carried out by sanitisation workers,” he said on Monday.Sharma also appealed to the people to maintain cleanliness in and around their locality, listed the do's and don'ts to curb the spread of dengue as he urged them to get themselves tested if they show any symptoms. "We have a large number of patients with the symptoms of fever, we are conducting tests,” Dr Nishant Nayak from the Civil Hospital in Gwalior said.On Monday, the Union ministry of health and family welfare’s expert team rushed to Uttar Pradesh’s Firozabad district following a fever outbreak, said that a majority of the cases are due to dengue as well as scrub typhus and leptospirosis. "Vector Indices were also found to be high with House Index and Container Index, both above 50 per cent, in Firozabad district and accordingly the vector surveillance and control measures have been instituted," Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a letter to UP chief secretary.Also read | Covid command centre to assist dengue patientsBhushan asked the UP government to screen all fever patients for dengue, malaria, scrub typhus and leptospirosis based on the detailed observations of the central team after the outbreak in Firozabad. He also said the state needs to strengthen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based testing facilities. "Activities related to fever survey, vector control and fever camps should continue as per micro plan submitted by the Central Team. Surveillance should be strengthened with the implementation of IHIP in the district in coordination with CSU IDSP, NCDC. Entomological activities should be strengthened and continued as per standard guidelines and SOPs of NVBDCP," Bhushan said in the letter.Also read | Firozabad dengue outbreak: CM orders strict action against officials found laxWhile dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection, scrub typhus is caused by bacteria spread by mites and leptospirosis spreads through water or soil contaminated by the urine of bacteria-infected animals such as pigs, dogs, rodents, etc. The rainy season is considered the active breeding time for vector-borne diseases, including dengue.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-up-s-firozabad-dengue-cases-reported-in-madhya-pradesh-101630997152058.html

Here the government didn’t allow family members to conduct last rites, instead the family members of Geelani were beaten especially women and also cases slapped against them. India is a very big country and this is against its culture. This country is respected across world for its democracy and in democracy everybody has right to put their perspective,” she tweeted.But the Jammu and Kashmir Police later said that Geelani's sons agreed to bury their father at night, and only changed their mind later.“IGP Kashmir personally spoke to a few relatives and ensured them of safe passage. However, 3 hrs later probably under the pressure from Pakistan & miscreants they behaved differently & started resorting to anti national activities including wrapping dead body in Pakistani flag, making loud sloganeering in favour of Pakistan and instigating neighbours to come out.

07-09-2021||India||Pilots’ association accuses Air India of gender discrimination||The Indian Commercial Pilots’ Association accused the government’s Air India of actively discriminating against women pilots, in a letter written to Air India Managing Director Rajiv Bansal on Monday.In the letter, the association said that the Upgradation List excluded the names or misspelt the names of few women pilots who took maternity leaves, thereby amounting to a denial of due service benefits like Leave Travel Concession (LTC) and adversely affecting their seniority.“It is reiterated that the present actions of Air India amount to a complete unauthorized transgression vis-à-vis the constitutionally protected rights of its female Pilot workforce and are, therefore, unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, and contrary to the judicial pronouncements on this issue,” the letter said.Also Read | London-bound Air India flight delayed after ants huddle at business classThe letter said that such discrimination has adversely affected the morale and dignity of the said women pilots and called on Air India to restore their rightful seniority.According to an extant policy of Air India, women pilots are compulsorily taken off all flight duties when they report their pregnancy. The said pilot is then shifted to desk duty with full pay, excluding flying allowance, performance incentives and mobile phone allowance.The pilots’ association said this is a violation of women pilots’ right to equality and dignity. “The same is also insulting to a woman pilot and almost makes out pregnancy as if it is a stigma or a negative marker which makes the said woman pilot ‘unfit’ or ‘not qualified or entitled’ to discharge her duties ably, shoulder to shoulder with her male counterparts,” the letter added.Citing a Delhi high court verdict, the association said that any form of pregnancy-related discrimination against expecting women professionals is violative of their fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15, 16, 19 and 21 of the Constitution and is thus, entirely non-permissible by law.Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 (“Act”) governs the conditions of service of women employees on maternity leave. Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act 2017 provides for the rights of pregnant employees and attempts to ensure that such employees do not have to face any kind of discrimination during their pregnancy.An Air India spokesperson said that Air India won’t comment on such internal matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilots-association-accuses-air-india-of-gender-discrimination-101630994811922.html

Here's what Supreme Court observed||A 2-judge bench of the Supreme Court has ruled that the presiding deity of a temple is the owner of the land attached to the temple, while priests are only required to perform rituals and maintain properties of the deity. In doing so, the bench, comprising Justice Hemant Gupta and Justice AS Bopanna upheld circulars issued by the Madhya Pradesh government directing that the names of priests be deleted from revenue records of temple properties.In its order, the bench cited precedents including the Ayodhya land dispute case. “The law is very clear on the distinction that priests hold such land only for the purpose of management. They are not ordinary tenants and should only manage the property of the deity. Such rights can be withdrawn if they fail to do the task they have been assigned, which is to conduct prayers and manage the land. Hence, they cannot be treated as owners of the land,” it said.Monday’s ruling was delivered on a petition filed by the Madhya Pradesh government challenging the quashing by the high court of the said circulars, which were issued under the Land Revenue Code, 1959.In its appeal, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government argued that these executive instructions were passed to prevent illegal sale of temple properties by priests. The priests, on the other hand, contended that they have been conferred rights to ownership of the land which, they, said, cannot be withdrawn by means of executive orders.The hearings in the case, therefore, were held to determine whether a priest can be considered as the owner of temple land under the state Land Revenue Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/temple-land-belongs-to-deity-or-priests-here-s-what-supreme-court-observed-101630989845617.html

Among the eight are the boy’s parents and medical officials. We will localise and contain the outbreak as we did in 2018,” said the minister.

The seers have protested and sought a ban on AIMIM rally, accusing Owaisi of hurting the sentiments of the Hindu community. Faizabad district was renamed Ayodhya in November 2018.The priest of Hanuman Garhi temple at Ayodhya, Mahanth Raju Das, said the seers will not allow Owaisi to visit Ayodhya.AIMIM state unit president Shaukat Ali claimed that the members of the saffron brigade and rival political parties were panicking due to AIMIM’s increasing support base among all communities. Along with Muslims, Dalits, backwards and upper caste Hindus have also been invited to the conference, he said. “Not only Muslims but other communities, too, have been harassed and exploited by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the centre and in Uttar Pradesh. The AIMIM has decided to fight for the rights of the people suppressed by the BJP government by organising a series of ‘vanchit-shoshit samaj’ conferences across Uttar Pradesh,” he said. On September 7, the AIMIM chief will address one such conference in Rudauli area of Ayodhya district. The next day he will address a conference in Sultanpur, and in Barabanki on September 9. Shaukat Ali said the AIMIM was not only fighting for the rights of the Muslims, but of all the communities allegedly victimised under the BJP government. He claimed that Muslims, Dalits, backwards and even upper caste people in UP were looking for an alternative to the BJP, the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress since these parties had used them as vote banks. He added that the AIMIM will work for the welfare of all communities if it wins the UP polls. The AIMIM has announced to field candidates on 100 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh. It has also joined an alliance of smaller political parties to form Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, which includes Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) led by Om Prakash Rajbhar, Jan Adhikar Party led by Babu Singh Kushwaha, Rashtriya Uday Party led by Babu Rampal, Rashtriya Upekshit Samaj Party led by Premchanda Prajapati and Janata Kranti Party led by Anil Singh Chauhan. The Morcha has invited the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bhim Army to join the pre-poll alliance. Earlier in July, Owaisi’s visit to Bahraich to pay obeisance to medieval Ghaznavid general Ghazi Salar Masud alias Ghazi Miya had triggered a war of words between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and leaders of Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha constituents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/owaisi-to-launch-aimim-s-2022-up-poll-campaign-from-ayodhya-seers-upset-101630986411400.html

Built by Cochin Shipyard and designed by the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), the nearly 9000 tonne ship will be used to test missiles up to range of 1500 kilometers deep inside the Indian Ocean without the threat to population or sea traffic as well as land mass limitation.India is expected to commission at least four ships this year with ballistic missile tracking ship INS Dhruv being handed over to National Research Technical Organization (NTRO) on September 10. Stealth guided missile destroyer INS Vishakapatnam and diesel attack submarine INS Vela, fourth of the Kalvari class, will also be commissioned by the end of the year.Once commissioned, the FTR INS Anvesh will bring futuristic missile projects up to speed as it will provide for a ready-made safety corridor without going through the tedious exercise of issuing NOTAMs to ships and aircraft flying in the area. While the DRDO missile testing site at Wheeler Island off Odisha is under the scanner of the adversaries, the FTR will also allow discreet testing of missiles and torpedoes 400 to 500 nautical miles into the sea.While only a select group of nations operate FTRs, the DRDO has specific plans to use the vessel, equipped with electro-optical missile tracking, S-band radar tracking, telemetry devices apart from a launch pad, control and mission control center, for testing its phase II of Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) interceptor missiles. The phase II of the BMD envisages intercepting and destroying enemy missile up to range of 2000 kilometers by kinetic force with the FTR allowing live testing of the interdictor missiles and not computer simulations.The FTR will also allow for live missile and torpedo firing by the Navy as well as surface-to-surface tactical missiles with the Indian Army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sea-trials-for-floating-missile-test-range-ins-anvesh-begin-this-month-101630984781024.html

An altercation soon ensued between the two sides, leaving a BJP worker injured, police added.The second clash took place at Bashpukur, nearly three kilometres from Dhanpur, after Sarkar reached there on foot, shielded by a human barricade made up of CPM activists after police asked him to return. One CPM and four BJP workers were injured in the clash. The police fired tear gas shells to disperse the mob.“The situation has been brought under control,” said an officer from police headquarters, who didn’t wish to be named.Sarkar, while addressing a rally near Kathalia block, urged party cadres and supporters to protest against political violence in the coming days. The BJP in turn said it will hold a demonstration at Kathalia market on September 8 to protest against CPM’s act of violence.“We are not believers of violence.

There are scattered rains over northwest India mainly due to the monsoon trough but this will enhance further by around September 8. Even after the low pressure system weakens its cyclonic circulation, rains will continue,” explained K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre, IMD. There is also likelihood of another low-pressure area forming over Bay of Bengal next week. “Development of that-low pressure area is being monitored. Some models are indicating that another low-pressure area will form,” she added.Between 8.30am on Sunday and 8.30am on Monday, certain stations in coastal Andhra Pradesh recorded heavy rain including Vizianagaram-18cm, Srikakulam-13cm, Vishakhapatnam-7cm; in west Madhya Pradesh: Khargone-12cm; Sehore-10cm; In Uttarakhand: Chamoli-9cm; In East Rajasthan: Rajsamand-8cm; In Kerala: Vaikom-7cm etc.There is a 9% rainfall deficiency over the country with 13% deficiency over central India; 13% over northwest India; 10% deficiency over east and northeast India and 10% excess over peninsular India. Over northwest India, while Delhi and Haryana have recorded 26% and 20% excess rains respectively; Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir have over 20% deficiency; Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have 7% and 9% deficiency respectively.There is likely to be above normal rainfall activity at over 110% of the so-called long period average or LPA in September, and while this will reduce the current monsoon rain deficiency of 9% over the country, overall monsoon rain (June 1 to September 30) will still be in the “lower end of normal category,” IMD said in its monsoon monthly forecast last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wet-spell-to-bring-widespread-rain-to-central-west-n-w-india-this-week-101630983471302.html
07-09-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee likely to start campaigning for Bhabanipur by-poll from Sept 8||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is scheduled to start her campaign for assembly by-polls from September 8, news agency ANI reported on Tuesday. Banerjee has been fielded by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) party from south Kolkata's Bhabanipur from where she had won in the past.Banerjee needs to get elected to the state assembly by November to continue as the chief minister. The TMC swept to power for the third time in West Bengal by winning 213 out of the 292 seats in the April-May assembly election. But Banerjee lost the poll from Nandigram to her protege-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by a narrow margin of 1,956 votes.On Saturday, the Election Commission announced that by-elections to three assembly seats - Bhabanipur, Jangipur and Samserganj - in West Bengal will be held on September 30.TMC leaders Jakir Hossain and Amirul Islam will be the party's candidates for Jangipur and Samserganj seats respectively.The Congress is unlikely to field a candidate against Banerjee in the upcoming by-elections.The counting of votes will take place on October 3.The Bhabanipur seat was vacated by West Bengal's agriculture minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay in May, making way for the chief minister to contest from there.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost the assembly polls but emerged as the second-largest party with 77 seats.Though polls and by-polls are to be held in seven seats in Bengal, the Election Commission has announced elections in only three seats. The TMC wants polls to be held on all the seven seats at the earliest, but the BJP has claimed that the situation is not conducive as the pandemic situation is not under control in any part of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-expected-to-start-campaigning-for-bhabanipur-by-poll-from-sept-8-101630982425331.html

Officials said the incident happened in Damoh district on Sunday as part of a ritual.The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has sought a report from the Damoh district administration.A video that has emerged reportedly shows at least six bare-bodied girls of about five years of age walking together with a wooden shaft on their shoulders with a frog tied to it. A group of women is seen singing devotional songs and following the procession.A report in India Today, the girls visit every household in the village and beg for flour, pulses and staple food cereals. The collected items are then donated for a ‘bhandara’ (community lunch) at the village temple. All residents have to ‘mandatorily’ remain present during the ritual. In another clipping, some women said the practice would help bring rainfall in the region where the paddy crop is drying. They added they would collect raw food grains from villagers during the procession and then cook food for 'bhandara' (community feast) at a local temple.“We believe that this will bring in rains,” they can be heard telling the person who recorded the incident. The village is located about 50km from the Damoh district headquarter in the rain-starved Bundelkhand region.Police said the ritual was performed with the consent of families of the young girls. Damoh superintendent of police (SP) DR Teniwar said police came to know about some girls being paraded naked to appease the god as part of local practice and prevailing social evils. “Police are investigating this incident. Action will be taken if it is found that girls were forced to walk naked,” he said.Damoh collector S Krishna Chaitanya said the local administration will submit a report in this regard to the NCPCR. He said the parents of these girls were also involved in this incident and an awareness campaign would be initiated to explain to the villagers the futility of such practices.The district collector said none of the villagers complained about this 'ritual'. "In such cases, the administration can only make the villagers aware about the futility of such superstition and make them understand that such practices don't yield desired results," he told reporters.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/minor-girls-made-to-walk-naked-to-please-rain-god-in-mp-s-damoh-district-101630980897403.html

He also brushed aside Opposition criticism over continuing some restrictions, saying festivals could be celebrated later but timely prevention of another Covid surge and saving people’s lives was a bigger “priority” at the moment.“The demands to open up activities have led to the risk of a spread. There will not be any need for curbs if rules and restrictions are properly followed. I am, therefore, appealing to all political parties, including Sena, to follow restrictions. Our priority should be [saving] the lives of people. Festivals can be celebrated even next year, if everything is well at home. To protect human lives, everyone should follow health restrictions meticulously. Avoid crowding and public events. Do not encourage political meetings, rallies and even Lord Ganesha would wish so,” Thackeray said in a statement on Monday.The state has named Pune, Ahmednagar, Satara, Solapur, Sangli, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg as districts of concern due to their high Covid-19 positivity rates.“The growth rate and weekly positivity rate in these districts are too high. Pune has clocked 6.58% positivity rate, the highest, and it’s more than 5% in Ahmednagar. With the Ganesh festival beginning from Friday, there are chances of it triggering the third wave or strengthening the second wave in these districts. The administrations need to take utmost care in these districts,” Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary of public health department had said during a presentation on Sunday.Both Maharashtra and Mumbai have been witnessing a rise in the daily caseload and positivity rate over the past few days. Maharashtra registered 3,626 new Covid-19 cases and 37 deaths on Monday and Mumbai recorded 383 new cases and five deaths, taking the toll to 15,998. The relatively lower numbers of fresh infections were a result of fewer tests (145,457) conducted in the last 24 hours owing to holidays on the weekend. On Sunday, state recorded 4,057 new cases among the 193,193 tested samples. The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 47,695. Pune tops cities with most active cases with 12,413 patients, followed by 7,275 in Thane and 6,328 in Satara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-celebrate-festivals-later-save-lives-1st-maharashtra-cm-backs-covid-curbs-101630981371030.html
07-09-2021||India||'Those who connect the dots...': S Jaishankar on why Quad matters||External affairs minister Dr S Jaishankar on Monday talked about "quantum shifts" along with more organic changes globally as he presented a case for the centrality of the Indo-Pacific and Quad in today's time. Jaishankar was delivering the annual JG Crawford Oration at the Australian National University.He said the world is at the cusp of something big and that the Indo-Pacific would be very much at its core."The geopolitical turbulence in the Indo-Pacific, the ripple implications of the Afghanistan withdrawal and the larger consequences of the Covid pandemic are three such current examples," he said."Those who connect the dots would surely agree that we are really now at the cusp of something big. As we seek to discern the outlines of what emerges next, there is no question that the Indo-Pacific would be very much at its core," Jaishankar said in the virtual address.Referring to geopolitical developments and challenges, Jaishankar also elaborated on the role of the United States of America and delved extensively into the reality of the strategic recalibration by it, adding the country is "undeniably the premier power of our times and will remain so.""The US is undeniably the premier power of our times and will remain so. Indeed, such is its centrality to the current order that be it ally, competitor, the agnostic or the undecided, none of us can really be indifferent to its posture," Jaishankar added.At the same time, he said the American polity is going through a serious introspection and that could well result in a different method of engaging the world.Jaishankar then talked about the emergence of China on the global stage, which he said saw "impressive growth"."There are three autonomous aspects to this phenomenon that need considered analysis. The first is the enormous expansion of Chinese capabilities in virtually every field," he said."The second is a projection pattern that changed beginning with 2009, and then more vigorously, after 2012. The third – and this was particularly apparent during the pandemic – is China's deep relevance to the global economy," observed the foreign minister.The external affairs minister also noted that the last two decades have seen a real transformation in India's relations with its three Quad partners: The United States, Japan and Australia.Jaishankar credited the role of the Indian diaspora living in the US and Australia which represents a "unique bridge between our societies", and regional convergence and natural empathy of democratic societies in ties with Japan as the reason for the Quad's proliferation."The Quad nations are all democratic polities, market economies and pluralistic societies. Apart from that natural understanding that it generates, similarity in the structural aspects of their relationships has helped to foster the platform," he said.In an apparent reference to the need to reform the United Nations and other global bodies, Jaishankar said a 75-year-old world order had run its course and was ripe for change."The fate of our region cannot be left, certainly not in a democratic era to the decisions of a few. Those of us who have interests, capabilities and confidence must step forward. If the G-7 could become the G-20, then our region too can surely find a broad-based decision-making process," the foreign minister said.He added that the Indo-Pacific is at the epicentre of change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/those-who-connect-the-dots-s-jaishankar-on-why-quad-matters-101630979593263.html
07-09-2021||India||Supreme Court to hear NCLAT's decision in Videocon resolution matter today||The Supreme Court will on Tuesday hear the decision of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on the Videocon Industries Ltd resolution matter. Earlier in August, the apex court had refused to set aside the stay order given by the NCLAT on Vedanta group’s Twin Star Technologies acquisition of Videocon group.The NCLAT had in July stayed industrialist Anil Agarwal-led Twin Star Technologies' ₹2,962.02 crore-takeover bid for debt-ridden Videocon Industries over the pleas filed by two dissenting creditors, reports news agency PTI.Prior to it, a two-member NCLAT bench headed by its Officiating Chairperson Justice A I S Cheema had stayed the order passed by the NCLAT in June and directed to maintain "status quo ante" as before passing of the order, till the next date of hearing.The NCLAT order came over the petition filed by two creditors--Bank of Maharashtra and IFCI Ltd--contending that as per the law, they could not have been paid less than the liquidation value. The NCLAT had in its June order observed that the liquidation value of the 13 Videocon group companies and resolution plan value were very close.In its appeal before the top court, Twin Star Technologies said that while staying the implementation of its resolution plan, the NCLAT “has blatantly ignored the settled law laid down by the SC in catena of decisions that the commercial wisdom of Committee of Creditors (CoC) in accepting or rejecting the resolution plan (RP) is paramount and that there should be no interference to an approved RP, unless the same contravenes Section 30(2) of the IBC… As apparent, its RP does not contravene any provisions of the Code or its regulations”.It also said that the order does not assign any reasons on prima facie case, irreparable loss and balance of convenience while staying the approval order. It stated that the reliance was based solely on a ‘doubt’ of the NCLAT of non-compliance of confidentiality clause in respect of liquidation value and fair market value as categorised by NCLAT in its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-nclat-s-decision-in-videocon-resolution-matter-today-101630977310745.html

Cipla is the sole distributor of Roche’s tocilizumab in India.Hetero said the authorization by the regulator will allow doctors to use it for treatment of covid in hospitalized adults who are receiving systemic corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.Tocilizumab is used with steroids to soothe an excessive immune response in severe covid patients. It was originally developed to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab is also part of India’s Covid treatment protocol, though as an off-label drug. Hetero’s Tocira will be marketed by its associate company ‘Hetero Healthcare’ in India.Hetero is among several Hyderabad-based companies which are involved in India’s fight against the contagious disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hetero-gets-emergency-nod-for-tocilizumab-use-101630965782168.html

But do not use our platform to push them,” said the bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Hrishikesh Roy and CT Ravikumar.The petition sought deferment because some of the students writing the exam would also have to appear for Odisha Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) on September 6 and CBSE Class 12 physics compartment/improvement examination on September 9. Advocate M Shoeb Alam appearing for the petitioners informed the court that the NTA had deferred Session 4 of JEE from July 27 to late August and could similarly consider deferring NEET.“Let the exam go on. This will amount to too much of meddling with education. We should now redefine the scope of our judicial review. Because of inconvenience of some, 16 lakh students should not suffer...,” the bench said. The court also noted the logistical challenges of planning and arranging for the examination centres.But the court offered an alternative. “If the petitioners so desire, are free to make representation(s) to the competent authority who may consider the representation(s) on its own merits and in accordance with law at the earliest,” it said.The top court also directed the University Grants Commission (UGC) and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to provisionally accommodate students appearing in the CBSE examination for private/compartment/patrachar (correspondence) categories pending announcement of their results by September 30.CBSE counsel Rupesh Kumar informed the court that nearly 90,000 students were appearing for the private/patrachar/second compartment and improvement exams. Advocates Apoorv Kurup for UGC and Harish Pandey for AICTE informed the court that even if the results are not available before September 30 and the admission process begins, the petitioners and similarly placed students could apply for provisional admissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-rejects-petition-seeking-neetdeferment-101630963744501.html

Vaze is in jail for his alleged role in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder case. On the basis of the CBI case, the ED launched a probe against the Nationalist Congress Party leader and issued a LOC against him, said the people. Deshmukh had in the past termed the allegations against him false.Meanwhile, a Delhi court has refused to extend the CBI custody of Deshmukh’s lawyer, Anand Daga, and CBI sub-inspector Abhishek Tiwari in a graft case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lookout-notice-against-ex-maharashtra-minister-deshmukh-over-corruption-case-101630962595761.html
07-09-2021||India||‘Obviously’: BJP responds to buzz that it wants to be part of Sikkim cabinet||SILIGURI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wants chief minister Prem Singh Tamang to induct some of its lawmakers into his council of ministers, a senior party leader confirmed on Monday in response to swirling rumours in Gangtok about tension with the ruling Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM).“Obviously, if our alliance partner considers ourselves worthy of getting ministers. We have conveyed our message to the SKM and the chief minister PS Golay (Prem Singh Tamang) and now the ball is in their court,” Sukanta Majumdar, the BJP’s Sikkim in-charge said when asked if his party wanted to be part of the council of ministers.“The party has conveyed its message to the chief minister and I think he will consider all those things positively for the betterment of the state.”To be sure, the ruling SKM has a majority on its own with 19 MLAs in the 32-member assembly. The BJP, with its 12 MLAs, is in an alliance with the SKM but is not a part of the government in the eastern Himalayan state. There is just one opposition legislator in Sikkim; former chief minister Pawan Chamling who founded Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) that ruled the state for five straight terms from 2014.On Sunday, the BJP delivered a 48-hour public ultimatum to government led by chief minister PS Tamang, better known as PS Golay, to resolve the problems of agitating adhoc teachers who are on indefinite hunger strike seeking continuation of their services till interviews are held.If the ultimatum goes unheard and no concrete steps are taken, the BJP will come out more strongly on the issue, BJP’s Sikkim unit spokesperson Raju Giri warned.The warning on Sunday triggered speculation that not everything was hunky dory in the alliance and the ultimatum was a tactic to pressure the coalition government to induct BJP lawmakers into the council of ministers.Majumdar, who is the BJP’s Lok Sabha MP from West Bengal’s Balurghat seat, brushed aside speculation about cracks in the alliance, but added there may be a “misunderunderstanding”.“Some misunderstanding may be there, otherwise it is okay. We are in alliance with the SKM, but we are not in the government. We have the right to raise the issues related with the people of Sikkim and that is what we are doing.”He added that the BJP wants the alliance with the SKM to continue “but it depends upon the SKM.”SKM spokesperson Jacob Khaling said there was no problem between the two. “The SKM has good rapport with the BJP and is running the government with good understanding with BP leaders.” In the May 2019 elections, the SKM won 17 of the state’s 32 seats while the Chamling’s SDF won 15. Two SDF and one SKM lawmakers, however, had to resign since the three of them had won from two seats. Later, the SKM led by PS Tamang (Golay) fought the by-elections for three assembly seats as an alliance partner of the BJP. The BJP won two seats while SKM won the third seat. In August 2019, 10 MLAs of the opposition SDF joined the BJP while two joined the ruling SKM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/obviously-bjp-responds-to-buzz-that-it-wants-to-be-part-of-sikkim-cabinet-101630957488193.html
07-09-2021||India||Farm unions say will take protest across the country||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha plans to mount a countrywide opposition to the Narendra Modi government’s economic policies, two leaders of the outfit said a day after hundreds of thousands of farmers gathered in Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar for a Kisan Mahapanchayat demanding a roll back of the Centre’s three contentious farm laws passed by Parliament a year ago.The plan envisions a three-point resolution, arrived at by SKM after a meeting of its key leaders on Monday. It includes setting up SKM units in every state, expanding their opposition to include broader criticism of the government’s economic policies and carrying out protests such as blocking toll plazas across regions.The SKM, an umbrella body of the protesting farmers’ unions, has been spearheading the agitation since November last year when farmers thronged Delhi’s borders against the three laws.After Sunday’s Mahapanchayat, the unions have announced their plan to oppose the government’s National Monetisation Pipeline, under which the Centre will monetise state-owned assets over the next four years to generate a revenue of ₹6 lakh crore and boost infrastructure spending to spur economic growth.They have alleged that the scheme will only benefit a few big corporations. “India is now on sale to (Gautam) Adani and (Mukesh) Ambani. We will not allow that to happen,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait, in a reference to the owners of two of India’s biggest business conglomerates that operate everything from seaports to airports.While the farmers began their agitation demanding a repeal of the three legislations -- the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act – the leaders of the movement have now broadened their agenda to oppose the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its economic policies.At the Mahapanchayat, the SKM also launched “Mission Uttar Pradesh”, a programme to propel their protests into the state where elections are due next year.“Sunday’s rally has given us new energy as well as direction,” said Yogendra Yadav, a key leader of the farmers’ platform.The outfit, Yadav said, will set up a unit in every state. “The Samyukta Kisan Morcha will set up units in every state and in all of Uttar Pradesh, from Gazipur on Delhi’s border to Ghazipur in the eastern-most part of Uttar Pradesh,” he said.Tikait asserted that the farmers will work to defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP in Uttar Pradesh.“We will hurt them in elections to teach them a lesson,” said Tikait, who hails from the Baliyan khap community -- a dominant farming clan among the Jat agrarian community in western UP.The community voted overwhelmingly in the favour of the BJP during the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, and the 2017 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections.Addressing the Mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar on Sunday, Tikait also called for Hindu-Muslim unity. “We will not allow anybody to divide farmers into Hindus and Muslims,” Yadav said at the event. The region witnessed bloody communal riots in 2013 that claimed over 60 lives.The protesting farmers have sought a repeal of the laws which they say will do away with the MSP system and allow big supermarkets and food businesses to skirt regulated markets. They have also demanded a law to guarantee minimum prices for their produce.The Modi government, however, has repeatedly said the reforms were necessary to boost farm earnings.“Steps taken by the government to improve farm incomes, cash transfers for farmers, linking of markets, building of warehouses, expansion of procurement, funding for agricultural markets known as mandis… all these together will counter any negative fallout,” said Gopal Aggarwal, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s national spokesperson overseeing economic affairs.The farm leaders have called a nationwide strike on September 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-unions-say-will-take-protest-across-the-country-101630954596623.html

07-09-2021||India||TN tables bill making it must for shop owners to provide seating for staff||The Tamil Nadu government on Monday tabled a bill in the assembly, which makes it mandatory for business establishments to provide seating arrangements for their employees, who stand for long hours.The bill is subject to assent from governor Banwarilal Purohit, and once it is an act, Tamil Nadu would be the second state after Kerala to legalise the ‘right to sit’ at the workplace.The bill was introduced by Minister for labour welfare and skill development, C V Ganesan. “Persons employed in shops and establishments in the state are made to stand throughout their duty time, resulting in varied health issues. Considering the plight of the employees, who are on their toes throughout their duty time, it is necessary to provide seating facilities to all the employees of the shops and establishments,” the bill stated. The issue was raised and discussed during a meeting of the state labour advisory board on September 4 in 2019, and the provision for seating facilities was approved by all members unopposed. So, the government decided to amend the Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishments Act, 1947 to be called the Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishments (Amendment) Act, 2021. The decision has come into force immediately, the minister said.Inserting a sub-section to the legislation, it reads “The premises of every establishment shall have suitable seating arrangements for all employees so that they may take advantage of any opportunity to sit which may occur in the course of their work and thereby avoid ‘on their toes’ situation throughout the working hours.” This has come as a huge relief to employees and salespeople working in shops and showrooms across the state – some of whom work in undesirable working conditions. “We stand for at least 7-8 hours,” said Sandeep Menon, who works in a high-end jewellery showroom in Chennai. “There are a few chairs for us to sit when we aren’t attending anyone, but we don’t usually sit because our floor managers may think we aren’t being active. But when there is a new government rule, that perception may change.”Advocate P Venu Gopal, a fourth general resident of T Nagar, a commercial hub dotted with street vendors and high-end showrooms in Chennai, said that during festival seasons, the workers are standing continuously and some of them work in double shifts due to the rush. “But unfortunately, it’s been an accepted way of working,” said Gopal. “They get to sit only during a meal break, and they usually sit on the floor. But no one has complained so far, which is vastly different from what had happened in Kerala.”G Venugopal, chairman of Naidu Hall, which has had stores across Chennai since the 1930s, said that their showrooms have resting areas. “90% of our workforce is women, so we have a resting area in the terrace of the showroom where they can take breaks and eat,” he said. “We also have stools on the floors for them to sit on a rotational basis. With the new legislation, it looks like we will provide each of them a stool or a chair to sit on the floor they’re working in.”Experts say that this is in the right direction for the health and dignity of workers. “To treat all employees with dignity and provide them with basic facilities is the most basic duty of any employer,” said senior advocate and human rights activist Sudha Ramalingam. “Providing seating facilities for the employees will pave the way for efficient working of the employees, as they will not be exhausted and have the energy to attend to their customers.”However, the bill does not detail the implementation and if shop owners would be penalised for not providing seating arrangements. HT contacted labour commissioner Atul Anand for clarification but he did not respond to calls and messages. Workers of textile showrooms in Kerala had protested for their right to sit during work, and in 2018, the neighbouring state amended the Kerala Shops and Establishments Act allowing the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-tables-bill-making-it-must-for-shop-owners-to-provide-seating-for-staff-101630954306295.html
07-09-2021||India||Police detain Andhra BJP chief, gen secy during stir over idol immersion on Ganesh Chaturthi||Andhra Pradesh police on Monday detained Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president Somu Veerraju, general secretary Vishnu Vardhan Reddy and national secretary, Y Satya Kumar after a scuffle broke out during the party’s protest over the state government’s decision not to allow idol immersion during this year’s Ganesh Chaturthi festival in Kurnool, the police said. The BJP held protests on Monday in all 13 districts of Andhra Pradesh demanding that the festival should be held. Party functionaries said that party leaders held demonstrations across the state demanding the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), led by chief minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, to allow public pandals for Ganesh idols this year to observe the festival. While the police detained leaders in some places like Kurnool, protests in other parts of the state were more or less peaceful, with some BJP leaders even giving representations to local authorities over the issue. In Kurnool, the police blocked the movement of BJP demonstrators, resulting in a scuffle between them. “The government is asking the public not to do Puja in public places and has asked them to do it in their homes citing Covid-19. The entire Ganesh immersion was created by Bal Gangadhar Tilak to build a community. The government is trying to curb it among Hindus and is slowly driving us towards western traditions,” alleged Sudheesh Rambhotla, BJP’s chief spokesperson in Andhra.Rambhotla said the ruling YSRCP held a massive gathering to observe the death anniversary of former chief minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh, late Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy, on September 2. “Jagan (who is Christian by faith) is trying to convert people into Christianity, and his target is 50,000 per Assembly constituency,” he alleged. Jagan and YSR Congress party has refuted such claims in the past. Vinayak (or Ganesh) Chaturthi, which falls on September 10, is widely observed in Hyderabad (capital of Telangana), wherein people gather in large numbers to immerse idols in lakes or other water bodies. While not as widespread in Andhra, it is observed similarly by a section of people every year. In 2020, too, the festivities got hampered due to the Covid pandemic. On Monday, the state reported 739 new cases, taking Andhra’s total tally to 2,022,064. Over the last fortnight, cases of Covid-19 in the state have been around 1,000 marks per day on average.When contacted, a senior police official who did not want to be quoted said that BJP leaders were released after being detained for some time and that no untoward incident took place during the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-detain-andhra-bjp-chief-gen-secy-during-stir-over-idol-immersion-on-ganesh-chaturthi-101630954247452.html
07-09-2021||India||Stop politics over God: Tamil Nadu minister to BJP state president||Tamil Nadu minister Sekar Babu on Monday told off the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president K Annamalai to not do politics in the name of God, after the ruling government prohibited people from publicly celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi.“I’m asking you not to put God in the forefront and make it political, unnecessarily create law and order issues and cause split among people who are living unitedly,” Babu, the minister for Tamil Nadu’s hindu religious and charitable endowments (HR & CE) told reporters on Monday. “All of us can pray to Vinayagar (Lord Ganesha) from our homes this year, and he will fulfil our wishes.”Last week, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) cited the Covid-19 pandemic to prohibit people from installing Ganesh idols in public places and from carrying out processions or immersions, which is a huge affair particularly in Chennai, a coastal city. Annamalai had asked the state government to reconsider its decision. On Monday, he issued a statement saying that chief minister M K Stalin was insulting Tamil people by interfering in an individual’s rights. He urged people to send a postcard to Stalin asking him to wish the people of the state for the festival like he extended wishes for other religious festivals. He urged people to celebrate by placing their idols outside their homes, the same way in which the BJP cadre plans to do. A day ago, Annamalai insisted that the DMK is being stubborn. “We will keep one-lakh idols in front of our (BJP) homes. The government cannot prevent that,” Annamalai had told reporters on Sunday. The BJP and right-wing affiliations such as the Hindu Munnani questioned the DMK’s decision of banning the religious procession when the state has opened up and allowed numerous relaxations. “While Tasmac liquor shops remain open in the state as the government claimed that Covid spread is curbed, the same government restricts the celebrations. Even with the rise of Covid cases in Maharashtra, its government allowed celebrations and idol processions,” Annamalai had said a week ago.When a PIL, filed by Hindu Munnetra Kazhagam to lay down SOPs for the Ganesh Chaturthi festival celebration, came up in the Madras high court on Monday, the state submitted that they were abiding by a circular issued by the union government asking states to regulate crowds during the festival.The same issue had played out last year between the BJP and their ally the AIADMK, which was governing the state and had banned processions due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stop-politics-over-god-tamil-nadu-minister-to-bjp-state-president-101630954246281.html
07-09-2021||India||Lakshadweep launches seaweed farming units in nine inhabited islands||After fisheries, coconut and tourism, the Lakshadweep administration has prioritized seaweed farming as the next major engine of economic development.In this effort, large-scale farming of indigeneous seaweeds was launched in nine inhabited islands of Lakshadweep on September 1 under the guidance of Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMRI), a premier marine research body, headquartered in Kochi. “The initiative is in line with a study conducted by the marine research body which found immense potential for quality seaweeds in serene and pollution-free lagoons for high-end utilisation like pharmaceuticals, food and nutraceuticals,” said CMFRI in a statement on Monday, which is planning to produce about 30,000 tonne worth ₹7.5 million in a year. The CMFRI said the indigenous red algae, Gracilaria edulis and Acanthophora spicifera are some of the species being planned in nearly 2,500 bamboo rafts benefitting 100 families belonging to 10 women self-help groups. “Known for its unique tuna fish, beautiful corals, reef fishes and other creatures now the islands are likely to be known as the seaweed farming hub of the country soon”, said Dr K Mohammed Koya, a senior scientist with the CMFRI. Recent studies by the CMFRI revealed a big growth of indigenous seaweed species in various lagoons of Lakshadweep with nearly 60-fold growth in 45 days for species like Gracilaria edulis. Following this, the island administration joined hands with the CMFRI for multi-locational trial farming and capacity building of stakeholders. “Experimental farming was conducted in the islands of Kiltan, Chetlah Kadmath, Agatti and Kavaratti during 2020-21 with good results,” said CMFRI. “Our studies revealed that the island has a potential of producing nearly 30,000 tonnes of dry seaweed per year worth ₹7.5 million by farming only 1% (200 ha) of its 21,290 ha of lagoon area (inhabited islands only)” said Dr Koya. To provide a sound scientific basis for a sustainable seaweed farming, the CMFRI and the Lakshadweep Krishi Vigyan Kendra began further studies for assessing the carrying capacity of the lagoons, spatial mapping of suitable farming sites, standardising farming methods for year-round farming in deeper areas and to ensure quality seeding materials, said CMFRI. Seaweed is consumed in several countries especially in East Asian countries. It is also used in food additives, medicine, fertiliser and cosmetic goods and to combat beach erosion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakshadweep-launches-seaweed-farming-units-in-nine-inhabited-islands-101630954189280.html
07-09-2021||India||Tamil Nadu to mark Periyar’s birth anniversary as ‘Day of Social Justice’: CM Stalin||Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Monday declared September 17 as ‘Day of Social Justice’ in the state, a tribute to social reformer and father of the Dravidian movement ‘Periyar’ EV Ramasamy on his birth anniversary. “This will be observed annually,” Stalin said.Periyar’s ideology was about social justice, self-respect, rationalism, equality, and brotherhood, principles that, Stalin added, employees of all state government offices would undertake a pledge of henceforth. The chief minister also said Periyar’s ideals laid a foundation for Tamil society’s growth and it would pave the way for the future.Stalin recalled Periyar’s life and said that he spoke of issues that others hesitate to raise. “Equality of men and women, and the abolition of caste were his main principles,” Stalin said.Periyar dropped his surname ‘Naicker’– a caste name – to show his stance on caste discrimination. Stalin credited Periyar for being instrumental in the first amendment to the Indian Constitution (that safeguarded reservation for backward classes) without even going to the Parliament.Born on September 17, 1879, Periyar has enjoyed an iconic status with his ideals, particularly his stance against oppression. His politics started with the Congress party, and much of the Tamil linguistic and land identities arose from Periyar’s self-respect movement, founded in 1925. Periyar founded Dravidar Kazhagam (DK), a political party, but in 1949 his lieutenant CN Annadurai moved to form the current ruling government Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). Later, MG Ramachandran split from the DMK, headed by M Karunanidhi then, to form the ADMK (later renamed AIADMK). Periyar died on December 24, 1973, but the Dravidian majors’ espouse his political stances.On Monday, all parties welcomed the announcement, and in an eventful turn, even the state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lent its support. “The social justice concept is among the principles of the BJP,” said BJP floor leader Nainar Nagendran in the assembly. “The BJP believes in theism and welcomes this announcement.”BJP has often been at odds with Periyar and his ideology. In 2019, the state unit of the party stoked a controversy by tweeting a picture of Periyar alongside his wife Maniammai, whom he married at the age of 69 when she was 31 and wrote that a society has to be built without any POSCO accused. BJP’s allies, the AIADMK and PMK, also condemned the tweet, which was deleted later. Last year, unidentified miscreants smeared saffron paint on a statue of Periyar in Trichy. More infamously, actor Rajinikanth, last January, during his speech at the 50th-anniversary event of Tamil magazine ‘Thuglak’, edited by right-wing ideologue S Gurumurty, accused Periyar of disrespecting Hindu gods by referring to a rally in 1971 in Salem district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-to-mark-periyar-s-birth-anniversary-as-day-of-social-justicecmstalin-101630954186835.html

Rafik, Sobuj Shaik, Mohammed Rafikdul Islam Ridoy, Rakibul Islam, Mohammed Babu Molla, Mohammed Alami Hossein, Mohammed Dalim, Hossain Azim, Mohammed Jamal, Enamul Haque Shuzan, Mohammed Ruhul Amin, Riday Islam, and Mohammed Milon Biswas — all Bangladeshi nationals — have been charged with sections of the IPC, the Foreigners Act, and the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, the NIA official said. The case was registered in June in Bengaluru against the 13 accused, based on a raid conducted by the police at a rented house where seven women and one child of Bangladeshi nationality were rescued from the custody of four human traffickers, a NIA official said. The NIA took over the case and found that the 13 charge-sheeted accused had illegally crossed over to India from Bangladesh, the official of the premier investigation agency said. They were luring women from Bangladesh and trafficking them to India with the promise of jobs, the NIA official added.

Seniors will give the guidance, B S Yediyurappa (former CM) will be the Margadarshak (guiding force) during the next election,” Kateel said in response to a question.Speaking to reporters here, he said there is no opposition or differences within the party on this issue.“....our party is unique, when we have a Chief Minister, he will lead the party in the next election, it has been clarified (by Shah), but we will all work collectively as a team, so we will all go together,” he said in response to a question on differences in the party after Amit Shah’s statement.During his visit to Davangere last week, Shah had exuded confidence that the BJP would once again come back to power in Karnataka with a complete mandate, under Bommai’s leadership.However, senior party leader and Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K S Eshwarappa had contended that the BJP would fight the next assembly election under “collective leadership” of which Bommai will be a part.There were also reports of former chief ministers Jagadish Shettar and B S Yediyurappa holding talks on September 4, regarding Shah’s statement.Noting that it will be the chief minister, who will lead during the next election, when the party is in the government, the state BJP chief in response to a question pointed out that the party was going to assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, under incumbent Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s leadership.“It is the same for all states, when the party is in government. When not in government it will be the party president, while in government it will be Chief Minister along with the president....so the leadership will be his (CM’s), along with him we will all work collectively, there is no difference on that,” he added.To a specific question whether the party will face the next election under Bommai’s leadership and has everyone in the party have accepted it. Kateel said Bommai became the Chief Minister following the directions from the central leadership, and it has been accepted by everyone.“There is still one-and-a-half years left for the assembly election.Already Amit Shah has given a message, the party will work together as a team,” he said.A section of BJP leaders are said to be sceptical about Shah’s statement, as Bommai, who is not a native BJP leader, and the message such a statement at this stage may send to party’s hardcore Hindutva ideologues or voter base.In a surprise move Bommai, who has his political origins in Janata Parivar, was made the Chief Minister on July 28,following the exit of state BJP strongman Yediyurappa from the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-bommai-to-lead-bjp-in-2023-polls-says-state-president-kateel-101630954006304.html
07-09-2021||India||It’s back to school for students of classes 6-8||Schools in Karnataka reopened for students of classes 6 to 8 on Monday in areas where the Covid-19 positivity rate is below 2%. Karnataka primary and secondary education minister BC Nagesh said that the government decided to reopen schools after approval from the state’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Covid-19. “We are thinking about reopening schools for primary classes,” Nagesh told reporters. Shashi Kumar, the general secretary of the Associated Management of Private Schools in Karnataka on Monday said that attendance in the private schools in the state was around 55%. He, however, added that most private schools are continuing with online classes due to safety concerns. “Compared with classes 9 and 10, the attendance is low. We hope these numbers will increase,” Shashi Kumar said. The state government is yet to release the data on first-day attendance. Talking to reporters on Monday, Nagesh said that the government will take a decision on reopening schools for students of classes 1 to 5 after consulting the technical advisory committee. He, however, did not specify any timeline. The government has already allowed the reopening of schools for students from classes 9 to 12 since August 23. Nagesh said many parents and students urged him to reopen schools as he visited several parts of the state. He said the government and district administrations have been working together with the department for the safe conduct of classes. “The department had an intention of reopening schools for some time now and teachers were also ready for it; but keeping in mind the health of the students along with education and concerns of the parents, we discussed with the technical advisory committee and after taking the opinion of expert pediatricians, we are reopening schools for classes 6,7 and 8,” he told reporters. There are over 3.1 million students in these three classes across around 38,000 schools in the state, according to official data.It is mandatory for students to submit a consent letter from their parents to attend offline classes and these classes are not compulsory, as there is a provision of online classes also. The government has said that offline classes for students of classes 6 to 8 will be held on alternate days, each with 50 per cent attendance. They will be held on five days a week and school authorities will sanitize and put in other Covid control measures over the weekend. A technical advisory committee (TAC) on the third wave, headed by noted cardiologist, Dr Devi Shetty, had submitted its report to the Basavaraj Bommai government on June 22. It had strongly recommended that schools and physical classes be resumed at the earliest.“Any further delay in school reopening may push children into malnutrition, child labour, child marriage, child trafficking, begging etc., making their condition further worse,” according to the report. According to the TAC, there are 23,838,995 people below the age of 18 in the state with an estimated population of 70,259,592, accounting for around 34%.There are 24,391 schools that have grades between 1 and 5 which have over 5.4 million students and around 162,000 lakh teachers, data shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/its-back-to-school-for-students-of-classes-68-101630953947627.html
07-09-2021||India||BJP impresses in Urban Local Body polls, wins 35 seats in Belagavi||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday secured control over the Belagavi city corporation for the first time, by winning 35 out of the 58 seats in the Urban Local Body (ULB) polls held on September 3. The victory in Belagavi, marks an important landmark for saffron party,which fought the polls on the development plank. So far, language was the as the main election agenda in local polls in the district. The win also marks a new high for the Basavaraj Bommai government in the state that has been in power for just over a month and faced its first electoral test in the state.“Within one month of our government this election was the first sign of approval and support. And in the coming days this will show the direction (of future elections),” chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Monday.The victory for the BJP in Belagavi also relegated the Congress to a distant second as well as the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES), a pro-Marathi outfit to the opposition benches.A total of 1,105 candidates contested the elections in the three ULB polls comprising 195 seats. The Congress, which was hopeful of a better show in Belagavi, won 10 seats while the Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majli-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) managed to secure just one. Twelve seats went to Independents, including two from the MES, according to data shared by the state election commission on Monday.The victory for the BJP will help boost the saffron party’s confidence ahead of the yet-to-be announced zilla and taluk panchayat elections which would be a major test for all political outfits to understand the support in the grass roots which would be a crucial indicator before the 2023 assembly polls.In Hubballi-Dharwad, the BJP won 39 out of the total 82 wards that went to the polls, while the Congress secured 33 seats and the Janata Dal (Secular) managed only one. The AIMIM won three seats and six went to Independents.In Kalaburagi, the BJP broke new ground with 23 seats at the cost of the Congress which managed 27. The JD(S) won four and there was one Independent, which leaves the district with no clear majority for any one party. However, the hung verdict gives rise to the possibility of local alliances including one with the BJP and JD(S). All in all, the BJP managed to win 97 out of the total 195 seats in the three large corporation ULB polls while the Congress got 70. The JD(S), which has no real presence in the northern districts of the state, managed 5 seats in all.The AIMIM had an impressive outing with a total of four seats while 19 went to Independents.The BJP also won 12 out of the 31 seats in Bengaluru Rural, one out of 23 in Chikamagalur and one in Bidar. The Congress managed to win 15 seats in Chikmagaluru.“The government is in their hands. They have more resources, misuse power and all officials work for them. As a matter of fact, in Kalaburagi, the commissioner acted like a BJP worker,” Siddaramaiah, the former chief minister and Congress’s leader of the opposition said on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-impresses-in-urban-local-body-polls-wins-35-seats-in-belagavi-101630953946450.html
07-09-2021||India||11 contacts of Nipah victim symptomatic: Kerala govt||At least 11 of 251 people on the contact list of the 12-year-old boy, who succumbed to Nipah virus in Kozhikode district on Sunday, have been admitted to hospital with symptoms, state health minister Veena George said on Monday.At least 54 of the total are believed to be in the high risk category, she added. The minister’s remarks came as the Union health ministry directed the state government to shift all high-risk contacts of Nipah-infected patients to a quarantine facility to prevent further spread. Briefing reporters in Kozhikode on the situation, George said the samples of all 11 people -- mainly the deceased’s mother, three relatives and seven healthcare workers -- were sent for testing to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune and the results of eight of them are likely to be available late at night. The condition of all the 11 people is stable, she said. “There are 38 persons in isolation at the Kozhikode Medical College hospital of which 11 have shown symptoms. Samples of eight persons have been sent to Pune NIV for testing,” the minister said. “Hectic efforts are on to trace the source of infection. Experts have recovered half-eaten rambutan fruits from the premises of the boy who died on Sunday. They also found a fruit bat habitat near their house,” the minister said. Fruit bats are considered to be the main carrier and reservoir of the virus. “We have traced all contacts of the boy and quarantined them. The next week is crucial for us. We have to keep utmost vigil,” the minister said, adding that the health department will also look into some of the earlier deaths, if any, with the same symptoms. The minister said that Pune NIV is planning to set up a special laboratory at the medical college hospital here to facilitate quick testing. The health department is also planning to launch a mobile application to check the exact situation of Nipah and contain any false information. “Different teams are at work to find out the source of infection. If needed, more experts will be deployed. Since the whole state is following strict physical distancing and masking, the chances of high transmission are low. But we can’t lower our guard,” she said. Relatives of the deceased boy told a team from the National Centre for Disease Control that he had eaten rambutan fruits two days before he developed a fever. The team later found rambutan and guava at his house. An area of 3 km radius from the house of the deceased has been sealed. The state animal husbandry department has also started examining domestic animals and pets in the area and collected blood samples in this regard. “The blood and serum samples of the two goats, owned by the child’s family, will be tested by the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal,” she said, adding that a team from Bhopal NIV will reach Kozhikode on Wednesday.The minister exuded confidence that the latest outbreak will be localised and contained like the 2018 outbreak which claimed 17 lives in the district. The government has released a Nipah-management plan, listing out protocols related to treatment procedures, precautions and norms for hospitalisation, among other details. The state government has also decided to suspend the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive in Kozhikode city and outskirts in view of the new threat, she said. Following the fresh detection of the virus in Kozhikode, which is seeing cases for the second time in three years, a high alert has been sounded in the two neighbouring districts -- Kannur and densely-populated Malappuram. Malappuram had also reported a few cases in the last outbreak. Meanwhile in a letter to Kerala chief secretary V P Joy, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the state will have to implement strict surveillance measures to track each suspected case.Based on the report submitted by the Central team of National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), which was deputed to Kozhikode, Bhushan said: “Both the hospital-based and community-based surveillance needs to be strengthened. Awareness needs of Acute Enchephalitis Syndrome/Respiratory Distress and risk communicated to the public.”In the letter, Bhushan said that the central team has carried out field investigations along with the district surveillance officer and other officials. “It also visited the epi-centre, house of the 12-year-old male diseased child, and interacted with family members and others.”Recommending the measures, the union health secretary said: “The district authorities must identify primary and secondary contacts and prepare line listing of high risk and low risk”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-contacts-of-nipah-victim-symptomatic-kerala-govt-101630953887865.html
07-09-2021||India||Experts question govt nod to Ganesh festival||Karnataka government’s decision to allow Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations in the state has raised concerns among experts. Even though the government has decided to allow celebrations only in districts with a positivity rate of less than 2% and strict restrictions have been imposed in districts where celebrations have been allowed, experts are questioning the decision. Dr N Manjunath, member of state Covid Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, said that festivals could become potential super-spreaders if a large number of people are allowed to celebrate together. “A large number of people usually come out for festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi and markets are often overcrowded. We have our Covid situation under control, such overcrowding could undo it,” he said. Another TAC member on the condition of anonymity said that even though the government has put strict restrictions in place, implementation has been a problem. “How will they control the markets? In every festival before this, we have seen photos of people thronging KR Market and other places. Ganesha being a longer festival than others, the chances of gathering it are much higher. If you look at how cases have increased in Kerala after Onam, we should have imposed more restrictions,” he said. Talking about the restrictions imposed for the festival, R Ashok, Karnataka’s revenue minister on Sunday had said, “The (Karnataka) government is allowing the (Ganesh Chathurthi) festival but several restrictions are in place. There will be no procession orchestra, no DJ and pandals must be 50/50 feet and Covid vaccination is compulsory wherever the Ganapathy festival is being held. However, the minister was not clear on how the government or authorities will decide who will be allowed to keep the idol in public spaces. In Karnataka, like other states, Ganesh Chathurthi is celebrated with much pomp and fervor with public processions, dance, cultural programs which attract large crowds of worshippers and others. Ashok said that the government has approved to allow one Ganesh festival per ward in urban areas and that district authorities would decide on similar requests in rural regions. Officials have stressed that prior permission is mandatory for anyone from the local district administration or from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (in Bengaluru city areas) to install Ganesha idols and to organize related festivities. “Officials will be deployed to ensure celebrations conclude by 9 pm. It is mandatory that all organizers of the celebration shall be fully vaccinated as well,” a senior government official said. Health Department officials, however, said strict measures are in place. A senior official said it has been clearly stated that the height of the idols installed at public places and in houses should not be more than 4 ft and 2 ft, respectively. Deputy commissioners of border districts had been empowered to take decisions on granting permission to public celebrations of the festival depending on the Covid-19 cases. “During the celebrations, the state government has barred the distribution of food and prasad. Also, if anyone violates the guidelines to have only one Ganesh idol in each ward, will face police action. We have already held a meeting with the police and one more meeting will be held to finalize the decision,” said BBMP commissioner Gaurav Gupta on Monday. Meanwhile, while neighbouring Tamil Nadu has banned public processions and celebrations , Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra have decided to ban all Ganesh celebrations considering increase in Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-question-govt-nod-to-ganesh-festival-101630953886609.html
07-09-2021||India||Centre emasculating tribunals: Apex court||The Union government has no respect for the judgments of the top court and is now testing its patience, said an anguished Supreme Court on Monday, adding the government is “emasculating tribunals” by not filling up vacancies in them. A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, further observed it is “very upset” by the government and censured the Centre for re-enacting the very same provisions for the administration of tribunals that were struck down by the court in July. “The government is bent upon not honouring the orders of this court... Virtually the same Act is re-enacted. We cannot have this situation. Legislature can take away the basis of a judgment but you cannot overrule a judgment by re-enacting the very same provisions,” said the bench, which also included justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao. The bench said that the court will have to consider staying the new law since it is a “replica” of the old law, which was held to be unconstitutional. There are more than 200 posts lying vacant across 15 tribunals in the country. Commending the Centre for clearing nine names as judges of the Supreme Court within a week, the bench clarified that it is not looking for “any confrontation with the government” but added that the reluctance in appointing members in tribunals has left most of them virtually defunct. The court was hearing a clutch of separate petitions on vacancies across the tribunals and a challenge to the Tribunal Reforms Bill, which was passed by both the houses in the Monsoon session of the parliament. The petitioners included advocate Amit Sahni, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh and Delhi Bar Association. Senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Vikas Singh appeared for some of the petitioners. When the hearing commenced on Monday, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, requested an adjournment seeking accommodation for attorney general KK Venugopal, who was not available. But the bench turned down the S-G’s request. “There is no respect to the judgment of this court. You are testing our patience,” retorted the bench, asking Mehta about the number of people appointed in tribunals since the last hearing two weeks ago. At this point, Mehta shared with the bench a communication received from the Union finance ministry on Monday morning that said the government will take decisions within two weeks in cases where the Search-Cum-Selection Committee (SCSS) for various tribunals have made their recommendations. These committees are led by a sitting Supreme Court judge and also include secretaries from the government. Justice Rao, on his part, asked Mehta why the government did not make appointments for names sent a year-and-a-half ago when those recommendations were made completely in accordance with the rules existing at that point of time. “Many tribunals are on the verge of closing down. Then, there are tribunals working with only one member... See the burden we have to face now. You are emasculating the tribunals by not appointing members,” said the judge. Justice Chandrachud flagged vacancies in company law tribunals. “NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) and NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal) are critical to the economy. They are cornerstones of reconstructions and restructuring of companies. But because of vacancies, they have not been able to adhere to the timelines. A very critical situation has arisen.”Justice Chandrachud called it a “waste of time and energy” when the government was not interested in clearing names, which were sent by the selection committee in consultation with the government’s bureaucrats, after they were okayed by the Intelligence Bureau (IB). At this, the CJI said the court is now contemplating the option of staying all tribunal related laws and asking the high courts to start dealing with the cases or issue a contempt notice to the government. “What is your alternative proposal? Tell us if you do not want tribunals. If you don’t have faith in the two judges of this court and your own bureaucrats (who comprise the selection committee for tribunals), we can’t understand. Let us also tell you that we are not bothered about your subsequent legislation,” the bench told the S-G. It highlighted that there is no difference between the new law on tribunals and the one that was struck down by the court in July. Justice Chandrachud cited at least four such provisions. The first one related to fixing the tenure of members and chairpersons of tribunals at four years while the court in its July judgment said the tenure has to be for five years. Similarly, the minimum age requirement of 50 years, which was quashed by the court in July, still finds a place in the new law. The court ruling held that the provision relating to the recommendation of two names for each post by the SCSC and further, requiring the decision to be taken by the government preferably within three months is violative of the Constitution. But the new law puts this back in the statute. The provision relating to allowance and perks have also been brought back. “The situation is very serious. We are very upset with what has transpired. We will give you 3-4 days and we will then pass an order on the new legislation after hearing you...you cannot re-enact the same provision. This is not validating legislation,” said the bench. It added the court cannot go on delivering judgments after judgments on the same issue. The court issued notices in the petitions for filling up vacancies in the tribunals and against the validity of the new law while fixing the matter for next Monday. “We expect some appointments by Monday next,” the bench told the S-G. Mehta agreed to come back with instructions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-emasculating-tribunals-apex-court-101630953526697.html
07-09-2021||India||UP deaths causedby dengue, 2 other diseases: Centre||A majority of the fever cases in Uttar Pradesh’s Firozabad district are due to dengue, and a few due to scrub typhus and leptospirosis, according to the investigation of Union health ministry’s expert team which was rushed to the region following a fever outbreak that has claimed at least 51 lives, mostly children. Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection; scrub typhus is caused by bacteria spread by mites; and leptospirosis spreads through water or soil contaminated by the urine of bacteria-infected animals such as pigs, dogs, rodents, etc.As many as 51 persons have died, of which at least 36 includes children, in Western Uttar Pradesh over the past two weeks. Hundreds more are undergoing treatment for the diseases currently.A six-member central team of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and National Vector Borne Disease Control Porgramme (NVBDCP) was rushed to Firozabad last week. Preliminary findings of its investigation were submitted to the Union health ministry on Monday.“The central team has observed that the majority of cases are due to dengue, while a few because of scrub typhus and leptospirosis. Vector indices were also found to be high with house index and container index, both, above 50% in Firozabad district; and accordingly the vector surveillance and control measures have been instituted,” said Bhushan in his letter to UP chief secretary, RK Tiwari.These indices show the percentage of homes of containers infested with larvae during inspections.Based on their detailed observation, the government experts recommended a slew of measures that must be strictly and quickly implemented to contain the outbreak.All fever patients need to be screened for dengue, malaria, scrub typhus, and leptospirosis, the team suggested; along with ongoing fever survey, vector control measures, and fever camps to be continued at the local level. Surveillance needs to be strengthened with the implementation of Integrated Health Information Platform in the district in coordination with central surveillance unit of the integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP) and NCDC.“Entomological (related to insects) activities to be strengthened and continued as per standard guidelines and standard operating procedures of NVBDCP (National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme). Isolation beds and admission facilities in district hospital of Firozabad and neighbouring districts need to be augmented; a short reorientation should be organised of all doctors at primary health centre, community health centre, and district hospital cum medical college on recent guidelines for management of dengue, scrub typhus and leptospirosis; services of experts on infectious diseases from KGMU and similar institutions may be utilized for this purpose; and information education and communication activities need to be intensified by the district administration,” Bhushan added in his letter outlining the central team’s suggestions.NCDC has also deputed two senior experts in the district for 14 days to help the district in strengthening its outbreak response.UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath held a meeting and directed teams of specialists from Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and King George’s Medical University in Lucknow to also be sent to Firozabad, Agra and Mathura to guide local doctors and oversee treatment of patients. To contain the outbreak, the Firozabad district administration has said it is releasing about 25,000 mosquitofish that eat larvae of dengue-breeding mosquitoes in ponds.District health officials have started releasing the fish, generically known as Gambusia, in ponds in urban as well as rural areas of the district, Dinesh Kumar Premi, chief medical officer (CMO) told PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/updeaths-causedby-dengue-2-other-diseases-centre-101630953405440.html
07-09-2021||India||Must find ways, means to boost farm productivity and agri exports: Piyush Goyal||Union food & public distribution minister Piyush Goyal on Monday stressed the need for finding ways and means to augment farm productivity and agriculture exports to boost farm incomes in the country.He also said that the Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) will soon submit a comprehensive modern crop storage plan for the benefit of farmers in India, according to an official release.Speaking at the Conference on Agri Infra Fund and Digital India, Goyal said that a cluster-based approach in agriculture produce marketing and exports will enable to “bring down cost of production without affecting quality.”He also threw light on the works done in the last seven years, including India featuring in the ninth position in the top 10 list of agricultural produce exporters in 2019 with 3.1% global agricultural exports as per WTO report. Goyal also said that the export of agricultural and allied products – including marine and plantation items, saw a 17.34% hike during 2020-21 as opposed to its previous financial year (2019-20).At Monday’s event, the minister said that focus needs to be present on “five pillars to create atma nirbhar Kisan”. These include the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund of ₹1 lakh crore, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), digital agriculture, national mission on oilseeds and oil palm, and export of agriculture products, the official government release read.Talking about the various initiatives and works done by the Centre, Goyal, who also holds the profile of the Union commerce minister, said that the department of commerce has reached out to the states, districts and farms in order to boost a rise in exports of agriculture products.He added that farmers have been given a “stake in exports of their produce, export market linkages [have been] provided to farmers/FPOs,” and export-oriented production with Farmer Producer Organisations (FPO) have also been encouraged.The minister, while outlining the agricultural achievements, mentioned the export of dragon fruit to London and Bahrain, a consignment of ‘Raja Mircha’ (king chili) from Nagaland exported to London by air for the first time, and ‘Shahi Litchi’ from Bihar exported to the UK as well by air, among others.Goyal also mentioned export of saffron and dry fruits from Jammu & Kashmir to Saudi Arabia and a consignment of vegetables consisting of curry leaves and ladies finger sourced from Hardiwar exported to Dubai.“India has the attention of the entire world today and we are being looked upon as a trusted partner,” the release quoted him as saying.Goyal said that India is “expecting FTAs/PTAs with many countries” for instance, the UK, the EU and Australia, among others that will help in “boosting agriculture exports as well.”The minister added that by “expediting technology adoption” in agricultural practices, India can boost its competitive advantage further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/must-find-ways-means-to-boost-farm-productivity-and-agri-exports-piyush-goyal-101630952750572.html
07-09-2021||India||12.5 mn Covid-19 vaccine doses being given in a day in India: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said India administered as high as 12.5 million doses against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) daily, which is more than the entire population of several countries. “…Free vaccines to everyone and the confidence of 130 crore Indians is the result of self-reliance in vaccines. India is making a record by administering 1.25 crore vaccines in a day. The number of vaccines India is administering in a day is more than the entire population of many countries,” the PM said while interacting with health care workers and Covid-19 vaccine beneficiaries of Himachal Pradesh. On August 28, Himachal became the first state in the country to cover first vaccine dose of all eligible beneficiaries. The state has also crossed almost one third of the population in the case of second dose also. “The success of India’s vaccination campaign is the result of the culmination of hard work and valour of every Indian. The ‘Sabka Prayas’ that I had mentioned from the Red Fort on the 75th Independence Day is a reflection of that. After Himachal, Sikkim and Dadra Nagar Haveli have crossed the 100% first dose milestone and many states are also very close to it,” he added. Modi reiterated the need for making concerted efforts to ensure those who took their first dose must also take the second dose and complete the course. He gave credit for achieving this milestone to health care workers and support staff on ground. He appreciated the tireless efforts of Covid warriors, including doctors, paramedical staff, Asha and anganwadi workers, and teachers. “This achievement is the result of the high spirits of all health workers, ASHA workers, Anganwadi workers, teachers and all other colleagues. There is also a lot of hard work by the people associated with the health sector, be it doctors, paramedical staff, or other assistants. In this too, a large number of our sisters have played a special role,” the prime minister said. Modi said as many as 700 million vaccines have been administered so far in the country and said that doctors, nurses, Anganwadi-ASHA workers, local administration, vaccine manufacturing companies and scientists of India have put in their best efforts. He also warned that people couldn’t afford to drop their guard just yet. “There has been a rapid pace of vaccination, but we have to guard against any indifference and carelessness and I have been reiterating a mantra from Day 1 that we must not forget the mantra of ‘Dawai Bhi Kadai Bhi (yes to medicine, yes to caution),’ he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/125-mn-covid-19-vaccine-doses-being-given-in-a-day-in-india-pm-modi-101630952867196.html
07-09-2021||India||Experts call for reopening of schools||Schools must be reopened for in-person teaching for all age groups, a collective of epidemiologists has recommended, saying there was no evidence it would lead to a greater infection risk among children and that keeping them home will instead lead to lasting social and developmental impairment and increase inequality among privileged and underprivileged children. Last year, 167 countries across the world had implemented measures like lockdowns and school closures to prevent transmission of a virus not very well understood at the time. Most countries re-opened schools slowly; India was among the last eight to still have physical schools closed before some of the states started reopening them, the Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine said in its report. The report addresses two main concerns when it comes to sending children to a school – the risk of infection and severe disease in the children and the risk of transmission to other more vulnerable members of the family. The report says if children get infected at a similar rate as adults, most are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and are less likely to pass the virus. Most children also do not need hospital and intensive (ICU) care, the report said, citing studies. These factors, the report adds, makes a case to reopen schools before vaccinations are rolled out. The report suggests that staff members and vulnerable people at homes of schoolchildren must be vaccinated to protect from severe disease. “What we are saying is that depending on the local situations – number of cases, positivity rate – schools should be the first to open and last to close. What we have seen is even when children are at home, they are exposed to the virus. Going to school does not increase that risk,” said Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, well-known epidemiologist, who was part of the group. “If children can go to malls and markets, why not schools?”On the other hand, the report added, keeping schoolchildren at home can lead to social and developmental challenges for many, especially the underprivileged. The report states that with rapid digitisation of education during the pandemic, those without access to phones, computers, and internet are unable to keep up. Schools also teach children social skills that cannot be taught online. The report also adds specific risks for children from poor families: schools provide mid-day meals and once these are closed, the likelihood of a child being pushed into child labour rises. Going to school also prevents early age obesity and the exercise helps young age development. “Due to the pandemic a major chunk of our population has been deprived of education with virtually no education in rural areas due to the digital divide. The growth and development along with nutritional status from preschool to higher classes is compromised. The overall objective of the advisory is to support the government to reopen the schools with appropriate precautions. Benefits of opening the schools far outweigh the risk of Covid-19,” said Dr Suneela Garg, president of IAPSM and member of the Lancet commission on Covid-19 India. The report also states steps to ensure safe return to schools – classrooms must be well-ventilated, students seated apart, alternate attendance be allowed, face masks and regular hand-washing be compulsory and staff be vaccinated. The recommendations also call for counsellors to address anxieties that may arise due to the return to school in children. The organisation includes people such as the chairperson of the scientific advisory committee of the National Institute of Epidemiology Dr JP Muliyil, and the head of the department of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr Sanjay Rai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-call-for-reopening-of-schools-101630952865872.html
07-09-2021||India||Issue notice to Centre on Bengal plea against CBI probes: SC to registrar||The Supreme Court on Monday directed its registry to issue a formal notice to the Centre on a suit filed by the West Bengal government to debar the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) from conducting probes in the state without prior approval of the government. A bench, led by Justice L Nageswara Rao, said the notice has to be issued as a matter of procedure. “The registry has to automatically issue a notice. There is no procedure for listing of suits before the court without issuance of a notice. We will ask the registry to issue a notice. We will list this matter after four weeks since the notice has to be for 28 days,” the bench, which also comprised justices BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna, said. Appearing for the state, senior lawyers Kapil Sibal and Sidharth Luthra said the suit was listed before the bench perhaps because the state government had also sought an interim order to restrain the CBI from lodging any fresh case and from proceeding in other cases till the apex court’s final decision. Sibal and Luthra added that the suit involves a pure question of law. At this, the bench said that the state government will have the liberty to approach it in case any urgent directions are required in the next four weeks. The state’s ruling Trinammol Congress alleges that after the Bharatiya Janata Party lost the state elections it has embarked on a vendetta using central agencies to target the state and its leaders. The BJP claims that after the election results were announced, the TMC unleashed violence on its (the former’s ) workers and supporters. Last week, the state also appealed the SC against the Calcutta High Court’s order on a CBI probe into post poll violence in the state. Underlining that the TMC government had in November 2018, withdrawn general consent to carry out a probe in the territory of the state, the suit maintained that registration of 12 cases by the central agency despite withdrawal of consent was an instance of “constitutional overreach” by the Union government. The state said that the CBI has no inherent jurisdiction to conduct a probe in any part of the state, including railway areas, till the time it obtains a prior sanction. Claiming that the agency has been exercising its powers in an “unconstitutional manner”, the suit said the registration of cases by the CBI was an encroachment on the legal rights of the state. The petition demands annulment of all 12 cases registered by the CBI and to restrain the agency from lodging any fresh cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/issue-notice-to-centre-on-bengal-plea-against-cbi-probes-sc-to-registrar-101630952808206.html
07-09-2021||India||Chandrayaan-2 has completed 9,000 orbits: Isro||The Chandrayaan-2 has completed 9,000 revolutions around the moon, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chairperson Dr K Sivan said on Monday, after releasing data gathered by eight payloads aboard the orbiter on the eve of the second anniversary of India’s attempt to soft-land near the lunar pole on September 7, 2019. The space agency is also conducting a two-day workshop to disseminate information about the publicly available data and the research already conducted. This is a milestone as India’s previous lunar mission had stopped communicating after ten months in lunar orbit. In contrast, the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter is expected to function in lunar orbit for seven years, collecting scientific data. “The payloads will provide repetitive data from multiple points due to the many years of operation,” said Dr AS Kiran Kumar, former chairperson of ISRO and chair of the apex science committee at the space agency. The orbiter will also function as the communication link between the lander-rover Chandrayaan-3 mission, which India plans to launch in 2022. Talking about the science from the eight surviving payloads, Dr Sivan said, “The results are very much encouraging.” He further urged the academia, students and everyone interested to utilise the publicly available data to generate new science. “The data is national property use it to discover new science,” he said. He said the moon was crucial to understanding the origin and evolution of the solar system. “Being airless, there is no chemical weathering of the evidence, especially at the shadowed areas at the poles,” he said. Moon could also become a base for further inter-planetary travel, with the water becoming fuel for such mission, he added. Two of the payloads onboard the orbiter – Dual Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar and the Imaging Infra-Red Spectrometer – have been able to distinguish between the water and hydroxyl (OH) molecules on the moon that were first detected by its predecessor. OH molecules were more likely to be found in the space-weathered lunar plains with high surface temperatures whereas more water molecules were observed in fresh surfaces. The Chandrayaan-2 Large Area Soft X-ray Spectrometer (CLASS) can map elemental abundance at a high spatial resolution, much better than the instruments available so far. The Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM) studied for the first time quiet sun microflares; almost all solar flares are observed in the solar active regions. The observations provide strong support to the hypothesis of the occurrence of small-scale impulsive heating events everywhere on the solar disk, which could contribute to the heating of the corona. On that day, just 2.1 km from its destination, the Vikram lander crashed into the lunar orbit. The Vikram lander and Pragyan rover together had five payloads, with its most important task being the observation of water molecules in the permanently shaded region near the lunar South Pole where it was to land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isrochandrayaan2-has-completed-9-000-orbits-101630952805963.html

The trial’s results are part of a pre-print study yet to be peer reviewed.Covishield (SII-ChAdOx1 nCoV-19), locally manufactured by Pune based Serum Institute of India (SII) following technology transfer from AstraZeneca, was evaluated in a phase 2/3 immuno-bridging study in India.“SII-ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 has a non-inferior immune response compared to AZD1222 and an acceptable safety/reactogenicity profile,” said the the phase 2/3, Observer-Blind, Randomised, Controlled Study. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is sold as Vaxzevria in Western markets.Between August 25 and October 31, 2020, 1601 participants were enrolled for the study, of which 401 were in the immunogenicity or reactogenicity cohort and 1200 in the safety cohort.“After two doses of SII-ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or AZD1222, seroconversion rates for anti-spike IgG antibodies were 98% and 98·9%, respectively…,” said researchers.Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) granted emergency use authorization to Covishield on January 3, this year, after the national drugs regulator’s subject expert committee recommended its approval.As per Union health ministry’s provisional data till 7pm on Monday, 697 million doses of the vaccine have so far been administered.SII submitted the drugs regulator safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data generated on 23,745 participants aged 18 years and older from overseas clinical studies.The overall efficacy of this recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus vector anti Covid-19 vaccine was found to be 70.42%.The company also submitted data from the bridging trials to the national drugs regulator that was not made public then.“Further, M/s Serum was granted permission to conduct Phase-II/III clinical trial on 1600 participants within the country. The firm also submitted the interim safety and immunogenicity data generated from this trial and the data was found comparable with the data from the overseas clinical studies. After detailed deliberations Subject Expert Committee has recommended for the grant of permission for restricted use in emergency situation subject to certain regulatory conditions,” the drugs controller said in a statement while approving Covishield for emergency use in India.A senior public health expert said on condition of anonymity that while “the results have been on the expected lines” the question was “why it took so long to put out results considering they did submit interim data with the drugs regulator for review during the EUA process.” There was no response from the SII on the issue.Meanwhile, commenting on the issue of counterfeit Covishield vaccine doses in circulation in the South East Asia and Africa region of WHO (World Health Organisation), the Union health ministry issued certain identifying markers for those administering Covid-19 vaccine doses on ground, to authenticate the supply.“…it was requested that the vaccines need to be carefully authenticated before use… the information on genuine Covid-19 vaccine labels and additional information of the Covid-19 vaccine in use is being enclosed for reference of programme managers and service providers under the National Covid-19 vaccination programme,” it said in a letter to state governments.For Covishield, the advisory says, “…The lettering is printed in special white ink to be more clear and readable. The general trend is to keep white lettering in reverse and just print the solid color. This gives the labels a special look and unique claret and readability. The entire label has been given a special texture honeycomb effect which is visible only at a specific angle…”For Covaxin, the ministry mentioned that vaccinators should look for an invisible UV helix (DNA like structure) on label that is only visible under UV light; micro text hidden in label claim dots that is written as Covaxin; green foil effect in the ‘x’ of Covaxin; and holographic effect on Covaxin.For the third vaccine that is being administered under the programme, the Russian made Sputnik V, the ministry clarified that imported products are from two different bulk manufacturing sites from Russian and, hence, there are two different labels for both these sites. While all the information and design is same, only manufacturer name is different in the pack. For all the imported products till now, the English label is only available on the front and back of the carton of 5 ampoule pack. All other sides including primary label on the ampoule is in Russian.The letter also has scanned pictures of all three vaccine packs for reference. “The service providers and monitoring teams for Covid-19 vaccination may be informed about these details and to ensure due diligence towards recognition of counterfeit vaccines,” the health ministry’s letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishields-immune-response-same-as-uk-version-of-oxford-az-jab-study-101630952628342.html
07-09-2021||India||Former UP governor booked for sedition over remarks against Yogi govt||Former governor of Uttar Pradesh, Aziz Qureshi, has been booked for sedition over his alleged derogatory remarks against the  Yogi Adityanath-led government, the police said on Monday.  Qureshi, however, said he was misquoted to cause political harm.According to the police, Qureshi has been booked following a complaint by local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, Akash Kumar Saxena, at the Civil Lines police station in Rampur district on Sunday. In his complaint, Saxena alleged that after visiting Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan’s house and meeting his wife Tazeen Fatma, Qureshi made derogatory statements against the Adityanath government and compared it to a “blood-sucking demon”. “The statement can create tension between two communities and create unrest in the society,” the complaint added.Qureshi (81) is a senior Congress leader who served as the governor of Mizoram from 2014 to 2015 and also briefly held charge of Uttar Pradesh in June 2014. Speaking to news agency ANI, the former governor said: “It is my right to oppose the policies of the government and I will fight for it till my last breath in a democratic way. My statement is being completely distorted to harm me politically and to mislead the public.”“I had said that there have not been as many atrocities in earlier days like today. I have not made any remarks against anyone,” he added. According to the FIR, Qureshi has been booked under sections 153A (promoting enmity between two groups on grounds of religion, race), 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration), 124A (sedition), and 505(1)(B) (intent to cause fear or alarm to the public) of the Indian Penal Code.“The FIR against Aziz Qureshi was lodged on the complaint of one Akash Saxena. Qureshi has been booked under sedition on the basis of the complaint made to the police. A team of the local police station is investigating the matter. We are also collecting video evidence of the incident for probe,” said additional superintendent of police (Rampur) Sansar Singh.Hitting out at the government, Samajwadi Party spokesperson Abdul Hafiz Gandhi said: “The words by Mr Qureshi may not be in good taste but how on earth does his statement constitutes the offence of sedition. Since when has CM Yogi became a state? The criticism of government is not sedition, UP police needs to keep this in mind. The Supreme Court has also expressed concerns about the misuse of the law. It has asked the central government why is it not repealing a colonial era law that was used against our freedom fighters. Rampant misuse of this law shows the anti-democratic character of the present UP government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-up-governor-aziz-qureshi-booked-for-sedition-over-remarks-against-yogi-govt-101630952505967.html
07-09-2021||India||Govt will create guardrails around new IT rules: MoS Rajeev Chandrasekhar||Union minister of state for electronics and information technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar on Monday said the government is working on “guardrails”, or standard operating procedures (SOPs), to address “grey areas” for social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, to comply with the new intermediary guidelines.“Around the IT guidelines and the IT Act, there are some grey areas. We will create guardrails and SOPs and release them to the public. The jurisprudence will evolve; cyberspace is an area that governments are coming to terms with,” Chandrasekhar said in an interview.Stating that the internet initially began as an enabler of connectivity, the minister said: “But in 2021, the internet has both good and bad facets. The law will accordingly evolve and the ministry will create clarifications where necessary.”Social media platforms and industry bodies have been seeking SOPs from the government ever since the new guidelines came into effect on February 25. The guidelines, seen as controversial by the industry as well as activists, put in place a new mechanism for companies to regulate content, appoint officers who will be liable for compliance, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.The SOPs are expected to clarify which all government bodies can ask social media companies to remove content -- one issue that has been repeatedly raised by companies.Chandrasekhar said the government is committed to ensuring that the internet is open, safe and secure. “At the same time, the intermediaries that provide these services also have to be accountable. We don’t want any child or any woman or any person to feel unsafe on the internet.”The minister highlighted that the new guidelines, which courted controversy for traceability requirements and takedown powers over news articles, were meant to ensure user safety. “As far as the issue of takedown is concerned, every sovereign government has the right to direct takedown of content that is illegal, wrong or can cause harm to users.”The guidelines have been challenged by at least seven associations and activists representing digital new platforms and intermediaries. WhatsApp has also challenged the traceability clause, which mandates intermediaries primarily in the nature of messaging to identify the originator of a message.Chandrasekhar also stressed that the right to free speech was guaranteed by the Constitution and no bureaucrat or minister could take it away. “On the issue of censorship, there is no cause for concern. There is no reason for anyone to fear it. The Constitution guarantees the rights. If people try to take it away, like the UPA did with section 66A, the courts will strike it down.”His reference is to the now defunct section 66A of the IT Act which was read down by the courts. Section 66 (A), which prohibited the sending of information of a “grossly offensive” or “menacing” nature through computers and communication devices, has been used by several states to arrest people over posts on social media that officials claimed were “seditious”,” communally sensitive” or abusive.Most of these arrests were for posting controversial remarks or photos, while some were for sharing, commenting on or liking such posts. The section was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015.The minister said that as tech conglomerates turn bigger and more powerful, his government wanted to ensure they remained accountable.“We don’t want the internet to be unsafe. Social media intermediaries provide a service, we don’t want them to ignore the users. The guidelines are about creating user safety as platforms become bigger,” he said.Drawing attention to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assertion that the internet should remain free of government interference, Chandrasekhar said some platforms are using their own rules to scuttle free speech.“I use the words open, safe and trusted. The PM’s track record on this has been that the internet should remain free of government interference. Moreover, we are concerned that some platforms use their own rules to scuttle free speech. That the government is censoring content is a narrative that is being peddled by some people.”The government has been a stand off with Twitter since January this year, when it asked the company to remove content about the farmers protests. Twitter refused to block account of activists and journalists saying that it was defending free speech. The government also sent Twitter two non-compliance notices. The company was also initially non-compliant with the new guidelines but has since appointed the necessary officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-will-create-guardrails-around-new-it-rules-mos-rajeev-chandrasekhar-101630952448937.html
07-09-2021||India||Indian Hindus, Muslims share same ancestry: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said on Monday that Hindus and Muslims of India share the same ancestry as he reasserted that every Indian citizen is a “Hindu”.Speaking at a conclave organised by a Pune-based think tank, Global Strategic Policy Foundation, Bhagwat urged “sensible” Muslim leaders to “oppose tyrannical thoughts”.“The basis of unity is our motherland and our glorious tradition. For us, the word Hindu is the synonym for motherland, ancestors and the legacy of the Indian culture. The word Hindu does not denote any caste or linguistic definition, but it’s the name of a culture that guides the development and uplift of every human being. All those who accept this, irrespective of any caste, creed, religion or language, are Hindus and in this backdrop, we consider every Indian a Hindu,” he said.The conclave, organised on the subject ‘Rashtra Pratham Rashtra Sarvatopari’ (literally, “nation first, nation above all”), was also attended by Muslim scholars and intellectuals.“Islam made inroads in the country through aggressors. This is the history which should be told in that fashion. Sensible leaders from the community should oppose tyrannical thoughts. This needs to be done for a longer period and we have a herculean task before us. Our social loss will be less if we begin early,” he said.He further stressed that all “should think about the dominance of India” and not “the dominance of Muslims”.“If India becomes the superpower, it would not pose any challenge before anybody, but it will be a superpower in the form of a Vishwaguru,” he said.Kerala governor Arif Mohammed Khan and Lt Gen Syed Ata Hasnain, chancellor of the Central University of Kashmir, were among the other speakers at the event.Khan said more diversity leads to a prosperous society and added “Indian culture considers everyone equal.”Hasnain urged Muslim intellectuals to be more vigilant in the wake of the changed situation in Afghanistan and thwart Pakistan’s attempts to target Indian Muslims.In July, the RSS chief had attempted to allay concerns that the Sangh is fuelling anti-minority sentiments in the county. He said there is a need to guard against fear-mongering that the Sangh is against minorities or that Islam is in danger in India. He had also said the Sangh has always believed that the DNA of the people of India is the same and that both Hindus and Muslims are one entity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-hindus-muslims-share-same-ancestry-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-101630952385870.html
07-09-2021||India||Afghanistan terrorism may spread to Kashmir: Russian ambassador||Russia and India have the shared concern of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan spreading to Russian territory or to Kashmir, Russian ambassador Nikolay Kudashev said on Monday against the backdrop of the Taliban takeover in Kabul.Counterterrorism cooperation is a key part of the India-Russia dialogue at various levels, and Moscow wants an inclusive government in Kabul to ensure stability and sustainable development in Afghanistan, Kudashev told reporters during an interaction at the Russian embassy.Separately, Bangladesh information minister Hasan Mahmud, who is on an official visit to New Delhi, told reporters at the Press Club of India that his country is closely watching developments in Afghanistan as they have implications for regional stability.“We are keeping an eye on that. Stability in Afghanistan is important for stability in the South Asian region,” Mahmud said. He added it was too early to talk about any recognition of a set-up formed by the Taliban.Kudashev, who spoke to reporters on the margins of an event at the Russian embassy, said Russia is closely cooperating with India to counter the danger of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan. Any flare-up of the civilian conflict would result in terrorism spilling over across the region, he said.“As far as the phenomenon of terror is concerned, we do share our concerns with India. There is a danger of terror...being spread to the Russian territory, to the territory of Kashmir maybe,” he said.“We want an inclusive government, we expect that Afghan soil would not be a source of terror emanating to the other countries of the region,” he said.“Thus, this is a matter of common concern and this is a matter of continued dialogue between Russia and India within multiple frameworks, be it the bilateral counterterrorism working group, [or] the track of national security councils [or] the track of defence ministers [and] foreign ministers,” he added.Russia’s main concern is stability in Afghanistan and building an inclusive government that can “offer itself for recognition to the international community to secure stability and sustainable development”, Kudashev said.Afghanistan “deserves peace, predictability and sustainable development, and India and Russia want “Afghanistan to be peaceful [and] friendly with each and every country in the region”, he said.“These are the very basic values which bring Russia and India together. I don’t see much of a difference in our positions,” Kudashev added. Both countries are also cooperating on Afghanistan within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and its working group on Afghanistan.Kudashev said it was too early to talk about any recognition of a set-up created by the Taliban. “The new Taliban dispensation should prove that it is a responsible government, that it is able to build an inclusive government, that it is able to look after each and every minority, each and every region of Afghanistan, that it is able to build predictable foreign ties...with the regional and international community,” he said.“If that will be the case, we will be able to revisit this question,” he added.Kudashev’s comments came against the backdrop of some amount of disquiet in New Delhi over Moscow’s efforts to work more closely with Islamabad on the issue of Afghanistan. India was kept out of several recent meetings of the “extended troika” format organised by Russia, and Pakistan was part of these discussions.Zamir Kabulov, the Russian special presidential envoy for Afghanistan, had even said that India was not invited to participate in the “expanded troika” meetings because it does not have any influence on the Taliban.Kudashev said in response to questions that India and Russia were expected to hold multiple interactions this year, including the annual bilateral summit, a 2+2 dialogue of the defence and foreign ministers, and meetings of the military and technical commission, trade and economic commission, and other expert-level groups. These meetings will focus on matters such as UN reforms, strategic stability, the emerging regional architecture in Asia and the Pacific, and challenges such as terrorism, drug trafficking and crime.He noted there are “enormous opportunities” for bilateral cooperation in defence, oil and gas, nuclear power, space, infrastructure and connectivity. The Russian proposal to build six new nuclear reactors is still “on the table” and “it is for the Indian government to take a decision” on this matter, he said.Kudashev said Russia is expected to deliver the first batch of S-400 air defence systems under a $5.4-billion deal by October. “There are no issues as far as the timeline is concerned. It would be performed in due course,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghanistan-terrorism-may-spread-to-kashmir-russian-ambassador-101630952327328.html
07-09-2021||India||Suvendu skips CID summons, gets relief from HC||The Calcutta high court on Monday granted Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari protection from coercive action in two cases and stayed police proceedings in three others, criticising “misuse” of state machinery to investigate the Bengal leader of Opposition.The development came on a day Adhikari did not appear before the Criminal Investigation Department in connection with the probe into the death of his bodyguard, citing prior political engagements.Justice Rajasekhar Mantha stayed proceedings against Adhikari in connection with three cases pertaining to the death of the bodyguard, an alleged political clash in Nandigram and a case of snatching lodged in Contai, Nandigram and Panskura police stations, respectively, in Purba Medinipur district.Allowing investigation in an alleged job scam case registered with Maniktala police station in Kolkata and a case of allegedly threatening the police at Tamluk, the court directed that no coercive action can be taken against him in connection with these.Adhikari is not a named accused in the cases filed in Contai and Maniktala police stations.“in the instant case, there is prima facie evidence before this court of abuse and or misuse of state and police machinery in registering cases for investigation based on half-truths, fiction, concoctions and nonevents,” the court said.”The right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 is cardinal, above all and completely non-negotiable,” the bench added.Directing the West Bengal government to furnish information regarding any further FIR registered against Adhikari, the bench said that the state will have to obtain permission from the court before arresting him or taking any coercive action against him in all such cases.B Bhattacharya, Adhikari’s lawyer, said, “ In two cases, the court has said that investigators can question him at a place of Adhikari’s choice but would not be able to take any coercive action. In future too if any fresh cases are lodged, coercive actions can’t be taken against Adhikari without the court’s permission.”The high court asked the BJP leader to cooperate with the investigating officers in connection with the two cases in which probe will continue, while making it clear the investigators will, as far as possible, accommodate him, if he is required to give any statement, from a place and time convenient to him, considering his public responsibilities.The order was passed on Adhikari’s petition seeking the court’s intervention in criminal proceedings filed against him by the state police.He claimed that these cases were politically motivated.Earlier in the day, Adhikari was summoned by the CID for questioning in connection with the death case of his bodyguard. Adhikari, however, sent an email to the investigating agency saying that he had some political engagements and would be unable to appear for questioning.In July the CID initiated a fresh probe into the death of Adhikari’s security guard who reportedly died by suicide in 2018, officials said. The victim’s wife had lodged a complaint demanding a fresh probe. “He mailed us around 9.30 am, mentioning some political engagements due to which he was unable to come and meet our officers,” a CID officer told PTI. A CID team has already visited his Kanthi residence in connection with the probe.“We have to see the high court’s order first, to comment on it. But what I came to know is that in some of the cases the court has kept the option open where in Adhikari may be questioned by the police. He wanted to avoid any kind of investigation. The court didn’t allow it,” said Kunal Ghosh, Trinamool Congress spokesperson.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suvendu-skips-cid-summons-gets-relief-from-hc-101630952267294.html
07-09-2021||India||Allow Covishield 2nd dose after 4 weeks: Kerala HC to Centre||The Kerala high court on Monday asked the Union government to allow the administration of the second dose of the Covishield vaccine after a gap of four weeks for those wishing to take the jab early, and willing to pay for it. It also asked the Union government to make necessary changes on the CoWin portal. The reduction in gap does not apply to those availing free vaccines under the government’s vaccination drive.“The decision on increasing the gap was based on opinion of experts after reviewing all the relevant data from across the globe and what was observed locally. Experts in committees on immunisation keep reviewing data and developments to update guidelines and advisories,” said an official in the central government, on condition of anonymity.The verdict came on a petition filed by Kitex Garments and Kitex Childrenswear, which last month questioned the long gap between two doses of vaccine. A single bench of Justice P B Suresh Kumar accepted the argument in the petition that if the Union and state governments can make exceptions for students travelling abroad and others (including sportspeople), the same privilege can be extended to others.The verdict comes even as Kerala continues to see a raging second wave of infections. The seven-day average of daily new cases in the state was 28,632 on Sunday, 69% of the corresponding seven-day average for the country as a whole.The two Kitex companies which bought vaccines for their employees, were unable to provide them a second dose after four weeks because of the government restriction.The gap between two doses of Covishield, the Indian version of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, was increased from 4-6 weeks in January to 12-16 weeks in May. While the government cited scientific evidence for this, it was widely believed that the gap was also increased to account for a shortage of vaccines. The gap between two doses of the other vaccine widely administered in India, Covaxin, has stayed constant at 4-6 weeks.The union government opposed the plea saying that 84-day gap between two doses of vaccine was related to efficacy and had nothing to do with the shortage of doses. It also cited the study of the national expert group on vaccination administration for Covid-19 to buttress its point. But the court said since both, union and state governments, were diluting the provision for a section it can’t be denied to others who are in need.“The decision of the government in providing relaxation in the protocol regarding administration of the second dose of vaccine to certain classes of persons alone amounts to discrimination,” it ruled.“If the government can permit who are intending to travel abroad to exercise a choice between early protection and better protection from Covid-19 infection, there is absolutely no reason why the same privilege shall not be extended to others who want early protection in connection with their employment and education, etc,” it said.Kitex in its plea contended that it vaccinated around 5000 of its workforce with the first dose but unable to administer the second dose due to the prevailing restrictions. It sought judicial intervention to speed up the process in view of mounting cases in the state and cited recent relaxations allowed by the state and central governments.Experts said that while the court has relaxed the gap for some people it doesn’t mean everyone will have to go for a second jab immediately. “A gap is always good. It gives extended immunity and many studies have proven it.

07-09-2021||India||BCI, SCBA reply soughton virtual hearings’ plea||The Supreme Court on Monday sought the view of the Bar Council of India (BCI) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) on a petition filed by a group of lawyers demanding virtual court hearing as a matter of fundamental right.Challenging the move by two high courts – Uttarakhand and Gujarat– for moving towards physical court hearings, the All-India Association of Jurists, claiming to be a body of 5,000 lawyers practising across the country along with a legal journalist urged the top court not to discontinue with the present system of virtual court hearing.The Uttarakhand HC issued an administrative order on August 16 by which virtual court hearing was stopped. The Gujarat High Court issued a similar order on August 6 coming out with a standard operating procedure (SOP) for physical hearing of cases from August 17 with no mention about continuation of virtual court hearing. Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra appearing for the Association said, “We are only saying that even if physical court commences, the hybrid mode of hearing (with virtual hearing) should continue. This is in the interest of litigants in getting access to justice, which is recognized to be a fundamental right.”A three-judge bench led by Justice L Nageswara Rao, and comprising Justices B R Gavai and B V Nagarathna said, “The BCI and SCBA are impleaded as parties. We issue notice, and we will wait till their response and then we will hear the case.” The bench directed the matter to be heard after four weeks.The bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna told Luthra that BCI chairman at a felicitation ceremony held for Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana on Saturday said that virtual hearing had severely affected the livelihood of lawyers. The bench said, “We are hoping there should be normalcy. Should you still insist on this petition?” The bench pointed out that a physical court hearing experience not only benefits litigants but also helps young lawyers to learn. “We are missing eye to eye contact which makes arguments effective. Young lawyers also learn watching the seniors argue in Court,” said the bench.SCBA president Vikas Singh, who was appearing in another matter, informed the court that SCBA was in favour of having physical hearing and will state so in an affidavit.The petition made central government along with high courts of Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Bombay High Court as parties in its petition. ---Luthra cited the interim report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee submitted in September 2020 which highlighted that “affordable access to justice mandatorily demands that virtual courts must be made a permanent feature.” It further recommended that information and technology can be suitably used to fast-track cases by resorting to the technology of Video Conferencing, which will reduce the burden on courts, unnecessary crowding of Court premises and shall allow lawyers across the Country to appear in any court of the country.”The bench underlined the difference between online courts and virtual courts, with the former referring to use of artificial intelligence for conducting court proceedings as compared to use of technological devices for conducting court hearing. “As regards artificial intelligence-based courts, we have made it clear that it cannot be practical for the present. Coming to virtual courts, the use of information technology tools has to be limited. You cannot say hybrid should continue,” the bench remarked.The petition filed through advocate P Sriram cited Section 30 of the Advocates Act 1961 which entitles all lawyers registered on the rolls of the State Bar Council to practice before any Court, Tribunal or Commission of law across the Country. “This right and entitlement can be given full effect to only, when the option of virtual hearing is available along with the physical mode of hearing on the same terms and with the same level of alacrity by the administration of the various High Courts,” the petition said.The bench said that for 70 years, litigants have enjoyed the right of access to justice. The issue in the present petition related to right of lawyers to practice their profession under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. An application filed by a group of lawyers represented by advocate Pradeep Kumar Yadav opposed the petition claiming that they represented only 5000 when over five lakh lawyers in the country do not want virtual court hearing to continue. The bench refused to enter into the dispute and said that it was only seeking the opinion of BCI without passing any order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bci-scba-reply-soughton-virtual-hearings-plea-101630951005629.html
07-09-2021||India||PM Modi reviews Afghan situation after Taliban claims ‘complete control’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday chaired a high-level meeting to review the situation in Afghanistan in the wake of the Taliban claiming to have complete control of the country.Home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, chief of defence staff Gen Bipin Rawat and national security adviser Ajit Doval attended the meet held at PM Modi's official residence.There was no official word on the meeting, though people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the deliberations at PM Modi's meeting focused on the situation in Afghanistan following the Taliban’s claim that it had complete control of Afghanistan following a reported victory over resistance forces in Panjshir province.Also Read: Taliban takeover in Afghanistan to figure at Brics meet chaired by PM ModiImages posted on social media showed Taliban commanders in front of the provincial governor’s compound in Panjshir, where forces of the National Resistance Front (NRF) led by Ahmad Massoud, the son of legendary commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, have been battling the Taliban.Reports have emerged of the Pakistani military backing the Taliban in the campaign in Panjshir, especially after the Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, arrived in Kabul on Saturday.The NRF has also dismissed reports that the Taliban have captured the holdout province, saying its forces were still battling the group.India has adopted a wait-and-watch stance with regard to the developments in Afghanistan following the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government and the takeover of Kabul by the Taliban on August 15.The Indian government has said its key concern in Afghanistan is ensuring that Afghan soil isn’t used for terrorism or anti-India activities and the safe return of Indian nationals who are still in Afghanistan. These issues were raised when India’s ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, met Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai, the deputy head of the Taliban’s political office in Qatar, at the Indian embassy in Doha at the request of the Taliban on August 31.This was India’s first officially acknowledged meeting with the Taliban, though the government had opened channels of communication with some Taliban leaders and factions last year.India is also yet to take a call on recognising any set-up created by the Taliban in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reviews-afghan-situation-after-taliban-claims-complete-control-101630950946993.html
07-09-2021||India||OBC, EWS reservation: SC issues notice on PIL against medical quota||The Supreme Court on Monday sought the Union government’s response on its decision to introduce 27% reservation for other backward classes and 10% for economically weaker sections (EWS) in the all India quota (AIQ) for undergraduate and post graduate medical/dental admissions from this academic year. The response has to be filed within two weeks.The court order came on two separate petitions filed by 27 doctors who claimed the notification of July 29 issued by the Medical Counseling Committee (MCC) under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare was bad in law and arbitrary.The petitions argued by senior advocates Arvind Datar and Vikas Singh pointed out that with the said reservation policy, the total reservation will exceed the 50% ceiling fixed by the Supreme Court in its landmark 1992 verdict. The 50% ceiling was later upheld in subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court. The 27% OBC quota and 10% EWS quota would apply to 15% AIQ seats in the MBBS/BDS courses and to 50% AIQ seats for MD/MS/MDS courses. As the effect will be felt largely on post-graduate medical seats, the petitioners said, “the impugned notice (of July 29) for the current academic year will severely harm the future of lakhs of students who had no knowledge of the said reservation policy, while they registered for the exam in February this year.”The common entrance for PG medical/dental courses is scheduled for September 11.A bench of Justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli issued notice to MCC, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and National Board of Examination and posted the matter after two weeks. There is already reservation for Scheduled Castes (15%) and Scheduled Tribes (7.5%) under the AIQ. With the addition of OBC quota (non-creamy layer) and EWS quota, the total reservation would exceed 50% and will touch 64.5% (including 5% reservation for persons with disability).“The impugned decision is manifestly arbitrary as it is in complete breach of Article 14 (right to equality), 15 (non-discrimination), 16 (equality of opportunity in public employment) and 21 (right to life) of the Constitution of India and also bypasses ceiling of reservation of 50 per cent,” said the petition filed through advocate Malak Manish Bhatt. It further stated that “the decision to implement the reservation policy for this academic year is sheer afterthought,” as NEET PG 2021 was earlier scheduled to be organized on April 18 but was postponed due to the surge in the Covid-19 cases.The petition further relied on a statement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May when he announced postponement of NEET- PG exam by four months. It said, “It was nowhere mentioned that in between these four months, there will be changes in the reservation policy and the current academic year will be subjected to the revised reservation policy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/obc-ews-reservation-sc-issues-notice-on-pil-against-medical-quota-101630950826162.html
07-09-2021||India||Odisha: A murder that revealed a cult and its overreach||Satyabrat Nayak’s house is hard to distinguish in the rows of thatched, asbestos-roofed homes with laterite stone walls covered in patchy plaster. Like most others in Abhimanpur -- a village of roughly 60 families from the Saara community, who believe they are adivasis but are not listed as tribals in government records -- the Nayak family has little of material value other than a small television set. When his wife cooks rice, she does it on an earthen chullah. Till early August, their biggest worry was whether the paddy they cultivated would wither away due to the lack of rain in the region.Then, on the morning of August 2, his family’s quiet life was torn asunder. News arrived that Nayak had died, a day after he was abducted by people from the Manavbadi Sangathan, an organisation he was a member of since its inception in 2005. On that morning, the family said some members of the Sangathan came to Abhimanpur and asked Nayak’s nephew Basant to accompany them to the neighbouring Karadagadia village. What Basant found was the body of his uncle lying on a funeral pyre. A gun pointed at him, Basant was allegedly forced to set the body on fire.Basant’s complaint at the Begunia police station would, over the next few weeks, unravel a series of events that have led to eight arrests, and the dismantling of an organisation that said it fought for the rights of the Saaras, but implemented its life principles in the harshest manner possible. These included assault and abuse, and in the case of Satyabrat Nayak, murder. Among the eight arrested are Manas Das, lawyer, politician and the 51-year-old president of the Manavbadi Sangathan, and his 25-year-old son Manoranjan Das. They have been charged in several cases, including homicide and abduction.“Das and his son were arrested over the involvement in the conspiracy to murder Nayak, who was once a member of Manvbad Sangathan but had stopped being an active member. Though they were not present at the scene of murder, they played a role in the conspiracy of his abduction, murder, and later destruction of evidence,” said inspector general of police (central range) Narasingha Bhol, who has been supervising the investigation. “We suspect that he (Das) is involved in many past cases, and if anyone has any evidence, we welcome people to lodge FIRs against him.”Several Dalit and tribal leaders who have been working for the disadvantaged in Odisha say that Das used poverty and existing social fault lines to create a “cult” in Khurda district.A Dalit and the son of a peon in state secretariat, Das joined the Bahujan Samaj Party in 1990s, and left it in 1999 to start the Rashtriya Samajik Nyay Manch, a forum that promised to deliver social justice to Dalits and tribals in the state. As he started getting traction, he formed another organisation, the Manavbad Sangathan (humanitarian organisation).“While heading the Rashtriya Samajik Nyay Manch, he met a lot of Saara community people of Bolgarh and Begunia areas of Khurda district, and lured them to the Manavbad Sangathan, which he built like a cult. The members of the Sangathan were supposed to live by a set of rules that included no idol worship, women not wearing bangles or vermillion, and a ban on last rites. Those joining the organisation had to take a pledge that they would not consume drugs or alcohol. While he could not get tribals to join his organisation, he managed to get a lot of Saara community people as his followers,” said Ashok Mallick, president of the Rashtriya Dalit Mahasabha, which also works for tribals and Dalits in Odisha. Both the Rashtriya Samajik Nyay Manch and Manavbad Sangathan are not registered with the state’s Inspector General of Registrations.Satyabrat Nayak, who is a Saara, was among Das’s first recruits, and had become a senior member of the organisation. Like other Saaras, Nayak proudly called himself a descendant of Biswabasu, the mythical Sabara tribal chief who worshipped Lord Jagannath in wooden form before the deity was placed in the Jagannath temple. Though Soharas and Sabaras are deemed as tribals in government records, the Saara community, which follows the same religious and cultural practices as them, doesn’t share the same status.The tehsildar of Begunia, Prithviraj Mandal, said the lack of ST status for the Saara community is mostly because of their revenue records. “They may be following the same practices of Sabara and Sohar tribes, but most of the Saara community members either live on government land or don’t have necessary land records that show them to be tribals. At my tehsil office, I regularly get requests to give them tribal status, but can’t do anything,” he said.It was this sense of injustice -- STs get benefits such as scholarship and stipend for students, assistance for small-scale businesses and reservation in education and government jobs -- and seething resentment among the Saaras that Das sought to tap into when he first began making trips to the district in early 2000s. Jharia Nayak, the neighbour of Satyabrata Nayak, who was also a member of Manavbadi Sangathan, said that Saaras are still not allowed to worship the deity in Swapneswar Shiva temple in their village.“We can enter the temple premises, but have to keep our offerings to God and draw back before the priest collects it and does the puja for us. We are not allowed to go near the deity,” said Nayak.Local fault linesAnother local, Sanuj Nayak was one of those who joined the Sangathan driven by a sense of discrimination and inspired by the belief, having listened to Das, that he was “Dravidian, not Aryan”.“I had joined the organisation in 2013 after listening to the speeches of Manas Das and his followers. We were told about the years of discriminations that tribals faced at the hands of upper caste people. We were told that Saara people are not Aryans, but Dravidians. The Aryans were our enemies. But we were never told why they were our enemies. We were told that we he would get Saara community the tribal status. But I left the organisation a few years later,” said Nayak, who left his house in Dalatola village of Begunia block a few years ago after facing threats from members of Manavbad Sangathan.The whole point of signing up was that those who joined the organisation were expected to do so for life, and any deviation was punished swiftly -- like in the case of Satyabrata Nayak.“Though Satyabrata Nayak was among his oldest followers, and had indoctrinated a lot of people, he had lost interest in last two years, more so after Covid pandemic last year. He was asked to get his brother-in-law, who ran a parallel organisation of the Saaras called Nilamadhab Sangathan, to join the Manavbad Sangathan. He could not fulfil that. The day Nayak was killed, a 60-year-old man and his 35-year-old son in Kadaba village in Begunia were being thrashed at the same time for not getting any new members. After the video of the incident later went viral, a case was lodged,” said a police officer who asked not to be named.On August 1, Satyabrat Nayak was called to a meeting in Abhimanpur to explain why he couldn’t get his brother-in-law to join the group. As soon as Satyabrat reached the meeting, Swapneswar Nayak -- a senior member of the Manavbadi Sangathan -- and others allegedly started beating him. He was then let go, but not for long.When night crept in, around 8pm, Swapneswar and Tulu Behera, another member of the Sangathan, allegedly picked up Satyabrat in a motorcycle at a nearby village square. He never returned. SDPO Mishra said investigations found that Satyabrat was attacked again with PVC pipes, sticks and kicked repeatedly, likely leading to his death.Swapneswar came to Satyabrat’s house in the village the next morning around 10am and asked his nephew Basant to follow. “Swapneswar took me to a cashew orchard at Karadagadia village where I found my uncle’s body on a pyre in the burial ground. When I asked them to explain how my uncle died, someone put a gun on my head and I was asked to light the pyre. I was abused and threatened against reporting the matter to the police,” said Basant.Sociologist Rita Ray said organisations such as Manavbad Sangathan exploiting social fault lines is not new to the state. “Already low on development indices and literacy levels, there will always be someone who will promise revolution. As long as social and economic disparities remain, these will always exist,” she said.‘Bhaisahab’ to ‘Guruji’In the initial years of starting the Sangathan, Das asked people to call him “Bhaisaheb” (elder brother), apparently on the lines of “Babasaheb”, as Dalit icon BR Ambedkar was called. Later, he asked his followers to call him by the epithet “Guruji”. People who became members of his organisation had to attend training camps in different districts throughout the year and had to pay ₹50-100 for each camp. Every year on May 16, he organised a Manavbad Diwas, asking his followers to attend, where Das talked about injustices done to the tribals.Structured like a pyramid, the Manavbad Sangathan has hundreds of followers who attend meetings and take a pledge not to worship idols or follow rituals. “All Aryans are my enemies and I would always treat them as my enemies,” the pledge entails. After working for a few years and depending on performance, a follower gets promoted to “cadre” and then “senior cadre”. “A few of the senior cadre would go on to become ‘top cadre’ who stay close to Das. The cadres for each panchayat send monthly reports to Bhubaneswar about the work they did in getting new recruits. Each of the cadres get regular monthly remuneration for their work,” said a former member on condition of anonymity.Das lived in Bhubaneswar’s Shahid Nagar. “He called his house in Bhubaneswar the “headquarters”, and anyone just entering his gate had to pay ₹20 to ₹70. For an audience with him, the charges were higher. As he had more than 10,000 followers, the income was sizeable,” said Khurda sub-divisional police officer Sushil Mishra. The police are now probing how Das collected the money, and are planning to track his investments over the years.Mishra said Das began asking tribals to take up issues of land, such as of cashew nut orchards, but using violent methods. “He would motivate the Saara community members to attack leaseholders of such cashew nut orchards telling them that the entire property belongs to tribals. When the community attacked the leaseholder, mostly an upper caste person, there was an inevitable backlash which began a cycle of violence. In 2010-11, one person was killed during a case like this. He also started doing the same thing with stone quarrying leases. In March 2016, his people were involved in the murder of owner of a stone crusher in Dadhimachhagadia area of Khurda district. There are several cases where he may have instigated the Saara people to take the law into their own hands.”Das’s followers, however, argue that he is not guilty. “He has been framed by detractors. He has been trying to bring social equality in Khurda through various programmes,” said Biranchi Nayak, a follower in Srirampur village of Khurda district. On Friday, more than 300 of his supporters staged demonstration before the office of Khurda SP demanding that he be released.Police officers said Das would have become an influential political leader had he not been arrested in the murder case last week. In February 2019, he joined the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in the presence of chief minister Naveen Patnaik, where he hailed the BJD for looking after the interest of Odisha.Senior BJD leader Pramila Mallick however denied that Das was a member, refusing to comment on the 2019 function. She said, “If Das got photographed with BJD leaders that does not mean he was part of BJD. Let police do its inquiry and take action.”“In a state where most politicians don’t have much following, Das has over 10,000 followers. He would have successfully negotiated with political parties -- maybe he still can,” an officer said, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odishaa-murder-that-revealed-a-cult-and-its-overreach-101630942663702.html

Six other accused in the case are still absconding. We have launched a hunt for them,” said Raipur superintendent of police (SP) Ajay Yadav. However, sources claimed that Yadav has since been transferred to police headquarters, apparently over the incident. They said senior officials were of view that the SP was unable to handle the issue and the accused should have been arrested immediately. Also Read | Central, west and northwest India to receive fresh spell of rainOn Sunday, a group accused Pastor Harish Sahu of indulging in religious conversion and manhandled him as well as Ankush Bariyekar, general secretary of Chhattisgarh Christian Forum, and one Prakash Masih, inside Purani Basti police station. A video of the incident went viral on social media following which, Yadav attached Purani Basti station house officer Yadumani Sidar to the police lines.

07-09-2021||India||ED grills Abhishek Banerjee for almost 9 hours in illegal coal mining case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday questioned Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, for almost nine hours in its probe related to money laundering worth ₹1,352 crore in illegal coal mining scandal in the state.The 33-year-old Lok Sabha MP, also the de-facto number 2 of the TMC, is an alleged beneficiary of funds obtained by accused persons in the illegal mining case, according to an earlier claim by the central agency.Banerjee arrived at ED’s Jam Nagar house office around 11am on Monday and left around 8 pm after almost nine hours of interrogation. He was interrogated about his alleged association with the kingpin of the mining case – Anup Majhi -- as well as alleged funds linked with his family members, said people aware of developments.“I reached the ED office at 11 am. I have been questioned non-stop for nine hours. I have cooperated with them and answered all their questions to the best of my abilities. I gave them my written statement,” said Banerjee.He accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of using agencies against its opponents. “We will fight against you (BJP) and go to all those states where you (BJP) have murdered the democracy. Do whatever you can. BJP’s tyranny will be defeated. Let BJP put all its might, vigour, threat, resources. Mind my words..all their resources will fall flat. TMC will beat BJP in the upcoming election (in 2024),” he added.The TMC MP also said that at least 25 BJP MLAs in West Bengal are in the queue to join the TMC even though his party hadn’t accepted them. Since the TMC came to power with a sweeping victory in the recently held assembly elections, four BJP MLAs have switched sides. The BJP had won 77 seats.“Forget about any other political party. We will give our life, but we will not sell our spine to these autocrats, these cowards who can’t defeat us politically,” he said.The agency had claimed in a Delhi court in April this year that “Majhi assisted in transferring substantial funds derived from the proceeds of crime to Abhishek Banerjee’s close relative (wife and sister-in-law) at London and Thailand.”An ED officer, requesting anonymity, said, “We have reliable statements and evidence on Abhishek Banerjee’s role, but investigation is on.”Outside the ED office, Banerjee said he will cooperate with the probe agencies. His wife Rujira was also summoned by the ED on September 1 to Delhi but she sought to be questioned at her residence in Kolkata due to prevailing Covid-19 situation, a request which has been accepted by the agency, people cited above said.The BJP countered Banerjee and said that the TMC was day dreaming.“We have told time and again that the BJP has nothing to with ED and CBI investigation. The law is taking its own course. If the TMC thinks otherwise they can any day move court. As far as the number of 25 BJP MLAs waiting to join the TMC, it is nothing but a day dream. The rest are political statements,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in West Bengal.ED’s money laundering probe is based on a CBI First Information Report (FIR) registered in November 2020 on the allegations that a coal pilferage at a massive scale was taking place in Eastern Coalfields Ltd mines in Kunustoria and Kajora areas in West Bengal.After arresting the former Inspector in-charge of Bankura police station, Ashok Kumar Mishra in the case, the ED had claimed in a Delhi court in April, just ahead of state assembly elections, that Banerjee was a beneficiary of funds obtained in the illegal mining, which was flourishing in West Bengal under the ‘patronage’ of the political party in power.Apart from Mishra, ED has arrested Vikas Mishra, brother of TMC youth wing leader Vinay Mishra, in the case so far.Vinay Mishra, said to be close to Banerjee, left the country in September 2020 and has already renounced his Indian citizenship. It is believed that he has settled in Vanuatu, a small island nation in South Pacific Ocean.According to the probe carried out by the anti-money laundering agency, an amount of ₹1,352 crore has been illegally generated by Majhi through illegal coal mining in just two years.It is alleged that tainted funds collected by Majhi and others in connivance with the police officers reached political leaders in West Bengal and then were laundered to various locations in India and abroad.“Investigation revealed a deep system of political patronage and well-oiled network by which the system was subverted to carry out these illegal activities in a brazen manner,” ED said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-questions-abhishek-banerjee-in-illegal-coal-mining-case-101630922082170.html
07-09-2021||India||Section 377, 3 years on: Freedom to love takes root||Shanti Tudu knew no one like her.Her village, nestled in the Ajodhya hills in the tribal hinterlands of western Bengal, was far from any city. Her parents, relatives and most people in the village subsisted on farming and forest products. Most young people moved away for manual labour, or if they were lucky, education. Her house didn’t have a television or a fixed Internet connection, and cellphone network was patchy, Yet, Tudu knew she was different.Since she could remember, she preferred shirts and trousers over any girl’s uniform the local school prescribed, and liked the heroines of the Hindi and Bengali songs she would sneak off to watch with her friend. She didn’t know what this attraction was, if it had a name or, as her friend told her, was a disease.Shanti Tudu knew no one liked her. When she moved an hour away to Purulia town for studies four years ago, she feverishly researched about girls liking girls, understood that it was not a disease; but confidences to friends and teachers in college were broken, and she was dragged to a local quack for “therapy”.In 2018, she ran away from home, found a job and started living in a women’s hostel – where she met her future partner, Rekha, who requested to withhold her second name. Both had decided to never go back home, but started reconsidering after the landmark Supreme Court verdict that decriminalised homosexuality three years ago.“I don’t understand the law too much and hadn’t followed the case. But Rekha called me up that day and said, we are not criminals anymore. Even our local papers carried big news items that day. It gave me hope,” said Tudu.Together, they plan to tell their parents about the relationship. They are aware of the risks – their families can force them apart, confine them or file cases against one partner. But they believe the 2018 Navtej Johar judgment will shield them.“We have spoken to a lawyer who assured that if anything goes wrong, the courts will protect us. So we are hopeful of leading a life together,” said Rekha.They are not the only ones. Three years after the Supreme Court read down Section 377 to not apply to consenting adults in same sex relationships, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people around India have approached the courts to seek a phalanx of rights, from seeking recognition of marriage equality to reading down of specific sections of laws like the State Police Act to protection from violence of families.Many of these people hail from small towns and the countryside, who have used the law forcefully and creatively to expand the horizon of LGBT rights.2In July this year, the Delhi high court helped protect Anita Kumari and her partner, Priyanka Singh, both residents of Gaya town in Bihar. Kumari, 23, was in her third year of college when her parents pulled her out after she came out as lesbian.She was locked up, prevented from meeting Singh, 25, sexually abused by her cousins and threatened by her sister and mother. After five months, Kumari escaped and went to live in Delhi with Singh.Weeks later, Kumari’s mother filed cases against Singh and her family. This prompted Kumari to file a petition in the Delhi high court, seeking protection and asking the police to take her statement in Delhi, as she feared returning to her hometown.On July 7, the judge permitted all her requests. “The petitioner is a major and if she has different sexual orientation, she is at liberty to live in the manner as she wishes,” judge Mukta Gupta said.“My decision to leave my house was not made on the spur of the moment. I knew that the only way I could live with safety with my partner was if I ran away. But my family continued to threaten my partner and me. It was only after the court agreed to protect us that I felt safe,” said Kumari.S Sushma and U Seema Agarval, two university students from the rural parts of Madurai district in Tamil Nadu, also successfully used the 2018 judgment to protect their lives and relationships – in the process also securing sweeping protections for the community.The women met in 2019 and fell in love but battled fierce disapproval from their conservative families. On February 9, they ran away from home to Chennai, but both sets of families filed missing person FIRs in two separate police stations, prompting policemen to travel to Chennai to track them down.Things came to a head in the second week of March, when both sets of parents, along with roughly 10 policemen showed up in cars and threatened violence. By then, the women had already filed a petition in the Madras high court.On June 8, justice N Anand Venkatesh delivered a judgment that was remarkable for two reasons. One, the judge undertook counselling to understand the identity and concomitant vulnerabilities of the petitioners.Two, he issued directions to a slew of state and central agencies to frame guidelines that recognise the rights of LGBT people, and ensure their safety and security. On August 31, he issued further directions to the police to provide immediate protection to all such vulnerable couples and effectively banning conversion therapy – the kind that Tudu was subjected to in her college days.The two women know that their fight isn’t over – they are still looking for stable housing and employment, and remain fearful of reprisal from their families -- but they’re hopeful. “We want to...live our life in front of everyone. And help others like us,” said Sushma.3Legally, the troika of the 2017 verdict on privacy – where the apex court recognised sexual orientation and gender identity as core parts of privacy – the 2018 Hadiya judgment – where the top court recognised the right to choose a partner – and the Navtej Johar judgment together have paved the way for protections for queer couples.In the last three years, people have approached high courts in Rajasthan, Delhi, Mumbai, Allahabad, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Chennai, Kolkata and Odisha – seeking to validate their rights and rebuff parental and social censure, all on the basis of this landmark verdict.“The high courts have taken very liberal and progressive positions…they’re showing the way that things can change,” said Manuraj S, a lawyer at the Madras high court who fought on behalf of the Madurai women petitioners.He referred to another 2019 verdict by the Madurai bench of the Madras high court, which upheld the marriage of a man and a transgender woman under the Hindu Marriage Act, relying on the Navtej Johar judgment, among others.“For years, LGBT issues have been projected as elite and from the west. But the Sushma and Seema case showed that it wasn’t the case. There is a deepening and democratising of these rights. That the Madurai bench of the HC gave such a progressive judgment gives us hope that these judgments are percolating in rural and smaller regions, and people are learning about a more fairer and equal society,” he said.To be sure, there are still big strides to be taken to ensure dignity and respect for queer life. Transgender folks continue to battle prejudice in employment, education, housing and health facilities. The 2019 transgender rights law is unclear on punishments for discrimination, has been criticised for focusing on medical checks for issuing transgender certificate and stipulating lower punishment for crimes against transpeople.Queer folks from marginal castes and communities face hostility within and outside the community. State laws against transfolks, sex work and beggary are deployed against queer people. Manuraj pointed out that the 2018 judgment could have protected civil rights such as marriage and inheritance, but disappointingly stopped short. And petitions to legalise same-sex marriage have been pending before the Delhi and Kerala high courts for over a year, with the Union government staunchly opposing such a move.Still, the positive social life of the 2018 verdict – it was splashed across newspapers, extensively discussed on television and coincided with rising acceptance of queerness, especially among young people – has helped cut through the stigma long attached with homosexuality and mitigate the cycle of shame, blackmail and police brutality. “Without the Navtej Johar judgment, none of this would have been possible,” said Manuraj.4Queer people are everywhere. They are dancing in prides and protesting against bias outside government offices, talking back to homophobic teachers in class and demanding trans-friendly policies in offices.They are in our homes, in the cramped alleys of small towns, stealing glances with ones they love but dare not speak the name, in parks and lakes, holding hands as darkness descends because their homes are too hostile to their truths. They come from all castes, faiths and abilities.For too long, queerness in India has focused on big cities, that offer a respite from the loneliness in their promise of a glitzy nightlife, parties, prides and community events. But now, even pride parades are taking root in cities like Raipur, Chandannagar and Imphal.“Cities are enticing. But beyond the glamour of the gay parties in Delhi or Mumbai, the colours of the pride parade and the resistance and building of movements in courtrooms; many life worlds of queerness escape our sights, often invisiblised,” said Dhiren Borisa, a professor at Jindal Global Law School.He pointed to the more muted ways in which queerness flourishes away from the big cities – the clandestine changing of clothes at a friends’ house, the evening haunts of public areas that function as silent hubs of queer intimacy, the internet cafes and mobile phones where the first brush with the acronym LGBT occurs, and the many queer and trans people who live their lives both openly, and become a part of the local fabric – the two unmarried aunties who live together as “friends”, the trans couple everyone calls ‘didi’ or the two friends who were so close that they never married.“Not everyone can become a respectable queer subject with resources and power, or be well versed in the language and acronyms, which can be compartmentalising and suffocating, and rarely symbolise freedom. While one aspires to be in the city, there are many ways to desire and be able to survive it too,” Borisa said.Tudu knows it well. She is aware of the challenges of being queer in her small town – there are no support groups, people look at her like she’s an alien, her family has ostracised her and there are no fun nights or events she can take Rekha too. Yet, she is averse to moving away. “We met each other here, and have built a life here. Who said we have to go to big cities to love?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/section-377-3-years-on-freedom-to-love-takes-root-101630875219858.html
07-09-2021||Today's||For Delhi, the India-US partnership remains the best bet||The last American troops in Afghanistan have flown out, ending the longest war the United States (US) has ever engaged in. There was agreement in the international community that the withdrawal was incompetent, at best, and a disaster, at worst. The withdrawal also generated many claims that it heralded the unravelling of American empire. Given that any sentence containing the words “American” and “empire” is contested not just in the US’s policy community but also among historians, it would be more useful to ask if the end of America’s 20-year war is also the end of American leadership and dominance. There, the jury is still out. And it is far from clear that India must, as some have argued, rethink the India-US partnership.

India’s population, in particular, is going through an epidemiological and demographic transition, which has led to an increasing burden of non-communicable diseases, including of the brain and mind. This is also attributed to increasing longevity and changing lifestyles.

And the international community is busy making short-term tactical adjustments to cope with the new realities, with some pleased (Pakistan), some wooing the Taliban and vice-versa (China and Russia), and others (including India) slowly making peace with the tectonic shift in geopolitics, sparked by the messy and hurried withdrawal of the United States (US) from Afghanistan.
07-09-2021||Editorials||The future is at stake||The Covid-19-induced school closure, which began in March 2020 and continued till August-September 2021, has led to “catastrophic consequences” for underprivileged students, reveals a new report, Locked Out: Emergency Report On School Education. The survey, supervised by economists Jean Dreze, Reetika Khera, and researcher Vipul Paikra, was conducted in August and covered 1,400 students, from classes 1 to 8, across 15 states and Union Territories. About 60% of the sample households reside in rural areas, and close to 60% belong to Dalit or tribal communities. Only 8% of students in rural areas and 24% are studying online regularly, and 19% of children in urban areas and 37% in rural areas are not studying at all. Ninety per cent of parents in urban areas and 97% in rural areas want schools to reopen. This is understandable: Only 23% of urban parents and 8% of rural parents feel that their children have adequate online access. Both sets (76% in urban and 75% in rural areas) said that their children’s reading abilities have declined during the lockdown. The results of a simple reading test conducted during the survey confirm the assessment. Nearly half of all children in the sample could not read more than a few words.
07-09-2021||Editorials||Nipah is a potential threat; step up surveillance||The death of a 12-year-old boy in Kerala has brought back focus on the threat from the Nipah virus. Like Sars-Cov-2, it is zoonotic, having jumped from animals. The virus is carried by fruit bats and infection spreads typically when a person eats or drinks something contaminated by bat droppings. Nipah infections have a high fatality rate; 17 of the 19 confirmed cases in Kerala in 2018 died. The World Health Organization estimates 40-75% of the infections are likely to be fatal. Experts have warned of a high pandemic potential with a virus such as Nipah. Till now, cases of human-to-human transmission are few compared to infections via contact with animals or contaminated products. But a 2019 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine raised the possibility of the virus mutating to become more able to jump from person to person, making any outbreak a cause for significant concern.
