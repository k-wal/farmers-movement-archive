A senior government official said the deadline for submitting these plans was 6pm Tuesday.“We had given all the agencies time till 6pm on Tuesday to submit their final action plan and the recommendations they have for the government ahead of the winter pollution season. Now we will be scrutinising their plans and will give them feedback on what can be added,” the official said. The official also added that based on the submitted plans, the environment department along and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) will formulate a detailed winter action plan that is likely to be released by September 30. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai announced earlier this month that the government will release a winter action plan this year to ensure that pollution from various sources is kept in check. He said that the individual action plans submitted by agencies will also be evaluated from time to time to ensure that they are sticking to the tasks they have taken up. Every year ahead of the winter season, pollution levels in the national capital start deteriorating till they reach emergency levels. The season starts off with fumes from the crop stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana and is made worse by Delhi’s local pollution sources such as vehicular emissions, dust and incidents of open waste burning, and cracker-bursting during Diwali time. The unfavourable weather conditions, including low wind speed, also tend to worsen the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-scrutinise-winter-pollution-plans-submitted-by-agencies-101632248714821.html

Their demand is that the word “Gurjar” must therefore be removed from the statue’s plaque. Elders of both Gurjar and Rajput communities have discussed the contentious issue and agreed to a show of unity during Adityanath’s visit, but some disgruntled members continued with their protest on Tuesday.While the Noida police has made adequate security arrangements, members of the Rajput community have threatened nationwide protests if the text on the plaque is not changed.“Police have threatened our members and asked us not to protest. They said if we protest, our members will have to face the consequences,” said Prithvi Singh, national secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Kshatriya Mahasabha.Gautam Budh Nagar police commissioner Alok Singh was unavailable for comment on the matter.According to the CM’s schedule, he will arrive at Greater Noida’s Expo Mart around 10am. He will reach Dadri around 11am to unveil the statue at Mihir Bhoj Degree College. He will also inaugurate a higher secondary school and a “sadbhav mandap (community centre)” before leaving for Dhaulana in Hapur to inaugurate multiple development projects there.The chief minister is on a two-day visit to western Uttar Pradesh cities, including Greater Noida, Ghaziabad, Hapur and Moradabad, among others.“The chief minister is travelling across the state every day and talking about the development work done in every district in the last four-and-a-half years. He has performed wonderfully well on all fronts, so people also want to listen to him at events,” said Dhirendra Singh, BJP MLA from Jewar.Ahead of Adityanath’s visit, the Noida authority sealed offices and clubhouse buildings inside group housing projects of 11 realtors in different sectors, including 74, 75, 78 and 107.“We have sealed the office spaces and club buildings, which are controlled by the realtors in these 11 projects because the developers are violating the National Green Tribunal orders. Either they have not set up sewage treatment plants (STPs), or the STPs are non-functional, thereby dumping untreated sewage into city drains which eventually pollutes rivers,” said Mukesh Vaish, senior manager, Noida authority.The residents of the housing projects said the action should have been taken long ago-- it is now inconveniencing them rather than the builders.“The authority took this action now to show the chief minister that they are working according to rules. This action should have been taken long ago because almost all realtors have been dumping untreated sewage into drains for a long time now. Also, why did they seal clubhouse buildings meant for residents?” said Amit Gupta, member of Progressive Community Foundation, a residents’ group.“The authority team reached our premises at 12.20pm and sealed our maintenance office without any notice. This has affected our functioning-- it must be de-sealed. The Noida authority wants to make the chief minister happy with this unreasonable action. Junior-level officers are misleading the Noida CEO and acting unlawfully. Our sewer is supposed to be connected to a nearby STP of the Noida authority. They arrested our staff illegally,” said Namit Gautam, president of Prateek Fedora Apartments in Sector 61.However, the authority claimed they only sealed premises controlled by builders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ahead-of-cm-s-dadri-visit-today-officials-go-all-out-to-make-event-a-success-101632248533889.html
21-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Two vehicle theft gangs, with links to criminals in Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, busted; five arrested||New Delhi: The city police on Tuesday claimed to have busted two separate gangs of auto-lifters, with alleged links to liquor and drug smugglers in Rajasthan and stolen car dealers in Uttarakhand, after the arrest of five people and recovery of 12 stolen vehicles, along with electronic gadgets and lock breaking tools, allegedly from their possession.The operation by the anti-auto theft squad (AATS) of Shahdara district police spanned across Delhi and three nearby states over a period of two weeks, officers said.According to police, the gangs stole vehicles from Delhi as per the demand from their clients in Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. Officers aware of the investigation said one gang used to steal CNG-fitted cars and sell them to stolen car dealers in Uttarakhand, while the other targeted SUVs, like Creta, Brezza and Seltos, depending on orders received from Rajasthan-based agents. Officials said the SUVs were subsequently sold to gangs involved in trafficking liquor from Haryana to Gujarat, which is a “dry state”.“The stolen vehicles were also used to smuggle opium poppy into Rajasthan from Madhya Pradesh,” said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram.The DCP said that the AATS was tasked with nabbing auto-lifters following several incidents of vehicle thefts using a similar modus operandi in Shahdara district.The DCP said the suspects wore caps to hide their faces from CCTV cameras, stole cars in the wee hours of the day and used various advanced tools to deactivate the security features of the cars, open doors and start the engine. The police got on one of the gang’s trail while investigating the theft of a CNG-fitted Honda City car from Anand Vihar area on August 14.“Our team collected details about the suspects through technical investigation and human intelligence network and arrested Parvez, 25, from Bilaspur near Rampur in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday. Two stolen Honda City and a Creta were recovered after his interrogation,” said the DCP.Upon interrogation, Parvez allegedly revealed that his gang is led by one Satish Gangwar, and added that they have contacts in Uttarakhand’s Haldwani and Nainital to receive the stolen cars. The gang either sold parts of the vehicles or used documents of similar vehicles involved in accidents to sell the stolen cars, police said, adding that efforts are on to arrest Gangwar and two other members of the gang.The AATS learned of the second gang after finding four of its members replacing the number plates of two cars -- a Brezza and a Creta -- near CBD ground in Karkardooma in the early hours of September 9. Police arrested two suspects -- Faisal (26) from Nainital, and Azharuddin (39) from Meerut -- after a brief scuffle even as the two others escaped in the Creta car.The Brezza car was later found to be stolen from MS Park area on September 7, the police said.The two arrested men revealed that they allegedly worked for Kuldeep Singh, a habitual criminal from Delhi’s Alipur, and reportedly admitted to stealing over 50 cars from Delhi-NCR in the past few years. Singh was later arrested from northeast Delhi’s Dayalpur and eight more stolen vehicles were recovered after his interrogation. They sold the stolen cars to Manish Kumar, a receiver in Rajasthan who was also arrested, the DCP said.“This gang used electronic gadgets imported from China to decode the engine control module (ECM) of a car and start its engine. They tampered with the car’s engine and chassis numbers and gave a new identity to the vehicle using details of other cars of the same model and make. Singh is an expert in making a digital car key using programming tools,” he added. Police said that Singh and his gang members stole vehicles after received demands from Kumar, who further sold the stolen vehicles to traffickers of liquor and drugs in Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhitwo-vehicle-theft-gangs-with-links-to-criminals-in-rajasthan-and-uttarakhand-busted-five-arrested-101632248358859.html

The youngster feels that one should follow instinct and passion and things automatically fall into place.“My father was in the India Air Force and pursuing engineering was my choice. But, during my college days, I started modelling and soon won Mr Youth Bangalore pageant. It became my passion, so I convinced my parents and since then it has been a decade and I have never been out of work. Even during the pandemic, I was doing short films and documentaries,” says the model-turned-actor.Last year, he shot for a 90-minute documentary, 3687 Metres Black Peak, which bagged many awards. “This is one of the highest peaks (20,960 feet) in Uttarakhand and we scaled it in a record time of six days. It got the cinematography award at the Canadian Film Festival 2021 and was the official selection at the Dada Saheb Phalke Awards 2021. Next, we will do two sequels to it — first 23,212 Ft Mount Satopanth in India followed by Mt Everest. It’s for the first time a mountaineering documentary of this scale is being done in our country,” says the karate black belt and national-level swimmer.Mittal feels documentary space is set to become big. “In India, we need to go big on documentaries. Free Solo, based on rock climbing, went on to win an Academy Award in 2019. So, I feel, films, serials and web-series are fine but documentary films and short films have a huge potential and are going to be the next big things. The audience is relating with realistic space and if we look at OTT platforms, so many documentaries are getting great viewership.”He has done 12 short films as well. “My last short was Kanke Mental Asylum which is in the horror genre. It’s again a part of a three-part series. I will soon make an OTT series debut which is based on Sunil Sihag’s novel Day Turns Dark which stars actor Rahul Dev as my mentor. We will be shooting it on the border of Rajasthan in October.”The actor has also featured in Babbu Maan song Meri Jannat, Altaf Sayeed and Omar Inayat’s song Closed Eyes: Kahan Tum Kho Gaye and will be seen in Awara Hu Banjar Hu which is an ode to Indian Air Force officers. Besides, he is also directing documentaries, ads and short films.Throwing light on his first name, he says, “Kovid is a Sanskrit name derived from Hanuman Chalisa which means wisdom. After the pandemic, I started getting random messages if my name was inspired by Covid-19 and then I educated people about its relevance (laughs).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/documentary-film-space-has-a-huge-potential-kovid-mittal-101632248354630.html

21-09-2021||Mumbai||OBC quota in local body polls: Maharashtra sends ordinance to governor for final approval||Faisal MalikThe Maharashtra government has sent the ordinance to provide reservation to the Other Backward Classes (OBC) in the local bodies elections to governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for final approval. The ordinance can be promulgated only after the governor’s approval. Last week, the state decided to promulgate an ordinance to make amendment to the legislations to provide political reservation to the OBC community in local bodies without breaching the 50% reservation cap mandated by the Supreme Court. The decision was taken in the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday.An official said Koshyari has raised a query on the ordinance, but there was no official confirmation about it. “In case of a query by the governor, the state government will send a response in a day or two,” said another official from the chief minister’s office (CMO). An ordinance is a temporary law approved by the governor (on the advice of the state government), when the state legislature is not in session. An ordinance becomes a permanent Act (the law of the land) on being approved by the state legislature within six weeks, failing which it lapses.On March 4, the Supreme Court ruled that the reservation in favour of the OBCs in local bodies should not result in exceeding the 50% mandated cap in quota. It has directed the state to appoint a dedicated commission to collect empirical data, based on which the reservation for the community will be fixed and also allowed the state election commission to hold local bodies polls without having reservation for OBCs.This could prove politically damaging for the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and hence it was decided to take ordinance route to save the OBC reservation.According to the decision, the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities will continue to get political reservation quota based on their population in each district, while the OBCs will get the remaining quota within the 50% ceiling. To make it possible, the state rural development department will issue an ordinance to amend two legislations — Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 and Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act for zilla parishads, panchayat samiti and gram panchayatsThe state believes they will be able to secure around 90% seats of the OBC community with the ordinance. However, it is not clear when the Raj Bhavan will clear the ordinance. The apex court order came in connection with the bypolls in district council elections. The state election commission has already declared bypolls in six district councils on October 5. The new ordinance is unlikely to be useful for the byelections as the schedule is already declared, said a senior MVA minister. Koshyari and the MVA government have been locked in a bitter tussle for quite some time. The governor is yet to clear the 12 names approved by the state cabinet in November last year to be appointed as the members of the legislative council. Every six years, 12 members are nominated to the Upper House of the state legislature by the governor on the recommendation of the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/obc-quota-in-local-body-polls-maharashtra-sends-ordinance-to-governor-for-final-approval-101632246614380.html

21-09-2021||Gurugram||Air quality management: Old vehicles to be impounded on roads ahead of winter pollution spike||The traffic police will start a drive from Wednesday to impound old vehicles plying in violation of environmental norms ahead of the winter season, officials said.Orders issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2015, as well as the Supreme Court in 2018, state that diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol vehicles older than 15 years cannot ply in the National Capital Region (NCR) due to high levels of air pollution. In July 2016, the Haryana government also passed a similar order, banning such vehicles in Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat and Jhajjar districts.“Adhering to the NGT directions and ahead of the stubble burning season, from Wednesday onwards, traffic police is going to launch a full-scale drive against petrol and diesel vehicles older than 15 and 10 years, respectively. The drive is being launched keeping air quality management across NCR in mind. Owners of such vehicles have been directed to either replace such vehicles or sell it as scrap material,” Ravinder Singh Tomar, the deputy commissioner of police (DCP), traffic, Gurugram police, said.According to Gurugram traffic police officials, they have impounded 640 such vehicles from 2018 to September 20, 2021. Officials said that 208 vehicles have been impounded for the offence this year.Tomar said that personnel have been directed to impound old vehicles plying on roads and take the same to the nearest police station. In addition, a challan of ₹5,000 will also be generated against the offender on the spot and the owners will only be returned the vehicles if they agree to scrap them.In October and November, air pollution levels in the city surge drastically as farmers in northern states follow a common practice of setting their paddy fields afire to remove the leftover stubble after the harvest to prepare the soil for sowing the next crop. Such is the impact of the stubble burning that air quality levels are often 30-35 times higher than the permissible limit across the NCR.This period coincides with the onset of winter, when particulate matter remains suspended close to the ground due to low wind speeds and smog. Vehicular pollution in the city further compounds the problems during these months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/air-quality-management-old-vehicles-to-be-impounded-on-roads-ahead-of-winter-pollution-spike-101632246557245.html

As per the policy, a farmhouse in an agriculture zone can be a house constructed as the main dwelling unit or an ancillary unit. DTCP officials said that as per the new policy, farmhouses would now be allowed in hyper-potential zones of Gurugram and Faridabad, which was not allowed earlier. DTCP officials said that the farmhouse has to be developed as a self-sustainable unit, with solar lighting, ways to ensure 100% treatment of all waste, including water, and no generation of effluents allowed. The policy allows the construction of a swimming pool with a maximum area of 50 square metres (sqm) for personal use, but not for commercial purposes. The farmhouse must also have tree coverage of 15%, according to the policy. According to the policy, farmhouses are allowed only if the minimum area is one acre with a maximum floor-area ratio of 0.12 for farmhouses built on an area of up to two acres. For properties larger than two acres, the department has fixed the maximum size of the building at 1,000 sqm. RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement) said that the farmhouses under the policy can’t be used for commercial, religious, institutional purposes or as a party/banquet hall. “The purpose of this policy is to allow landowners to develop farmhouses in a regulated manner and to ensure that these properties are developed in an eco-friendly manner. Planned development is crucial in both urban and rural areas,” he said.Officials said that the new policy was announced due to popular demand for the same, due to which several illegal farmhouses have cropped up on the outskirts of Gurugram. The policy aims to curb the development of illegal colonies and allow individual landowners to build farmhouses for personal use. “This, however, does not mean that a person can buy large land and develop multiple farmhouses to sell these,” Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, said. DTCP officials also said that sites approved under the policy will not come under the purview of the Haryana Apartment Ownership Act. In case of any violation or misuse of the premises, the same shall be sealed and penal action taken against the violators, they said. These properties would be monitored by a district-level committee comprising officials of the DTCP and other departments concerned, and headed by the deputy commissioner. Owners of agricultural land welcomed the move.Suresh Yadav, a landowner, said that the policy will curtail illegal developments and also allow landowners to develop such properties for personal use. “Once these get approved, there would be no harassment either,” he said. Before this, the government had come up with a similar policy for urban areas, aimed at allowing landowners in urban pockets to develop land in a regulated manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ecofriendly-self-sustainable-farmhouses-allowed-in-agriculture-zones-101632246556158.html

Officials said that they conducted a detailed survey and found that owners had covered setback areas (open space around a structure) and made rooms in stilt parking, among other illegal extensions. RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said that notices were mainly issued to property owners in Sushant Lok 1 to 3, DLF Phases 1 and 3, South City 1 and 2, and Palam Vihar. “We have found that owners of these 60 properties have violated rules and they must restore the properties, failing which action will be taken. Last year, we had made it easier for house owners to obtain occupancy certificates, but it is being observed that after getting it, owners are frequently violating the plans,” he said. Officials said that violations are continuing despite the state government increasing the floor-area ratio (FAR) and allowing more constructions in plots in the recent past. According to the details shared by the department, notices were served to owners of 57 residential properties and three commercial properties. The maximum violations were in Sushant Lok-3, DLF Phase-1 and South City-1, officials said. DTCP officials said that the stipulated setback, space in the front, and checks on extensions and additional constructions are being done to maintain the sanctity of a planned colony and ensure that people get light, ventilation and space to live comfortably. “What is being seen is that in the greed for more rent, FAR and additional coverage rules are being violated. This also negatively affects the residents who follow rules,” Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/building-plan-violation-owners-of-60-properties-in-private-licensed-colonies-served-notices-101632246554890.html

He said that the state government was ready for any investigation and even a CBI probe, if needed, would be ordered. “The wishes of the Akhara Parishad and the Panch Parmeshwars (heads) of Shri Panchayati Akhara Niranjani (a monastic order of which Narendra Giri was also the secretary) would be honoured in this regard,” he said while interacting with media persons in Prayagraj. Earlier, Maurya arrived here from Lucknow and paid his last respects to Mahant Narendra Giri at the Baghambari Math ashram where his body had been kept for darshan. It is worth mentioning that Maurya had met the 62-year-old Mahant on Sunday. “I cannot believe that Mahant Narendra Giri could have committed suicide. I am shocked, pained and at a loss for words. I knew him since childhood and he was always very brave. I had sought his blessings on the morning of September 19. He was quite normal then,” Maurya had said in his Tweet in Hindi after the news of Narendra Giri’s death had surfaced. The deputy CM said that during his interaction with Narendra Giri, the latter could have shared any problem that he was facing but he did not do so.

This reduces the convergence of vehicles and saves both wait time and travel time for commuters,” Ravinder Singh Tomar, deputy commissioner police (DCP), traffic, Gurugram police, said.The Shahid Hawaldar Singh Chowk on Ambedkar Road is one of the most congested spots in the city due to the convergence of traffic from St Thomas Marg, Golf Course Road, Golf Course Extension Road, Huda City Centre and Kanhai traffic signal. It takes commuters nearly 15-20 minutes to navigate the section during peak traffic hours.To facilitate smooth vehicular flow, traffic police have placed jersey barriers along the carriageway of the road from the Kanhai traffic signal. Commuters have to take a compulsory left turn towards Huda City Centre and then take a U-turn to head towards St Thomas Marg or Golf Course Extension Road.From January to March 2020, and again from October 2020 to April 2021, the traffic police had placed jersey barriers at the spot. However, these were removed due to the low traffic volume as the Covid-19 pandemic broke out.At the Rajesh Pilot Marg/ Gurgaon-Faridabad Road signal, jersey barriers have been placed in a manner to facilitate signal-free commute on the leftmost lane of the carriageway of the stretch from the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road towards Gwal Pahari. The arrangement ensures that the vehicles turning right from Rajesh Pilot Marg do not converge with the traffic heading straight towards Gwal Pahari.“Earlier, I used to get stuck at the signal for five to 10 minutes. Now, I travel straight through. The jersey barrier arrangement has saved me around 15-20 minutes of daily travelling time,” Gaurav Bansal, a resident of DLF Phase-1, who works in Faridabad, said.Tomar said that on Sunday, the traffic police will place jersey barriers below the Vatika flyover, the first flyover on the National Highway-48 after the Kherki Daula toll, on a trial basis. The junction below the flyover is locally known as Next Vatika Chowk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/jersey-barrier-arrangements-at-shahid-hawaldar-singh-chowk-faridabad-road-cut-travel-time-reduce-congestion-101632246494412.html

It said that due to this benefit, Uttar Pradesh reached the top position in effective implementation of nearly 90% of the central schemes, including PM Awas Yojana, PM employment general programmes, Ujjwala scheme, and construction of personal toilets, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-got-over-rs-2-lakh-crore-aid-from-centre-due-to-double-engine-govt-101632246054844.html

He specially highlighted the personal interest that the senior seer took in ensuring that every ritual and ceremony during the mega religious fair was conducted as per the norms laid down. “I was lucky to have always received his blessings, including during the Kumbh,” he added.Earlier, Akhilesh Yadav landed at the Bamrauli airport and directly proceeded towards the Baghambari Math.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/let-sitting-hc-judge-probe-abap-chief-s-death-akhilesh-101632246255671.html

The police found her body about a kilometre away from her house.. There were apprehensions of heavy rain at the end of last week and schools and colleges were closed statewide. However, the weekend passed smoothly but a downpour lashed the city on Tuesday, leading to overflowing drains and water-logging everywhere. The girl Shabnam alias Shannu (6) was playing near her house when she fell in the overflowing drain. There was three ft deep water in the locality (known as Gobar Chowki) in Tajganj and the girl was swept away before her parents could take notice and look for her. “Extensive efforts were made by police by placing nets all through the drain and a team from the Nagar Nigam was called in. She was traced after an hour in a drain near ‘Mughal pulia’ and was rushed to the nearest hospital but was declared brought dead,” informed Udayveer Malik, inspector in charge of Tajganj police station. The girl’s father Vakil Ahmad, a labourer, looked shattered as he held the body of his daughter in his lap. The city was thrown out of gear after the heavy rain when schools ended and students were on the road. Water-logging made the traffic crawl and jams were seen at most crossings and roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/agra-girl-swept-away-in-overflowing-drain-dies-101632245654606.html

The party also reiterated its request to him to take action against hooligans (in the garb of farmers), who had targeted Akali workers proceeding to Delhi to participate in its march to Parliament last week (on September 17). Addressing a press conference, senior SAD leader Prem Singh Chandumajra, said it was unfortunate that even after admitting that some wrong elements wanted to defame the Kisan Sangharsh, Rajewal had neither asked for an apology from those guilty nor subjected them to the process of law. Akali leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal also took objected to Rajewal’s statement that only SAD legislators and MPs should have gone to protest in Delhi. “We fail to understand what is his objection to a protest by thousands of people. Previously too, thousands of farmers had marched to Parliament, sending out a message of unity and strength, that attracted worldwide attention,” he asked. Asserting that the SAD held Rajewal in high esteem, the SAD leaders said, “He, however, should not lower his dignity by making political statements. We are ready to debate political issues separately. Farmers’ forum is not to be used for the same.”They added that the speeches made by former union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal in Parliament were a matter of public record, and that she was the lone minister to resign from the ministry in support of the farming community. The SAD leaders also made it clear that the protest organised by it on September 17 was aimed at strengthening the Kisan Andolan and said Rajewal should have appreciated the step, instead of opposing it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/keep-farmers-stir-above-politics-sad-tells-rajewal-101632244694372.html

The successive state governments led by secular political parties did not work for the welfare and uplift of the Muslim community.”“The backwardness among the Muslim community has been disclosed in the Sachar committee report. The secular parties have failed to give a share to the Muslim community in power after forming government. The UDA will raise the demand of the rights and justice of the Muslim community in the coming assembly election campaign. The alliance will also fight to free the Muslim community from political slavery. To check division of Muslim votes, the like-minded political parties are welcomed in the UDA fold,” Dr Ayub said.Maulana Rashadi said, “There was a demand from the people that both the Peace Party and the Rashtriya Ulama Council should join hands to fight for the rights of the Muslim community. The alliance will unit people one platform. The other political parties representing the oppressed or deprived sections in the society are welcome to join the alliance.” “The UDA will work to remove the communal forces from power. The people are harassed by the anti–people policies of the BJP government in UP. The alliance will work to resolve the issues, including inflation, unemployment, poverty, corruption, communalism, check discrimination on religion and castes,” he said.The Peace Party has influence among the weavers’ community settled in East UP.

21-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 3,131 new Covid cases; experts call for caution||Even as the past 10 days have witnessed a drop in the daily caseload of the Covid-19 cases in the state, the experts have cautioned with a potential spurt in the cases in the next two weeks because of the crowding during the Ganesh festival, which ended on September 20. On Tuesday, the state reported 3,131 new infections and 70 deaths taking the case tally to 6,527,629 and the toll to 138,616. Mumbai reported 357 new cases and one death, while Ahmednagar in western Maharashtra reported the highest, 605, cases on Tuesday.State’s daily caseload of Covid-19 cases has dropped to average 333 cases in the past ten days between September 11 and 20 (total 33,319 cases) against the average of 414 during September 1-10 (total 41,369 cases). The number of deaths in 10 days from September 11 to 20 dropped to 485 against 748 in the first 10 days of the month. In Mumbai too, the daily caseload average in the past 10 days (Sept 11-20) dropped slightly to 418 from 434 in the first 10 days of the month. The deaths reported in the city in past 10 days were, however, high at 47 against 34 between September 1 and 10.The number of average daily tests, however, has dropped to 146,177 during September 11-20 from the daily average of 172,574 tests from September 1 to 10. The drop in the testing in the past ten days is also attributed to holidays leading to the non-availability of the facilities during Ganpati festival.Some of the districts, including Ahmednagar, Satara and Pune continue to report a high number of cases. Ahmednagar district reported the highest, 605, cases on Tuesday, followed by Pune district (644), Satara (247) and Sangli (244). Pune has the highest number of active cases — 10,875 —followed by Thane (5,654), Ahmednagar (5,530) and Mumbai (4,966). Divisional commissioner of Western Maharashtra Radhakrishna Game has warned people of the beginning of the third wave from Ahmednagar. “We still have a high number of active cases. People are crowding for wedding ceremonies, funerals and do not follow Covid appropriate behaviour. If this continued, I fear that the third wave may begin from the district,” he said.Out of 61 units of districts and cities in the state, 43 reported no cases on Tuesday. Seven out of 36 districts have less than 10 active cases.Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state-appointed task force of doctors said that though the present situation looks better, the next two weeks will determine whether there is any spurt owing to the crowding in Ganesh festival. “Since delta strain transmits rapidly, the early trends are seen in the first few days of the festival. It is a good sign that there is no rise seen in the number of cases from the beginning of the festival. But still, it could be a ‘work in progress’ and we will have to wait for two more weeks to get an idea if there would be any spurt in cases. In Mumbai too there is no significant rise in number though we have been witnessing ‘mini blips’ in the ongoing wave. The test positivity rate is less along with the R-value which is 0.89% currently. Besides the satisfactory vaccination in the city, it appears that the citizens have got reasonable exposure to the virus. However, exposure could not be complete protection,” he said.Dr Joshi has the word of caution as he says the drop in number could be a lull before the storm. “The authorities could continue with the aggressive testing and contact tracing and keep isolating asymptomatic patients to keep the spread under control,” he said. He also added that since the recently held sero survey in Mumbai was restricted to the healthcare workers, it does not truly indicate the immunity among Mumbaiites.Dr Subhash Salunke, former advisor to the state government on Covid-19 said that the spurt could be witnessed between October 1 and 10. “Though major parts of the state have developed immunity against the virus, which was seen in the recent sero survey in Mumbai, the risk of spurt in cases is still there. It could be witnessed 15 days after the Ganesh festival which ended on September 20. Many districts in Marathwada and Vidarbha have developed herd immunity,” he said.Maharashtra has 272,098 people in home quarantine and 1,704 in institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-3-131-new-covid-cases-experts-call-for-caution-101632243554227.html

Somaiya has accused the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) minister of ₹100-crore corruption in Appasaheb Nalawade sugar factory at Kolhapur’s Gadhinglaj through a private firm allegedly owned by his relative.In his complaint to ED, Somaiya has said that the sugar factory was taken over by Brics India Private Limited, in which Mateem Hasin Mangoli, the minister’s relative is a benami owner. He said that the sugar factory was given to Brics to operate for 10 years in 2014 without following any bidding process. Somaiya said that 7,185 shares of the sugar factory are held by SU Corporation, a shell company used by Mushrif to park the money, while 998 shares each are held by Mangoli and a man named Gulam Hussain. He said that 98% shares of the sugar factory are held by the Mushrif family.Mushrif, a senior NCP leader from Kolhapur in western Maharashtra, rubbished the allegations. “The sugar factory in question had been taken over by Brics in 2012 till 2020 and is now being run on cooperative basis by more than 60,000 farmers as its shareholders. The Maharashtra State Central Cooperative Bank had refused to hand over the factory to any private entity. The sugar factory is debt-free now. Neither has my son-in-law [Mangoli] nor do I have anything to do with the factory or Brics. I have been helping the factory as a local legislator,” he said.Mushrif said that he has welcomed Somaiya to visit Kolhapur and was ready to provide him every detail related to the firms. He said he was being targeted because he turned down BJP’s offer to join the party ahead of the 2019 Assembly polls.Somaiya has alleged that the minister diverted his illegal money earned after becoming the minister in 2019 to the sugar factory. This is the second set of allegations by Somaiya against Mushrif. Earlier, he had accused the minister of laundering ₹127 crore through Senapati Santaji Ghorpade sugar factory.“SU Corporation, in which other relatives of the minister are shareholders, hold shares in Brics. Sikandar Desai, a director of SU Corporation, is also the director in CRM Systems and Marubhumi Finance and Developers Pvt Ltd. These three companies are involved in money laundering and benami transactions done in Senapati Santaji Ghorpade sugar factory,” he has stated in the complaint. NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase questioned over Somaiya’s silence on the corruption cases against BJP leaders Kripa Shankar Singh, Narayan Rane, Vijaykumar Gavit and Babanrao Pachpute. “Somaiya had levelled allegations of corruption against these leaders when they were in other parties. He does not utter a word about those cases now as they are in BJP. Why is he silent about those cases,” he questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjps-kirit-somaiya-lodges-complaint-against-maharashtra-minister-hasan-mushrif-101632243134437.html

The process of co-option means appointment to the membership of a committee or any other body by the invitation of existing members.“The undersigned is constrained to deduce that Manjinder Singh Sirsa is not well-versed with the reading and writing of Gurmukhi and, therefore, does not qualify the eligibility conditions as laid down in Section 10 of the DSGMC Act,” says the order issued on Tuesday of director, gurdwara election, Narinder Singh. Sirsa, a former DSGMC president, had lost the August 22 election to Shiromani Akali Dal (Delhi) candidate Harvinder Singh Sarna. On August 25, when the result of the polls was announced, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal had announced that Sirsa will continue as the DSGMC president. He had added that Sirsa would be co-opted through the quota of Amritsar headquartered Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). The SAD has majority in the SGPC. The orders of the election director add that while Sirsa might be able to write a few words in Punjabi, but the spirit of the DSGMC Act, 1971, places great importance to recitation from the Sri Guru Granth Sahib and the writing of Gurmukhi, where he has miserably failed.Delhi HC hearing Sarna plea Previously, Sarna had filed a petition in the Delhi high court, seeking Sirsa’s disqualification on the grounds of lack of Gurmukhi knowledge, the script used for writing Punjabi, and also the script in which the Guru Granth Sahib is written.On September 15, the high court had ordered the directorate to submit a report by September 21. Sirsa appeared before the directorate to take a test in Gurmukhi on September 17. After the test, he had said that he had recited the Gurbani, but he refused to write because any inadvertent mistake would amount to sacrilege. The next hearing in the court is fixed for October 15. “I will challenge the orders in the high court. The director is working against my interests and that of my party,” said Sirsa responding to the order, adding that he holds a BA (Honours) degree in Punjabi. “The same directorate has cleared my nominations thrice in the past. Now, it says my knowledge of Gurmukhi is limited. This is unacceptable,” he added. According to the DSGMC Act, 46 elected members would meet on September 24 for the nomination of two members from among 350 Singh Sabha gurdwaras in the national capital that falls under the DSGMC’s jurisdiction. Other than that, four members from the clergy would also be nominated, taking the total strength of the house to 55. In the House, there is one member, who could be co-opted from the SGPC. After Sirsa’s disqualification the directorate has written to the SGPC to send a fresh name for co-option before September 24. Two members, SAD (Delhi) president Paramjit Singh Sarna, and Vikram Singh Rohini, belonging to the Badals-led SAD, were co-opted in the previous meeting on September 9, when Sirsa’s nomination was put on hold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sirsa-ineligible-for-co-option-into-dsgmc-says-directorate-of-gurdwara-elections-101632242714189.html

The other arrested persons were identified as Yadunath Rai, Vakil Paswan, Gautam Sahni and Salwa Devi, said Vaishali superintendent of police Maneesh.The accused woman was arrested on charges of destroying evidence, the official said. “On Manjhi’s instruction, she thew the girl’s bicycle and bag in a field. Police later recovered the victim’s belongings after interrogation of the arrested woman. A hunt is on for a sixth person,” the SP said.Meanwhile, Mahnar police lodged a case against 25 named and 200 unknown persons who blocked NH-322 and disrupted vehicular traffic for more than six hours on Saturday against alleged police inaction in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/minors-murder-in-bihar-s-vaishali-four-including-woman-arrested-101632242534207.html
21-09-2021||Patna||Bihar: BEd counselling to start from today; aspirants in a fix||Lalit Narayan Mithila University (LNMU), a nodal university for facilitating admission in BEd course across 14 state varsities, is set to begin the first-round counselling process from Wednesday, which will conclude on September 29. Thousands of students who are aspiring to take admission in BEd course are in a fix as they will get only one chance for participating in the counselling process.As per LMNU, more than 1.12 lakh aspirants qualified BEd Common Entrance Exam this year. Of them, over 73,000 candidates registered for taking admission across 350 BEd colleges in the state.Ashok Mehta, nodal state officer, said, “If any candidate decides not to take admission in the allotted college in the first round, they will not get another chance to participate in the second counselling. However, spot round counselling is open for all qualified candidates.”Earlier, BEd aspirants were free to participate in the multi-round counselling process and upgrade their college choice in the next counselling round as per the availability of vacant seats. An aspirant Prakash Kumar, who scored 92 in the common entrance exam, said, “I have been allotted a private college, which is situated 115km far from my house. It was my sixth college preference.”“Closing window for second-round counselling is unfair for meritorious students. I deserve a better college but it’s risky to leave the first chance. Spot admission is based on a first-come-first-serve policy, which may also lead to the backdoor entry of low scoring students in good colleges”, he added.Meanwhile, another section of students, who were allotted College of Teacher Education (CTE), Saharsa, are in distress as the college’s affiliation has been cancelled after the publication of the college allotment list on September 18. Mehta said, “Those who have been allotted CTE need not panic as we are trying to figure out a solution. Candidates will be informed of the future course of action through SMS.” LMNU has scheduled the second round of counselling from October 16 to October 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-bed-counselling-to-start-from-today-aspirants-in-a-fix-101632242234237.html
21-09-2021||Patna||Six held for Covid norm violation in May: Show cause notice issued to Samastipur SP||The subdivisional judicial magistrate, Dalsinghsarai, has issued a show cause notice to Samastipur superintendent of police (SP) to reply as to why a criminal contempt of court not be initiated against him in a case pertaining to the arrest of six persons by Ujiyarpur police station for alleged violation of Covid-19 protocol in May this year. In an order passed by additional chief judicial magistrate Vivek Vishal Monday, SP Manavjit Singh Dhillon has been asked to reply within 30 days of the receipt of the court order, while directing the inspector general of police, Darbhanga, to inquire into the SP’s conduct and take action against all police officers involved in the case and subsequent investigation. The Ujiyarpur police on May 25 lodged an FIR against six persons and arrested three of them the same day on charges of alleged violation of Covid-19 guidelines at a village haat under various sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC), Endemic Act, Disaster Management (DM) Act and Section 41 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which were not established by the prosecution so far. The remaining three accused were arrested June 7. The arrested persons were granted bail the next day of their production in court. The concerned court, however, observed that the police booked the persons under wrong and non-existent sections, and the responses of the police officers concerned was far from satisfactory. It said that the police applied Section 81 of the DM act, which is non-existent. It further clarified that the police had applied Section 56 of the DM Act in the FIR against the civilians, which is also wrong, as the section empowers the police to arrest government officials only. The court also disputed claims of the SP that the police was empowered to arrest anyone under Section 41 of the CrPC without an arrest warrant in this case. Citing the Supreme Court’s judgement in the Arnesh Kumar versus the state of Bihar case, the SDJM clarified that though the police had the power to arrest anyone indulging in any cognizable offence, they need to specify the grounds for the arrest in writing. The court also pointed out that Section 41 of CrPC would apply, as the arrest of three persons out of six was made 12 days after the alleged incident. Noting that the intent and conduct of the police in the case was improper, the court earlier asked the SP to submit the reply in the case for misuse of the power by the police, but the SP and the SDPO refused to comply. The SP also questioned the authority of the court when it asked him to be ready for contempt of court proceedings. The SDJM, in the aforementioned order, found tone and language of the SP objectionable in his belated reply to the court’s summon. “It appears that the SP Samastipur is either not aware how to submit reply to the court or knowingly trying to demean the authority of the court. This court considers that comparing with the SHO, the SP has intentionally demeaned the authority of the court,” read the judgement. Dhillon, when contacted, said that he would submit the reply to the court in an appropriate legal way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/six-held-for-covid-norm-violation-in-may-show-cause-notice-issued-to-samastipur-sp-101632242176143.html
21-09-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Ruling Cong hits street for 27% OBC reservation, BJP takes jibe||The ruling Congress, which is the second largest party in the Hemant Soren government after Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), held a a one-day sit-in protest across the state, demanding 27 percent reservation for other backward classes (OBCs) in Jharkhand. The OBCs currently get 14 percent quota in the state, and increasing it was an electoral promise of all mainstream parties in 2019, including the ruling alliance--JMM-Congress-Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)---in the current dispensation. The OBC wing of the Congress on Tuesday organised the protests in all district headquarters, while the main event was held near Raj Bhawan in the state capital, and attended by state leadership, including president Rajesh Thakur, ministers Banna Gupta and Badal Patralekh, legislators and other senior office bearers. When asked that why does the Congress have to hit the streets with the demand when its one of the ruling parties and whether it showed fissures in the ruling alliance, the party leaders said it showed the commitment of the party over the issue. “This protest was organised by the OBC wing of the party. We have been raising this issue at all levels, be it the government, Assembly and now even on the ground. Our in-charge had directed us to associate people who would be beneficiaries of it. Giving 27 percent reservation to the OBCs was a poll promise and we are committed to it and will get it done in this tenure. This protest would add to our resolve,” said Thakur.The main opposition Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), however, dubbed the event as an attempt by the ruling Congress to “fool people of the state” over the issue. “Whom are they protesting against? They are in the government and they can take a decision with one stroke of a pen. Instead of protesting on the street, they should immediately provide the promised 27 percent reservation to the OBCs,” said Jharkhand BJP president Deepak Prakash. Defending the protest, health minister Banna Gupta, who is the OBC face of the Congress in the Hemant Soren Cabinet, said the BJP should not be lecturing them on the issue.“If the BJP is so concerned about the OBCs, why doesn’t the Prime Minister announce increased reservation for them across the country? Why is the BJP opposing caste census? BJP had made Raghubar Das the chief minister for five years. Why didn’t they do anything on the issue then?,” questioned Gupta. Ruling out possibilities of any fissures in the alliance over the issue, JMM principal general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said the government is committed to fulfil the electoral promise.“Increased OBC reservation is a national issue for the Congress. As far as increasing it in state is concerned, the ruling alliance is committed to it and their is no difference of opinion. The CM said during the recently concluded Monsoon session that the government was working towards it and it would get reflected in the employment policy of the state,” said Bhattacharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-ruling-cong-hits-street-for-27-obc-reservation-bjp-takes-jibe-101632242174348.html
21-09-2021||Patna||Bihar CM inaugurates Mandar ropeway||Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday inaugurated the much-awaited ropeway at Mandar hills in Banka, developed by the state tourism for worth over ₹9 crore. The Mandar ropeway is the second such facility in Bihar. The travel length of the Mandar ropeway is 377.36 metres and it can cover the distance from the station at the base to the top of the hill within four minutes approximately. The airlift facility has eight cabins with the capacity of four persons at a time. After reaching the top of Mandar hill in the newly developed cabin ropeway, the CM said there had been a demand for a ropeway at Mandar hill for a long time. “It is over 700- metres high and atop the hill, there are many shrines. Pilgrims have been interested in visiting the temples. However, it’s difficult for senior citizens to travel that far. It used to take more than an hour to reach the top. I too couldn’t go there during my last visit to Banka,” he said. But now, as the ropeway has been developed, it will take hardly four minutes to reach there. It will draw more tourists to Mandar, he said. The chief minister said that considering the high flow of tourists, better tourism amenities have been planned at Mandar too. “The existing guest house for visitors would be expanded and the entire area from the base to the top of Mandar hill would have better light arrangements,” he said. Besides, a pathway would be developed too around Mandar hill for Parikrama. “Special care would be taken to keep intact the archaeological structures and antiquities available in the area,” he said. Kumar said that more ropeways have been planned at many other sites in the state. Deputy chief minister Tarkishor Prasad, also present at the site, said that Banka has a great religious and heritage value. The current government has been committed to develop the place and bring out its tourism potential. Sanjay Kumar Jha, the water resources minister, said the ropeway has enhanced the tourism facility at Mandar and it would woo more domestic and foreign tourists to the site.Meanwhile, chief minister Nitish Kumar also laid foundation stones of a biodiversity park planned near Mandar hill in Banka on Tuesday. Not just that, he also visited the Odhani dam over the Odhani river, a tributary of the Chandan River in Banka and directed the officials to develop tourist facilities at the Odhani dam reservoir and improve greenery around the lake. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-cm-inaugurates-mandar-ropeway-101632241994152.html

Over 200 policemen raided nine locations, including Patna, Bhojpur and Arwal districts and found DA worth ₹9.47 crore, besides other things, like land deeds, passbooks, bank lockers and investment-related papers, till the time of filing of this report. “The investigation is on and more details will be available soon,” said an official.ADG (EOU) N H Khan said, “Based on the information, our officials raided his houses and found properties disproportionate to his known source of income. A case of DA has been lodged under Sections 13(1) and 13(2) of the Disproportionate Assets Act, 1988, against eight persons, including Dhiraj and his brothers Surendra Kumar Singh, Shashi Bhusan Singh, Shyam Bihari Singh, Birendra Singh, Bijendra Kumar Bimal, Ashok Kumar and nephew Dharmendra Kumar.”The EOU unearthed four residential plots, an agriculture plot and a five-storey building owned by Bijendra and 10 residential-agriculture plots, besides four and five-storey buildings owned by Surendra in Bhojpur. Shyam Bihari owns a mall-cum-residential building.As per the officials, the preliminary probe suggested that Dhiraj and his associates bought these properties with ill-gotten money.Narendra joined services on May 13, 1988, and earned about ₹1.5 crore as salary during his 33 years and two months of the service period. The Vigilance Investigation Bureau (VIB) suspects that the constable and his family have hidden a huge amount outside the state.“When people are finding it difficult to buy even a single car, this constable, currently attached with Patna police, managed to buy 20,” said a senior officer, while alleging that he earned this much money by misusing his official position.Apart from the vehicles and other assets, Dhiraj, who turned out to be a crorepati, owns a two-storied building at Mahavir Colony under Beur police station in Patna worth crores and another building at his ancestral village in Muzaffarpur under Sahar police station of Bhojpur district.During the investigation, the EOU found that Dhiraj’s family had only four-bigha ancestral land before he joined the police force, an official said. Meanwhile, no action has been taken so far against the accused policeman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/eou-raids-premises-of-millionaire-bihar-cop-101632241935805.html
21-09-2021||Patna||Eight Covid positive samples in RAD test negative on RT PCR in Bihar’s Madhubani||Madhubani’s district authorities heaved a sigh of relief after eight of the 25 swab samples, positive on the rapid antigen detection (RAD) kits, tested negative on the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a confirmatory test for Covid-19 Tuesday evening, said health officials. Results of 17 samples are awaited. The district authorities had sent 25 swab samples for confirmatory RT-PCR tests to the Madhubani Medical College on Monday and Tuesday, after 76 samples had tested Covid-19 positive in the RAD tests, conducted among passengers at the Madhubani railway station over the last four days, raising alarm among district health officials. As many as 22 passengers of the 76 found positive on RAD kit since September 17 were not traceable, said officials. Most had come by train from New Delhi and Mumbai. “Some have given us incorrect mobile number and address. While some mobile numbers belong to people of other districts, most others are either unreachable or switched off. This has made it difficult for us to locate them,” said health officials. The district authorities had reasons to believe that the RAD kit results were false positive after around 12 passengers tested negative during a re-test on the RAD kit at their village in Babu Barhi, Harlakhi, Raj Nagar, Madhepur and Benipatti, said an official. “The sensitivity of RAD kit depends on many factors, the temperature being one. We are getting all the samples re-checked on RT-PCR,” said Dr Sunil Kumar Jha, Madhubani’s civil surgeon. The Bihar Medical Services Infrastructure Corporation Limited, which purchased the RAD kits, has been asked to check them. “The sudden rise in cases, the asymptomatic nature of patients, epidemiological references that false-positive cases go up when the prevalence of a disease goes down, some passengers testing negative during a re-check on RAD kit at their village, as also the fact that no other passenger at any railway station earlier en route Madhubani from New Delhi or Mumbai reported positive, had raised suspicion that these may be false-positive cases,” said Dr Jha. The district has been testing average daily 1600-1800 samples, the results of which were negative for the past few days, said Madhubani civil surgeon. Meanwhile, the district authorities have allowed all Covid-19 suspects to be under home isolation till the results of RT-PCR tests allow for some conclusion on their status. “Our healthcare workers are checking on them on a daily basis to see if their condition deteriorates. We are also pressing on them to opt for institutional isolation. Around 800 beds at Covid care centres, available in our district, are vacant,” added Dr Jha. The Covid-19 bulletin, released by the health department on Monday, reported only seven new cases in the state. Of them, two were from Gopalganj and one each from Patna, Madhubani, Bhojpur, Purnia and Katihar. Madhubani reported only 14 active cases out of the total 18,359 cases and 338 deaths there so far. Bihar has reported 725,901 cases and 9,659 deaths since March 21, 2020, when the first Covid-19 case was reported in the state. Patna, with 146,942 cases and 2,334 deaths, was the worst affected. As many as 716,173 patients have recovered so far, adding to the state’s case recovery rate of 98.65%. The number of active cases in the state has come down to 68.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/eight-covid-positive-samples-in-rad-test-negative-on-rt-pcr-in-bihar-s-madhubani-101632241934008.html
21-09-2021||Mumbai||Removal of caps on airfare, increasing capacity in flights to 85% positive move, say travel experts||After the aviation ministry recently increased the seating capacity in domestic flights to 85%, travel demand has picked up. According to airlines and industry experts, increasing the seating capacity will keep increasing due to the upcoming festive season. Moreover, with the airfare cap being removed and travellers starting to fly more, airlines expect the air traffic to be back to pre-Covid levels by the end of this year.“We expect domestic air travel to reach pre-pandemic level by December 2021,” a spokesperson for IndiGo, India’s largest airline by market share, said.Another important factor, according to industry experts, is that with Canada and the US easing their travel restrictions for Indians, the international market is gradually opening up which will increase the passenger numbers.“We urge the government to allow more bubble flights with fewer travel restrictions to more and more countries. As an industry, our objective should be to be at full scheduled service by summer for all international destinations. It will require a lot of heavy lifting by the government to get us there,” IndiGo said.Capacity caps increasing to 85%, the highest ever in the last seventeen months, will allow more people to travel.“The move will enable airlines to operate more flights and will push up passenger loads significantly. In addition to providing more options on the existing routes, it will also open up more domestic routes. We forecast bookings to increase by over 25% by the end of September 2021. The trend will only be upward moving thereon. Bookings were already on the rise, as per our data, even before the new guidelines kicked in,” said Gaurav Bhatia, executive director, Bird Group- that owns Amadeus (a software for tickets reservation and distribution program) in India.“Changes in fare fixing mechanisms will bring much-needed cheer for the airlines. Cheaper fares will be on offer for flyers, a move that will stimulate the market and strengthen revenue management cycles,” he added.Appreciating the government, IndiGo said that it is pleased with the recent decision of the government to allow airlines to operate with 85% capacity. “The demand has certainly picked up and we are expecting it to strengthen further in the upcoming festive season. We are bullish about the overall growth and demand for domestic travel and increasing the cap to 85% is a welcome move,” said the IndiGo spokesperson.There has been an uptick in passenger growth in the last few months and business travel has also started to slowly inch up, reiterated rating agency- CRISIL. However, according to CRISIL, air traffic in the domestic sector will not be back to pre-Covid levels before March 2022. “With private offices opening up, many of the employees are slowly returning to their base location. While these are the positives, we are still at least two quarters away from getting back to pre-Covid levels in the domestic route. Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, director- transport and logistics, Crisil Infrastructure Advisory said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/removal-of-caps-on-airfare-increasing-capacity-in-flights-to-85-positive-move-say-travel-experts-101632241873989.html
21-09-2021||Mumbai||Koshyari, Thackeray locked in letter war over Sakinaka rape case||Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) are engaged in a letter tussle over the Sakinaka rape and death case with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray telling Koshyari his move to join the opposition in demanding a special session of the state legislature to discuss the incident is “lethal for parliamentary democracy”. Earlier this week, Koshyari had requested Thackeray in a letter to consider the demand of BJP’s women legislators for a special session to discuss the issue of women security, against the backdrop of the Sakinaka case. In response, Thackeray wrote back to Koshyari, saying that since violence against women was a national issue, the latter should request Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to call a four-day special session of the Parliament to discuss the same. A week ago, a delegation of BJP women legislators met Koshyari and urged him to direct the state government to convene a two-day special session of the state legislature to discuss violence against women. Following this, Koshyari wrote a letter to the chief minister and said that he could consider the demand.Thackeray responded with a strongly-worded four-page letter and referred to the cases of rape and murder of women in BJP-ruled states such as Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir (a Union territory) and said that the issue was not only limited to Sakinaka. In the letter sent to Koshyari on Monday, Thackeray also pointed out that the government and Mumbai Police acted swiftly in the case and the culprits were arrested soon after the incident. “As the governor you have expressed concern over violence against women in the backdrop of Sakinaka case. We are also concerned about the same. But the matter is not limited only to Sakinaka, in fact it is a nationwide problem and hence the entire women community is looking at you with big hope. Thus, I want you to demand from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to call a four-day special session of the Parliament to discuss it in detail. Sakinaka case can also be discussed during the same session,” stated Thackeray in his letter.“In the Delhi incident, not only the culprits killed the victim, they even burnt her body. The incident happened in the national capital where entire union ministry sits,” Thackeray wrote in the letter. He also pointed out that Mumbai Police had acted swiftly and arrested the suspects in no time. “I have directed that the case will be tried in a fast track court. I have also strictly directed the police to give utmost priority to women security and take all the necessary steps…Government is doing its job hence your directive to convene a special session to discuss the issue can create a new controversy. Honorable Governor’s support to the demand made by those who are against the government can be lethal for parliamentary democracy,” he added.Koshyari and the MVA have been locked in a bitter tussle for quite some time. Last year, Koshyari wrote to the chief minister about reopening places of worship in the state amid the raging Covid-19 pandemic outbreak and asked if Thackeray, who is also the president of the ruling Shiv Sena, had “suddenly turned secular”. Thackeray also reminded the governor that secularism was one of tenets of the Constitution that he swore upon while taking oath as Maharashtra governor.The governor is yet to clear the 12 names approved by the state cabinet in November last year to be appointed as the members of the legislative council. Every six years, 12 members are nominated to the upper house of the state legislature by the governor on the recommendation of the state government.Koshyari was a senior BJP leader before his appointment as governor. He was also chief minister of Uttarakhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/koshyari-thackeray-locked-in-letter-war-over-sakinaka-rape-case-101632240974043.html

21-09-2021||Mumbai||PIL in high court objects to Mumbai Metro 2B overground line near Juhu airport||The Bombay high court (HC) has held that it will be hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) which has challenged the construction of the Metro 2B line passing through SV Road near the Juhu airport. The PIL alleges that the Metro line violates the funnel area stipulations of the airport and will endanger the lives of civilians and flight passengers permanently. The PIL has contended that the no-objection certificate (NOC) granted by the authorities did not take into consideration the potential threat the overground Metro line will pose and hence seeks orders against the same. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing the public interest litigation filed by Harit Desai, a social worker and a resident of the Juhu Vile Parle Development Scheme (JVPD) through advocate Nishant Thakkar. The bench was informed that the petition challenged the NOC issued by the Airports Authority of India to the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA) in 2017 for constructing the overground Metro 2B line. Thakkar submitted that while the elevation for the funnel area for landing and take-off of flights at runway 26 and 8 of the Juhu airport was 3.89 meters above mean sea level, the NOC permitted MMRDA to construct the metro line in the funnel zone which would not only be a permanent hazard to the operation of aircraft but would also endanger the lives of those in the aircraft as well as civilians residing and travelling in the vicinity. In light of these submissions, Thakkar submitted that the NOC was violative and contrary to the Civil Aviation (Height Restrictions for the Safeguarding of Aircraft Operations) Rules, 2015 and hence sought to quash the original NOC as well as subsequent NOCs issued in 2018 and 2019. The MMRDA represented by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni and advocate Akshay Shinde however submitted that the petitioner had not exhausted the remedy of approaching the appellate committee and hence the court should not intervene in the PIL. However, Thakkar responded stating that the appellate committee comprised of two members who were responsible for issuing the NOC hence the only option was to approach the HC. Advocate Sandeep Marne along with advocate Arsh Mishra for the AAI however submitted that in light of the contention of the petitioner that a member of the committee had been involved in issuing the NOC it was not opposing the PIL. After hearing the submissions the court held, “Since an important public project is involved and the petitioners propose to oppose it on the grounds urged in the writ petition, we expedite its hearing. Let reply affidavits be filed by the respondents by a week from date; rejoinder affidavits thereto, if any, may be filed by 5 (five) days thereafter,” and posted hearing of the PIL to October 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pil-in-high-court-objects-to-mumbai-metro-2b-overground-line-near-juhu-airport-101632239833831.html
21-09-2021||Chandigarh||Dalit women seek implementation of Land Ceiling Act in Punjab||A day after Charanjit Singh Channi took oath as the first Dalit chief minister of Punjab, hundreds of women from the scheduled castes community sought implementation of the Land Ceiling Act in the state during a protest in Sangrur on Tuesday. The Dalit women, under the banner of Zameen Prapti Sangharsh Committee (ZPSC), assembled on the Dhuri road and marched to the district administration complex, raising slogans in favour of land distribution.ZPSC zonal secretary Paramjit Kaur Longowal said that two land reform laws were introduced in Punjab in 1952 and 1972, but Dalits, who comprise 33% of the state population, got only 1.5-2% of the land. A large part of the land went to upper-caste rich landlords, who are still purchasing land from small farmers, he said.Longowal said that as per the Land Ceiling Act, one family could own only 17 acres, and the excess land should be redistributed.“The landless Dalits are facing caste oppression in villages. Only equal distribution of land can bring equality to Dalits in society. Dalit women are the biggest victims of caste oppression and economic oppression,” she said.Raj Kaur, one of the protesters, said government institutes were denying loans to landless Dalits, who end up taking money from private lenders at high interest.ZPSC state chief Mukesh Malaudh said: “Just a CM face will not change the fate of Dalits. Channi promised free water and electricity like Amarinder Singh and Badals but did not touch the issue of land in his first press meet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dalit-women-seek-implementation-of-land-ceiling-act-in-punjab-101632239593917.html
21-09-2021||Mumbai||Isolated heavy rain likely in Mumbai on Wednesday: IMD||The monsoon made a comeback in the city this week, with an overcast sky, strong winds and widespread rain (along with isolated heavy showers) being observed across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) on Tuesday evening. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said that isolated heavy showers are likely to continue on Wednesday, placing Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts under a ‘yellow category’ storm warning alert.Though the day started off without much rain (the IMD’s monitoring station in Santacruz received 6.6mm of rain during the night), the intensity of showers picked up for a short while in the afternoon, with Santacruz receiving 37.2mm of rain in the nine hours ending 5:30pm Tuesday. Several other monitoring locations in the city and suburbs, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli, too saw between 20mm to 40mm of rain in a three-hour period on Tuesday afternoon.According to a spokesperson with the IMD’s regional centre in Mumbai, widespread light to moderate rains will continue for the next two days in intermittent spells and will subside thereafter. A low-pressure area is expected to pass over the Bay of Bengal sometime early next week, and rainfall activity will regain intensity around then, IMD said.In September thus far, the city has recorded a total of 536mm of rain in 21 days, as against the normal of 229.7mm. Since June 1 this year, 2,958mm of rain has exceeded the seasonal normal by 849.6mm. Officials at the IMD said it is very likely that seasonal rains may cross the 3,000mm mark by the end of September, particularly as the expected late withdrawal of the monsoon this year will sustain more light to moderate showers before the month is over. Between June and September last year, the city had recorded a total 3,687mm of rain, stopping just 70mm short of 2020 being the wettest monsoon on record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/isolated-heavy-rain-likely-in-mumbai-on-wednesday-imd-101632239473680.html

21-09-2021||Mumbai||Fear of stigma forces Covid caregivers to hide identities: ICMR study||Apart from battling the novel coronavirus, healthcare workers (HCWs) attending to patients are facing another challenge – stigma. This often forces the caregivers to hide their identity in order ‘to prevent any social harassment’. This has been revealed in a pan-India study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) across 10 cities. The study has also revealed various other reasons that are affecting the mental health of the HCWs.The ICMR has conducted the study of 967 participants from the 10 cities —Bhubaneswar (Odisha), Mumbai (Maharashtra), Ahmedabad (Gujarat), Noida (Uttar Pradesh), south Delhi, Pathanamthitta (Kerala), Kasaragod (Kerala), Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh), Kamrup (Assam) and East Khasi Hills (Meghalaya). Among the respondents, 56% were females, while 46% were males who were primarily in the age group between 20 and 40 years (84%).Stigmatisation of HCWsTill August 28, around 87,000 HCWs in India have been infected with Covid-19 on their line of duty. Six states—Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, West Bengal and Gujarat recorded almost 74% of the total cases. In Maharashtra, around 158,000 HCWs were tested for Covid-19, of which, around 24,500 were identified with novel coronavirus— the highest in India, as per the data from the Union health ministry.Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the overwhelmed HCWs have been working round the clock in taking care of the patients and vaccination. Despite this, in repeated instances, they are being subjected to stigmatisation and harassment.Citing a particular instance, the study has published an interview of a 55-year-old male ambulance driver who was responsible for ferrying patients to hospitals. Sharing his experience, he said, “When people see me, they say “here comes Corona!.” They (neighbours) would close their doors and windows if they saw me coming from a distance. At marketplaces, people cover their faces when they see me. They would cross me or supersede me very fast by accelerating their vehicles. Even my relatives walk away when they see me and do not want to be face to face with me. There seems to be so much hatred in their minds.”This is not the only instance where HCWs in service for Covid-19 patients were humiliated. In April 2020, HT reported how a marriage proposal for Dr Reshma Shinde, a resident doctor in pathology department at King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Parel did not work out as she was stationed in the Covid-19 ward.The study has found out that the neighbours, friends and relatives of the HCWs made them feel they were the spreaders of the infection and avoided them, made hurtful remarks and also showed reluctance to interact with them. “Some HCWs reported that they also had to conceal their identities to prevent any social harassment as captured in the statement below. There were also some who reported stigma from their own families,” reads the study. “This attitude was mainly because they were considered as vectors for transmission of the virus and not perceived as those whose primary service was to prevent infection and help those infected,” it further reads.Dr Beena E Thomas from the department of social and behavioural research, National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, Chennai who is the main correspondent of the study said that there is a need to sensitise the public. “The stigmatisation adds to the mental health of the already exhausted and burn out HCWs. More focus should be paid on educating people,” she added.HCWs need a psychological support systemHCWs are already suffering from burnout. As HT reported earlier, many of them are taking psychiatric help to deal with the trauma in Mumbai. National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) conducted a survey among 3,083 HCWs across India. They published their findings in April in the Asian Journal of Psychiatry, which revealed that 26.6% and 23.8% of the respondents had anxiety and depression respectively.Against this backdrop, ICMR conducted his study to find out the main reasons for the mental health crisis among the HCWs and make recommendations to the central government.“I am not able to take care of my two-year-old baby and leaving her was difficult for me. My kids are angry with me, and now whenever I call my daughter, she does not talk to me. They are angry because I have to leave them again and again. My elder daughter is studying in Class 9, and as a mother, I should provide her more time in this growing up stage and I should help her with her studies, but I am unable to provide time for her. I am unable to provide them good food in these growing up years and I am unable to take care of them,” a 43-year-old nurse was quoted in the study.Along with the pressure of separation from the family, the researchers also found out that the excessive workload, erratic working hours, challenges of working personal protective equipment (PPE) for hours, fear of infection, sleep deprivation, disruption in eating habits are also contributing to the mental trauma of the HCWs.“Recent reports indicate that health personnel struggled with higher workloads and a swiftly changing workspace milieu that differed greatly from the familiar day-to-day reality while dealing with the social changes and emotional stressors of Covid-19. The longer working hours with erratic timings reported in the present study resulted in sleep deprivation as well as unhealthy eating patterns, which could have long-term consequences,” reads the study.In fact, the researchers have found out that female caregivers are more affected than male counterparts as along with workload, they also have the responsibility at home. “As the triple burden of being caregivers in the hospital, at home and balancing these dual roles which took a toll on their mental well-being…(sic),” reads the study.ICMR has suggested improving the working environment for HCWs, allowing them breathing space, filling the staff crunch and providing them more time with facilities.“There is a need for a more holistic approach by focusing on community engagement and support groups in each organisational structure,” said Dr Thomas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fear-of-stigma-forces-covid-caregivers-to-hide-identities-icmr-study-101632239293902.html

The court also took into consideration that the investigation is completed and there is no possibility of the accused tampering with the evidence.The court granted bail to Kundra, who was arrested in July by the Mumbai crime branch along with his Information Technology (IT) head Ryan Thorpe, on a surety of ₹50,000 each on Monday.Additional chief metropolitan magistrate, Sudhir B Bhajipale further observed that the crime branch has filed a 4,000 pages charge sheet that has 64 witnesses. The investigation officer has taken care of recording statements of witnesses under section 164 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The server, laptops, and mobiles of Viaan Industries are already in the custody of the investigating officer. In such circumstances, it cannot be said that there is a possibility of tampering with the evidence.The court said if statements of witnesses were perused, then the element of inducement which is a prime ingredient of cheating appears to be missing from the case of the prosecution.All the accused in the case are on bail and in such circumstances, only on the grounds that further investigation is in progress, the accused cannot be kept behind bars till the conclusion of the trial. The offences nowhere provide punishment for more than seven years.It is better to mention here that the trial will take its own time and in such circumstances, it will be not proper to keep the accused in custody when they are ready to furnish surety for their appearance and to abide by the conditions imposed by the court, the court added.The agency has already seized my computer, DVD’s, CDs from my office and nothing is left for further investigations or for my further custody. The investigation is complete, there is no chance of tampering with evidence or threatening witnesses as statements have already been recorded before the magistrate, the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/porn-films-case-element-of-inducement-missing-from-case-against-raj-kundra-says-magistrate-101632239173887.html

Other team members were Sumeet Mandale, Vivek Shivade and Pawan Hadole along with Sherpa Mingam and Nim Dorje.The team reached base camp on September 11, however, a difficult climatic condition did not allow them to move ahead till September 15.“On September 17 we started summit push from camp 2 and the next day we conquered the peak. It was a very challenging peak technically. From base to camp 1 it was more challenging than from camp 1 to 2 it was a little easy. Summit push was challenging (last 1,000 metres) as it has one vertical wall, rock climbing and Ice climbing and a steep climb of 70 to 80 degrees,” said Shivade.The climbers also did route opening and rope fixing along with Sherpas.“Handling the tough weather conditions was the biggest challenge. Before Mt Manda-1, I had climbed three mountains but this was the toughest,” said HadoleZirpe, was a part of two unsuccessful attempts on Mt. Manda-1 in 1989 and 1991.“We had to abandon our attempt due to a shortage of equipment in 1991. Proper management of not only equipment but also of all the resources for the expedition with excess adequate quantity and implementation of our plan with all safety is very important,” said Zirpe, a veteran mountaineer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-giripremi-mountaineers-scale-mt-manda-1-101632239008178.html

21-09-2021||Pune||Reduce highway accidents, formulate action plan: Satej Patil to authorities||PUNE A review meeting was held earlier last week to help reduce the number of accidents on national highways passing through western Maharashtra after a survey by the Save Life Foundation (SLF) found that 1.35 million people die in road crashes across the globe out of which 150,000 are in India alone and that more than 30 children die in road accidents every day in India.The virtual meeting was attended by the minister of state for IT and home Satej Patil; divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao; transport commissioner Dr Avinash Dhakne; special inspector general of police Manoj Lohia; district collectors of Pune, Sangli, Satara and Kolhapur; superintendents of police; highway police force officers; and founder-president of SLF Piyush Tiwari. Based on the SLF survey report, Patil instructed the Pune, Sangli, Satara and Kolhapur police chiefs to immediately start patrolling the national highways by constituting dedicated, 24x7 patrolling vehicles and teams for each highway. He also directed that the IT-based infrastructure on the national highways be made more efficient.Among others, the SLF survey revealed that the Pune to Satara highway saw 292 rear-end collisions out of which 95 were fatal; 102 pedestrian accidents in which 34 pedestrians lost their lives; 86 object-related accidents which saw 34 fatalities; 116 self-rollovers or falls which saw 10 fatalities; 48 head-on collisions in which nine people were killed; and 14 other accidents which saw two fatalities.On the Satara to Kagal highway, 360 rear-end collisions were reported which saw 106 fatalities; 251 self-rollovers/falls in which 55 people died; 156 pedestrian accidents in which 44 pedestrians lost their lives; 31 object-related accidents in which 12 people died; 18 head-on collisions which saw 14 fatalities; 52 other accidents with 28 fatalities; and 35 unknown accidents with five fatalities.Twenty-five and 62 incidents of wrong side driving during the day and night were reported on the Pune to Satara and Satara to Kagal highways, respectively. One-hundred-and-nine and 205 incidents of wrong lane usage were reported on the Pune to Satara and Satara to Kagal highways, respectively. Three and 40 incidents of overtaking from the left were reported on the Pune to Satara and Satara to Kagal highways, respectively. One-hundred-and-forty five and 99 incidents of illegal parking were reported on the Pune to Satara and Satara to Kagal highways, respectively. One-hundred-and-three and 160 two-wheeler riders were found riding without helmets on the Pune to Satara and Satara to Kagal highways, respectively.The survey revealed that as many as 125 people have been killed in road accidents on the Pune to Satara and Satara to Kagal highways in the year 2019-20 due to various reasons. The accidents have been caused due to speeding, not wearing seat belts, not wearing helmets, sudden change of lanes, indicators, headlights not being in good condition and so on.The meeting took cognisance of all these matters with SLF suggesting high impact and scaleable solutions to reduce the fatalities and accidents on highways. “Immediate measures need to be taken from re-engineering of roads, bridging gaps between accidents and their treatment with urgent trauma care to engaging motorists and the general public to change behaviours and upgrading national policies that promote safe driving behaviours among people. By working both on the ground and at the system level, we are addressing the problem from the bottom-up and top-down to completely and decisively resolve this public health issue,” the SLF report stated. Earlier, implementation of the zero fatality corridor helped authorities and the SLF to reduce road fatalities by 52% on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway over four years; 54% on NH48 over one year; and 100% at Delhi’s Bhalswa chowk black spot in less than one year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/reduce-highway-accidents-formulate-action-plan-satej-patil-to-authorities-101632238033783.html
21-09-2021||Bhopal||Exhibition of rare ancient coins at Bhopal's State Museum attracts people||Rare ancient coins dating back from the seventh century BC to medieval times are on display in the exhibition hall of the State Museum here.Named the 'The Heritage of Coins', the exhibition will continue till Wednesday.The collection of these rare coins organised by Dr Vishnu Shridhar Wakankar Archaeological Research Institute under the aegis of Directorate Archaeological Archives and Museum, belongs to Dr RC Thakur at Ashwini Shodh Sansthan, Mahidpur, District Ujjain. The exhibition can be viewed free of charge from 11 am to 5 pm. BK Lokhande, former president of the state museum, said that the coins displayed in this exhibition give information about a long period of history and coins of different metals prevalent in it.These coins are of precious metals like gold, silver, zinc, copper etc. These coins give information that there was a technique of minting coins and stamping their emblem on them about 2,700 years ago. This is an indicator of the advancement of science in those times. According to Lokhande, the circulation of coins started in our country from the time of 16 districts. These coins put barter out of circulation.It is noteworthy that currency (coins) have a special place in the cultural history of India. Initially, the common people used the cow for barter. But due to the difficulty in the division of the unit of currency, pieces of metal were used as currency.Coins began in circulation around 800 BC, indicating a systematic history of currency. Coins of metals like copper, silver, gold, zinc, lead etc. were issued. This exhibition of rare coins is useful and informative for students, archaeology enthusiasts and the general public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/exhibition-of-rare-ancient-coins-at-bhopal-s-state-museum-attracts-people-101632233372567.html
21-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai court acquits late gangster Amar Naik’s kin of kidnapping, extortion charges||A sessions court on Tuesday acquitted Ashwin Naik – brother of late gangster Amar Naik – and his seven aides who were booked for in a 2015 abduction and extortion case under the stringent provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) and the Arms Act. The other acquitted accused have been identified as Pramod Keluskar, Prathamesh Parab, Janardhan Sakpal, Rajesh Tambe, Avinash Khedekar, Milind Parab and Suraj Govardhan.As per the prosecution’s case, in December 2015, Naik through his seven aides had kidnapped a Dadar-based builder, who was constructing a structure in the central suburbs. The builder was kidnapped at gun point and taken to Naik’s office in Subhash Nagar on NM Joshi Marg, the prosecution claimed. Naik had allegedly threatened the builder and demanded ₹50 lakh as well as 6,000-square-feet flat from him.The builder managed to escape from their custody after he requested that he needed some time to think. He then approached Dadar police, which registered a case under sections 364 (a) (abduction), 384 (punishment for extortion), 387 (putting person in fear of death or of grievous injury in order to commit extortion), 34 (common intention) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. In addition, the police had also applied sections of the Arms Act and later also invoked MCOCA in the case.The builder then agreed to meet Naik to hand over the money. Naik, who is paralysed waist down, waited for him in a car. When he accepted the bag containing cash worth ₹50 lakh, the police detained him, the prosecution alleged. Later, his alleged aides were also picked up from the spot. Naik’s advocates argued that there was hardly any evidence against him and most of the witnesses had turned hostile and that the accused had been framed in the case.After hearing the arguments, sessions judge RR Bhosale acquitted the eight accused.Naik has been acquitted in 16 other cases related to murder and extortion. One of the cases was pertaining to his wife’s murder. He was alleged to have hatched the conspiracy to kill his wife Nita when he was in Delhi’s Tihar Jail. Nita was shot dead outside their house in Chinchpokli on November 13, 2000, despite being under police protection. In 2009, a special MCOCA court had acquitted him in the case.Naik, a London-educated electronic engineer, had taken over the gang run by his Amar, after his brother was gunned down by the police in an encounter in the 1990s.In 1994, rival gang members had shot at Naik in the Mumbai sessions court premises, following which he had become wheelchair-bound.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-acquits-late-gangster-amar-naik-s-kin-of-kidnapping-extortion-charges-101632237553896.html
21-09-2021||Mumbai||BMC begins prep for February 2022 polls||To prepare for the upcoming civic polls in February 2022, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started the process of verification for delimitation (redrawing) of boundaries of the 24 administrative wards. Post this, the BMC will submit the list to the state election commission for suggestions and objections. The BMC is also expected to increase the number of booths in view of Covid-19 to ensure social distancing while conducting voting. The BMC currently has 227 corporators who are elected representatives across 24 administrative wards formed on the basis of the census conducted in 2011. The census for 2021 was delayed amid the pandemic. Delimitation is undertaken to ensure that all electoral wards largely have the same amount of population. The state election commission had last month given permission to several municipal corporations including Mumbai civic body to go ahead with the delimitation process. Vishwas Mote, from the BMC’s election department, said, “Preliminary preparations are going as per the directions of the state election commission.” According to BMC officials, post verification, the data will be sent to the state election commission which will later call for public suggestions and objections. The process is being done considering the pattern of migration of citizens, development, redevelopment in wards of the city, and the data is expected to be ready by mid- October. After the suggestions and objections, the BMC will also conduct a lottery for reservation of the administrative wards to determine the reservation of the ward. For example, R North ward in north Mumbai was reserved for women. Of the total 227, a total of 50% of the seats are reserved for women candidates. From the 50%, there is a parallel reservation in the scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and OBC category. A BMC official said, “From 7,000 polling booths, we plan to increase them to 10,000.” Suresh Kakani, Additional Municipal Commissioner of the BMC, said, “As per the instructions of the state election commission, we have started initial preparation to understand whether delimitation will be required or not. However, this time we will have to increase the number of polling booths keeping Covid-19 into consideration.”The term of the current elected representatives ends on March 7, 2022, and the elections are expected to take place in February 2022. The Shiv Sena has 97 seats, BJP 83, Congress 29, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) 8, Samajwadi Party (SP) 6, AIMIM 2 and MNS 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-begins-prep-for-february-2022-polls-101632237373615.html
21-09-2021||Pune||Maval farmers oppose 30m-wide service road to Pune-Mumbai e-way||PUNE Farmers and locals in the Maval tehsil have raised objections against the 30-meter proposed service road to Pune- Mumbai expressway in the newly published draft development plan (DP) by the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA).They have demanded to accommodate the service road in the acquired land for the expressway and also to reduce the width of the service road.Locals claimed that this is the fourth time their lands would have to be given up for a developmental project and the same set of landowners are getting affected in these projects.“We gave up land for the expressway and then for the closed water pipeline project. Hyperloop project is also proposed from the area and now PMRDA’s service road. Soon farmers in the area would be left with no land and without any prospect of employment. We have registered our objections against the proposal by PMRDA and have given our suggestions,” said Subhash Dhamankar, a resident of Urse village in Maval tehsil.September 16, was the last day of submitting the suggestions/ objections on the PMRDA’s draft DP.Locals from Maval are hoping that the objections would be considered and suitable changes would be made.“It would be better if the width of the service road would be reduced to 12 metres. Also, the proposed service road should be constructed on the already acquired land my Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) for the expressway. It would save agricultural lands and employments of the locals,” said Vikas Shelar, resident of Urse Village.“We had been demanding the service road but only from the acquired land for the expressway. Also, once the service road is constructed, there would be no development zone around it. So collectively, a huge piece of land would be wasted in that,” he said.Some locals pointed out that though they had to give up their land, the compensation was not enough and locals are not given priority in the employment opportunities created after the completion of the projects.“After the expressway was completed food malls, rest houses were constructed on its side. But the operators of these facilities are not locals. Local youth are neglected,” said Gulab Ghare, resident of Ozarde village.“Locals have lost their lives earlier in the struggle to save their lands. The administration should take us into confidence and listen to our grievances,” he said.PMRDA commissioner Suhas Divase was now available for comments immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maval-farmers-oppose-30m-wide-service-road-to-pune-mumbai-eway-101632236953572.html

The search was launched in Indian territory falling under the Dharma Border Outpost (BoP), but nothing suspicious was found. This is the third incident of suspected drone entry into the Indian territory in Tarn Taran district in three days. On the night of Saturday and Sunday, two similar incidents were reported near BoP Karnail Singh Wala near Khalra. In that instance, BSF had even opened fire. The area falls under the 103-Battalion. In July, the troops of this battalion had gunned down two Pakistani nationals, who were trying to sneak into the Indian territory near Khalra. In February, the battalion personnel had shot dead a Pakistani smuggler and recovered 14-kg of heroin. A BSF official said, “Nobody saw any drone, but we heard sounds similar to it. A search of the area was carried out on Tuesday morning, but nothing suspicious was found. We are yet to confirm if the sound was of a Pakistani drone.”On September 15, Punjab Police had claimed to have busted an Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI-backed) terrorist module with the arrest of four people. The accused had tried to blow up an oil tanker near Ajnala by using an Improvised Explosive Device (IED). Punjab Police believe that the IED was dropped by a drone from Pakistan. Khalra station house officer Jaswant Singh said, “We got a call informing us that a sound of a flying drone was heard in the area. We launched a hunt, but did not find anything.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/drone-heard-along-indo-pak-border-search-operation-finds-nothing-101632235813489.html

21-09-2021||Mumbai||Khwaja Yunus case: Court raps Maharashtra govt, CID, for failing to appoint spl prosecutor||The sessions court on Tuesday rapped the state crime investigation department (CID) and the state government for their apathetic approach in appointing a special public prosecutor for the trial in Khwaja Yunus custodial death case. “The approach of the investigating agency has been lackadaisical in such a serious offence like custodial death case,” observed the court. The trial against four policemen including suspended cop Sachin Vaze, implicated in the case, a 2002 Ghatkopar blast accused, has been held up since 2018, shortly after it began, for the want of a special public prosecutor.“As I have observed on past two dates, there is a delay at the instance of the prosecution to proceed with the case. The record reveals that despite repeated notices and letters to the police officers as well as the prosecution, no concrete steps are taken,” said additional sessions judge Dr UJ More.Deputy superintendent of police (SP) Irfan Shaikh from state CID informed the court that the appointment has been approved by the additional chief secretary, home. The file, however, is now pending with the law and judiciary department.“We don’t want you to just follow up and write letters or take concrete steps for a speedy trial. The last judge has observed that he was incapacitated before the agency,” the court asked.Advocate Chetan Mali who represented Asiya Begum, mother of the victim - Khwaja Yunus, informed the court that a petition regarding the removal of Dhiraj Mirajkar as the special public prosecutor of the case is pending before the Bombay high court and is likely to be heard on Wednesday. A special leave petition has been filed in the Supreme Court regarding the sanctions to prosecute some more police officers in the case, he added.The state through assistant public prosecutor has made a statement in the high court, that it won’t appoint anybody as a special public prosecutor in the case till the Bombay High Petition is decided, Mali said, adding that, they want Mirajkar to continue as special public prosecutor.Vaze’s counsel told the court he was admitted at Wockhardt Hospital and had undergone bypass surgery.The court asked the counsel for Yunus’s mother to file a status report by the next date about the pending matters before various courts and also asked the state CID to update it in the matter of appointment of special public prosecutor by the next date and adjourned the matter to October 27.On December 2, 2002, a bomb went off in a BEST bus parked outside Ghatkopar railway station, during the evening rush hour, killing two and injuring over 50 people.The Mumbai crime branch, of which Vaze was part, picked up a few persons including Yunus on December 25.On January 7, 2003, Yunus was reported missing from police custody. The police claimed that he escaped with two other accused while they were being taken to Aurangabad when the vehicle carrying them met with an accident in Ahmednagar district.An FIR was registered in connection with the incident at the Parner police station.However, during an enquiry into the so-called accident conducted by the special Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) court in Mumbai, Dr Abdul Mateen, who was also one of the accused, revealed that he had heard Yunus being beaten, and later vomiting, in an adjacent cell.Mateen claimed that Yunus had likely died on January 6. This testimony was corroborated by a third accused in the case.Vaze and three police constables - Rajendra Tiwari, Sunil Desai and Rajaram Nikam, are being prosecuted for the custodial death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/khwaja-yunus-case-court-raps-maharashtra-govt-cid-for-failing-to-appoint-spl-prosecutor-101632232033733.html

Condoling the death of top seer, general secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti, Swami Jitendranand Saraswati, demanded a thorough probe into the death top seer. Giri was surrounded by several controversies, including dispute between Guru and Shishya, besides issues within the akhadas. It has also come to the light that a three-page suicide note was recovered from the room in which Giri’s body was found. Doing his own signature properly was a big thing for Mahant Narendra Giri Ji. When he was not able to write his signature properly, how could such a person write three pages? In such circumstances, it should be probed thoroughly if it was a murder under a deep conspiracy to implicate someone?,” said Saraswati. He said that various other points had come to light in the case too which also needed to be probed. Saraswati said he had full confidence that chief minister Yogi Adityanath would ensure a thorough probe into the matter by a competent investigating agency. “Giri was provided sufficient security by the state government. So, there is no question that he lacked security,” he said. The top seer was a strong-willed person and he couldn’t commit suicide. “There is a deep conspiracy and it should be probed,” he added. Meanwhile, expressing his condolence over Giri’s death, Annapurna Temple Mahant Shankar Giri said, “Narendra Giri had deep attachment with Kashi. He was representative of a number of Akhadas. He extended support to Sadhus during Kumbh. We are extremely sad over his demise.” He also demanded a high-level probe into the incident and said that he would visit Prayagrag to pay tributes to the Akhada Parishad chief. Akhil Bharatiya Vyas Sangh president Mahant Balak Das said that the death of Mahant Narendra Giri was an irreparable loss to the Sant Samaj and followers of Sanatan Dharma. “He was a saint of strong willpower and he couldn’t commit suicide. Something wrong has happened with him somewhere. There are smells of conspiracy behind the incident. Everything will be revealed after a proper investigation,” he said. The Kashi Vidvat Parishad also demanded a high-level inquiry into the sudden demise of Mahant Narendra Giri. General secretary of the Parishad, Prof Ramnarayan Dwivedi, said that there should be a judicial inquiry into the incident to find out the truth. Acharya Ashok Dwivedi, former chairman of Kashi Vishwanath Temple Trust, said that the sudden demise of the Akhara Parishad president Narendra Giri was shocking. He was the flag bearer of Sanatan Dharma and it is difficult to fill the void created after his departure. I pray to Lord Shiva to give him a place at his feet. There should be a high-level inquiry into the incident,” he said. Shankar Dev Chaitanya Brahmachari, the Peethadheeshwar of the Dharmasangha, said that Narendra Giri had a close relationship with the Dharmasangha. He was available at all times whenever the Sangha required him. “May God give him a place at his Shri Charans. This is my personal loss along with Sant Samaj,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/varanasi-religious-leaders-saints-demand-thorough-probe-into-narendra-giri-s-death-101632231373274.html

21-09-2021||Chandigarh||Brush with writing: A drop of ink may make a billion think||Writing is magic. It offers a rare joy and is my favourite companion, wherever I am and wherever I go. Often, it gives the opportunity to relive the simplest pleasures and express the many epiphanies that cross the mind, leading to clarity I had been seeking. I admire how it connects, showing the path to many as Lord Byron aptly observed, “A drop of ink may make a billion think.” A warm thank you to the monthly school magazine at Punjab Public School, Nabha, the boarding school I attended, which planted the seed of writing. A writeup on the festival of Halloween was my first published piece, way back in 1999, when I was in grade 6. The engrossing narration about this festival from one of our guests at home became my inspiration. Seeing the piece in the magazine encouraged me so much that I began contributing an article every month. As I reached grade 10, my letters started finding place in the letters to the editor column of newspapers. Within a short span, my collection of letters grew, and I preserved them in a large glass frame, still hanging in my bedroom. My first piece of 500 words in a newspaper was about a nostalgic visit to the boarding school, years after passing out. I can easily recall the date: December 7, 2012, and also who was first to congratulate me. Interestingly, it was published in the newspaper you are now reading. I wanted to write more, and I did, and will always continue to since it keeps me so alive. Ideas to write come anytime, anywhere – be it while bathing, walking or even while holding conversations. Some of them surprise and I want to jot them down before I forget. No wonder I’ve scribbled on napkins and pamphlets. Ideas crawl to me in the middle of the night. There was a time I kept writing them on papers, never able to find them, when needed. Thankfully the habit of keeping a diary saved me, which stays not only by my bedside but also joins me wherever I go. Its pages on return are always filled with so much new. A unique euphoria awaits me as I wrap up a piece, and it is all set for submission. The moment I hear it’s been selected, my happiness knows no bounds and seeing it in print is a dream come true. However, rejections too are part of the process and despite them one should go on. Sometimes, there’s no reply, while sometimes the same line, ‘Thanks. Regret our inability to carry the piece,” or “Sorry, your piece is not being used,” with no further explanation. As shared in Chicken Soup for Writer’s Soul book, there have been cases when some also received stinging feedback but didn’t give up. In 1889, Rudyard Kipling received the following letter from the San Francisco Examiner: “I am sorry; Mr Kipling but you don’t know how to use the English language.” In 1902, the poetry editor of the Atlantic Monthly returned the poems of a 28-year-old, with these words: “Our magazine has no verse for your vigorous verse.” The poet was Robert Browning. Even Stephen King was rejected a hundred times. So, what makes a good writer? First and foremost, one who lives in the present, an observer, a voracious storyteller with the ability to draw lessons from all kinds of experiences, an open-minded traveller and most importantly an ardent reader. Nearly a decade ago, when I got a chance to meet Ruskin Bond, he too underlined the power of reading. It not only enriches our writings but also our mind and this reminds me of a quote by Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes, “The pen is the tongue of the mind.” In one word: Absolutely! rameshinder.sandhu@gmail.com The writer is an Amritsar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/brush-with-writing-a-drop-of-ink-may-make-a-billion-think-101632226032731.html

When the leopard came to eat the kill, he got trapped in the cage,” said Vinay Bhargava, divisional forest officer, Pithoragarh. Bhargava said the team from the forest department spared no effort to cage the leopard, after Pithoragarh district magistrate Ashish Chauhan ordered them to catch the leopard without harming it. The decision was taken after the body of the girl identified as one Karishma Vishwakarma, was recovered on Monday morning about 60 metres away from her house. The leopard attacked the girl and took her into the forest in the dark. On Monday, state disaster response force (SDRF) personnel recovered her body following an overnight search operation in the forest .Leopard attacks have become frequent in many parts of the state these days.

21-09-2021||Mumbai||Thane: Probe ordered into additional road widening without approval||Thane Municipal Corporation has ordered an inquiry into the unauthorised widening of Pokharan road number 1 between Cadbury junction to Yeoor in 2015-16, done apparently to help real estate projects on the stretch. Thane Mayor Naresh Mhaske has asked for the probe report’s submission in 10 days’ time amid allegations of irregularities in the execution of the project.The general body of the municipal corporation passed a resolution to conduct an inquiry following the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator Archana Manera’s allegation that the Pokharan road was widened to 48 meters, when the development plan (DP) allowed only 40 meters widening. Manera pointed out that any changes in the development plan needed official approval, which was not sought in this case.The town planning department agreed that the width of the road in question exceeded the approved width as per the development plan. Manera alleged that while the corporation would raze small establishments for encroachment of even lesser space, the additional eight meters widening had been done to benefit a large-scale commercial project in the area.During the question-answer session, Manera asked if the civic commissioner has the right to change the DP.TMCs city planning officer Shailendra Bhendale, said, “As per the DP, the road is 40 meters wide, however, it is true that the actual length of the road is 48 meters. The general body’s permission is needed to make any changes in the DP.”Vikrant Chavan, the Congress corporator added that the additional eight meters were only added on one side of the road, ensuring demolition of the shops at Vartak Nagar Naka. “The road was widened by officials only to benefit the real estate projects coming along the route. TMC will also incur additional expenses on maintaining the road henceforth,” Chavan said.The Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) corporator Najib Mullah said it needed to be inquired how additional widening was done without seeking the approval of the house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-probe-ordered-into-additional-road-widening-without-approval-101632222252373.html

Channi will be accompanied by Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu and the two newly appointed deputy chief ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and OP Soni.It is not clear when the meeting with Rahul Gandhi to discuss the names of the ministers in the new Punjab cabinet will take place as he is on a personal visit to Shimla. Upon his arrival at the national capital on Tuesday, the chief minister-led delegation will meet senior Congress leaders Harish Rawat and KC Venugopal and two central observers.There are already hints that several new faces, including a few from the group that spoke out against former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, might be inducted into the new cabinet to give it a fresh look and make a clean break from the previous administration.Charanjit Singh Channi was sworn in as the 16th chief minister of Punjab on Monday to become the first politician from the Dalit community in the state to take charge of the top post. The Congress leadership announced his name as the chief minister last Sunday.Channi served as the minister of technical education in the state government led by Amarinder Singh, who submitted his resignation last Saturday, after a months-long power-sharing tussle with Navjot Singh Sidhu.After taking the oath, CM Charanjit Singh Channi held a press conference where he called himself an ‘aam aadmi’ (common man) and urged the Centre to take back the three new farm laws. Channi made a slew of promises to the people of Punjab which included free water supply to smaller households, reduction in the power tariff and also the elimination of sand mafia in the state.(With inputs from Navneet Sharma, Punjab bureau)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-channi-sidhu-to-visit-delhi-hold-talks-on-cabinet-expansion-101632200909869.html
21-09-2021||Patna||67 samples test Covid-19 positive in 2 days at Madhubani station, retest ordered||Administration of Bihar’s Madhubani district sent 67 swab samples for confirmatory real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests on Monday. These samples had tested Covid-19 positive in the rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests, conducted among passengers at the Madhubani railway station, which alarmed district health officials. As many as 35 passengers from the Swatantrata Senani Express from New Delhi tested positive in RAD tests for Covid-19 on Monday and 32 others from Mumbai tested positive on Sunday, triggering concern.The district authorities, however, have reasons to believe that these could be false positive results since three of these passengers tested negative during a re-test with RAD kits at their village, said officials. “The sudden rise in cases, the asymptomatic nature of patients, epidemiological references that false positive cases go up when the prevalence of a disease goes down, three passengers testing negative during a re-check, as also the fact that no other passenger at any railway station earlier en route Madhubani from New Delhi or Mumbai reported positive, have raised suspicion that these may be false positive cases,” said Dr Sunil Kumar Jha, civil surgeon, Madhubani. He added that the sensitivity of RAD kits depends on many factors, temperature being one. “We are getting all the samples re-checked on RT-PCR,” he added. Meanwhile, the district authorities have allowed all the 67 Covid-19 suspects to be under home isolation till the results from RT-PCR tests allow for some conclusion on their status. “Our healthcare workers are checking on them on a daily basis to see if their condition deteriorates. We are also insisting that they opt for institutional isolation. Around 800 beds at Covid care centres, available in our district, are vacant,” added Dr Jha. The Covid-19 bulletin, released by the state health department on Monday, reported only seven new cases. Of them, two were from Gopalganj and one each from Patna, Bhojpur, Madhubani, Purnia and Katihar. Bihar has reported 725,901 cases and 9,659 deaths since March 21, 2020, when the first Covid-19 case in the state was reported. Patna, with 146,942 cases and 2,334 deaths, was the worst affected. As many as 716,173 patients have recovered so far, taking the state’s case recovery rate to 98.65%. The number of active cases in the state has come down to 68.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/67-samples-test-covid-19-positive-in-2-days-at-madhubani-station-retest-ordered-101632205210669.html

21-09-2021||Patna||Preparation for Durga Puja celebration begins in Patna||With only a couple of weeks left for the beginning of Durga Puja celebration, organisers in Patna are finalising designs of pandals and idols along with plans to implement Covid-19 safety protocols. The Durga Puja will begin on October 7 and conclude on October 15.Patna district magistrate (DM) Chandrashekhar Singh has allowed Durga Puja celebration and Ravan Vadh event on Dussehra this year on the condition that Covid-19 containment measures will be followed strictly.“As per the state unlock guidelines, there is no restriction on religious and cultural activities. Puja committees will have to acquire a licence for erecting Puja pandals and strictly follow Covid-19 safety guidelines,” DM Singh said.Several Puja organisers have decided to scale down recognising the need for measured celebrations keeping the Covid-19 threat in view.Singh cautioned that if Covid-19 cases tend to rise in the near future, Puja celebration could be cancelled in view of public health safety.Ranjan Kumar, vice-president of Shri Shri Navyuvak Durga Puja committee, said, “We have opted for low-key celebration fearing the third wave of Covid-19. Durga Puja will be performed with traditional rituals but we will have a simple pandal this year as monitoring huge crowds will not be possible.”In line with the need for social distancing, Chajjubagh Sarbojanin Durga Puja committee is collecting donations through digital platforms this year.“Instead of visiting door to door, we are circulating the donation link on social media for collecting contributions from devotees. Unlike previous years, we will not go for grand pandals and life-size idols,” said a member of the committee. Vijay Vahini Durga Puja committee, Anandpuri has opted for decorations in the rainbow theme to symbolise hope.“We are happy as the government has allowed Durga Puja celebration this year. We will design a pandal based on Kedarnath temple along with rainbow decorations. However, the height of pandals and idols will be less this year,” said Santosh Kumar, a member of the committee.The district administration has also allowed cultural events including Ramleela, Ravan Vadh and Bharat Milap at Kalidas Rangalaya on October 14, 15 and 16 respectively, with a limited number of guests. Earlier, these events were organised at Gandhi Maidan, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/preparation-for-durga-puja-celebration-begins-in-patna-101632202690426.html

The India Meteorological department (IMD) has predicted all districts of south Bengal will receive light to moderate rainfall with one or two spells of heavy rainfall and thundershowers, till Tuesday.Many areas in the Bengal capital such as Ballygunge, Golf Green, Palmer Bazar, Topsia, Ultadanga, Chetla etc received more than 100 millimeters (mm) of rainfall on Sunday leading to flooding. Rainwater inundated the outpatient department (OPD) of gynaecology section as well as the ticket counter on the ground floor of the SSKM Medical College and hospital building on Monday, and nurses were seen wading in ankle deep water to attend to patients. Rainwater also damaged valuable medicines and oxygen cylinders at the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine.The IMD regional office said Kolkata received 142mm of rain in a span of 24 hours till 8.30am on Monday, and over 100mm during the six-hour span from 1am to 7am.

21-09-2021||Kolkata||Bangladesh to send 2,000 tonnes of Hilsa fish ahead of Durga Puja||With less than a month left for the Durga Puja – the biggest festival in West Bengal – the Sheikh Hasina-government in Bangladesh has decided to send at least 2,000 tonnes of Hilsa fish to West Bengal. This comes at a time when fishermen in the state have been complaining of a poor catch this season. “This year, we would get 2,080 tonnes of Hilsa fish from Bangladesh. We are expecting the first consignment to arrive at the Petrapole border in a day or two. The consignments would continue to come till October 10,” said SA Maqsood, secretary of the Fish Importers’ Association in West Bengal. Hilsa is often tagged as the Queen of Fish for its taste and the Bangladeshi Hilsa, found in River Padma, is considered to be tastier than the ones found in Ganga. Also Read | Uncertainty over Bengal BJP’s Durga Puja celebrations after party’s poll debacleEven though the five-day-long Durga Puja starts this year from October 11, the festival extends for over a week every year. Mahalaya this year would be held on October 6 and the immersion process would continue till 17. “Bangladesh had banned exports of Hilsa fish in 2012. Over the past three years, it has been lifting the ban around this time of the year and issuing special permission to export the fish. In 2019, Bangladesh sent around 500 tonnes of the fish. In 2020, it sent around 1,850 tonnes,” said Maqsood. Fish traders and importers in India have learnt from their Bangladeshi counterparts that the fish would weigh somewhere between 700 and 1200 grams each and the cost would be around ₹900 – ₹1,500 per kilo. Every year during the monsoon, shoals of Hilsa swim several kilometres from the sea into the estuaries and upstream along the rivers for spawning after which they return to the Bay of Bengal. The eggs hatch in freshwater and the sub-adult Hilsa swim downstream into the sea. Another lot comes during February-March. “This migration depends on multiple factors from depth of water at the mouth of rivers, amount of rainfall, river flush and water-pollution among others. The Hilsa, being very sensitive, changes its course and swims in the direction where the conditions are favourable. If they don’t find suitable conditions in Hooghly in West Bengal, they enter Meghna-Padma estuary. Some may even go towards Irrawaddy in Myanmar,” said Shyamsundar Das, joint secretary of West Bengal United Fishermen Association. “The catch has been dwindling over the years. This year, we have managed to catch around 2,700-2,800 tonnes approx., which is slightly better than last year,” said Akhil Giri, state fishery minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bangladesh-to-send-2-000-tonnes-of-hilsa-fish-ahead-of-durga-puja-101632198610314.html

We expect to complete the finishing in the next couple of months,” said Nitin Kohli, the contractor who is carrying out the construction work. Tharu tribe members have lauded the initiative. “It’s a good step. I believe that efforts should be made to preserve cultures of all such tribes as they are an important part of history,” said Lakshmi Devi, a Tharu and the head of Bela Parsua, a Tharu dominated village in Lakhimpur Kheir district. The project was inaugurated in January 2020 by UP CM but got delayed due to the disruptions caused by the pandemic outbreak.

21-09-2021||Mumbai||Pornography case: Raj Kundra may walk out of jail today||A day after being granted bail in a case pertaining to creation of porn films, businessman Raj Kundra may walk out of jail on Tuesday. Kundra was named a key accused in a pornography case and was arrested on July 19 along with 10 other people. He was booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Information Technology Act and Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act.On Monday, Kundra and his associate Ryan Thorpe were granted bail by a metropolitan magistrate court in Mumbai. Kundra has been ordered to pay ₹50,000 surety for his release.Speaking to news agency PTI, Kundra’s lawyer said on Monday that he is currently lodged in Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail under judicial custody and is likely to walk out at around 9.30 am on Tuesday.Last week, Kundra moved a bail plea before the metropolitan magistrate court, days after the police filed a supplementary charge sheet in the case.In his plea, Kundra alleged that there is not an iota of evidence to date with the prosecution that would connect the app ‘Hotshots’, used in the alleged porn films racket, with an offence under the law. It was earlier reported that Hotshots was developed for streaming adult and pornographic content that Kundra’s firm produced.Kundra claimed that there was no proof of him being “actively” involved in the creation of alleged questionable porn content, and he said he was being made a scapegoat for reasons best known to the investigators. He also told the magistrate court that the videos were shot with the consent of the actors.The public prosecutor, meanwhile, opposed the businessman’s application and said that just because the charge sheet has been filed, it does not imply the accused should be given bail. Chief metropolitan magistrate Bhajipale, after hearing both sides, allowed Kundra’s application on furnishing a bail bond of ₹50,000.In the nearly 1,500-page charge sheet filed on September 16, the Mumbai Police claimed that Raj Kundra was the main facilitator in the case and he along with others exploited young women who were struggling in the movie industry by filming them in obscene ways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pornography-case-raj-kundra-may-walk-out-of-jail-today-101632185078534.html

21-09-2021||Chandigarh||Consider reducing GST rate on ropeways: HP to Centre||Himachal Pradesh government has urged the Centre to consider reducing the rate of GST from 18% to 5% by adding a specific entry related to ropeways and other unconventional modes of transportation. HP chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has apprised Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman of the state’s decision to use the concept of ropeways for transportation of passengers and goods throughout Himachal. The objective behind this decision is to connect the left-out habitations where construction of roads is not environmentally and economically feasible. It also aims at connecting new places of tourist attraction and exploring new opportunities from a tourism point of view for employment generation and economic growth of the state. Jai Ram Thakur has said that the Himachal government has created ropeways and Rapid Transportation System Development Corporation (RTDC) under the transport department as a single nodal agency for construction of ropeways and other mass rapid transportation systems in the state. Therefore, the ropeways would not act merely as the tourist attraction but would also help in providing sustainable means of transport in rural areas besides considerably solving the traffic congestion in these areas. The CM has also added that the ropeways and other unconventional modes of transportation are not defined separately under the specific entry of GST schedules. The GST is being levied on this service (9% SGST and 9% CGST), thereby increasing the freight on this mode of transportation substantially. He said the ropeways are one of the safest modes of passenger and transport material transportation and are eco-friendly solutions for providing connectivity. He has further mentioned that Himachal Pradesh is one of the revenue deficit states where the revenue gap is more than 50%. The setting of ropeways in a big way in the state would attract a large number of tourists to the state which in turn would help in economic growth and enhance the revenue receipt of the state which might help in reducing the revenue gap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/consider-reducing-gst-rate-on-ropeways-hp-to-centre-101632175028448.html

The KMSC’s demands also include a new law ensuring minimum support price (MSP) for 23 crops, implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report, waiving of debt of farmers and government jobs and compensation of ₹5 lakh to the families of the farmers who died during the agitation against the three farm laws at the Delhi border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kisan-mazdoor-sangharsh-committee-mobilising-support-for-protests-outside-dc-offices-in-punjab-from-sept-28-101632170168285.html
21-09-2021||Chandigarh||Samyukt Kisan Morcha appeals to farmers to intensify agitation against agri laws||Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders on Monday appealed to the people of Punjab not to shift their focus from the ongoing agitation against the three agriculture laws amid coronation of new chief minister in the state, terming the infighting in the ruling Congress a scramble for political power. The morcha, which has been protesting at the Barnala railway station for 355 day, said the farmers’ movement has nothing to do with “political games”. “All this noise is a part of a plan to win the elections with new faces in 2022. Due to the government’s anti-people and pro-corporate policies, the economic condition of people is deteriorating by the day and politicians have no solution to the issues of the masses,” SKM leader Manjit Singh Dhaner said. He also asked the protesters to focus on preparations for the Bharat Bandh on September 27 and appealed the youth to join a five-day kabaddi tournament at the Delhi borders from Wednesday. Bhupinder Singh Longowal, state committee member of the Kirti Kisan Union, said they have been holding meetings and rallies at villages to mobilise the locals to participate in Bharat Bandh to oppose the new agriculture laws. “We are educating and motivating people from all walks of life to make Bharat Bandh a success. The SKM leaders also held a meeting with all representatives of farmer unions in view of the upcoming strike in Sangrur. We have also decided to meet the vyapar mandal leaders to hold a joint protest on September 27,” added Longowal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/samyukt-kisan-morcha-appeals-to-farmers-to-intensify-agitation-against-agri-laws-101632169988152.html
21-09-2021||Chandigarh||Channi takes over as Punjab CM, but Congress drama continues||Charanjit Singh Channi was sworn in as the Punjab chief minister on Monday, becoming the state’s first Dalit CM, even as a political controversy over the change of guard just months ahead of assembly elections in the state grew with changing power dynamics within the ranks of the Congress. In his first media interaction after taking oath, Channi promised free water supply to smaller homes, a reduction in power tariff and a transparent government for the “common man”, and urged the Centre to repeal the three “black” farm laws. Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and OP Soni, both ministers in the Amarinder cabinet (along with Channi), were also sworn in by Governor Banwarilal Puohit and have been designated as deputy chief ministers. The ceremony was also attended by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Punjab Congress affairs in-charge Harish Rawat, PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu and others. All three took oath in Punjabi. Amarinder skipped the swearing-in at which only 40-odd guests were allowed. Channi and Randhawa were among the four cabinet ministers who had rebelled against Capt Amarinder. Both deputy CMs are from the Majha region. The appointment of Randhawa, a Jat Sikh, and Soni, a Hindu, is being seen as an attempt by the Congress to balance the caste equations ahead of the polls and counter the attempt of rival parties to woo Dalit voters. Hours before the swearing-in ceremony, Rawat said the upcoming state elections will be fought under the leadership of Sidhu. Calling the statement “baffling”, former state unit chief Sunil Jakhar said it could “undermine” the authority of the new CM. Soon, the Congress went into damage control, saying that Channi and Sidhu will both be “our” faces for the Punjab elections in 2022. Brahm Mohindra’s name dropped at the eleventh hour Earlier, senior party leader Brahm Mohindra’s name was finalised for one of the two slots of deputy chief minister. AICC treasurer Pawan Kumar Bansal was the first to tweet about the six-time MLA’s elevation. “Heartiest congratulations to @Charnjit _channi for elevation as @PunjabCM and @BrahmMohindra & @Sukhjinder_INC as deputy CMs,” he tweeted on Sunday night. Bansal expressed regret on Monday afternoon for his earlier post. Rajya Sabha MP Ambika Soni had also called up Mohindra to congratulate him on his appointment. Mohindra’s name was dropped at the eleventh hour. A section of the party, including Sidhu, was not in favour of elevation of the Patiala Rural MLA who was seen to be siding with Amarinder during his (Capt’s) tussle with the disgruntled ministers and legislators, said sources. He had succeeded Sidhu as the local government minister and the two shared uneasy equations. Mohindra said he never asked for the post and gave his consent after the party took the decision regarding the appointment. “Now, they have taken another decision, it is totally fine with me. I am with the party and the high command. I am a Congressman. My father was also a Congressman. Congress is in our DNA,” he said. Meanwhile, Channi is learnt to have started consultations with the state president and other senior leaders for the expansion of his cabinet. There are already indications that several new faces, including a few from the disgruntled group that spoke out against Amarinder, may be inducted to give it a fresh look and make a clean break from the previous administration. Punjab Congress working president Sangat Singh Gilzian has sought due representation for backward classes in the cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/channi-takes-over-as-punjab-cm-but-congress-drama-continues-101632169868565.html

I have come to know through the media today that assembly elections in Punjab will be fought under a non-Dalit leader and not under Channi,” Mayawati told newspersons here.Attacking the Congress, she said, “It still does not have faith in Dalits. Dalits need to be very alert to their double standards. I have full faith that Dalits of Punjab will not fall for this stunt.” The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister also claimed the Congress is rattled by the SAD-BSP alliance for the Punjab assembly polls.The BSP and SAD had in June joined hands for the 2022 Punjab assembly elections. SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal had announced that if their alliance wins, the deputy chief minister would be from the Dalit community.“The reality is that Congress and other political parties think of Dalits only in times of crisis,” Mayawati charged.The Congress’ decision to name Channi, who hails from Rupnagar district in Punjab’s Malwa belt, assumes significance as almost 32% population of the state comprises Dalits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-be-wary-of-cong-s-election-stunt-mayawati-tells-dalits-101632168908044.html

The protesters said the victim had taken the extreme step a day before he was due to marry the woman he loved, Megha. However, she was also involved with another man Raghav of Gandhi Nagar. The police have booked Raghav but have not registered a case against Megha. Alleging that the victim’s death was a conspiracy, his relatives have demanded that the culprits be charged with murder. Commissioner of police Naunihal Singh has assured them that action will be taken against the accused. On September 14, the victim, also a resident of Gandhi Nagar, had gone to Ludhiana Zoo with his fiancée, whom he was to marry the next day. However, he consumed poison in front of her, after which the woman fled. The police arrested Raghav for abetment as he had told the victim that he was in a relationship with Megha, after which the victim had asked her to meet him at the zoo and ended his life. A cousin of the victim alleged that Megha had given him the poison. A probe has been marked to the assistant commissioner of police (ACP, north), Dharmapal.Salem Tabri station house officer, inspector Gopal Krishan, said the woman had not been let go scot-free, but a probe was on to determine her role in the suicide case.The mobile phones of the victim, his fiancée, and the accused have been seized. As per recordings in the phones of the victim and his fiancée, they were of the belief that Raghav was provoking the victim against Megha.

Congratulating Channi, senior Aam Aadmi Party leader Harpal Singh Cheema hoped that he will fulfil all the Congress’ poll promises made before the 2017 assembly elections.

SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, while congratulating Channi, said he hopes the new chief minister will fulfil all promises which the Congress party made to the people of Punjab at the time of polls. SAD spokesman Pawan Kumar Tinu said: “Even though Channi was not the automatic choice as a Dalit chief minister by the Congress high command and was a compromise candidate, he should seize this opportunity and right all the wrongs committed against Scheduled Castes, particularly Dalit students”.

In March this year, a fast-track court in Faridabad had convicted the duo, Tohsif and Rehan, and sentenced them to life imprisonment for the murder. A third accused, Ajrudeen, was acquitted in the case.In his plea, the victim’s brother, Naveen Tomar, stated that the trial court had erred in sentencing the duo and also not compensated the family for the loss. “.. trial court failed to consider that the present case falls under the category of rarest of the rare case. Admittedly the horrific incident took place in broad daylight in public gaze where a young girl, aged 21, was tried to be forcefully abducted and on her resistance, she was brutally shot,” the plea says. A closed-circuit television camera installed outside the college had shown the convicts, Tohsif and Rehan, trying to shove the victim into a car and later shooting her when she resisted. Nikita had later succumbed to her injuries. “The accused need to be weeded out of the society to send a signal so that nobody dares to commit such a crime with a hapless girl. There are no chances of such people getting reformed and they cannot be allowed to mix with the society again. Therefore, they deserve to be sent to the gallows,” the brother stated in his plea, in which compensation was also sought for the family. He has also filed another plea challenging the acquittal of the third accused, Ajrudeen, and claimed that he should be convicted for criminal conspiracy in the murder case. The court in his case had said that though there were allegations of conspiracy against him, he was not present at the place of occurrence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nikita-tomar-murder-brother-approaches-hc-seeks-death-sentence-for-convicts-101632168668025.html
21-09-2021||Chandigarh||Won’t let any harm come farmers way: Punjab CM Channi||Chandigarh/Chamkaur SahibChief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Monday urged the Centre to repeal the three contentious farm laws over which farmers from Punjab and other states have been protesting for the past one year. In his first media interaction after taking oath, the new chief minister that his government and the party (Congress) are firmly behind the farmers in their struggle. “I will sever my head but I will not let any harm come to the farmers,” he said, adding: “Punjab is primarily an agrarian state and this government is pro-farmer”. Channi was flanked by Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat, state unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, deputy chief ministers Sukhjinder Randhawa and OP Soni. Rule of ‘aam aadmi’ has been established: CM Channi said his would a government of the poor, for the poor and with the poor, describing himself as an “aam aadmi” (a common man), “The rule of aam aadmi has been established. I thank the Congress leadership for picking a poor person for the top post,” he said getting emotional. He also recalled that he had pedalled a rickshaw and his father ran a tent house. Announces cut in power tariff The three-time MLA from Chamkaur Sahib also announced waiving the domestic water and sewage bills and reduction in power tariff of the poor households in the state. “My wife is a doctor. My brother is also a doctor. There are employees in my house. When the power bill comes, my wife tells me the money goes from her pocket. These bills will be reduced,” the CM said. He also said there will be no water and sanitation charges for houses up to 150 or 200 square yards in urban areas. Promises action against mafiaPromising to take prompt action against the mafia, Channi said the state cabinet will take a decision dealing with sand mafia in the state. “We don’t want the mafia in the state,” he stressed. Assuring the protesting employees that the government will take care of their demands, he appealed to government employees to withdraw their agitation and return to work. Committed to party’s 18-point agendaHe said that his government is committed to the party leadership’s 18-point agenda for the state. Praising former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, Channi said he did good work. “He is known as the protector of water rights. He is our leader,” he said. ‘Party is supreme’ On the government-party relationship, he said the party is supreme not the chief minister or the cabinet. “The government will be run as per the ideology of the Congress. Party will decide and the government will implement,” he said in an important statement in the backdrop of the rift between Sidhu and Amarinder that left the party divided. ‘Justice will be in Bargari sacrilege’ Later, addressing his first public rally after becoming the CM in his constituency Chamkaur Sahib, Channi said justice would be done in Bargari sacrilege case. “I am a devout Sikh of Guru Sahib and can’t tolerate that culprits of this incident are roaming freely,” he said. Slamming the Shiromani Akali Dal, the CM said the farm laws were drafted with the consent of SAD leadership and now they are playing politics to befool the people of the state. “I will visit the protesting farmers at Delhi borders as it’s like a holy place where they are fighting against unjust laws. I am with farmers,” Channi said. The CM also announced ₹50 crore for the development of Chamkaur Sahib constituency. He said every person of his constituency is a chief minister. “People of my constituency admire me as a family member. It’s because of you all that I have reached the top post,” he said while addressing the gathering.The CM announced to make Chamkaur Sahib a world-class tourist hub and said a theme park would be inaugurated on November 6.‘Supervise attendance on govt offices’After taking over as the CM on Monday, Charanjit Singh Channi issued orders to all the state government employees to reach office at 9am sharp and stay in the office till its closure. The orders, issued by state personnel department on his behalf, directed the heads of department and administrative secretaries to make surprise checks in offices at least twice a week.

21-09-2021||Chandigarh||Under attack, Cong says Channi, Sidhu to be its faces in state polls||The Congress on Monday said it will fight Punjab elections under the leadership of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and both will be “our” faces.The Congress went into damage control after it came under attack from various parties over the statement of its general secretary in-charge for Punjab Harish Rawat that the party would go to polls with Sidhu as it face.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the next Punjab assembly elections will be fought under the leadership of both Channi and Sidhu and attacked the BJP, Akali Dal, BSP and Aam Aadmi Party for insulting a Dalit chief minister.He also questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP leadership why they had not named any Dalit as their chief minister and why they and other leaders of the BSP, AAP and Akali Dal were undermining the Congress Dalit leader.“Our faces will be Charanjit Singh Channi and Navjot Singh Sidhu as also ordinary Congress workers and leaders who will be supporting them. If anybody says one or the other will be the face, intentionally or otherwise, it is being misinterpreted by the media,” he told reporters.He alleged that the BJP, SAD, AAP and BSP have “unwarrantedly, shamelessly and regrettably” attacked the candidature of Channi.“We would urge Narendra Modi ji, JP Nadda, Sukhbir Singh Badal, Arvind Kejriwal and Mayawati ji to not grudge the rightful due of a Dalit’s son who is today the chief minister of Punjab, and instead of shamelessly criticising him, they should hail his elevation,” the Congress leader said.Various parties had attacked the Congress after Rawat’s remarks saying the grand old party is only doing tokenism.Rawat’s statement baffling: JakharEarlier in the day, the Congress also came under attack from within with its former state chief Sunil Jakhar questioning Rawat over his statement.Jakhar termed Rawat’s statement on the day of the new chief minister’s swearing-in as “baffling”, stating that it is likely to “undermine” his (Channi’s) authority. “On the swearing-in day of Sh @Charnjit_channi as Chief Minister, Mr Rawat’s statement that “elections will be fought under Sidhu”, is baffling. It’s likely to undermine CM’s authority but also negate the very ‘raison d’etre’ of his selection for this position,” the former Punjab Congress chief tweeted. Jakhar, a Hindu face, was one of the frontrunners for the chief minister’s post after Capt Amarinder Singh resigned following months of internal strife that left the state unit divided. His name was more or less final at one stage, but a section of the party leaders, including Sukhjinder Randhawa, Ambika Soni and some MLAs, pressed for a Sikh CM. In another tweet, he endorsed Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh’s statement on the possibility of a Hindu CM for Punjab. “Sagacious words of Jathedar of Shri Akal Takht Sahib couldn’t have come at a better time when petty minded small people occupying high positions are trying to divide Punjab on basis of race/caste/identities”. Hours later, Surjewala said Channi is the chief minister and Sidhu is the organisation head of the Congress in Punjab, and the next elections will be fought under both of them.“It’s a matter of great pride for every young and old Congress worker, and every poor and disadvantaged (person) and Dalit of India that this singular decision will fortify social justice foundations in this country,” Surjewala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/under-attack-cong-says-channi-sidhu-to-be-its-faces-in-state-polls-101632168249230.html
21-09-2021||Other||Delhi police blocked highway, not us: Farmers||A day after they boycotted the meeting called by a high-powered committee of the Haryana government, farmers protesting against the agricultural reforms stated that they have not blocked the national highway-44, rather it is the Delhi police who have obstructed free flow of traffic by installing barricades to stop their movement towards the national capital. Interacting with reporters in Jind, Samyukta Kisan Morcha leader Darshan Pal Singh said, “A nine-member committee of SKM had unanimously decided to boycott the meeting. The protesters have not blocked any road; it is the Delhi police who have installed barricades since November last year, leading to inconvenience for commuters. We have cleared one side of the highway but will not clear the other side,” he said. He further added, “On behalf of the SKM, I want to make it clear that we will not enter Delhi even if the police remove barricades. If we had a plan to enter Delhi, we might have entered the national capital by removing barricades by now. Our main focus is to strengthen this agitation at the village-level in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh,” he added.The farmers’ numbers have been dwindling at both the protest sites –Tikri and Singhu – as the harvesting season is round the corner. Activist Yogendra Yadav said the meeting called by the high-powered committee was pointless and the sole purpose of this meeting was to implicate farmers for blocking the highway.“The Haryana government should hold talks with the union home ministry under whose Delhi police comes and remove the blockade from NH-44. In the apex court’s directions, there were only two parties-state governments and union, whom it had asked to ensure safe passage on highways. The farmers were not any part, so we had skipped the meeting,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-police-blocked-highway-not-us-farmers-101632168248035.html
21-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Channi ‘dummy appointed by Congress to woo dalits’: Opposition||With Charanjit Channi taking oath as the first dalit chief minister (CM) of the state on Monday, the opposition parties including Shirmani Akali Dal (SAD)-Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) slammed Congress for trying to befool voters with an aim to cater to the dalit votes in the upcoming asembly elections.Citing the statement of Punjab Congress in-charge Harish Rawat, hours before the swearing in ceremony of Channi, that the upcoming elections will be fought under president of Punjab Pradesh Congresss Committe (PPCC) Navjot Singh, the SAD-BSP leaders even termed Channi a “dummy CM, who has been appointed to woo the dalit voters”. BJP also raised questions over Channi’s character citing the complaint against him during #MeToo movement. District president of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Jeet Ram Basra, said, “Congress was forced to appoint a dalit CM in the state because of the rising popularity of SAD-BSP alliance and acceptance among dalit voters in the state. Channi will not be any more than a dummy CM as hours before the swearing in ceremony, Rawat made it clear that the elections will be contested under Navjot Sidhu. Channi will not be able to do any good to the dalit community in the coming 3-4 months. SAD-BSP will form the government in the state in 2022.”District president, SAD, Harbhajan Singh Dang said, “Channi is like an inexperienced driver, who has been put at the driving seat and he will certainly end up in an accident.The Congress has lost its path. Rather than working for the betterment of the state, the Congress leaders are fighting with each other for power. Channi will not be able to perform and dalit voters will not accept him.”District BJP president said, “Apart from the complaint during #MeToo movement, a few inappropriate pictures of Channi are also going viral on social media networks, which raise questions over his character. If the government is so concerned about the dalits in the state, then why Channi or some other dalit leader was not made CM earlier. Congress is also trying to wo the dalit voters with its move, but it will not be successful.”AAP Lok Sabha in-charge Amandeep Singh Mohi said, “CM Channi is being made a scapegoat for the failure of Congress government and he is being used to cater to the dalit votes in the state. If the Congress wants to benefit the dalit community then why Rawat stated that the congress will fight elections under Sidhu.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-channi-dummy-appointed-by-congress-to-woo-dalits-opposition-101632167949393.html

Bharadwaj alleged that the North Corporation has sealed the mall again now, “after eight years”, when the traders did not pay the money again.“Delhi BJP leader and former mayor Ravindra Gupta has been accused by the traders of extortion of crores of rupees and when Gupta’s blackmailing and extortion practices got exposed, the North Corporation sealed that building this morning,” Bharadwaj claimed.Gupta denied the allegation and called them baseless. He said he will file a criminal defamation case against Bhardwaj if the AAP leader does not apologise. “The owner of the mall wrongfully de-sealed the building and was running it illegally due to which it has been re-sealed,” he said.But Bhardwaj said the matter resurfaced as BJP got greedy and asked for money again. “These shopkeepers held a press conference and revealed everything about this matter,” he said.Gupta said that AAP is hand in glove with the mall owner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/north-mcd-took-bribes-to-allow-illegal-mall-to-operate-aap-101632167659107.html

As per National Crime Record Bureau data one case of sexual assault, two cases of sodomy, and five cases of attempted rape on minors were reported in Ludhiana in 2020.

In most cases, both parents of the victims were at work when the sexual assaults took place and in most cases, the victim knew the predator. The overall cases of crimes against children also went down to 225 against 328 in 2019 and 352 in 2018.117 minors abducted In 2020, 117 cases of abduction were reported in Ludhiana, of which 108 minor girls were abducted on the pretext of marriage, while nine minors were kidnapped for other reasons.The kidnapping of the two-and-a-half year-old son of a city-based hotelier had grabbed headlines in 2020.

Children brought from other states to work in factories and beg had been rescued.Four minors murdered Four minors, three boys and one girl, were found murdered in 2020.

21-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab on high alert: Lone baggage scanner at Ludhiana railway station lying defunct||While Punjab is on high alert following the busting of four terror modules by the state police, the only baggage scanner at the Ludhiana railway station is lying defunct.The cops throughout the state are on their toes since the tiffin box blast in Amritsar last month. Moreover, Ludhiana is among the busiest railway stations in the state with over 100 trains plying from or through this station daily.The X-ray baggage scanner was installed to detect suspicious things such as arms, ammunition, explosives or any other illegal substance inside the luggage of the commuters.The station has three entry points but only one baggage scanner at the entry towards platform number 1, which has not been functional for the past few days putting the security of the passengers at risk.Though the railway authorities claim to be holding high-level meetings with senior officials of Government Reserve Police and Railway Police Force after high alert was declared in Punjab for the scaling of forces here, the security lapses were found at the prime entry point of the railway station during a reality check done by Hindustan Times on Monday.No frisking, checking at entry pointThe passengers were seen entering the platform without their luggage being checked, leaving security to the mercy of God. No manual checking of the luggage was being done, either.A lady cop was seen sitting next to the defunct baggage checking machine. When asked about why the baggage was not being checked, she expressed her helplessness stating that the machine was lying defunct.Ludhiana railway station director Tarun Kumar said that the orders to fix the machine had already been given to the maintenance team: “It will be made functional soon. We have door frame metal detectors installed at all the three entry points and our security teams are doing random checking of the passengers.”He added that a meeting for the safety of the railway station was held with the additional inspector general and superintendent of police of the GRP last week.“We are regularly holding the security meetings. Another meeting with the MC officials and traffic police was also done where we requested them to get the encroachment done by the illegal vendors at the entry and exit points removed. Traffic cops have been requested to not let the rickshaws and three wheelers stand at the gates as some anti-social elements may take advantage of the rush there”, added the officer.‘Baggage scanner practically useless’Surprisingly a senior security officer on the condition of anonymity said that the baggage scanner was of no use since the station was not enclosed and had openings from many sides.Meanwhile, DSP, GRP, Balram Rana said that night patrolling on the tracks was a routine affair now. “We have increased night patrolling and our teams are also manning nakas at the outer areas daily,” said the DSP.Inspector Jaskaran Singh, GRP, said that the station remained under 24/7 CCTV surveillance as over 85 cameras had been installed here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-on-high-alert-lone-baggage-scanner-at-ludhiana-railway-station-lying-defunct-101632167471391.html
21-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A special kind of book lover||Here’s his hand-drawn painting of poet Emily Dickinson. Here’s his portrait of poet Hart Crane. The next few loose sheets have his recreations of poets Elizabeth Bishop, Wisława Szymborska, Anna Akhmatova, Robert Frost, as well as of novelists Leo Tolstoy, Thomas Mann, James Baldwin, Joan Didion and various other literary icons. Vishal Nagraj clarifies his author portraits aren’t for sale. He paints these select writers solely because he wants to say thank you to them. “It is just an expression of gratitude from a reader.”A native of “many places,” the multi-skilled Mr Nagraj, 28, also makes pop-out kirigami cards. He also collects hard-to-get editions of classic novels, as well as rare paperbacks. He does sell some of these collectibles—his loyal patrons are spread along the Delhi region, particularly in Gurugram, and also beyond the Delhi region. A day back he sent a carton of Gabriel García Márquez’s novels to a book distributor in Jammu and Kashmir.This afternoon Mr Nagraj is hanging out in a used bookstore in Old Delhi’s Daryaganj, where he often drops by to engage with casual browsers “because I love being with people who love books.” With his gaunt figure, wispy beard, and long hair, he looks like one of those imagined romantics who play guitar in full moon nights. In his Mayur Vihar apartment, “I keep my note pads by window sills, and whenever the mood strikes, I sit by a window and write a poem.”Chats with the soft-spoken Mr Nagraj are demanding. His talk is full of philosophical abstractions, and consists of long winding sentences in Hindi and English, as if he were reading from a densely written book. He is neither on Instagram, nor on Facebook, “because I want to be available to the things that surround me like paper, pencil, books… and also people.” His shoulder bag anyway is as absorbing as any social media feed. Like a magician’s hat, it produces the most amazing things. Today it contains some of his aforementioned sketches, some vintage paperbacks of western cowboy novels, an old hardbound of Tolstoy’s War and Peace (in a slipcase!), and a super-thick Sylvia Plath biography that he is currently reading. Mr Nagraj is shy of sharing his mobile number but you may spot him in Daryaganj’s used bookstores. Come after 4pm when chances of sightings are higher, particularly in Mukta Bookstore, across the road from Daryaganj Police Station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-special-kind-of-book-lover-101632167194935.html

According to police records, Patiala has recorded more than 1,200 protests over the past five months.With this kind of protest rate, roads leading to Amarinder’s residence remained heavily fortified. Local living in peripheral colonies of Amarinder’s residence had to take longer or a more time-consuming route, just to reach their homes. Sukhwinder Singh, state president of BEd-TET passed Unemployed Teachers Union, said, “We have been protesting for regularisation. Now, we will shift our protest to Channi’s home constituency Chamkaur Sahib. We have planned a state level protest outside Channi’s residence at Kharar on September 24.”Other unions of unemployed teachers, health workers and PowerCom protesters have also postponed their state level rallies to be held at Patiala. PK Sharma, of Ad hoc and Contractual Employees Union, said, “We have ended our protest in Patiala and will now protest in Channi’s constituency. Our main concern is that the government should listen to our demands, no matter who is the CM. On Sunday, we held a state-level protest march towards Navjot Singh Sidhu’s Patiala residence.”Residents of Patiala, however, have heaved sigh of relief as the city recorded no protest outside former CM residence on Monday. Traffic jams, road blockades and traffic diversions did not happen today, something that hit normal life to an extent, with police barricading on a daily basis. Hardev Singh, a local, said, “Police should lift the barricades and clear roads for free movement of vehicles. The past few months had been harrowing, as we had to take longer routes to reach our destination due to multiple protests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-change-of-guard-in-punjab-protesters-shift-focus-to-channi-s-residence-from-patiala-101632167287969.html
21-09-2021||Chandigarh||Bargari sacrilege: Faridkot court declares three dera national committee members POs||A Faridkot court on Monday declared three members of the Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda’s national committee as proclaimed offenders (PO) in connection with the 2015 Bargari sacrilege cases.Three Haryana residents — Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kaler and Harsh Dhuri — were declared POs after four arrest warrants against them returned unexecuted in two sacrilege cases wherein torn pages of a “bir” (copy of Guru Granth Sahib) were found scattered in Bargari and three derogatory posters were put up near gurdwaras at Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala villages in 2015. “The police submitted that they received the proclamation of the accused and pasted the copies of notices at different places. The accused did not appear even as the statuary period of 30 days has expired. Therefore, this court declares Harsh Dhuri, Pardeep Kaler and Sandeep Bareta as proclaimed offenders,” said judicial magistrate Tarjani in her order. The court also directed the station house officer (SHO) concerned to proceed against them under Section 174-A of the Indian Penal Code after registering an FIR. The matter was adjourned to October 11 for filing the list of property of all the accused under Section 83 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Naming the three as conspirators in the Bargari sacrilege and derogatory posters cases, the SIT had filed a challan in the court in July. Earlier, they were declared POs in three other sacrilege cases as the police failed to nab them since 2018 when they were first named in cases connected to sacrilege incidents in Moga and Bathinda districts in 2015. Bareta, Kler and Dhuri were also named as accused in the Malke and Gurusar cases. Torn pages of Guru Granth Sahib were found at Malke village in Moga district in November 2015 and Gurusar (Bhagta) village in Bathinda district in October 2015. Last year, they were named as accused and later declared PO in the case of theft of a “bir” from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village. The police failed to submit the list of properties of the accused in “bir” theft case again on Monday after which the matter was adjourned to November 29. The SIT probing the case claims that Bareta, Kler and Dhuri are the key link in Punjab’s five sacrilege incidents that sparked state-wide protests in 2015. “The instructions to execute sacrilege at Bargari, Moga and Gurusar were given by Bareta, Kler and Dhuri to the district dera committee members,” the SIT alleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bargari-sacrilege-faridkot-court-declares-three-dera-national-committee-members-pos-101632167107874.html

Precisely one person said, “Wow, what a city that would be!”But, busy in our work and lives, sometimes we are so trapped in the present that we might not even dream about a possible future. So, we argue about why an area and city without private bikes and cars cannot be. The idea of car-free is not new. The Mall Road in Shimla, and Matheran, are famous car-free areas. In more recent times, I’ve seen advertisements for townships providing an added attraction of a vehicle-free zone where children can play and cycle freely and safely. Just about a week ago, the Delhi government launched Chandni Chowk market as a beautiful pedestrian zone.However, “private-vehicle-free” should no longer be considered only a nostalgia-evoking hill-station idea or one for elite living or as tourist precincts, but an imperative mainstream need for large cities. We don’t need air pollution. We don’t need road crash deaths. We don’t need road rage. We deserve cities in which moving around is not a struggle. The solution isn’t spending our hard-earned money buying vehicles. Typically, car-free city designs envisage people walking or cycling for short distances and using public transport for longer distances. For weekend trips to grocery stores locally circulating on-call shuttles could be provided. One can buy or rent a fancy car or bike for a family outing or special occasion, but not use it for the daily commute.Harshad Abhyankar, Director, Save Pune Traffic Movement, says “What if pollution gets so out of hand that we have to make it illegal to use cars in cities? Every once in a while we decide, for example, that asbestos or saccharine or some medicine is bad for us, and decide to live without it. What if cars are next? Then we will be forced to design a city that relies solely on walk-bus-cycle. The “bus” could be in many forms: Swanky metros, long, big articulated buses, or even 8-seater shared vehicles. We would somehow design our ways around the situation, right? There may be some inconveniences, but in the bargain we will get a clean and safe city for us and our children.”The specifics of what is needed may vary in different areas. Youth groups and citizens forums could quickly determine current modes of travel, difficulties faced in walking, cycling, and public transport. The findings would lend weight to demands for improvements presented to elected representatives, the municipal and public transport administration officials. For example, a small survey conducted by the Bavdhan Citizens’ Forum with housing societies’ residents in the Bavdhan area shows the need to improve bus services as well as information about bus services. Of course, the survey numbers are small and more extensive surveys may yield richer data, but the results seem reasonable. Of 94 people travelling daily or regularly for work, only one used a cycle, three used public transport, eight used company buses, while 82 used bikes or cars. Bikes and cars are the primary modes, even for distances less than 5 km. The reasons for not using public transport include inadequate frequency and connectivity, overcrowding and lack of information about services. About 28% were not aware of PMPML bus services from Bavdhan, and among those who were aware, about 40% did not have information about the bus routes and services.The need for a change in Pune’s transport systems is so acute that more and more citizens will need to join the efforts to create it bottom-up and advocate for systemic improvements in public transport and sustainable mobility. The fun fact is that our city’s policies and plans are already in place, stating that by 2032, at least 80 per cent of the journeys will be by foot, cycle and public transport. So we must not only hold on to that dream of a largely private-vehicle-free city, but work to make it happen – individually, as a community, and with our government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/civic-sanskriti-vehicle-free-utopian-dream-must-become-reality-for-pune-city-101632166449082.html

21-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s first genome sequencing lab aims to break Covid code||Thirty-year-old research scientist Vidushi Chitalia loads a cartridge into the sequencing machine with a large display screen. The cartridge contains all that is required for carrying out genome sequencing — 20 microlitres of barcoded samples of genetic material from Covid positive persons pooled into a tiny chamber. It’s taken three days for the team, also comprising research assistants Reem Nomani (26), and Sanika Shirsat (26), to prepare the samples that made it into the machine: a select bunch of swab samples from Covid positive persons in Mumbai was first treated to inactivate the virus in a Biosafety Level 2 area; the RNA or Ribonucleic Acid (it translates genetic material to protein) was extracted and converted to complementary Dioxyribonucleic Acid (cDNA); this in turn was amplified, and cut into smaller pieces (a process called fragmenting) since the sequencer is designed for a very specific size of DNA fragments; these were tagged with linker sequences (to help link the samples for further steps like barcoding), cleaned of any impurities and barcoded for the machine — a white box slightly bigger than a microwave. These sequencing will help identify the variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. And great care has been taken to select which ones will make it into the sequencer. The samples were taken from travellers arriving at the city airport, patients who had moderate to severe infection after receiving both doses of the vaccine, people who had been re-infected with Covid and those who were admitted in an Intensive Care Unit for a prolonged period of time. “We want to focus on certain categories of patients to understand how variants impact the nature of the infection,” said Dr Jayanthi Shastri, who is at the helm of the genome sequencing facility housed inside the Kasturba Hospital’s molecular diagnostic laboratory. The lab, which works under the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital, has been operational since 2007 to study pathogens causing H1N1, dengue, and leptospirosis, among other diseases. Last week, a batch of 376 samples of Covid-19 patients was processed and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) announced that 304 samples tested positive for the Delta subtype of the Covid-causing Sars-Cov-2 virus. None tested positive for the Delta Plus variant, a variant of concern (VOC) in India. Two samples were of the 19A subtype, four were of the 20A subtype and the remaining 66 were original strain of the coronavirus. This was the second batch to be studied in what is Mumbai’s first facility to study the Covid disease-causing virus. The work being done here is crucial: it will help address the gaps in our understanding of the pandemic. For instance, do variants of the virus, such as the Delta variant prevalent in Mumbai and the rest of the state, play a role in breakthrough infections, re-infections or long Covid? This in turn would help civic and state authorities to decide the best course of action. “If the SARS-CoV-2 continues to thrive, it will keep mutating,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Om Shrivastav, who is also a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force. “Genome sequencing will be our key tool to track the mutations and prepare strategies to tackle them. The changes in the virus could be more vicious or milder, but having that knowledge is the only way to combat it and stop it from spreading rapidly,” he said. The laboratory, which was inaugurated on August 4, is not part of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) — a network of 28 laboratories across the country tasked with studying the genomes of the various variants that emerge through the course of the pandemic — but its work contributes to the larger knowledge base being created about the coronavirus and its variants. The second batch mimicked the findings from the first: A few days after its inauguration, 188 barcoded samples were sequenced. The BMC announced that nearly 65% of these samples had the more contagious B.1.617.2 or the Delta variant. None of the 188 samples tested positive for the Delta Plus variant. Out of the 93 patients from Mumbai in the first batch, 54 had needed hospitalisation, while 40 patients showed no symptoms at all. Of the Mumbai cohort, 27 patients had taken both doses of their vaccine, and 20 had received their first dose. Only four patients out of those who had been fully vaccinated needed oxygen support. India is currently sequencing only 0.7% of the positive samples, Shrivastav said. “Ideally, for a dense country like ours, we should be sequencing at least 33% samples. Europe, UK, parts of Australia and New Zealand have been doing a lot more sequencing,” he said adding that cities like Mumbai should have many more genome sequencing facilities. The genome sequencing process is a lengthy one. Smaller portions of the Covid-19 samples known as aliquots collected from across the city arrive at the laboratory every day in a cold chain. These samples are stored at –80 degrees Celsius to ensure that the RNA does not degrade during the process. The sequencer — Kasturba facility has two such machines — has a capacity of 376 samples each. In order to utilise the machine optimally, the team waits till they have a pool of 376. The team of three handles the samples in a transit room equipped with an exhaust system with a virus burning unit that is meant to trap and destroy the pathogen in case of a leak. This room and other biosafety cabinets, where the cDNA is created and amplified, are a Biosafety Level (BSL) 2A [equipped to handle pathogens with a little more than moderate risk]. So, all researchers must follow strict Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) donning and doffing protocol while working in the transit room. After inactivating the virus, the RNA is extracted. The researchers wear a laboratory coat, head cover, mask and gloves instead of a full PPE kit to extract the RNA and conduct a Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test to confirm the presence of the virus. “Only the samples that have a cycle threshold (CT) value below 30 are selected,” said Chitalia. “The CT value helps measure the viral load,” she said. The extracted RNA is converted into complementary DNA (cDNA), which is amplified in a biosafety cabinet, tagged and fragmented. Once the impurities are cleaned, each sample is barcoded and pooled before being loaded into the sequencer. The cycle in the sequencer takes another 48 hours after which the data is relayed to the computer. The server has preloaded information on all the variants identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Besides looking for the existing variants such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma or Delta among others, the researchers also keep an eye for newer mutations, while they analyse the data. The two sequencing machines and server cost ₹6.5 crore. They were donated to the hospital by American biotechnology company Illumina. The company also bore ₹1.38 crore GST and customs levied to get the machines to India from Singapore. Other pieces of equipment such as extraction system, thermal cyclers, deep freezer, ice-making machine, pipettes costing nearly ₹4 crore were funded by the ATE Chandra Foundation. An alumnus of BYL Nair, Dr Mehul Mehta who is based in the US, facilitated the donations, said Shastri explaining how the lab came to be kitted with the machines.“We started the discussion in May and it all moved so quickly,” said Shastri, who believes that the genome sequencing laboratory has an important role to play in the city’s public health landscape. “We can use the facility for any pathogen. For instance, dengue is not very conclusively identified by PCR and whole-genome sequencing can prove to be beneficial for us. Or let’s say that the H1N1 virus becomes resistant to the oseltamivir drug in the future, genome sequencing will come handy then too,” she said. As Chitalia, Nomani, and Shirsat work in a high-risk environment, vaccination is mandatory. The three also monitor themselves closely for even the slightest of symptoms. None has developed any to date. The researchers at the laboratory want to compare the 2021 variants with the 2020 virus identified as the Wuhan strain in the hope of answering several pressing questions. Why, for instance, do the variants behave differently? Last year, hospitals saw a few instances of mother-to-child transmission but the virus did not have a serious impact on babies. “Are the 2021 variants affecting children more or causing increased mortality and morbidity in the pregnant women and the children? This is something that we need to check,” Shastri said. That’s why the samples for genome sequencing are selected carefully. Soon after the Kasturba facility opened, a circular explaining the criteria for selecting the samples were sent to all the wards and hospitals: in addition to breakthrough infections and re-infections, the laboratory also wanted samples of patients who were immunocompromised, as their immunity does not kick in for the virus to be cleared out completely. In such cases, there is a possibility of intra-host variation. “Put simply, the virus undergoes mutation within the host,” said Shastri adding that medical experts are also interested in the host genomics of patients who suffer from longer hospitalisations due to Covid. But host genomics is a long-term plan at the moment. The laboratory is now focused on utilising its maximum capacity to sequence the samples from across the city and turn around the reports within a short span. Until now, samples from Mumbai were sent to Pune or Delhi for genome sequencing and the results would take anywhere between several weeks to three months. “There is no point in carrying out contact tracing if the reports come so late,” said Shastri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-first-genome-sequencing-lab-aims-to-break-covid-code-101632166029140.html

21-09-2021||Chandigarh||Covid: Uptick in cases after four weeks in Chandigarh tricity area||After a steady decline for four weeks, the cumulative Covid-19 cases in the tricity saw an uptick in the week ending September 19. A total of 70 cases were reported between September 13 and 19, a 6% rise as compared to 66 cases in the previous week. Of the 70 cases, 29 cases were reported from Mohali, followed by 27 in Chandigarh and 14 in Panchkula.The tricity also reported two deaths in the past week (both from Mohali), raising concerns across the three health departments. Medical experts believe the uptick is due to apathy and complacency on the part of locals, who have stopped following Covid-appropriate behaviour, especially wearing of face masks.Since the week ending August 15, when 86 people had tested positive in the tricity, the weekly figures had been on a decline till the latest uptick. This month (till September 20), the tricity has recorded 181 cases, with 85 in Mohali, 67 in Chandigarh and 29 in Panchkula. In comparison, 323 cases had surfaced in August, with 154 in Mohali, 124 in Chandigarh and 45 in Panchkula.In terms of fatalities, five people have died in Chandigarh this month, followed by two in Mohali and none in Panchkula.Seven new cases in UTOn Monday, seven fresh Covid-19 cases surfaced in Chandigarh. Those infected reside in Sectors 35, 39, 47, 50 and Raipur Khurd. Meanwhile, Panchkula reported two cases (Sectors 12 and 27) while one was reported in Mohali, taking the tricity’s daily tally to 10. There was no virus-related death across the three jurisdictions.The active caseload in tricity stands at 93, with 41 patients in Chandigarh, 34 in Mohali and 18 in Panchkula.So far, 65,188 people have tested positive in Chandigarh, of whom 64,329 have recovered and 818 have died. In Panchkula, 30,714 cases have surfaced, 30,322 patients have been discharged and 377 have succumbed. Mohali leads with 68,695 cases. While 67,599 patients have recovered, 1,062 have died.‘No space for complacency’ “The daily tally of Covid-19 cases is increasing in Mohali, but is still in single digit. Complacency at this time can invite a third wave,” said Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur, while urging people to help the administration in controlling the surge by following all guidelines. “Wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing at public places should be strictly followed,” she said.According to Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services, Chandigarh, immunity formed in people after getting infected during the second wave in April and May has started waning after a four month gap. “Due to this, cases may start rising again. People must wear face masks and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, but most importantly, get vaccinated at the earliest,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-uptick-in-cases-after-four-weeks-in-chandigarh-tricity-area-101632165667793.html

These infections lead to a drop in platelets and due to the current pandemic, schools, colleges, social organisations and private offices are shut and so, the usual blood donation drives carried out by these organisations have come to a halt leading to a shortage of blood in the district. To overcome this shortage of blood and to ensure that no one faces any difficulty due to the shortage, a massive all taluka-level blood donation drive will be organised in the 13 talukas in the district on September 22.”The blood donation camp will be organised in collaboration with district officials at the taluka level, doctors from the District Hospital Aundh, and blood banks.Dr Milind Kulkarni, pathalogist at the District Hospital Aundh who has been appointed as the nodal officer for the drive, said, “We have been facing a shortage of blood now mainly because post monsoon, the number of dengue, malaria and chikungunya cases have gone up and so has the demand for platelets. The taluka level officials have been asked to coordinate the drive along with multiple blood banks from the city and rural areas that have come forward to organise this drive along with us. Anyone aged 18 to 65 years can donate blood; the body weight of the person must be more than 45kg and the haemoglobin must be 12.5. If anyone has donated blood prior to this drive, a four-month gap in case of women and a three-month gap in case of men must be maintained. Persons with a recent history of serious ailments such as typhoid, dengue, chikungunya, zika or tuberculosis, or with habits like alcoholism, or those who have had any major surgeries in the past one year, or those who have got a tattoo in the last one year, will not be eligible for blood donation.”Human blood primarily has three components namely, red blood cells that transport oxygen to the body’s organs and tissues, white blood cells that help the body fight infections, and platelets that help the blood to clot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-district-wide-blood-donation-camp-on-september-22-to-tackle-blood-shortage-101632165608072.html

The Kasba Ganpati immersion ended at 11.29am; the Tambdi Jogeshwari immersion at 11.30am; Guruji Talim at 12.37pm; Tulshibaug at 1.15pm; and Kesariwada at 1.17pm. The immersion of other important idols took slightly longer, ending at 6.38pm. Bhausaheb Rangari ended at 2.32pm; Dagdusheth Halwai at 6.27pm; and Akhil Mandai Mandal at 6.38pm.Priyanka Narnavare, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Pune police, said, “The immersion of the major public Ganpati idols ended with Akhil Mandai at 6.38pm. The home immersions and community immersion ponds were on till around 10 to 10.30pm.” Zone 1 comprises the old city which houses all the major idols and draws huge crowds during the 10-day festival especially on the last day.While the police were out on the streets in areas where crowds usually gather, Covid-19 restrictions made for smaller gatherings. Commissioner Amitabh Gupta and joint commissioner Ravindra Shisve were also on the streets on visarjan day.“There was dhol playing near the Tulshibaug Ganpati . We went there and seized the dhols and ensured that they did not play all day. That was the only incident. We have not registered any cases so far,” said DCP Narnavare.Among other festivities, the reverberating dhol-tasha sounds that announce the arrival and immersion of Lord Ganesh have been conspicuous by their absence over the past two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punes-ganeshotsav-ends-on-sombre-note-major-idols-immersed-by-6-40pm-on-sunday-101632165428281.html

Ranaut added that she had lost faith in the court as it had asked her to appear before it without providing any sufficient reason and an on record order which justified compelling appearance of accused in a bailable, non-cognisable and compoundable offence. “This court is threatening the accused on every date of issuing an arrest warrant without giving any sufficient cause and reason,” her application stated. Metropolitan magistrate RR Khan has now posted the matter to November 15 as the application for the transfer of the case is likely to be heard by the CMM court on October 1. Akhtar’s counsel, advocate Jay Bhardwaj, opposed the move to adjourn the matter, saying that there was no stay on the hearing. In her fresh complaint against Akhtar, Ranaut has alleged that after her dispute with co-star Hrithik Roshan, Akthar had called her and her sister Rangoli Chandel to his house in Juhu with “mala fide intentions and ulterior motives”. The actor has stated that Akhtar called her and Chandel on the pretext of acting as a mediator but instead threatened her. “We had not asked him to intervene in our matter,” she said. She further alleged that Akthar forced her to tender a written apology to her Roshan, thus forcefully seeking to create a document in a favour of her co-star. Ranaut has also alleged that Akthar had said that if she failed to apologise to Roshan, she would have to commit suicide because they would her in jail as they had found all the clues and evidences and have the case completely in their hands. The actor has said in her complaint that by mala fide and mischief and intentionally indulging in the above serious cognisable offences, Akhtar caused her immense mental torture and trauma. She prayed that her complaint against Akthar was delayed as her family allowed her to do so only now and hence, the delay should be condoned. However, she has also stated that they had spoken about it earlier on different platforms and the links of the same are available. In the last hearing on September 14, the magistrate had warned Ranaut’s counsel that if she failed to appear before the court for the next hearing on – for the appearance of both the parties and to decide on Ranaut’s application on permanent exemption – September 20, it could issue an arrest warrant against her. Akhtar had filed a defamation complaint against Ranaut last November for allegedly making defamatory and baseless comments against in a television interview. The magistrate had directed Juhu police in December 2020 to conduct an inquiry into Akhtar’s allegations and initiated criminal proceedings against the actor. Ranaut had challenged the process in Bombay high court, which dismissed her petition in the first week of September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/actor-kangana-ranaut-files-counter-plaint-against-javed-akhtar-101632165250085.html

21-09-2021||Other||HC stays cutting of trees in Rupnagar, Hoshiarpur||Chandigarh The Punjab and Haryana high court has stayed the cutting of Khair trees in three gram panchayats of Rupnagar and Hoshiarpur. The order came on the plea of advocate HC Arora seeking intervention against auction notices that the three gram panchayats had issued for the sale of these Khair trees. The three panchayats are Sabor and Jatoli in Nurpur Bedi block in Rupnagar and Dulmiwal in Dasuya block of Hoshiarpur. According to the plea, 5,375 Kher trees are to be sold in Sabor, 2,703 trees in Jatoli and 198 in Dulmiwal. The auction was to take place on September 22 in the Rupnagar block and September 30 for Dasuya block.Arora had argued that gram panchayats had ordered the trees to be cut and sold without any justification and without any concrete plan to plant substitute trees in their place. There is no transparency in the procedure of considering and approving the proposal for auctioning the trees, it was claimed adding that in the recent past there has been a considerable increase in the number of auctions of trees being ordered by the gram panchayats, with the result that the forest cover in the state is depleting.Taking note of the submissions, the high court has sought response from all concerned, including the state government and ordered that trees be cut after taking permission from the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hcstays-cutting-of-trees-in-rupnagar-hoshiarpur-101632165128979.html

21-09-2021||Chandigarh||Water woes in Mohali set to end in December||After missing two deadlines in the past nine years, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has set December 1 as the final deadline to start the additional supply of 20 MGD (million gallon daily) water from Phases 5 and 6 of the Kajauli waterworks.The Kajauli waterworks is located on the Bhakra mainline canal near Morinda in Rupnagar district, from where water requirement of Chandigarh, Mohali and Chandimandir are met.Even as Chandigarh has already started receiving its additional share of 35 MGD water from the two new phases, the supply to Mohali got delayed because of pending work at the water treatment plant coming up in Singhpura.The project has missed two deadlines: December 2020 and July 2021. Now, 400 workers are on the job to meet the new deadline.“The project has been delayed due to the pandemic. The construction work of the water treatment plant is going on in full swing and 80% work is completed. We have set the deadline of December 1 for its completion, and on the same day, Mohali residents will start getting an additional 20 MGD water,” said GMADA chief engineer Davinder Singh. Shortage touching 12 MGD in peak summerFor the past several years, Mohali has been reeling under an acute water shortage as the gap between the demand and supply stretches up to 12 MGD during peak summer.At present, against a peak demand of 32 MGD, Mohali gets 10 MGD water from the older phases of Kajauli waterworks and 10 MGD from 75 tubewells.In May 2012, GMADA had started laying pipelines to supply additional water from the Kajauli waterworks to Mohali and Chandigarh at a cost of ₹200 crore, half of which was borne by Chandigarh.However, the delay in Singhpura plant, being built by a Gujarat-based company for ₹100 crore, put a spanner in the project. One of the reasons was indecision: whether to go for 5 MGD capacity or 20 MGD? GMADA finally went with the second option. The pandemic, too, played a part by creating labour shortage. MC councillor Kuljeet Singh Bedi, who had moved the high court over water shortage in Mohali, said: “The project has been delayed due to the lackadaisical attitude of officials concerned. It is unfortunate that the public had to suffer for years.”Kharar to get 5 MGD water from same lineThe 20 MGD additional water to be supplied under the project will also cater to the needs of Kharar and Morinda. In order to overcome the scarcity of drinking water and problem of rapid depletion of groundwater, Kharar will get its share of 5 MGD potable water drawn from Phases 5 and 6 of the Kajauli waterworks, said the GMADA chief engineer“Kharar is coming up with the infrastructure, which will take some time for completion. Till then, Mohali will be using its share of 5 MGD water,” he said, adding that even Morinda will get 1 MGD water from the same pipeline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/water-woes-in-mohali-set-to-end-coming-december-101632165009183.html
21-09-2021||Mumbai||Facing BJP attack, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi partners come across as divided||As Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders continued to level allegations of financial misdeeds worth crores of rupees against sitting ministers and central agencies sent a notice to a minister, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners displayed lack of coordination. A day after BJP leader Kirit Somaiya was not allowed to enter Kolhapur, where he was headed to file a complaint against Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) minister Hasan Mushrif, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut distanced chief minister Uddhav Thackeray from the action, saying it was taken by the home department – a portfolio that is held by Nationalist Congress Party’s Dilip Walse Patil. It is likely that the Sena wants to show that it is not giving much importance to Somaiya but various instances in the past few months show that the three parties are not on the same page while countering a very aggressive BJP. “If you are using central agencies at the behest of the Centre, and making allegations against prominent leaders and ministers in Maharashtra, which could result in a law-and-order issue, the state home department can act on it. I spoke to the chief minister and he has clearly said that the chief minister’s office is not involved in the action [against BJP leader] and that it was done by the home department,” said Raut, insisting that there is no vendetta politics. Raut further added that the CM does not involve himself in such “small matters”. “There is no need to target the chief minister on this issue. A chief minister doesn’t get involved in such small matters,” he said. Hours later, Walse Patil also clarified that CMO was not involved in the action against Somaiya. “The CMO has no connection; it was the decision of the home department.” A political analyst added Walse Patil’s clarification was to show coordination between the two parties. “The district administration informed the home department about the situation that it observed in Kolhapur yesterday. Had the two groups had come face to face, it would have led to more issues. Based on that, they suggested that prohibitary action must be taken and therefore the district collector of Kolhapur issued a notice,” the minister said. Amid buzz of lack of coordination between the ruling allies, MVA’s coordination committee met in Mumbai to chalk out damage control measures. The committee has two senior ministers from each of the three parties. Thackeray also held a meeting with Walse Patil and senior IPS officials over the political drama involving Somaiya, which started on Sunday. Sena minister and member of the coordination committee Subhash Desai said the meeting was held on Monday. “We keep meeting regularly depending on the agenda and there is good coordination. We had a brief meeting today and may meet next week again,” Desai said, refusing to divulge if the meeting was prompted by the events on Monday. NCP minister and party spokesperson Nawab Malik said, “The decision [to not allow Somaiya] was made by the Kolhapur district magistrate and not even by the home department. There is no lack of coordination.” While individual ministers, who face allegations, have come out defending themselves along with statements their party colleagues, but there is no coordinated effort to discredit or counter the allegations made by BJP so far. Political analyst Hemant Desai said there have been several examples in the nearly two-year tenure of the Sena-led alliance government where parties and state government have lacked coordination. “The NRC-CAA bill was probably the first thing where the three parties had differences. The Shiv Sena supported the bill in Lok Sabha, but when the NCP and Congress displayed displeasure, they abstained from voting in the Upper House of Parliament. The attack on the Sena following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput was not handled well. The lack of coordination was also seen when energy minister Nitin Raut announced a decision to waive power bill, but finance minister Ajit Pawar didn’t agree. Anil Deshmukh and Sachin Vaze episodes were poorly handled by the alliance. They had opportunity to attack BJP in Mohan Delkar case but they didn’t,” Desai said. Reacting to Raut’s statement, Desai said that the Shiv Sena has passed the buck on to NCP Earlier, the MVA had handled the allegations against former home minister Anil Deshmukh poorly. Senior Sena leaders had said that the CM was upset with the former home minister and wanted him out over the handling of the Mansukh Hiran-Antilia case. Sena minister Anil Parab, who is close to the Shiv Sena chief, was served a notice by the Enforcement Directorate last month. Since last year, the ED has sent notices to Sena leaders, including legislator Pratap Sarnaik, MP Sanjay Raut’s wife, MP Bhawana Gawali. Also, BJP leaders have been targeting people close to Thackeray, including Milind Narvekar, close aide of the Sena boss. The Sena does not have a definite plan to counter the BJP so far. Senior party leader said the idea is to wait and watch and tackle the allegations legally. “We will fight the string of false allegations against party members legally. Whatever allegations one may put on us, they should be proven in the court of law,” said a senior functionary. Earlie, Raut that there would be no change in the political landscape amid pressure from central agencies.“We will face the situation. This government is not cowardly. This fight under the leadership of chief minister and Sharad Pawar will continue. No matter how many allegations are levelled, we will not bow down,” the Sena leader said. “The courts will decide whether the allegations are true or false. The attempt to destabilise our government will not succeed. Let them make allegations, our government is strong.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/facing-bjp-attack-maharashtra-vikas-aghadi-partners-come-across-as-divided-101632164950014.html

21-09-2021||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh’s premises searched: I-T department suspects ₹17-cr tax evasion||After carrying out searches at the premises of firms, trusts and organisations linked to Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Anil Deshmukh, the Income-Tax (I-T) department suspects that the former Maharashtra home minister committed a tax evasion of ₹17 crore. The department has begun investigation in the case, it said on Monday, in a statement without naming Deshmukh. However, senior I-T officials confirmed that the assessee in question is Deshmukh.Deshmukh’s lawyer Inderpal Singh had in past said, “The I-T department’s action on Deshmukh is very surprising as his tax assessments (files) are clear. He has never received any intimation or notice in the past 20 years from the I-T department. The action (searches) is nothing, but pure political harassment.”Deshmukh was not available for comment.On Friday, the I-T Department had carried out a search operation at more than 30 premises spread across Nagpur, Mumbai, New Delhi and Kolkata. The tax agency said that during the course of the operation, many incriminating documents, loose sheets and other digital evidences were seized. “These evidences clearly indicate the involvement of the [Deshmukh’s] group in unaccounted financial transactions made outside the regular books of accounts including inflation of expenses, money laundering, bogus donation receipts, unaccounted cash expenses,” the agency said.The agency claims that it has evidence on the receipts of bogus donation in the hands of the trust run by the assesse group through money laundering and using Delhi-based companies to the extent of ₹4.00 crore. This clearly substantiates laundering of the unaccounted income of the assesse routed as donation to the trust, the agency officials added.Further, specific evidences have been unearthed which reveal that three educational institutions of the trust have indulged in inflation of expenses in which salaries paid to the employees were partly collected back in cash. Such evidences were found for several financial years amounting to more than ₹12 crore, the I-T department said.During the search, it was also detected that the trust, apart from suppression of receipts, has paid substantial amounts to brokers for arranging admissions. Such payments, of about ₹87 lakh, have been paid in cash and are completely unaccounted for, officials have said.“Evidence found during the search clearly indicates concealment of income to the extent of about ₹17 crore,” the I-T department statement read.Several bank lockers found during the course of the search operation have been put under prohibitory orders. The evidence gathered during the search is being examined and further investigations are in progress, the statement released by Surabhi Ahluwalia, commissioner of I-T (media and technical policy) and spokesperson of Central Board of Direct Taxes, read.Earlier the Enforcement Directorate has also claimed that Deshmukh had used “paper” companies to route the money as donations to an educational trust headed by his family, which runs engineering and polytechnic colleges in Nagpur. According to ED, the money was first sent to two brothers in Delhi, who operated bogus companies, and at the behest of Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh, diverted the cash as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, a trust controlled by the ex-minister and his family.Deshmukh has been at the centre of controversies this year. On August 23, ED had filed a charge sheet against his personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and assistant Kundan Shinde in a money laundering case, in which the former minister is the main accused. The charge sheet also includes a statement from dismissed Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze, who is one of the accused in the Antilla explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases.In his statement to ED, Vaze has claimed that ₹40 crore was collected from 10 deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) and “paid” to Deshmukh and another minister for “letting the order of then city police commissioner Param Bir Singh to transfer them go through”.The money laundering case against Deshmukh and his aides was registered after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a first information report (FIR) against the minister on April 21. The basis of the FIR was the corruption allegations made by Singh who had alleged that Deshmukh had demanded a monthly collection of ₹100 crore from Mumbai’s bars and restaurants, a claim that eventually forced the NCP leader to resign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anil-deshmukh-s-premises-searched-i-t-department-suspects-17-cr-tax-evasion-101632164887769.html

After thunderstorm on Monday evening, chances for rain will continue in the coming days, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Rains during four months from June to September are considered monsoon.

The police believe that the duo have duped multiple people in the city in the same manner and have urged other victims to come forward and register a case.The theft happened in Sai nagar area along Upper Kondhwa road in Pune on September 16 between 7:30pm and 8pm, according to police. The complainant and his friend lost a total of ₹2,01,000 in the process. “The complainant is a hotel management graduate who had left his job during the lockdown. He needed UAE currency to carry with himself. His friend’s driver was approached by these two who first gave him a 50 dirham note which the driver gave to the complainant friend, who is a hotelier. When the friend exchanged it, it yielded ₹700. The next time, the friend himself went and got eight notes which again got him over ₹4,000 on exchange. So this time the complainant went with a higher amount along with a few thousand from his friend as well. When he reached for the exchange, he was duped,” said assistant police inspector Rajesh Usgaonkar who is investigating the case.The victim arrived at the spot in lane number 3 of the area with multiple Indian currency notes of ₹500 and ₹2000 in a plastic bag.The two men arrived with washing soap wrapped in a fabric that looked like currency notes wrapped in handkerchief, according to the complaint in the case.The two men made a hasty exchange and pushed the man on the ground before fleeing the spot, the man told the police.A case in the matter was registered under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 392 (theft), and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code at Bibwewadi police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/two-dupe-man-of-2-lakh-in-fraudulent-currency-exchange-101632164287797.html
21-09-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala: A day after bail, journalist booked in another case||A day after an Ambala-based journalist of a Hindi daily was released on bail after being arrested for allegedly promoting enmity between different groups through a news report, he was booked under charges of defamation, extortion and intimidation in another case on Sunday.The scribe, Sunil Brar, has called the development a “witch-hunt” against him. The second case has been registered on the complaint of Vikram Katyal, who works at the municipal council office in Ambala Sadar. He alleged a news report written by Brar on July 30 had spoiled his image. The complaint was submitted to the Haryana home minister Anil Vij during a public darbar on Saturday.Katyal alleged that Brar frequently visits his office and seeks gifts and cash, and wrote a baseless news against him, without his quotes, after he failed to meet his demands.“After reading the news, my father started remaining ill, and on August 21, he died of a cardiac arrest. Earlier this month, he (Brar) visited my office again and intimidated me (with) dire consequences. Now, his recent arrest boosted my morale and I decided to complain against him,” the complaint reads. Inspector Vijay Kumar, station in-charge, Ambala Cantt police station, said Brar has been booked under Sections 385 (putting a person in fear of death or of grievous hurt, in order to commit extortion), 500 (extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. “The matter is under investigation,” he said.Last Thursday, a case was registered against Brar and his colleague Sandeep Sharma at the same police station for publishing a news report about the arrest of a purported ISI-linked terrorist by the Punjab Police in Ambala. Brar was arrested on Friday and was released on a regular bail the next day, while Sharma is yet to be arrested. Reacting to the recent case, Brar, a journalist for over nine years, alleged the government was trying to harass him again and again, but he won’t bow down. “They were unsuccessful in the first case as I got justice from court; so they decided to persecute me again. I will join the investigation whenever they call me, but I won’t stop writing news that questions the establishment. Our management is also dealing with the cases at their own level,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-a-day-after-bail-journalist-booked-in-another-case-101632164228859.html

We don’t have any hope to go back to China,” a third-year medical student, on the condition of anonymity, said.NMC is the apex body administering medical education in India. Students are writing to the commission to allow them a mid-course transfer to medical colleges outside India. However, NMC has not approved such transfers. Dr Aruna Vanikar, president of undergraduate courses, NMC, was unavailable for a comment.For almost 20 months, Indian medical students enrolled for courses in China have not been able to return to their campuses amid travel restrictions. Students have kicked off a new semester online at the beginning of the month.They had returned to India last year amid a raging pandemic as their universities imposed lockdowns. Many left their belongings behind hoping to return to campuses soon. However, more than a year on, the chances of their return remain uncertain as China continues to impose a travel ban for international students. Only those from South Korea and the United States of America have been allowed to return so far.In June, the external affairs ministry had issued a notice in favour of students in international universities, who are stuck in India due to the pandemic. The notice had asked such students to write to its overseas Indian affairs (OIA) office about difficulties in reaching their university. “Indian students studying abroad who are stuck in India owing to Covid-19 pandemic restrictions and mobility issues can send their coordinates, that is, email id and mobile number to OIA-2 division at emails: us.oia2@mea.gov.in and so1oia2@mea.gov.in,” said the notice on the official website.Thereafter, affected students had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene in the matter and facilitate the students’ return through an open letter. However, there’s been no response yet.Meanwhile, mental stress and anxiety continues to grow among students attending lectures online. “The MBBS course requires students to gain practical experience. For almost two years, we’ve been bereft of that. It’s starting to bother my confidence,” said a fourth-year MBBS student of Jianghan University, Wuhan, who identified herself as Neha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mbbs-students-enrolled-in-chinese-varsities-look-for-mid-year-transfer-to-other-countries-101632164227765.html

21-09-2021||Delhi||Plea seeks to de-recognise AAP, HC seeks Centre, Delhi govt, ECI responses||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Monday sought the response of the Centre, Delhi government and Election Commission of India on a plea seeking de-recognition of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for organising and promoting Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations using funds from the state coffers.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Amit Bansal issued notices to only the three authorities and not to the chief minister and other cabinet ministers of the Delhi government.It granted time to the authorities to file their reply on the plea by advocate M L Sharma seeking direction to de-recognise AAP as a political party and remove chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and other ministers from the constitutional office due to alleged deliberate breach of the Constitution and the Representation of People’s Act in the interest of general public.“Keep your answer ready next time as to what you want to say on the issues involved in this writ petition,” the court said.Advocate Sharma said that the state cannot be allowed to fund the Haj pilgrimage from the state exchequer. The plea was opposed by senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, arguing that it was a totally motivated and mischievous petition coloured as a public interest litigation (PIL), and needs to be dismissed with heavy costs.He also said the decision was taken to prevent religious congregations amid the Covid-19 pandemic and as the Delhi government had prohibited setting up of pandals to prevent overcrowding, the chief minister had merely requested the media to cover the celebration for citizens’ participation from their residences.Mehra said the government facilitating religious celebration is not new and it is done every time during the Kumbh Mela and Amarnath Yatra, pointing out that it is the solemn duty of the state to protect public health.“It is a mischievous petition. An attempt is being made through this petition that somehow some kind of communal disharmony should be instigated,” Mehra contended.“Various governments across the board… There are Kumbh Mela, Amarnath Yatra, Mansorvar Yatra. It is the solemn duty of the State and the Union that the people who have certain faith, their public health is looked into, they are given good kind of facilities while these yatras are there. It is a laudable objective,” he further said.The plea, while seeking registration of an FIR, has also sought to declare that religious ceremony or promotion or funding for religious work or trust in any manner by the state treasury attracts sections 408 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of IPC. It also sought to declare this act as illegal, arbitrary and unconstitutional.The petition said the AAP-led Delhi government organised a Ganesh Chaturthi event on September 10 which was broadcast live on television channels. It said in terms of the constitutional mandate laid down by the Supreme Court, the state cannot promote religious celebrations.The high court had earlier dismissed Sharma’s plea seeking to declare as illegal the Delhi government’s move of organising Ganesh Chaturthi from state treasury and releasing advertisement, saying the petition was filed hurriedly and without doing proper homework. It granted him liberty to file a fresh plea with proper averments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/plea-seeks-to-de-recognise-aap-hc-seeks-centre-delhi-govt-eci-responses-101632163690271.html

21-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai saw 21 per cent more Ganesh immersions||This year saw 21% more Ganesh idol immersions in the city compared to last year, according to the data of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). According to BMC figures, in 2021, 164,761 idols were immersed across 246 spots, including 73 natural and 176 artificial, compared to 135,000 in 2020 and 196,000 in 2019. Owing to Covid-19 outbreak, for the second year in a row, the BMC had urged citizens to conduct immersion at their homes or buildings to reduce crowding at natural immersion spots. Usage of artificial ponds for immersion doubled from 33,000 in 2019 to 70,000 in 2020, and the increasing trend continued in 2021 also. The BMC in a statement said, “This year 79,129 idols have been immersed in artificial lakes. The immersion of the remaining 85,632 idols was conducted at natural spots. Of the 79,129 idols immersed in artificial lakes, 75,687 were domestic idols. The remaining 3,502 Ganesh idols belonged to Ganeshotsav mandals. Considering these statistics, it is seen that the citizens of Mumbai have responded significantly to the immersion of idols in artificial immersion sites.” The statement further added, “A total of 85,632 idols were immersed at natural immersion spots of the city, of which 82,339 were Ganesh idols and others were idols of Gauri. Of the total 82,339, 77,814 were domestic Ganesh idols and 4,525 were idols of the Ganesh mandals.” Of the 164,761 idols immersed, the highest number of immersions, 66,299, was on the fifth day, 48,716 on the first day and 34,452 on the 10th day.

21-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai needs 9 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to fully vaccinate its adult population||The city needs another 9 million doses of vaccine to fully inoculate its estimated adult population with both doses against Covid-19. Civic officials said they would be able to achieve this target by year-end if they receive at least 3 million doses every month. According to the civic estimates, Mumbai’s adult population is around 9.07 million or 9,078,952 to be precise. These estimates have been drawn from the 2011 census and projected mid-year population growth. With two doses mandated for each individual, the city requires a total of 18.1 million doses. As of Monday, the city had already administered 11.2 million doses, leaving a gap of 7 million more doses to cover the estimated adult population entirely. The civic body is also counting an additional 2 million doses as many individuals who have taken the vaccine in Mumbai were from outside the city, mainly from other parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). “About four out of 10 people taking vaccines in Mumbai are from out of the city,” said the city’s immunisation officer Dr Sheela Jagtap. “We have been taking regular updates from vaccination centres in the city to get an estimate of doses administered to people from out of Mumbai. Considering all factors, Mumbai requires another 9 million doses to cover its own population,” she said. The city’s target population, according to the state government, is on the higher side. Initially, the state considered the National Family Health Survey-5 data and had estimated the city’s adult population to be 9.6 million. In the latest target given to Mumbai, the state has estimated the city’s adult population to be 9.2 million, slightly higher than the estimates by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Early this month, Mumbai became the first district in Maharashtra to complete administering 10 million doses. As of September 16, the city has covered 69% of the population aged between 18 and 44 with the first dose and 16% with both doses. In the 45 to 59 age group, the city has covered 95% population with at least one dose and 60% with both doses. In the 60-plus category, Mumbai achieved 100% coverage with one dose and 71% coverage with both doses. The city’s overall vaccination coverage stands at 83% with one dose and 35% with both doses. The pace of vaccination in the city has picked up this month with nearly 1.4 million doses administered by September 15. The city had administered 2.1 million doses in August and 1.7 million in July. While private hospitals have accumulated a large stock of about 9.8 million doses, some have stepped forward to administer the doses as a part of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the quota of vaccination for the city has increased this month. “We have the capacity to administer nearly 200,000 doses a day. If we get a higher number of doses, we will be able to cover all the adult population by year-end,” he said, adding that some buffer time may be required for a few people as Covishield vaccine has an 84-day gap between two doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-needs-9-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-to-fully-vaccinate-its-adult-population-101632163271769.html

21-09-2021||Delhi||Bids invited to run coaching centres in vacant municipal school buildings in Delhi||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to allow private players to run coaching centres or vocational training centres in some of its vacant civic school buildings and has invited bids for letting out 14 such educational institutes in the first phase.Officials said the bids have been invited by the remunerative projects cell of the civic body and the process should be expected by October 22.Among the 14 school buidings going under e-auction are four in Narela, seven in Sadar-Paharganj zone, and one each in Karol Bagh, Civil Lines and Keshav Puram zones. Some of the schools, which are being rented out in the first phase, include Tajpur Kalan boys school, Baljitpur girls school, Barwala girls school, Salahpur Majra girls school, Kashmere Gate Boys school and Chahalpuri primary school. Schools located in the Walled City in the Sadar-Paharganj zone includes primary schools located in Gali Razia Begum, Mohalla Niyariyan, Pahari Imli and Phatak Badwalan.The North MCD runs 714 municipal primary schools, which cater largely to children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, have seen their enrolment numbers declining steadily.Enrolment data from the civic body shows that the North MCD-run primary schools had 3.7 lakh students in 2012-13 which decreased to 3.1 lakh in 2016-17. A senior official from the education department of the North corporation said that around 2.3 lakh children were enrolled in municipal primary schools till August. “The infrastructure in these vacant buildings is getting wasted and a portion of the revenue generated from this project will be provided to the education department,” said the official. Khagesh Jha, a Supreme Court lawyer and an education activist who heads the organisation Forum for Indian Parents, said that more than 20 lakh kids are estimated to be out of the schooling system in Delhi and the civic bodies should focus on bringing these kids to the fold instead of renting out vacant school buildings. “There is already a shortage of land for setting up new government schools. The municipal body should not use school buildings for revenue generation purposes. The population of Delhi is rising and the requirements of schools will only increase,” he added.Jogi Ram Jain, the standing committee chairman of the north corporation, did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bids-invited-to-run-coaching-centres-in-vacant-municipal-school-buildings-in-delhi-101632163267651.html
21-09-2021||Delhi||Stubble fire: Bio-decomposer solution to be prepared from Sept 24, says Gopal Rai||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Monday said that the government is set to prepare a bio-decomposer solution to be sprayed on paddy fields to organically decompose stubble. The process will begin on September 24 and the solution will be sprayed across fields by October 5, said Rai.“Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will initiate the process of preparing the bio-decomposer solution in Delhi on September 24. We will spray the solution for free across Delhi’s farmlands by October 5. This will give enough time to farmers to sow the next crop,” Rai said during a press conference.The solution will be prepared by the horticulture department nursery in Najafgarh’s Kharkhari Nahar. So far the agriculture department has estimated that about 4,000 acres of farmland need to be sprayed. “This is double the demand from the previous year. In case the demand increases, we are prepared to take care of it as well. Most of the paddy farming takes place in northwest and south Delhi,” Rai said.While Delhi farmers burn just about 1% stubble, smoke from stubble burning in neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana is a major contributor to Delhi’s winter pollution.Last, year, the Delhi government tied up with the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Pusa, which developed a decomposer capsule that could be converted into a liquid solution and sprayed on fields with crop stubble. The solution, once sprayed on the fields, decomposes the stubble into compost over 20 days, which can be used by farmers to treat the fields as well.The minister also said that about 10 litres of spray are required for an acre of land. For this, four capsules are needed. “Around ₹25 lakh were spent last year in the process all over Delhi last year. Now that the area has doubled, the cost will also double, but it is extremely cost-effective as a solution to curb air pollution,” said Rai.Last year, the Delhi government set up a centralised plant for the large-scale production of the solution at the Kharkhari Nahar village. He added that the entire process of preparation of the solution will be monitored by the scientists and experts of IARI Pusa. A 25-member committee formed by the government will look after the implementation of the solution across farmlands in the city. “They will reach out to farmers to take stock of the size of their land. All the farmers have to do is fill up forms to inform us about to the date and size of their field and we will reach them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/stubble-fire-bio-decomposer-solution-to-be-prepared-from-sept-24-says-gopal-rai-101632163208755.html
21-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s active Covid cases dip to 41,672, lowest in seven months||As active Covid-19 cases dipped below 42,000 for the first time in seven months, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said there was no indication of a third wave hitting the state as of now. The state administration, however, will be watching the situation for a fortnight due to the festival season. Maharashtra recorded 2,583 fresh infections on Monday, pushing the count to 6,524,498. The tally of active cases reduced to 41,672 as 3,836 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours. It was for the first time in the past seven months when active cases dipped to below 42,000 since the second wave of Covid-19 hit the state. On February 2, the number of active cases stood at 41,586. The state on Monday also reported 28 casualties, pushing toll to 138,546. Ahmednagar reported the highest toll with 12 deaths.Tope said there is yet no indication of a third wave in the state. “As of now, there is no indication of a potential third wave in Maharashtra. However, the daily tally is likely to increase owing to crowding to celebrate festivals. But if we ramp up the vaccination drive, it will help in containing the transmission rate,” Tope said while talking to reporters in Jalna on Monday.He added, “The state is vaccinating 1.3-1.4 million people a day and wants people to seriously follow all Covid rules. We intend to vaccinate 1.5 to 2 million beneficiaries a day and require a stock of 30 million doses every month. We have also intimated the Central government and are hoping to get the increased stock of vaccines.”The state government is not considering re-imposing fresh curbs anywhere in the state as of now as there is still no rise in daily figures.According to health experts, the impact of the festivals will be seen only after a period of two weeks and a third wave may hit the state by December or January. Earlier, the Central government directed the state government to take precautions during upcoming festivals.Maharashtra has maintained a trend of 3,000-4,000 Covid cases a day for the past two weeks, however, daily testing has also reduced in this period. On Sunday, it reported 3,413 new Covid cases and conducted 153,985 tests.On September 12, the state conducted 143,791 tests; 108,216 tests on September 13, 137,190 tests on September 14; 135,785 on September 15; 168,793 on September 16; 179,246 on September 17; and 165,363 tests on September 18.With 417 new Covid cases, Mumbai reported a total 738,518 cases till date. It also recorded five fatalities, taking the toll to 16,058.In the past 24 hours, the state tested 135,925 samples and had a positivity rate of 1.90%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 11.41%, according to the data issued by the state health department.The state also vaccinated 861,168 people on Monday and has administered a total of 74,295,248 doses till date, according to the data available on Co-Win portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-active-covid-cases-dip-to-41-672-lowest-in-seven-months-101632163207633.html
21-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Noise levels during Ganesh Chaturthi lowest in 18 years at 93.1dB||Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Mumbai celebrated its quietest Ganesh Chaturthi in 18 years, according to an observational noise monitoring exercise carried out by city-based advocacy group Awaaz Foundation on September 19. Noise levels during the final day of celebrations this year touched a high of 93.1 decibels (dB) as opposed to 100.7dB during the entire breadth of festivities in 2020, suggests a report released by Awaaz Foundation on Monday.The highest noise levels recorded over the past 18 years touched 123.7dB in 2015 followed by 123.2dB in 2013. Awaaz Foundation has been monitoring noise pollution in the city around key festivals, of which Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations see decibels at their highest, since 2003. This year, however, surveyors observed a low number of egregious violations, including loudspeakers and processions accompanied by drums and sound-systems, at key locations between 7pm and 10pm on Sunday, including Khar Danda, Worli Naka, Haji Ali, Girgaum Chowpatty and Shivaji Park.“Thanks to arrangements made by the police and with cooperation of Ganpati mandals... noise levels were lower than 2020, making it the quietest in 18 years since Awaaz Foundation began recording noise levels,” the group said in their report, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times. The report goes on to highlight the absence of loudspeakers, noisy instruments and firecrackers during the recently concluded festivities.In 2019 — the last year when Ganesh Chaturthi festivities were held without pandemic restrictions, noise levels on the last day of celebrations had touched as much 121.3dB, as opposed to the acceptable threshold for human ears of 70dB. The sound of ambient traffic ranges between 70dB and 80dB and is considered to be “loud”, while 120dB is closer to the sound a commercial airliner makes while taking off and is considered to be “very loud”. The human threshold for pain is marked at 130dB, over and above which even incidental exposure to loud noises can cause lasting damage to hearing. Prolonged exposure to noise levels around 120dB can also cause lasting hearing damage, in addition to increasing blood pressure and triggering headaches.Construction tools, car horns, bulldozers typically occupy the range between 90dB and 120dB. In comparison, every day conversational speech has a decibel level of about 60dBs.According to norms, noise levels in “silence zones” cannot exceed 50dB during the day and 40dB after 10pm. In residential areas, the levels are set at 55dB during the day and 45dB after 10 pm, and in commercial zones, the levels are capped at 65dB during the day and 55dB after 10 pm.On Sunday, the lowest noise levels were recorded near Atria Mall in Worli, at 76dB. The noises were attributed mainly to ambient sources such as traffic. The average decibel level ranged between 75 and 85dB. During the Foundation’s survey in 2020, noise pollution levels during Ganesh Chaturthi were recorded as low as 53dB, while the average level ranged between 65 and 75dB.“This indicates that while noise from festivities remained subdued for a second consecutive year, other sources of noise, mainly traffic, are much higher now, after falling drastically during the lockdown in 2020,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation. Abdulali, however, also emphasised that the survey carried out by her group was an informal, unstructured one, and the data was gathered in an arbitrary manner based on the discretion of the surveying team.“Our studies are not as comprehensive as that of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), but they are a valuable indicator of the situation on ground. The pollution control board should be able to verify this more accurately,” she added. MPCB, meanwhile, is yet to release data from their annual noise monitoring survey this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-noise-levels-during-ganesh-chaturthi-lowest-in-18-years-at-931db-101632163150589.html

The court listed both the pleas for further proceedings on September 24, when other batch of matters challenging the tender process and the new excise policy are coming up for hearing.The association, which claims to represent 143 licenced liquor traders in Delhi, said the Delhi government had issued an order on September 10 regarding the extension or renewal of retail licenses till November 16 in category L-6 (retail vendors of Indian liquor or beer), L-6FG (retail vend of foreign liquor in public sector to the holder of license in form of L-6) and L-6FE (retail vend of foreign liquor in public sector) though the petitioners’ categories was not considered.The petitioners are holding L7 (retail vend of Indian Liquor in private sector) and L10 (retail sale of Indian and foreign liquor) licenses. The plea said the petitioners have separately given their objections to the authorities requesting for extension of licenses but no reply has been received.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-seeks-delhi-govt-response-on-pleas-seeking-extension-of-liquor-licence-till-november-16-101632163147945.html

Your survey should clearly say that these are the street vendors who are sitting in hawking zones, and these are the ones who are in the no-hawking or no-vending zone,” the bench said.The bench asked the North MCD to place on record the scheme relating to no-hawking and no-squatting areas.Senior advocate Sanjeev Ralli, representing Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, submitted that the high court has passed several orders that there should be no encroachment in the no-hawking and no-vending zones. Despite that, hawkers and vendors occupy such spaces. “The survey team members are taking unauthorised cognisance of the presence of illegal hawkers and squatters in Chandni Chowk and Subhash Marg who are operating from the no-hawking/no-squatting areas notified by North DMC,” the traders association said in their petition.The plea sought direction to the North MCD deputy commissioner to ensure that the vending committee survey teams should not take any cognisance of illegal hawkers operating from no-hawking areas in Chandni Chowk, Subhash Marg and other such areas notified areas.Advocate Anuj Aggarwal, appearing for the Delhi Police, supported the petition and said it might become difficult for the police to control the vendors. Advocate Mini Pushkarna, who was representing the North civic body, told the court that she will file a reply to the plea, after which the bench fixed November 10 as the next date of hearing.On September 12, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated the redeveloped Chandni Chowk stretch between the Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid that has been made a no-go zone for motorised vehicles between 9am and 9pm.Meanwhile, the Delhi government on Monday told a division bench of the Delhi high court that it would start the second phase of the redevelopment in the Chandni Chowk soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/explain-hawking-despite-ban-in-chandni-chowk-delhi-hc-to-authorities-101632163087577.html
21-09-2021||Pune||Kirit Somaiya controversy: Shiv Sena tries to pass buck on to NCP||PUNEAs action against Kirit Somaiya snowballed into a controversy with the BJP and Somaiya accusing Uddhav Thackeray of directing the police action, the Shiv Sena tried to pass the buck on to the NCP, claiming that no orders were issued from the chief minister’s office. Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had no role in this as the orders (preventing Somaiya from entering Kolhapur) were issued by the home department to maintain law and order. “I spoke to CM Uddhav Thackeray and he said the chief minister’s office has nothing to do with it,” Raut said in Mumbai, insisting that there was no vendetta politics involved. The police action against Somaiya, according to political observers, provided him free airtime while on the other hand government looked wary of any criticism. “Don’t call the Kirit Somaiya episode as drama. In Maharashtra, drama and theatre have a lot of respect among people. There is no need to target the chief minister on this issue. A chief minister doesn’t get involved in such petty issues,” he said. He claimed that non-BJP leaders were being pressured with the fear of arrest and attachment of properties. “If you have to make allegations, state agencies like the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) and state police will investigate without bias,” he said. Raut said the truth in allegations will be decided by courts, but attempts to destablise the government will not work. BJP state president Chandrakant Patil said the MVA ministers have no coordination among themselves. “Is this the way the government is being run? The home department is taking some decisions, the CM does not know. When the MVA government was formed, I had advised Uddhav Thackeray not give the home ministry to NCP,” he said. He accused the MVA ministers of being “seeped into corruption” and said they were not worried that their “misdeeds” can be challenged in court. “Fight a legal battle, instead of a panic reaction. If supporters of Mushrif throw a single stone on Somaiya, that will prove costly to you (state government),” he said. Asked if the Shiv Sena and NCP leaders were on the BJP’s radar, Patil said his party was focussing on issues like “injustice” being faced by the common man and atrocities against women. “In some days, irregularities of two Congress ministers will be exposed,” he claimed, without taking any names.

21-09-2021||Delhi||No liquor shop to open in Delhi’s 23 wards during new excise policy switch||New Delhi: At least 23 wards in Delhi will go dry from next month as the Delhi government shuts all private liquor vends in the Capital between October 1 and November 16 to ensure a smooth transition to the new excise regime. Only government-run liquor outlets will function in the Capital during this period.Government data seen by HT shows that of the 272 wards in Delhi, nearly 80 don’t have government-run or private liquor stores while another 23 wards only have private liquor vends. With only government liquor stores functioning from October 1 to November 16, these 23 wards will go dry during the period.The 23 municipal wards where there are only private liquor vends include RK Puram, Andrews Ganj, Lajpat Nagar, Patparganj, Rajouri Garden, Tughlaqabad, Kotla Mubarakpur, Inderpuri, Rani Bagh, Rohtash Nagar, Jilmil and Pandav Nagar.The new excise policy, which aims to reform the city’s liquor business by improving user experience, cleaning up the liquor mafia and eradicating pilferage, was implemented on June 11. Under it, retailers are free to decide the selling prices in a competitive environment, rather than an MRP being mandated by the government. Delhi currently has 849 liquor shops which are not equitably distributed across the city. With the new policy, the government plans to keep the total number of vends intact, reshuffling them into 32 zones to ensure a more equitable distribution across 272 municipal wards in the city, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) area and the airport.Liquor retailers said the move to shut private liquor stores from October 1 will lead to overcrowding of government liquor stores at a time when social distancing is necessary to curb the spread of Covid-19. “The closure of the private vends for the 46 days will put an excessive burden on the government shops... This period is crucial as it also includes Diwali, which falls on November 4 this year. The demand and the sale of liquor is the highest during this period,” said a retailer who did not wish to be named. Naresh Goyal, president of Delhi liquor traders association, also expressed fears that the increased demand during festive season can lead to bootlegging. “Due to lower accessibility of liquor in Delhi during this 46-day period, people will start moving to Haryana to buy liquor. It could also lead to illegal smuggling of liquor from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and its sale in the black market at higher rates,” said Goyal. A senior excise official, on the condition of anonymity, said that they are in the process of creating more teams to crack down on illegal sale of liquor during this time. “Adequate stocks will be maintained in the government shops that will remain open during this period. We are also looking at increasing the operational hours in case there is a lot of crowding at stores. Civil defence volunteers will also be deployed to ensure Covid-19 protocols are followed,” the official said. A second excise official said the closure of private shops was required for easy transition to the new retail liquor licencees. “The current licences will end by September 30 and the new retailers will need 1.5 months to set up new stores and begin operations from November 17,” he said. Last week, the Delhi government completed the process of appointing new licensees for the retail sale of liquor in each of the new 32 excise zones, paving the way for swanky and spacious liquor stores in the national capital from November 17.The state excise department earned ₹8,917.59 crore through the bidding process of the 32 zones, which is about 26.7% higher than the reserve price set by the government. The government is aiming to earn around ₹10,000 crore in the next one year under the new excise regime.The newly appointed retail licensees will have to build bigger and modern liquor vends from November 17. Customers will get the facility to walk in and choose their preferred liquor brands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-liquor-shop-to-open-in-delhi-s-23-wards-during-new-excise-policy-switch-101632162850357.html
21-09-2021||Pune||Kirit Somaiya accuses Hasan Mushrif of another fraud worth ₹100 crore; minister terms allegations baseless||PUNE BJP leader Kirit Somaiya levelled fresh set of allegations against Maharashtra Rural Development Minister Hasan Mushrif accusing him of committing a fraud worth ₹100 crore involving the Appasaheb Gadhinglaj Cooperative Sugar Mill. Somaiya claimed the money was transferred through shell-companies from Kolkata, and said he would submit related documents of the sugar mill to the ED. Somaiya claimed that last year, the sugar mill was handed over to a private firm, which does not have any prior experience running a mill, without any transparent bidding process. He also alleged that Mushrif’s son-in-law was the ‘’benami’’ owner of the private firm. “Whatever money Mushrif earned through corrupt means after he became the minister, he parked that money here (in the sugar mills ). So, we demand a probe into these scams,” he added. The former BJP MP said he has already approached the Income Tax department, the Enforcement Directorate, and the Cooperation Ministry with a 2,700-page complaint against Mushrif. “Based on my complaint, an inquiry has already been started. The ED has sought additional information from me and I will give that information to them,” he said. Earlier, Somaiya had asked Mushrif how ₹127 crore allegedly got transferred to his company. He also alleged that ₹98 crore was transferred to the Sar Senapati Santaji Ghorpade Sugar Factory Limited (in which Mushrif’’s family members are directors ) through ‘’bogus” firms. Mushrif termed the allegations “baseless” while retiterating that he will file a ₹100 crore defamation suit against Kirit Somaiya. Responding to Somaiya’s allegations in a press conference on Monday, Mushrif said, “The accusations against me are part of BJP’s big conspiracy and Chandrakant Patil is the mastermind of this. I have been very vocal about the Centre using central agencies against the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and on the issue of (former Mumbai police commissioner) Parambir Singh. It is the reason I am being framed by BJP through Kirit Somaiya… to stop me.” “All allegations against me and my family are false and baseless. I am going to file ₹100 crore defamation suit against Kirit Somaiya. Kirit Somaiya should apologise to me. I will file an FIR against Chandrakant Patil for a ₹150-core hybrid annuity scam done during the BJP government (rule in Maharashtra),” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/kirit-somaiya-accuses-hasan-mushrif-of-another-fraud-worth-rs-100-crore-minister-terms-allegations-baseless-101632162848863.html
21-09-2021||Delhi||Repeated hammering on the ground floor led to collapse of Sabzi Mandi building: Probe||The breaking of a concrete platform in one of the two shops on the ground floor by repeated hammering led to the collapse of the four-storey building in north Delhi’s Sabzi Mandi last Monday, said senior police officers associated with the investigation of the case.The number of casualties might have been higher had three labourers and a contractor, who had been working on breaking the platform, not escaped in time via a narrow lane adjacent to the building. Since Monday is a market holiday, a majority of the shops were closed and the crowd in the neighbourhood was less, the police investigation has revealed.Two brothers, aged 7 and 12, were killed and Ramji Das Aneja, the 72-year-old owner of the second shop, was injured in the building collapse. The brothers were returning home with their mother after attending a tuition class when over half of the building collapsed, crushing them under debris and killing them on the spot.The 24-year-old owner of the second shop, Mohak Arora, was arrested a day after the collapse and booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. He is presently in jail. A private contractor, identified by his first name Jamaal, is absconding. The repair and renovation work of the shop, which was purchased by Arora just 11 days before the collapse, was being carried out under Jamaal’s guidance, said deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse.The building was over 60 years old and the shop, where the three labourers and the contractor were breaking the concrete platform in the absence of a civil engineer and without seeking permission from the municipal agency, was being used to run a dairy and confectionery business for almost three decades, said a senior police officer, associated with the probe.“We have learned that the platform was used for keeping and selling milk and other dairy products. The flooring level inside the shop was around two-and-a-half-foot below the road outside. Since Arora was planning to start a new business venture, he decided to remove the platform and raise the inner floor to the road’s level,” said the officer.Another police officer, who asked not to be named, said that the owners of the three upper floors, whose parents had built the structure, had warned the shop owner and the contractor about the weak foundation of the building when he began the renovation work. They had asked them to carry out the repair work only under the supervision of an experienced engineer. Also, they had advised against using an electrical hammer to break the platform, as the occupants of the upper floors felt tremors whenever the tool was used, the second officer said.“Most likely the tremors caused due to constant hammering of the concrete platform led to the crumbling down of the building. As the structure did not fall all of a sudden, the labourers and the contractor had enough time to escape from the shop. The search and rescue operation continued till late in the night because nobody in the neighbourhood had seen them coming out of the building when it collapsed,” said CL Meena, assistant divisional officer of Delhi Fire Services, who was leading the rescue operation.Police said that raids are being conducted to nab Jamaal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/repeated-hammering-on-the-ground-floor-led-to-collapse-of-sabzi-mandi-building-probe-101632162788303.html

Coldwell Banker Richard Ellis (CBRE), a consultant firm, has submitted a detailed report of the Film City project to Uttar Pradesh government officials concerned on Wednesday.“We will review the report and send it to the Uttar Pradesh government for approvals,” said Singh.The authority said, meanwhile, more than 90% of the families affected by the airport project have started constructing houses in the rehabilitation township. “Out of the 3,003 plots allocated in Jewar Bangar, construction work at 2,730 plots has started. Some families are even staying in their homes there, and the work will be completed according to the schedule,” he added.“Switzerland company Zurich AG, the concessionaire of the airport project, has started work on the ground. The state government will have to decide about the foundation or stone laying ceremony. We are focused on commencing commercial operations within the next three years, and on improving accessibility and connectivity of the Yamuna Expressway region with other parts of the national capital region (NCR),” CEO Singh added.The inaugural ceremony of the airport was scheduled to take place in August-end. “The demise of veteran Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Kalyan Singh, and the turmoil in Afghanistan had been keeping the political dispensation of the state and the Prime Minister‘s Office (PMO) busy,” said Dhirendra Singh, Jewar MLA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/foundation-laying-event-of-jewar-airport-in-noida-likely-during-navratri-101632162787004.html
21-09-2021||Noida||G Noida: Some Gurjar and Rajput leaders join hands to resolve Samrat Mihir Bhoj dispute||NOIDA: Several Gurjar and Rajput leaders joined hands on Monday to resolve a dispute over an upcoming statue of Samrat Mihir Bhoj at a college in Greater Noida’s Dadri on Wednesday (September 22). However, some people from both the communities said that they will hold a nationwide protest on Wednesday if Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath does not postpone his visit to Dadri, where he is supposed to unveil the statue of the ninth century king that day. Akhil Bharatiya Kshatriya Mahasabha (ABKM), Karni Sena, and other organisations of the Rajput community have been protesting the ceremony, claiming that King Mihir Bhoj was not a ‘Gurjar King’ as claimed by the Gurjar bodies.“Some people are playing politics over this issue, to create differences among the two communities. Samrat Mihir Bhoj was a great king, and great personalities belong to all the communities. Gurjars and Rajputs are together, and we share a common history,” said Davendra Singh Khatana, vice-president of Rajput Sabha, Gautam Budh Nagar.A member of Kshatriya Sabha (Ghaziabad), Ramdev Rawal, said that he supported the September 22 event because “disputes yield nothing”. “According to history, Mihir Bhoj was a Rajput king, but we also support events organised by the Gurjar community because we do not want to disturb harmony among the people,” said Rawal, who appealed to both the communities to put an end to the row.“Mentioning the caste Gurjar on the statute will only lead us to intensify our agitation. We will hold the nationwide protest if the mention of the caste is not being removed... Our members have been protesting across many cities, including Noida on Monday, and we will spread the protest to other states too.

21-09-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Inauguration of e-bus project delayed||Ghaziabad: Inauguration of the first batch of electric buses (e-buses) in Ghaziabad, which was scheduled to be held on September 26, 2021, is likely to happen in October now, said Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) officials on Monday.Officials familiar with the developments said that the city will get 20 e-buses in Phase I. Heavy rainfall in other districts of the state has delayed the work as authorities are busy tackling monsoon issues, they added.In August 2019, the ministry of heavy industries had sanctioned 5,595 e-buses to 64 cities, state governments, and state transport undertakings for intra-city and inter-city operations. Out of this, 600 e-buses, including 50 for Ghaziabad, were approved for 11 cities in Uttar Pradesh.“Ghaziabad will receive all the 50 e-buses in a phased manner. 25 e-buses were supposed to arrive in the city in Phase I in August, but now, it has come down to 20. The inauguration is likely to be delayed as there has been heavy rainfall in other cities which were to receive the e-buses and diversion of resources. We will get to notice operational issues, if any, during Phase I itself. Construction of charging points is being expedited,” said AK Singh, regional manager of UPSRTC.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath is scheduled to inaugurate the project in the city, but there are possibilities that Prime Minister Narendra Modi may also attend the event.“26 charging points are to be constructed, and a charging facility will also be available at the maintenance depot in Akbarpur-Behrampur. The work for charging the stations has not yet started, and it may take a couple of days to be completed,” said an official who is familiar with the development.According to the official estimates, the e-buses will be able to travel about 150 kilometres after being fully charged in five hours.The UPSRTC has suggested four routes, covering about 88 kilometres along major roads in the area, for the operation of low-floor and air conditioned e-buses.One side of the first route covering 33 kilometres will connect Anand Vihar to Muradnagar; the second route covering 20 kilometres will connect Anand Vihar to ALT Centre in Raj Nagar; the third route covering 20 kilometres will connect Dilshad Garden to Govindpuram, and the fourth route covering 15 kilometres will connect different points from Tila Morh to New bus stand.At present, Ghaziabad has no government-run transport for intra-city operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-inauguration-of-e-bus-project-delayed-101632162607019.html
