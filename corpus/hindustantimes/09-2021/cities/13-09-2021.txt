The move came after several people died of fever in nearby districts.“We have inspected the work of Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and Auxillary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) that are conducting door-to-door surveys to screen the fever cases. Fever cases are screened for the detection of dengue and malaria, according to the symptoms... I also made surprise visits to primary health centres in Barola, Mamura and Hoshiarpur to check medicine stock, anti-larvae fogging activities and the preparedness to handle the fever cases,” said Dr Vaish.Also Read | 30 CCTV batteries stolen from Eastern Peripheral Expressway in UP’s GB NagarDr Vaish has submitted his findings and recommendations in a report to the district chief medical officer, Sunil Kumar Sharma, following the Monday inspection. “The inspection results were satisfactory but some improvements are required, which have been submitted to the CMO. We will also conduct another inspection on Tuesday. The district is fully equipped to handle fever cases, and we are sure we won’t see a similar situation as in nearby districts,” he added.As per the district malaria officer, Rajesh Sharma, regular anti-larvae fogging drives are being carried out across the district. “The district has been receiving heavy rainfall for the past few days, which increases the chances of vector borne diseases. The transmission period for the same will continue till October. Hence, anti-larvae fogging activities are being carried out across the district to prevent breeding of mosquitoes. So far, the district has reported 24 malaria cases and no dengue cases,” he said.Dr Sharma, meanwhile, said, “The report submitted by the inspection team will be taken into account... We are fully prepared to handle such fever cases. A rapid response team and a control room has been set up at the Sector 30 district combined hospital and all the seven health centres in the district -- Community Health Centre (CHC) Bhangel, CHC Bisrakh, CHC Badalpur, CHC Dadri, CHC Dadha, CHC Jewar and Primary Health Centre Dankaur -- to report cases of viral fever and take immediate action. All these are equipped with dengue and malaria testing facilities and have child health specialists as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/dengue-malaria-up-in-noida-uttar-pradesh-health-dept-takes-stock-101631557712463.html

Sub-inspector Amandeep Singh, who is the investigating officer (IO), said the incident took place around 3:35 am, when Brar was alone in his room. “He returned home late and went to his room, while his wife, who is pregnant, was sleeping with her mother-in-law,” said the IO. Brar shot himself on the right temple with his licensed Austria-made Glock pistol, and died on the spot, said the IO. After hearing the gunshot, the family members rushed him to the civil hospital in Phase 6, Mohali, where the postmortem was conducted.“Prima facie, it looks like a suicide case,” said the IO, adding that no suicide note was found.Ruling out foul play, police have initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Code on the statement of Brar’s father, who didn’t want any further investigation. After the postmortem, the body was handed over to family members. An alumnus of DAV College, Sector 10, and Panjab University, Brar had won the bronze in the double-trap shooting event at the Indian University Championship and World University Games in 2015.

And after their cable laying work is completed, they leave without repairing the dug-up patches. This practice not only causes trouble to us but also damages infrastructure,” said Harendra Bhati, a resident of Sector Beta 1 and the founder of Active Citizen Team, a residents’ group.Also Read | 30 CCTV batteries stolen from Eastern Peripheral Expressway in UP’s GB Nagar“The Greater Noida authority must ensure that the permission to dig roads is only given to a firm on the condition that the firm will repair the patch properly immediately after the work is complete. And the digging should be done so as to not inconvenience commuters and residents,” said Alok Nagar, founder-member of India Against Corruption, an NGO in Greater Noida, and a member of the Federation of Greater Noida Resident Welfare Associations.Greater Noida chief executive officer Narendra Bhooshan ordered the digging of roads to be stopped immediately as it is causing huge issues amid rain.“We have imposed a ₹20 lakh penalty against both the firms. And we have directed them to deposit the penalty amount right away. If they do not pay the penalty now then further legal action will be taken.

Officials in the know of the development said that the project will be initiated by end of September and will involve the development of approximately 75km-100km of the road network comprising 10 major roads under corporation jurisdiction.Corporation officials said that the 10 roads include stretches of GT Road, Delhi-Meerut Road, Hapur Road, and Loni-Wazirabad Road, among others. They added that the funds allocated under the 15th finance commission will be utilised for the redevelopment.“We are likely to float tenders for the 10 roads by the end of September when the monsoon season is expected to end. Our aim is that all these roads should be in proper condition before the onset of winter and should not aid pollution,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner.Also Read | Ghaziabad civic body asks commercial establishments to obtain trade licence by SeptemberTo control the pollution generated by road dust, the corporation has also decided that they will use perforated tiles on pavements and will develop patches of greenery in nearby open spaces.“The central verge of these roads will also be developed with greenery, and we have also planned the development of dense forestry following the Miyawaki method of plantation in 10 industrial areas in the city. This will help us develop more green areas in the city to reduce pollution. The roads will be completed with proper functional lighting, repair of bad road patches, and development of footpaths,” Tanwar added.Ghaziabad has been hit hard by heavy rainfall during the ongoing monsoon season as several potholes develop on many internal and arterial roads.“The city roads were largely affected by heavy rain during the monsoon season and development and repair works were also delayed due to pandemic. Apart from major roads, internal roads also require immediate repair. With the development of major roads, the corporation must focus on internal roads as well on an urgent basis,” said Rajendra Tyagi, councillor from Raj Nagar.Officials said that the work for the repair of internal roads will also commence once the monsoon season ends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/10-major-roads-to-get-25-crore-makeover-in-up-s-ghaziabad-101631557051444.html

Keeping its target to form government in the state, the Trinamool Congress appealed to all non-BJP political parties including the Left, Congress or others, to join them in their fight against BJP. But the opposition forces rallying against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are yet to announce any sort of electoral alliance. The party, though earlier, announced to introduce all the welfare schemes in Tripura that are currently implemented in Bengal if they get people’s mandate in the upcoming elections. The political analysts claim that the prospect of the party led by Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee for the 2023 polls is yet to be determined at this moment. The experts said that the division of votes among the opposition parties might pave the scope for the BJP to give the final laugh. “It is premature to say the prospect of Trinamool Congress here. All the opposition parties, CPM, Trinamool Congress, Congress and other regional parties are raising voice against the BJP, but all of these parties have some different political beliefs that might not be acceptable to other anti-BJP parties. Almost one and half years left for the polls, the situation might vary during this period,” said a veteran political analyst who wished not to be named. The CPM has no agenda of allying with any anti-BJP party, especially Trinamool Congress, in the current circumstances, though they welcome any party if they want to fight against the BJP. “The CPM is the lone party in the state that has its reach to each and every booth in the state. The Left Front has a strong base here and to date, there is no need to go for alliance with the Trinamool Congress as it has no base here,” said CPM veteran leader Pabitra Kar. Trinamool Congress general secretary Abhishek Banerjee was supposed to announce formally the new state committee but it is yet to be done. “Our first target is to prepare cadres and the people of Tripura will decide who will be their leader. In electoral politics, people’s mandate is everything. We will visit all the districts of the state and will assess who has mass acceptance according to which we will decide our party’s Tripura unit president,” said newly-joined Trinamool Congress leader Sushmita Dev during her visit to the state a few days back. In the meantime, Banerjee’s pre-scheduled rally in Agartala on September 15 might not happen as the rally got no permission from police as it will collide with another political party’s rally the same day. The Trinamool Congress criticized the BJP saying that the party used the administration to disrupt the rally and it shows that the BJP is scared of them. “The Agartala police have said another political party will hold a rally along the same route on Wednesday. This proves that the BJP government is scared of the TMC. Abhishek Banerjee’s car was attacked twice when he visited Tripura,” said TMC Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy. “As the police denied permission to our rally, we will soon share our next course of action,” said TMC former parliamentarian Kunal Ghosh in Agartala on Monday. Terming both the CPM and Trinamool Congress as ‘two sides of the same coin’, Bharatiya Janata Party said that the Trinamool Congress has planned to bring people from Kachhar, Karimganj and Silchar of Assam to show their strength to Tripura people during the rally that was scheduled to be addressed by Abhishek Banerjee on September 15. “The Trinamool Congress has no booth committee here and they are well aware of their nil chances to come to power in 2023. They want to create unrest in the state through this rally that got no permission from the police as they didn’t apply properly. They aim to exploit the situation and take it to national politics. So, I urge all to keep themselves away from the conspiracy of Trinamool Congress,” said newly-appointed information and cultural affairs minister Sushanta Chowdhury. He also said that the state witnessed violence that was orchestrated by former chief minister Manik Sarkar a few days back where BJP activists were attacked by the CPM men. “The CPM created vandalism in the state. Now, they have handed over the baton to Trinamool Congress,” he said. Many influential leaders from different political parties, including the BJP, joined TMC in the past two months. The All India Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev also joined the party last month. The Trinamool Congress first hit the headlines in Tripura in July when 23 members of political strategist Prashant Kishore’s Indian-Political Action Committee (I-PAC) were detained and forced to stay inside a hotel in Agartala on the charge of violating Covid-19 norms.Centring the issue, Trinamool Congress bigwigs, including general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, Bengal minister Bratya Basu, and some parliamentarians have started visiting the state to expand its base beyond West Bengal that invited tussle between the two political parties several times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/political-prospects-of-tmc-in-tripura-yet-to-be-determined-say-analysts-101631556692429.html

The Ghaziabad police said that NHAI officials on Monday approached them regarding this issue. “They have told us about the thefts, and we will register an FIR,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural).The EPE, which became operational in May 2018, has been witnessing frequent thefts--the thieves usually escape with iron fencing, artifacts, and solar panels, among other things, the authorities said. Also Read | Noida: Bangladeshi national held for woman’s murderNHAI officials said that more thefts have come to light recently.“Nearly 30 batteries, covered with iron cages, were stolen during the past few weeks. These issues are prevalent in both Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Our teams are trying to fix the issue and we have decided that the CCTV cameras (with night vision and 360 degrees rotation) will also cover the battery system setups installed at different locations... Even electricity cables have been taken away. There are certain areas affected by these issues and we have conveyed them to the Meerut divisional commissioner, Surendra Singh,” said Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI.Officials said they do not have footage prior to the battery thefts as the CCTV cameras are located at some distance from each other. The expressway witnesses movement of 70,000 passenger car units every day. NHAI officials, familiar with the development, said that five or six illegal exits on the road were detected near Gautam Budh Nagar’s Dadri and Ghaziabad’s Dasna.“We have fixed/covered the illegal exits in the area. The thieves cut open metal beams on the expressway to make their way around the expressway,” Garg added.Singh said, “We will discuss these issues in the upcoming meeting with NHAI officials and get them sorted out. We hold such meetings twice every month. I have also directed the district officials to rein in traffic violators and stop the entry of unauthorised vehicles on the expressways.”“... The issue of illegal exits is due to the local population. We are keeping a check on certain activities and will get these resolved at the earliest,” said Raja.Traffic police officials of Gautam Budh Nagar said, “Making short-cuts, or driving on the wrong side of the roads can become a nuisance in certain rural belts. Sometimes, local toll booth operators are also involved. We do not have an extensive problem on the EPE, but it does happen once in a while. We keep an eye on the situation and our ground teams in the area immediately fine such vehicles,” said Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police, traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/30-cctv-batteries-stolen-from-eastern-peripheral-expressway-in-up-s-gb-nagar-101631556511415.html

The authority will keep a close watch on the process of collection of garbage through digital means. For example, every house will have a QR code. Whenever the waste picker goes to pick up the garbage from that house, he will scan it through mobile scanner. As soon as the scan is done, the information about the garbage being picked up will reach the vendor. The vendor will place its monthly information before the authority," the authority said in a statement.Whether it is a village or urban sector of Greater Noida, all the houses will have a QR code, it added.Similarly, it said the monitoring of vehicles engaged in garbage collection will also be done through GPS (Global Positioning System) technology."With this, the authority will be able to monitor the real-time location of any vehicle on garbage collection duty. Till now, the GPS was being used only in vehicles engaged in mechanical sweeping of roads. CCTV cameras will be installed at the waste processing plant. Through this, the movement of vehicles engaged in carrying garbage will be monitored," the authority said.The website of the Greater Noida Authority will also have complete information about waste collection and if any problem persists even after implementation of the new system of door-to-door service, then residents can complain on the Mitra app, authority's CEO Narendra Bhooshan said.Bhooshan expressed hope that the new tender for door-to-door garbage collection will be finalised soon and residents will get better facilities.According to officials, under the new system, the details of the contractor's employees engaged in door-to-door garbage collection will be on the website of the authority.The worker's name, mobile number, among other details will also be uploaded on the website and if he skips picking up the garbage or does not come for a day or two, the residents will also be able to call that employee to flag the issue, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/qr-code-gps-greater-noida-authority-s-plan-for-door-to-door-waste-collection-101631555824663.html

The city has seen 158 cases of dengue so far, of which 72 were reported in August, according to the data. There have been no deaths due to the infection. Last year, the city saw 131 cases of the infection in the same duration, and 1,072 cases were reported over the entire year. One person died of the infection last year. The city was reporting a surge in Covid-19 cases during the peak dengue season last year. Unlike Covid-19, dengue is not a notifiable disease in Delhi; meaning it is not mandatory for hospitals and healthcare centres to share details of cases that they might receive. Most of the data collected by the municipal corporation comes from government hospitals and dispensaries. “There were significant challenges last year, with fear of Covid-19 most people with other ailments did not go to the hospitals and even for those who did the data was not immediately share. This made it difficult to carry out breeding control measures. This year, we have started spraying insecticides and now even conducting fogging for adult mosquitoes,” said an official from the municipal corporation, on condition of anonymity. Delhi has also reported 68 cases of malaria and 40 cases of chikungunya so far this year, according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dengue-cases-in-delhi-sees-an-uptick-158-infections-so-far-101631555911427.html

With the key stretch being out of bounds for regular cycle rickshaws, many now fear losing income.Among them is Intizar Ali (27) who was stopped by guards on Monday afternoon. “Today (Monday) morning, we were ferrying passengers as before but were asked to leave the area around the afternoon by guards... They did not permit us to ply our rickshaws, so we could not earn a penny,” said Ali.He said that he wanted to get a revamped cycle rickshaw and the licence, but did not know how to go about it.“The contractor from whom I rent the rickshaw only has old-style rickshaws... We are poor people. Yesterday, we did not earn anything and had to skip a meal. How will people like me survive in the city? We don’t have a roof over our heads and sleep on the rickshaw,” said Ali.Bhim Singh (42), another rickshaw puller, said, “People here say we need to get the license from MCD, but we don’t know the process. They say we will have to shell out ₹2,000 for the new cycle rickshaw and license, which we can’t afford.”Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC) officers said that as per a Delhi high court order of 10 February 2017, only those cycle rickshaws and rickshaw pullers, who are registered or licensed, with effect from April 1, 2017, will be permitted to ply in the area.Rajesh Verma (30), who got one of these licences, said, “We are happy with the new look of the rickshaws and hope the number of visitors in Chandni Chowk will increase further in the coming days. All of us are charging a fixed sum of ₹20 per passenger for a trip between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid,” said Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhimany-rickshaw-pullers-claim-not-allowed-to-ply-on-revamped-chandni-chowk-stretch-101631555311630.html
13-09-2021||Delhi||Trash cans outside homes a hazard: E Delhi residents||Residents of cooperative group housing societies in Mayur Vihar Phase -1 (Extension) have opposed the civic body installing large open trash cans outside the gates of some of these compounds, arguing that they may pose health hazards.The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has placed the bins as part of its ongoing ‘zero dhalao’ (local dump yards or garbage collection points) initiative. The civic body has, over the past two years, resolved to free the area under its jurisdiction of these dhalaos by gradually coming up with an alternative for bulk waste collection and shutting these three-walled points one by one.“It has been a few days since two of these unwieldy bins were placed at the gates of our society. Besides being a breeding ground for mosquitoes at this time of the year, when dengue and malaria tend to spread, stray animals have now started gathering at our gates,” said Aditi, a resident of Samachar Apartments, one of the compounds outside which bins have been placed.She added that there are around 250 households within the society and that dumping the waste from all of these homes will turn the bins into a dumpyard, and defeat the purpose of the civic body’s initiative.“Civic officials told us that garbage will be lifted from these bins thrice a day on a regular basis. However, it is only once a day that they do manage to lift the waste and on days when it’s raining like the day before, it keeps rotting there,” she said.Residents also said the civic body did not have a fixed schedule to lift the waste.“Even though the bins have not come up in front of our society yet, having them right at the entrance with all this volume of waste is not a great alternative. Once these are full, the stench will be unbearable and the situation may be even worse than dhalaos” said Sanjay Gupta, a resident of Nirman Apartments.According to civic officials, the bins are cleared regularly. There were around 300 dhalaos in the EDMC area, of which 44 have been closed.“According to the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Rules, which were notified in 2018, group housing societies are categorised as bulk waste generators and are supposed to segregate as well as process their own waste. However, despite issuing notices to many housing societies for not segregating wet and dry waste, they continue to dump their waste as it is. The bins have been placed as a temporary arrangement and our concessionaire is lifting waste from the bins regularly,” said a senior official, who didn’t wish to be named.EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said that these bins can be used by passersby as well and are a part of the plan to shut dhalaos gradually. “Waste is lifted both from the dhalaos as well as the bins. Soon, we plan to come up with at least 40 more compacter plants to segregate and recycle the waste,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/residents-oppose-civic-body-move-to-install-trash-cans-outside-compound-gates-say-it-poses-health-hazard-101631554531281.html
13-09-2021||Delhi||Two-day conclave to discuss road map for education sector||Taking lessons from the pandemic and its impact on education, thought leaders, policymakers, educators, and industry experts will participate in a two-day education conclave beginning Thursday to discuss a road map for the education sector in India. Organised by Hindustan Times, the Lenovo Smarter Ed Conclave will focus on the New Education Policy (NEP), the digital divide brought to the fore amid the advent of online learning during the pandemic, developments in technology in education, upskilling teachers, and on encouraging interaction with decision makers across schools and institutes of higher education. Those interested in attending the virtual conference can visit https://lenovosmarteredconclave.virtualeventexp.com/ .“There is a strong argument that education will never go back to the pre-pandemic time and technology is going to be as important as physical campuses. The focus on large physical spaces will shrink and a hybrid model of education involving a combination of classroom teaching and online lessons will find greater acceptance,” the organisers said in a statement. Focussing on technological innovations and solutions leading to progression and tech penetration, the conclave will also discuss concerns on digital inequality and the new forms of exclusion that may arise. The conclave will begin with the address by Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan speaking on the NEP 2020 and the role of technology in the future of education. The managing director of Lenovo India, Shailendra Katyal, will share insights on how technology can help in bridging the digital divide, and Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the Union minister of state for skill development, will talk about the importance of skill education and how it can be built up in the coming years. The two-day conclave will touch upon the three key areas of the education sector – technological advancements in education, digital inequality, and reskilling or upskilling of the educator workforce. The conclave will also see an in-depth discussion on government policies focusing on upgrading the education sector with innovative tools and ideas. Experts will discuss the approach towards smarter education India and the role of analytical, data-driven technology in understanding young minds and providing them with a holistic curriculum as per the learner’s needs. Policymakers and experts will discuss the lack of infrastructure in rural India, address the gender bias in households, digital readiness of government educational institutes, and role of communities in bridging these gaps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/twoday-conclave-to-discuss-road-map-for-education-sector-101631554111462.html

13-09-2021||Delhi||Adopt Pusa solution, Kejriwal urges states||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday urged the Centre to direct other states to provide farmers with a proprietary microbial solution developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) – usually referred to as the Pusa institute -- to turn crop stubble into manure for free so as to prevent stubble burning, which is a major contributor to air pollution in Delhi-NCR.“I urge the Centre to direct all neighbouring states to start providing this microbial solution to their farmers for free so that we can curb air pollution this year, which starts getting severe from around October 10 as stubble burning in the neighbouring states takes off,” he said, during a digital press briefing.Kejriwal also said a third-party audit by the Centre’s WAPCOS — a PSU of the Union jal shakti ministry — has found the microbial solution, also known as the Pusa bio-decomposer, to be “highly effective” in converting stubble into manure.“WAPCOS inspected 15 villages in four districts [in Delhi] and interviewed 79 farmers to understand whether the new decomposers have helped or not. The central agency found that farmers in Delhi are very happy with the results of these bio-decomposers,” he said.Citing the report, Kejriwal said 90% of the 79 farmers said their stubble decomposed in 15-20 days, which otherwise would take 40-50 days. It found that wheat production in these farms increased by about 8% and the wheat sprouting levels increased by 17-20% as the soil quality enhanced, he said.Last year, the Delhi government gave the microbial solution for free to all city farmers.Every year, from October to November, fumes from crop residue set alight by farmers in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh engulf the national capital and its surrounding areas, making the air hazardous to breathe. This has required the Capital to issue restrictions on construction work and halve the number of private cars on the roads via the odd-even system.“The report states that farmers had to plough the soil 6-7 times earlier, but after using the new solution, the soil needs to be ploughed only once or twice. It also showed that the level of organic carbon in these farms increased by 40%. Nitrogen content in these farm lands also increased by 24% and the quality of soil has improved. The presence of bacteria that helps crops grow also rose around seven-fold, whereas fungal content in the soil tripled. The use of DAP fertilisers has also reduced from 46kg per acre to 36-40kg per acre,” Kejriwal said.He said the Delhi government had written to the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) too, informing them about this new technology developed by Pusa Institute.“But, they told us that it is only the Delhi government which thinks it has been successful and that the efficacy of the technology required a third party audit. So, we roped in the Centre’s WAPCOS for the audit and they submitted their report now. I will seek an appointment with the Union environment minister to share the findings of the report with him,” he said.Kejriwal said that the Centre, in October last year, proposed heavy fines and even jail for polluters, including farmers who were burning paddy stubble, in a desperate attempt to control air pollution in Delhi-NCR. “But the fault lies with the governments, not the farmers. So, I hope state governments also adopt this new technology,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/direct-other-states-to-provide-pusa-bio-decomposer-solution-for-free-to-farmers-for-crop-stubble-management-cm-to-centre-101631553811279.html
13-09-2021||Bhopal||'Ramcharitmanas' added as optional subject in Madhya Pradesh colleges||First-year students of graduation courses in Madhya Pradesh colleges and universities will be offered epic 'Ramcharitmanas' as an elective subject under philosophy discipline in art stream, higher education minister Mohan Yadav said on Monday. On recommendation of the syllabus committee, the “applied philosophy of Shri Ramcharitmanas” has been introduced as an elective (optional) course under the philosophy subject for first-year students of graduation (BA) from the academic session of 2021-22, he said. “The Ramcharitmanas has science, culture, literature and 'shringar' (concept of love and beauty in Indian classical art form). This is not about a particular religion. We have also introduced Urdu Gazal as a subject,” Yadav said. The minister said this 60-hour long elective course will help develop humanitarian perspective and ability of balanced leadership quality among students. Ramcharitmanas is an epic poem composed by the 16th-century bhakti poet Tulsidas. “When new syllabus is being implemented in context of the new education policy, we are also trying to bring our glorious past to the fore. Whether it is related to our scriptures or to our great men,” he said. Yadav claimed it has been proved in a NASA study that Ram Setu was a man-made bridge built millions of years ago and Beyt Dwaraka existed 5,000 years back. “This syllabus is being implemented on recommendation of scholars,” the minister said. Meanwhile, Congress MLA Arif Masood said the BJP government is taking such steps to hide its "failures". “The slogan of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas (everyone's support, everyone's development) is false. This slogan could be true if they would have included the Quran and the Bible along with the Ramayana,” he said. Masood said the BJP governments in Madhya Pradesh and at the Centre have failed and such steps are being taken to hide their "failures" on issues like education, infrastructure and employment. Earlier this month, medical education minister Vishwas Sarang had announced that MBBS students in Madhya Pradesh will study about RSS founder KB Hedgewar, Bhartiya Jana Sangh leader Deendayal Upadhyaya, Swami Vivekananda and BR Ambedkar as part of the first-year foundation course. He said the move is aimed at instilling social and medical ethics among students. Similarly, Yadav had earlier announced that the Madhya Pradesh government is considering changing the Hindi nomenclature of the vice-chancellor's post in state universities from 'Kulpati' to 'Kulguru'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/-ramcharitmanas-added-as-optional-subject-in-madhya-pradesh-colleges-101631552971522.html

Many of them downloaded an app on telephonic advice from unknown people and others shared bank details on phone. Still others were blackmailed, cops from cybercrime police station said. “That’s because the cyber cheats are continuously targeting people who use online payment modes and mobile banking techniques and apps. Since these modes are mostly preferred by the tech savvy, the cheats take advantage of the loopholes in online banking apps to dupe them,” the police said. Police said that online conmen frequently change their modus operandi. Besides luring bank customers on different pretexts and lucrative offers, they are using women to cheat the gullible. “A lawyer lost ₹39000 in cash after a cyber conman offered to deliver a pizza in 10 minutes and made him download an app. An assistant professor of Allahabad University (AU) was offered food for ₹10 from Sagar Ratna Restaurant. He used a mobile app and lost ₹10,000,” said the cops at cybercrime police station. “A police constable lodged an FIR at Dhumanganj police station after he lost cash ₹37000 from his bank account. The constable said he had received a call from a person posing as bank official who asked him to download an app on his mobile,” police said. “There are other instances too. Like that of a doctor who fell in a honey trap and was forced into transferring ₹35000 cash in his blackmailer’s bank account. The doctor later approached police when the woman made more demands of money,” the police said. Even a retired judge of the Allahabad High Court was duped of cash by a person who sought his personal details on the pretext of updating the judge’s bank account. Cyber police station in-charge Rajeev Kumar Tiwari said such incidents of fraud can be controlled only through massive awareness. “Online payment services should be used carefully, and their passwords and PIN number should not be shared with anyone under any circumstances. People should report to police if they receive such calls,” Tiwari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cyber-cheats-on-the-prowl-don-t-download-apps-on-stranger-s-advice-up-police-101631553331194.html

The applicants shall cooperate with the investigating agency. The applicants shall attend the concerned police stations on every second and fourth Sunday between 1pm and 2. The applicants shall provide permanent residential address and contact number of themselves and of two close relatives with documentary proof to the investigating agency within seven days from the date of their release on bail,” the order stated.According to police, the land grab took place between 2009 and May 2021. Mantra Properties allegedly got the land measured in their names by filing false documents with the Land Records Department. The police complaint stated that the accused have grabbed nine gunthas on plots 16, 20, 21 of 15,100 sqft on survey number 29. A special leave petition is pending in the Supreme Court. A private suit was filed in the court of judicial magistrate (first class), Khadki Cantonment, who directed police to lodge a case and investigate. Mukesh Gada, director, Gada group-29 Gold Coast said, “The land was purchased by paying all claims in front of Justice J A Patil appointed by the High Court.”“There is no civil litigation pending on this plot against the company for the said project in the Supreme Court. Police have already recorded our statements earlier. It is purely a civil litigation that the complainant is trying to make a case with. In his sale deed there are no boundaries marked or written which can locate his plots; the entire survey no 29 is around 50 acres plus. Looking into all these aspects district court of Pune has granted us interim bail,” Gada said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mantra-29-gold-coast-developers-get-bail-in-land-grab-case-101631551590320.html

13-09-2021||Other||163,112 cases pending before fast-track courts in Maharashtra||PUNE: In a reflection of the seriously slow pace of trials, there are as many as 163,112 lakh cases pending before various fast-track courts in Maharashtra with the state ranking second in terms of pendency of cases before fast-track courts, the ministry of law and justice stated in a reply in parliament. The mammoth pendency assumes significance in the wake of two recent rape-related deaths in Mumbai, and an underage girl recently raped by six persons in Pune where the police have promised fast-tracking of the case. Both Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray and Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta have promised fast-tracking of these cases for speedier delivery of justice.According to the department of justice, ministry of law and justice, the fast-track special courts’ scheme has been mooted for expeditious disposal of cases of rape and the Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Fast-track courts address different kinds of cases pertaining to crimes against women, child trafficking under the POCSO Act, crime against senior citizens, crime against the disabled, and other heinous crimes. In 2018, 1.60 lakh cases were disposed of by fast-track courts while 29,779 cases were decided by fast-track courts in 2019. Till May 2020, only 5,119 cases were decided by the fast-track courts.Advocate Milind Pawar said, “The sluggish working of fast-track courts defeats the very purpose of the institution whose main objective is faster disposal of pending cases. Factors such as the lack of physical infrastructure, shortage of dedicated judicial officials and clear mandates, less staff strength, and procedural reforms are essential elements that can fix the current situation.”Recent incidents of rape and gang-rape of minor girls and other heinous crimes against women have shaken the nation’s conscience. To prevent such crimes, “the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018” has been introduced to strengthen the relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC); Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC); Evidence Act; and Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) and provide for stringent punishment for the rape of children and women. The key motive behind introducing harsh punishment is to create deterrence against such crimes. However, it is only possible if the trial in the court is completed within the timeframe and justice is delivered expeditiously to the victims. This view is further supported by the proposed ‘National Mission for the Safety of Women’ anchored with the ministry of home affairs (MHA). One of the mission’s key objectives is to expedite trial and dispose of cases involving women and children by setting up fast-track special courts (FTSCs). The POCSO Act also mandates that the investigation in these cases is to be completed in two months and the trial in six months. However, despite a strong law and policy framework, a large number of rape and POCSO Act cases are still pending in various courts in the country, the ministry of law and justice said.In 2018, there were 22,775 cases pending under the POCSO Act and 138 fast-track courts were proposed.

Navid (Mushrif’s son) disclosed in his election affidavit in 2019, that he had taken the loan of ₹3.85 crore from Marubhumi Finance, ₹2 crore from CRM Systems, the two companies registered in Kolkata. The directors of these companies are Sikandar Desai, Aalamgir Mujawar, and Gopal Pawar who are close confidante of the minister. The family showed income from the companies which actually do no exist,” Somaiya said in a press conference.In 2018, the Central government struck off around 400,000 shell companies across the country.In a press conference held an hour later Mushrif said: “Kirit Somiya has been continuously targeting NCP leaders and ministers from the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government. Income Tax officials had raided my home and offices in 2019 ahead of the Assembly polls but they could not find anything substantial.”IT officials raided Mushrif’s home in 2019 based on complaints.Mushrif said he would file a defamation case against Somaiya and seek damages worth ₹100 crore. “I have faced not a single case in my 17 years’ stint (as minister),” he said. Mushrif also threatened to file a criminal case against state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil, whom he accused of providing incorrect information to Somaiya.“Kirit Somaiya has no correct information and the allegations are based on the information provided by BJP state chief Chandrakant Patil and their local leader Samarjeet Ghatge. Somaiya should have taken correct information before levelling such allegations,” Mushrif said.Somaiya, a former Member of Parliament alleged that Navid Mushrif and his mother Sahera, were shareholders in the Santaji Ghorpade sugar factory, a cooperative entity, which was involved in money laundering. He further alleged that the sugar factory had received crores of rupees from the shell companies from 2003 to 2014 the duration when Mushrif was a state cabinet minister in charge of various departments including labour.“I have already made complaints with Income Tax department by submitting 2700-page documents related to the corruption. I have also made a complaint with the Mumbai office of the Enforcement Directorate and with the Anti Corruption Bureau. I am heading to Delhi on Wednesday to take up the issue with ministries concerned, offices of Income tax, ED among others,” Somaiya said. Somaiya submitted the document to the IT department last week.Mushrif said that he was taking legal advice to file a complaint against Patil for his alleged corruption in the hybrid annuity model implemented while the latter was the public works department minister in previous BJP government in the state.Patil said that he was ready to face any inquiry. “The model implemented during our stint helped in construction of many roads which are being inaugurated by the Thackeray government now. Mushrif has threatened to file a case against me after his corruption was exposed by Somaiya. We are not afraid of any probe, Mushrif should go ahead with it,” he said, addressing queries from Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kirit-somaiya-levels-graft-allegations-against-mva-minister-101631551171295.html

Shetti has now launched a campaign and appealed farmers to give a missed call on the number 8448183751 if they support getting the FRP in a single installment.“The campaign is scheduled between September 12 and 30. Within a single day on September 12, we got over 1 lakh missed calls. We are hoping to get a huge response as we used social media as tool. We will submit this data to the central government and even add it to my petition which is in the Supreme Court,” Shetti said.“I am fighting for the farmers. I quit the BJP alliance as they did not resolve farmers’ issues. We were hoping that this government will take a decision in the interest of farmers. But when the central government sought feedback about paying farmers the FRP in two months, the MVA government without thinking of the farmers, gave the feedback in the interest of the sugar industry and asked that the FRP be paid in a year instead of over two months,” Shetti said.Earlier this month, Shetti undertook the Panchaganga parikrama and threatened to take a jal samadhi while demanding financial assistance for flood-affected farmers. Following the agitation, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with him and assured the farmer-leader that the government will look into his demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shetti-ups-the-ante-against-mva-government-101631550392853.html

The results were declared on August 30.According to Vishal Kumar, a medico of 2019 batch at DMCH, out of 120 students pursuing the MBBS course at DMCH, 50 have failed. On the other hand, as many as 39 students out of 116 from JLNMCH were declared failed. When contacted, the principal of JLNMCH, Dr Hemant Kumar Sinha, said that protesting students vented their ire against AKU for poor results. After the symbolic protest, OPD services were restored. He expressed sympathy with students while saying it was unprecedented that so many students failed this time.Protesting medicos at DMCH were persuaded by students in charge, Dr O P Giri, to allow the functioning of OPD in the interest of patients. Later on, a delegation of students approached the college principal Dr K N Mishra, who asked students concerned to provide their roll numbers and registration numbers for forwarding them to AKU for re-evaluation purposes.

For many years now, the villagers have been demanding a trauma care centre on the highway, especially since there is no emergency hospital along the Pune-Satara stretch. The Pune zilla parishad took the initiative and forwarded the proposal to the state health department and on Sunday, state health minister Rajesh Tope gave his go-ahead to the project and instructed that it be taken forward.Ranjit Shivtare, vice president, Pune zilla parishad, said, “The number of accidents taking place on NH4 on a daily basis is quite high and there is not a single trauma care centre between Pune and Satara. During times of emergency, victims do not get immediate medical aid so it was demanded to have such a centre on the highway. Accordingly, the proposal has been sanctioned in the general body meeting of the Pune zilla parishad and has now been sent ahead for further permissions. Yesterday, we held a meeting with health minister Tope and he too is positive about it and has instructed the department officials to follow the process.”“This new trauma care centre and district hospital will come up at Nasrapur on NH4 and a land parcel of 1 acre has been allotted for the project by the state government. A budget of Rs9 crore will be sanctioned for it soon after which the tender process for the actual work will start. If everything goes well, within one-and-a-half years, the trauma care centre will be functional to help accident victims and save lives,” Shivtare said.A similar proposal has been made for another trauma care centre in the Pirangut area, which is surrounded by several industrial and manufacturing companies. This too is located on the highway going towards Raigad district and there are accidents taking place along this stretch as well so a trauma care centre will prove helpful for accident victims.There is a trauma care centre operational at the Ozarde toll naka on the Pune-Mumbai expressway as well, which has all the necessary modern medical equipment and doctors to help accident victims during emergencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/trauma-care-centre-to-come-up-on-nh4-to-save-lives-101631549850045.html

These projects will reduce the dependence on city health infrastructure for emergency cases.” The proposal will now go for approval to the deputy director of health service Pune division, and the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/zp-to-convert-5-primary-health-centres-into-district-hospitals-trauma-care-units-101631548830042.html
13-09-2021||Mumbai||Pune, Ahmednagar contribute to nearly half of new Covid cases in Maharashtra||Two districts —Pune and Ahmednagar — are driving up the daily Covid-19 caseload by contributing nearly half of new cases in Maharashtra. While Mumbai has been reporting less than 500 cases for the past two months, Pune and Ahmednagar have been recording between 600 and 900 cases daily. On Monday, the state recorded 2,740 new Covid cases of which nearly 42% were from Pune and Ahmednagar. “The daily caseload has become a matter of concern for us,” said Dr Bhagwan Pawar, district health officer of Pune. “We have put all our focus on strengthening surveillance and aggressive contact tracing of high-risk as well as low-risk contacts. Lifting of lockdown restrictions has resulted in a massive movement of people which is driving up cases,” he said. Pune currently has more than 13,000 active Covid-19 patients — the highest in the state. The district’s daily testing hovers between 22,000 and 25,000. According to Pawar, the movement in Pune is different because of nearly 12 Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporations (MIDCs). “Many people come down from Marathwada and nearby districts, halt for a day or two and then go back. Therefore, the circulation of the infection is rampant,” he said, adding there could be other environmental factors such as humidity or temperature that could be responsible. “We need studies on these factors as well,” he said. Pune has administered over 9.1 million vaccine doses so far. The district has an estimated adult population of 7.8 million who are eligible for vaccination. To cover the population with both doses, the district needs to administer another 6.5 million doses. In Ahmednagar, majority of the Covid cases are coming from four talukas — Parner, Shrigonda, Pathardi, and Sangamner — that have been seen many religious gatherings, weddings as well as political events. “We have complained to the tehsildar about such events, but it seems to have become difficult to control people without lockdown restrictions,” said Dr Sunil Pokharna, civil surgeon of Ahmednagar. “There is also a lot of movement from Ahmednagar to Pune and Mumbai. In the recent weeks, many drivers and their families have tested positive for Covid after they returned from travelling to Pune and Mumbai,” he said. Ahmednagar currently has 6,600 active cases. The district is carrying out 15,000 to 18,000 tests daily. It has administered 2.1 million vaccine doses with around 480,000 people fully vaccinated. “There is some hesitancy reported from remote villages in Akola. But overall, vaccination is picking up. We are emphasising on Covid-appropriate behaviour and speedy vaccinations to bring down Covid cases that have remained stagnant around 700 since the past two months,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pune-ahmednagar-contribute-to-nearly-half-of-new-covid-cases-in-maharashtra-101631548771323.html

Nearly 8,200 contract and outsourced employees are seeking regularisation of their jobs for over 10 years. Presently, conductors on contract are being paid ₹9,118 per month, while drivers, also on contract, get ₹10,200 per month.The PRTC has been able to operate only 25% of its 1,100 buses for these nine days, with the strike hitting the life of the common man, especially those who commute to their places of work or business. Overall, the daily losses of the three STUs runs into crores of rupees, with 80% of public buses off road.Responding to the situation, the state government has invited the employees for a meeting, which chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh will chair, on Tuesday. On Monday, senior officials of the state transport department and the management of three STUs held meeting at Chandigarh to chalk out plan to resolve the issue in Tuesday’s meeting. PRTC managing director Bhupinderpal Singh said the issue will be discussed and resolved at the government level only. “I cannot comment much, as the government will take the final decision,” he added. Among other demands, the union is demanding stringent measures to keep check on transport mafia; streamlining of daily hourly roster; strengthening the STUs; implementation of equal work, equal salary law, and to stop unnecessary harassment of employees on day-to-day reports.Harkesh Kumar, state general secretary of Punjab Roadways, Punbus and PRTC Contract Workers Union, said, “We hope for a positive result in Tuesday’s meeting. If the government fails to consider our demands, our protest will be intensified.”PRTC INCURRING ₹95 LAKH LOSS A DAYThe PRTC, one of the key STUs, is facing a daily loss of between ₹90 lakh and ₹95 lakh over the past nine days with these employees on strike. Before the stir, the corporation’s daily income was around ₹1.5 crore; since the strike, the daily receipt has been recorded at around ₹55 lakh. “It will be difficult for the corporation to overcome these losses in coming days. Already, we were working hard to bridge the gap between daily income and expenditure, this new loss will put extra burden on corporation’s fiscal condition,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/roadways-staff-strike-bus-services-hit-for-9th-day-in-punjab-cm-to-meet-employees-on-tuesday-101631548710565.html

In this third regular round, for a total of 56,635 seats available, 29,505 students applied and 9,261 students were allotted a college. Of the 9,261 students, 2,314 students were given a college of their first preference, 2,143 students were given the college of their second preference and 1,340 students were given the college of their third preference. For this academic year a total of 85,701 students registered for the Class 11 admissions. Despite a high passing percentage for Class 10 this year, student registrations have been low this year for the available 112,965 seats. It is feared that a high number of seats will remain vacant this year. “One of the major reasons for the low number of registration is rural students who come to Pune for studies have not registered this year. This has a major impact on the admission process and would result in vacancy of seats,” said Meena Shendkar, assistant director of education, Pune, who is in-charge of the admission process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fyjc-admissions-merit-list-cut-offs-after-round-three-declared-101631548651471.html

13-09-2021||Delhi||Bored millennials get hooked to Shasn, the newest modern board game||Since time immemorial, board games have been the mainstays of quiet entertainment for various civilisations. Some of the earliest shreds of record in connection with board games come from Indus Valley Civilisation in the form of archaeological finds. Chaturanga was one of the more popular aristocratic games of ancient India. This immensely popular game has undergone various changes from chaturanga to shatranj to finally modern-day chess. The newest entrant into the fray is SHASN, a multiplayer political strategy board game created by Zain Memon, and published by Memesys Culture Lab, where each player takes on the role of a politician contesting elections and is required to take a stand on various political and ethical issues.In an ever-increasing digital world, all thanks to the pandemic induced boredom, board games have made a surprise comeback. Typically set on hard surfaces, including boards, game pieces, figurines, cards, dice, and other accessories, the board game market is growing by miles and leaps. Another one that has captured the imagination of many modern-day dwellers is Dungeons and Dragons, a fantasy tabletop role-playing game which has legions of adoring fans all across the western world. “SHASN managed to introduce a lot of players to the exciting world of modern tabletop games. Our vision is to keep expanding the market by creating fun, engaging games across genres and ages, and remind the country of its rich tabletop legacy,” quotes Zain Memon, designer, SHASN. And AZADI, the sequel to SHASN takes the political experience of its predecessor one step forward by plunging players into the shoes of revolutionaries attempting to overthrow a tyrannical Imperial power. The semi- cooperative board game is an effort to reclaim and rewrite history through the lens of the oppressed. Now that sounds like a reboot of your favourite Game of Thrones, doesn’t it?Coming to the era of internet civilisation, most of us have sneaked our way around a dragon’s lair to a heavy, hours-long strategic game about running a fast-food franchise, or have played at least one fantasy dungeon-crawler with the classic human/elf/dwarf/wizard party on a static board. “Pandemic induced lockdowns have made board games pretty popular. SHASN is one-of-its-kind game, the production values of SHASN which appear minimalistic in design but are just amazing. SHASN not only looks good but has high-quality linen cards and thick card stock of other elements. I hope AZADI is as fun as SHASN. This one will be in my collection for a long while. I highly recommend it,” says Karan Juneja, a gaming enthusiast.Board games that provide an intellectual challenge, or an opportunity for strategic thinking lures millennials and seniors alike. Understanding rules, finding an optimal placement for a piece, making a move that surprises your opponent—all of these are enormously gratifying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bored-millennials-get-hooked-to-shasn-the-newest-modern-board-game-101631546190373.html
13-09-2021||Kolkata||Bengal BJP seeks disqualification of 2 turncoat MLAs, moves assembly Speaker||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday appealed to West Bengal assembly Speaker Biman Banerjee to disqualify two of its legislators, Tanmoy Ghosh and Biswajit Das, under anti-defection law as they returned to the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) on August 30 and 31 respectively. While Ghosh is the legislator from Bishnupur in Bankura district, Das represents the Bagdah seat in North 24 Parganas. Both of them left TMC before the March-April polls. Leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, who left Mamata Banerjee’s cabinet in December last year, filed the petitions for disqualification on Monday afternoon. “I request you to dispose of the same as fast as possible,” said both the petitions that HT has seen. In the March-April polls, the BJP bagged 77 seats while the TMC won 213. The polls were held in 292 of the state’s 294 seats as the two TMC candidates died in Murshidabad. Two TMC candidates from North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas died of Covid-19 after the polls and it was found that they had won. These seats are lying vacant. Though the BJP wrested 77 seats, its score came down to 75 immediately after the polls as two legislators resigned from the assembly to retain their Lok Sabha seats. One of them is Nisith Pramanik who took oath as the Union minister of state for home affairs in July. Four BJP legislators have returned to the TMC although none have officially resigned from the party or the assembly. They are Tanmoy Ghosh, Biswajit Das, Kaliagunj MLA Soumen Roy and Krishnanagar North MLA Mukul Roy, a founder-member of the TMC who switched sides in 2017 and was made a BJP national vice-president last year. The BJP has already appealed for Mukul Roy’s disqualification and sought an explanation from Soumen Roy who returned to the TMC on September 4. No TMC leader commented on the BJP’s appeal for disqualification of the MLAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-bjp-seeks-disqualification-of-2-turncoat-mlas-moves-assembly-speaker-101631545892129.html

A case was registered against the three accused under sections 419, 420, 467, 468, 471, and 34 of the IPC. The mother and daughter were sent jail and raid were on to arrest the third accused, said A Satish Ganesh, commissioner of police, Varanasi. Osama Shahid, a final year MBBS student at Lucknow’s KGMU, used to send candidates seeking admissions to medical colleges to one ‘PK’, the kingpin of the solver gang. So far, he had sent several such candidates. The gang leader was a native of Mau, said Ganesh. Cops said the involvement of a doctor from a medical university in Lucknow also came to fore. The police had received inputs that a member of a solver gang was impersonating a candidate at the examination at the centre. A team of cops reached there and arrested the woman who was writing the exam. Julie Kumari and her mother Babita Devi were arrested from the spot, Vikas Kumar Mahto managed to flee, said a police officer.During interrogation, Babita Kumari revealed that Vikas Kumar Mahto was acquainted with her son Abhay Kumar Kushwaha.

13-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai gets above normal rain for September within first 13 days of month||After a prolonged dry spell last month, which resulted in the city’s fourth-driest August in 10 years, Mumbai recorded above normal rain for September within the first 13 days of the month, touching 407.4mm (as per the India Meteorological Department’s observatory in Santacruz). This is in excess of September’s normal average for the month at 327.1mm. In comparison, Mumbai saw only 338mm of rain in August, as opposed to the monthly normal of 546.2mm. The city recorded 39mm of rain in 24 hours ending 8.30am.A Negative Indian Ocean Dipole over the tropical Indian Ocean — a phenomenon where the western Indian ocean becomes colder than the eastern one and which is unfavourable for monsoon — prevailed throughout August, contributing to deficient rainfall, said experts at the IMD. There were also fewer typhoons in the West Pacific than is typical around this time of the year, leading to less westward movement of their remnant weather systems, into the Bay of Bengal.This led to fewer low-pressure systems forming over Bay, which typically activates monsoon activity across India. “Owing to a deep depression which has formed over the Bay of Bengal and a low-pressure area covering parts of south Gujarat, the northern part of the Konkan coast in Maharashtra has been receiving good rain for a week,” said Shubhangi Bhute, meteorologist with the IMD’s regional centre in Mumbai. She added that short bursts of heavy rain are likely to continue on Tuesday, after which moderate rainfall activity will prevail till at least Friday.In 24 hours ending 8.30am on Monday, the city and surrounding metropolitan areas received widespread moderate to heavy rain. While most monitoring locations of south Mumbai received between 20mm-40mm of rain, parts of the suburbs, Thane and Navi Mumbai received between 40mm and 70mm. Thane saw the heaviest showers, touching 142mm in the past 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-gets-above-normal-rain-for-september-within-first-13-days-of-month-101631545293212.html

Police have reached the spot and are scanning for evidence.Although no one was injured in the reported “attack”, the iron gate outside the MP's house showed marks.State BJP chief Dilip Ghosh was quick to say the assailants of Trinamool Congress were behind the attack while West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar took to Twitter to allege that “wanton violence” in Bengal show “no sign of abating.” The governor said he flagged his concerns to chief minister Mamata Banerjee.ALSO READ | Calcutta high court orders CBI probe into West Bengal post-poll violenceThe Trinamool Congress, however, rubbished the allegations and said the attack was a result of the Bengal BJP's internal feud.During the reported incident Arjun Singh was in Delhi but his family was inside the house, heavily guarded by personnel from the Central Reserve Paramilitary Force (CRPF). Singh had switched over from the Trinamool Congress to the BJP in 2019.

The phenomenon which occurs every year with varying intensity has been found on beaches in North Goa including along the sands of the Miramar beach in the capital city, Anjuna beach in North Goa as well as beaches further North including Morjim, Mandrem, Keri, as well as Colva beach in South Goa. Fishermen and tourism stakeholders have urged the Goa government to resolve the worsening environmental issue. Speaking to HT, Olencio Simoes, general secretary of the National Fishworkers Forum, said the tarballs were forcing the fishermen, especially the traditional ones, to dump their catch. “It happens every year, but this year the problem has been especially severe. The shellfish is completely covered in the tar and the entire colonies die out. Besides that, the nets are completely covered in tar and we have to throw the fish out as they cannot be cleaned,” Simoes said. “Tarballs can attract various heavy metals, including nickel, copper, and cobalt, to their surfaces. Due to different weathering processes, tarballs can accumulate high concentrations of heavy hydrocarbons, organic compounds that only contain carbon and hydrogen, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). This also causes cancer in humans besides complete destruction of marine life and loss to the livelihoods of thousands of fishermen,” he said. On Monday, a delegation of locals called on North Goa MP and Union minister of state for shipping Shripad Naik asking him to address the issue. A study by scientists at the National Institute of Oceanography, which backtracked the origin of the tarballs and using sea surface current modelling as well as chemical fingerprinting, found that the source of tarballs that arrive after the monsoons was used oil dumped in the sea by tankers that pass between the Middle East and South-East Asia. The tarballs that arrived in May were found to be crude oil spills from the Bombay High region. Tarballs are caused by the churning of the oil with seawater to become a thick paste which then washes ashore in the monsoons with the water currents. Some of the balls are as big as a dung cake while others are smaller globules that are a major irritant to those bathing in the sea or walking along the beach as they stick to the skin and are very difficult to wash off, the study said.The NIO also found that the Goan coast was close to one of the Sea Lines of Communication (SLOC), which is used by ships and international oil tankers coming from and going towards the Persian Gulf. Hence, all the oil spilt in the Arabian sea eventually gets deposited on the western coast in form of tarballs in the monsoon season when wind speed and circulation pattern favour transportation of these tarballs, the study said.Last year, Goa environment minister Nilesh Cabral wrote to the then Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar seeking help in tackling the problem. “We have tracked down the source of these tarballs after studying the phenomenon. We have written to the MoEF about the matter. The Central ministry will now study our findings before taking measures to address the issue which we have raised,” Cabral said.The Goa government officials said they were trying to find reasons for high tarball deposition on coasts this year as compared to previous years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/goa-beaches-sullied-by-tarballs-fishermen-tourism-stakeholders-worried-101631543612183.html

13-09-2021||Mumbai||Lake levels at 97 per cent, water stock to last Mumbai a year||Mumbai is unlikely to have any water cuts for the next one year as the water level in the seven lakes crossed the 97% mark on Monday. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has adequate water stock for the next 365 days. However, the final decision on water cuts is taken annually on October 1 post withdrawal of monsoon. Of the seven lakes supplying drinking water to the city, four— Tulsi, Vihar, Tansa and Modak Sagar — have already overflown once this monsoon. According to BMC’s data, the livestock of water is 100% in Modak Sagar, Tulsi and Vihar, and Tansa is 99%. The seven lakes that supply water to the city are located in Mumbai as well as neighbouring Thane and Palghar districts. This year, between July 16 and July 23, the catchment areas of the lakes received a maximum of its stock. On July 17, the overall water level in seven lakes was just 17% and the BMC was considering announcing a water cut. However, by July 22, water level crossed the 50% mark, followed by 60% on July 24 and 70% on July 28. On September 13, the water level was 97.72% in the seven lakes. Last year, on September 13, the water level was 97.87%, and it was 98.30% in 2019.Bhatsa dam in Thane which supplies 55% of the total annual water requirement of the city has 98% water stock, which was 97% last year at this time. In case of Upper Vaitarna, water level is 93% as of Monday. Last year at this time, the level stood at 98%. Middle Vaitarna has 95% of water stock as opposed to 96% last year at this time.The seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems —Vaitarna system which supplies to the western suburbs and the island city, and Bhatsa system which supplies to the eastern suburbs. The civic body supplies 3,850 million litres of water daily against the city’s demand for 4,200 million litres. In order to meet the shortfall, the BMC has been exploring several ways. Around two months ago, the civic body signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with an Israel-based firm for the city’s first desalination project at Manori in Malad. Under this project, the BMC plans to turn seawater into drinking water, and the pilot project is expected to be ready by 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lake-levels-at-97-per-cent-water-stock-to-last-mumbai-a-year-101631542829989.html
13-09-2021||Dehradun||Defection politics heats up in Uttarakhand with new entrants in BJP||Uttarakhand is just months away from the next state assembly elections to be held early in 2022 with all the contesting parties already in poll mode. However, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seems to be already going a step ahead of others by succeeding in welcoming two sitting MLAs, including one from Congress, into the party fold. The inclusions of the two MLAs, including Rajkumar from Purola constituency who was earlier in Opposition Congress, and independent MLA from Dhanaulti constituency Pritam Singh Panwar, created ripples in the state politics ahead of the elections. However, if the party insiders are to be believed, the mind behind this tactical move was of BJP Rajya Sabha member from the state and senior party leader Anil Baluni. Baluni, who was recently elevated in the party as the national chief spokesperson, was is believed to be the one who paved the way for the two MLAs to join the party. It was also evident during the events held at BJP headquarters in Delhi for the formal joining of the two MLAs during which they hailed his “leadership skills and development works in their respective constituencies.” “Rajya Sabha member Baluni played a major role in the inclusion of both Rajkumar and Panwar months before the elections. It was done very covertly and cleverly by him for which the persuasion was started a few months ago,” said a senior BJP leader on condition of anonymity. He added, “The MLAs were not included in the party without analysing the political equations. Panwar, who had played a significant role in the statehood movement, was also an MLA in the first assembly elections in 2002 after the formation of the state with Uttarakhand Kranti Dal. He has got his own strong support base.” “Similarly, Rajkumar who is an SC member, has a significant hold in the community which will benefit the party in the upcoming elections. Baluni knew all these and decided to get in the party,” the leader said. Another party leader too corroborated with him and said, “Apart from the above-mentioned reasons, the MLAs also have their own reasons to switch sides before the polls.” “Rajkumar, who was earlier in the BJP before fighting the 2017 elections on Congress ticket, was uneasy after senior Congress leader and former CM was handed over the charge for the 2022 polls by their national leadership. Our leadership sensed that and played the right card at right time,” said the leader. Despite several attempts, Baluni couldn’t be contacted. The two MLAs - Rajkumar and Panwar - didn’t speak openly on Baluni’s role in their joining the BJP but hailed him as an “efficient leader of Uttarakhand.” “Without any doubt, he is a very efficient leader who is concerned for the development of the state. During the first and the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, his relief works done for the poor in the state is its evidence. I was very impressed with that,” said Panwar. Rajkumar, who joined the BJP from Congress on Sunday, hailed Baluni’s works on the improvement of health infrastructure in his constituency. “I was mighty impressed with him when he helped in setting up an ICU in the government hospital in my constituency which falls in a small district of Uttarkashi. He didn’t see that I was an MLA from his opponent party. That just showed how much he is concerned for the people of the state, especially those hailing from the hills,” said Rajkumar. Party state president Madan Kaushik refused to comment on any leader’s role in the inclusion of the two MLAs, saying, “They were influenced by the charismatic leadership of PM Narendra Modi which they even accepted during the formal induction at the party headquarters.” “They saw that today BJP is the only party that is working for the development of Uttarakhand and the country under the able leadership of PM Modi. Hence, they decided to join the party in the national interest,” said Kaushik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/defection-politics-heats-up-in-uttarakhand-with-new-entrants-in-bjp-101631541571113.html
13-09-2021||Chandigarh||Central agencies discuss drone threat from Pakistan at high-level Attari meeting||As drones from Pakistan continue to pose a threat in the border areas, the country’s security agencies have been on toes mulling measures to deal with the arising situation. A high-level meeting of central agencies’ officials was held at the Integrated Check Post (IPC), which facilitates India’s trade with Pakistan and Afghanistan, to increase vigil and strengthen the Attari border’s security. The meeting was attended by the officials of Border Security Force (BSF), customs, Land Port Authority of India (LPAI), immigration, Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC), intelligence wing, etc. The meeting comes on the day when a drone entered into the Indian territory at Bharopal village, 18 km from the Attari border. Punjab Police suspected that the drone had returned to Pakistan after dropping a consignment. The police have also recovered a plastic cover which is used by anti-national elements in Pakistan to pack consignments of drugs or weapons. A manhunt has also been launched by the police. “The meeting focused on how to deal with the threat of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) which were being used by anti-India forces for smuggling explosives and drugs. It was discussed to increase the vigil at the Attari border and the ICP. More manpower will be used to keep a close eye on the border,” said a senior official, who was part of the meeting. He said, “There is a suspicion that anti-national elements in Pakistan may use drones to drop arms or explosive at Attari border. Though our forces are capable of dealing with any kind of situation, but we have to remain extra vigilant.”“We have also noticed increase in trade activities from Afghanistan. On Monday, 45 tuckloads of goods reached from Afghanistan. Every truck is being checked keeping in view of the Taliban taking over Afghanistan’s control. We are not taking any chances,” he added. In July, the Indian Air Force (IAF) base in Jammu was attacked using two low intensity improvised explosive devises (IEDs), which were allegedly dropped by two drones. Earlier, on August 10, a tiffin bomb, five hand grenades and 100 pistol cartridges were found near a drain at Daleke village, around 5km from Attari border. This consignment was also allegedly dropped by a drone from Pakistan. ICP’s manager Sukhdev Singh confirmed the meeting, but refused to divulge agenda of the meeting. Punjab Police recovered some drones that were used by Indian and Pakistani suspects for the smuggling of arms, ammunition and drugs in the last three years. “Anti-national elements often use UAVs late night making it difficult for our jawans to shoot them down. Our forces, many times, opened fire and forced drones to retreat,” said a senior BSF official, who didn’t wish to be named. BSF’s Punjab inspector general (IG) Sonali Mishra didn’t respond to phone calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/central-agencies-discuss-drone-threat-from-pakistan-at-high-level-attari-meeting-101631541330251.html

Das joined the BJP from TMC in 2019.Biswajit Das had courted controversy within his own party ahead of the assembly elections in Bengal earlier this year, when he accused the BJP of "blackmailing" the people of the powerful Matua community on the pretext of granting citizenship. Despite joining the BJP, Das was also seen touching the feet of chief minister Mamata Banerjee at the state assembly last February, giving rise to speculations that he could return to the Trinamool Congress.West Bengal has been witnessing a reverse trend of leaders rejoining TMC from BJP after assembly elections results. Earlier, BJP heavyweight Mukul Roy and his son Subhranshu Roy joined TMC. The Mamata Banerjee-led TMC registered a landslide victory in polls winning 213 seats in the 294-member West Bengal Assembly.

This is the second time since August that she has targeted the BJP government on the issue of inadequate relief to those displaced and devastated by floods.“People of UP, especially eastern UP, have witnessed widespread loss, destruction and devastation. Government help is also mostly on paper and hence there is an urgent need to ensure ensuring relief to the flood-hit,” Mayawati tweeted.“I urge the party cadres to reach out to the affected and provide the flood-hit all such help to the needy in whichever way they can,” said the four-term UP chief minister.In August, Mayawati, while reacting to a tweet put out by @BJP4UP, the BJP’s official Twitter handle for UP, claimed that it was “shameful” that BJP was playing “dirty politics” over floods.Her reaction was over the BJP post that claimed that while chief minister Yogi Adityanath was busy organising relief and rescue operations in flood-hit areas, the BSP was holding caste conferences.She had then hit back at the BJP saying instead of launching ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatras’, the BJP should have organised ‘flood victims’ assistance yatra’ to help those hit by floods in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/floods-have-devastated-east-up-government-s-relief-is-on-paper-mayawati-101631535990855.html

There is a crisis of beds at the district hospital and Jabalpur Medical College as many patients of seasonal flu, malaria and chikungunya have also been admitted at the hospital, said Rakesh Pahariya, district malaria officer, Jabalpur. Now, the district administration swung into action and started identifying the hotspot of dengue larva. “We are holding a door to door survey and also conducting fumigation to kill the larva in the district,” said Karamveer Sharma, district collector, Jabalpur. Indore and Bhopal district administrations also swung into action to contain the breeding of Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes.In Indore, a door-to-door sample collection drive is being done to check the presence of larva of the Aedes mosquito.Similarly, in Bhopal, fumigation is being done in the areas where a high number of cases has been reported. According to health experts, the symptoms of dengue-infected people are more serious. High fever and reduction of platelets are causing trouble for patients. Dr Pankaj Agrawal from Bhopal said, “High fever and sudden reduction of platelets are the reason behind the high rate of hospitalization of patients. It seems that the dengue virus also changed its variant.”The state health department issued a warning to all district administration and municipal corporations to make necessary arrangements to kill larva and identify the hotspots.State malaria officer Himanshu Jaiswal said, “We have sent samples to the National Institute of Virology Pune to check the variant but the report is awaited. We have given necessary directions to all the district officers to remain alert because the next two months are a favourable environment for breeding mosquitoes.”Medical education department minister Vishwas Sarang said, “Health, district administration and municipal bodies’ officers are jointly working to contain the spread. We are also spreading awareness among people by releasing a list of Dos and Don’t. We are also appealing to people that the condition is under control in MP so there is no need to panic.”The opposition was quick to attack the state government for failing to control the seasonal diseases.Congress MLA Kunal Choudhary said, “MP state government failed to contain the spread of seasonal diseases.

13-09-2021||Delhi||Two mile fashion: Chic, comfy, carefree||The pandemic followed by lockdown, #WFH and restricted social gatherings changed almost everything, including the way we dress up. Something which was called too boring to be worn outside has now become a chic style statement. Known as ‘2 Mile Fashion’, this trend is super comfy and relaxed. Brands are inspired to bring out collections featuring clothes that are simple yet stylish. “During the pandemic, staying indoors and having fewer avenues to venture out and socialise made people realise the value of things. People now wish to carve out a simpler lifestyle and avoid unnecessary expenditure on expensive, luxury goods.

Options abound for those who like the relaxed look. Jumpsuits, playsuits, culottes, loose fitted shirts, shorts, dresses and mid-length skirts, all spell comfort. “They need to be easy-to-wear, crinkle-free and trendy. Loungewear shouldn’t be restricted only to casual clothing like track pants, pajamas, hoodies etc. People want to look stylish for their WFH zoom meetings, casual dinners, drives or going out to a friend’s house,” says fashion designer Deepika Arora. Her new collection is inspired by this concept. “People prefer versatile pieces that are stylish and transitional from day to night yet comfortable. Two miles fashion doesn’t have to be restricted to home-wear. Most consumers today need chic, comfortable clothing to run errands, and deal with life’s little moments, without any hassle,” adds Arora.The concept is ersatile and can be styled up or down very easily. “For women, there are multiple options from joggers and hoodies to kaftans/kimonos, kurta sets, co-ords, wide-legged pants, and so on. Men can go with joggers, bermuda shorts, linen pajamas, kurtas, and so on. These can be worn at home to lounge in, for virtual meetings, house parties, casual dinners, and movies. These make perfect comfy travel outfits as well,” says Prashasti Goyal, founder of a sustainable homegrown brand, Auruhfy. Not just the clothing brands, shoe brands are also launching 2 mile footwear ranges. Matteo Lambert, Chief Collection Officer, Bata India Limited, “Even as the world opens up and people start stepping out, they lookout for footwear that can provide them home-like comfort all day long. The lines between strictly formal wear and casual wear are bound to blur. This has paved the way for 2-mile footwear, offering the perfect balance between lounge and workwear. We witness an uptick in demand for two-mile footwear in the last one year. Overall, demand for two-mile footwear has increased by 20%, and this trend is here to stay.” Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-mile-fashion-chic-comfy-carefree-101631530232746.html
13-09-2021||Delhi||Relish the rustic and rare taste of Bihar||What’s the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of Bihari cuisine? The delicious litti-chokha, right? However, chef Nishant Choubey shares, “Let’s not summarise Bihari cuisine as only litti-chokha. Bihari cuisine is unique, not just from its historic relevance but due to its diverse nature. I call it ‘food for the soul’ since it satisfies all your five senses. Every dish has its style.” Got tempted to try out more? Well, bringing authentic Bihari cuisines to your doorstep, the Bihar Bhawan canteen is now live on the food delivery app. “Bihar Bhawan is the first State House in the NCR to tie up with Zomato. Dishes that are ordered the most include bhuna maas, sarson wali machhli, litti-chokha and chicken curry,” says Raj Srivastava, canteen manager of the Bhawan.Bihari cuisines consists of traditional dishes both in the vegetarian and non-vegetarian categories. One can savour a variety of breads, appetisers, side-dishes, fast food variants of traditional delights and desserts. Nevertheless, litti-chokha remain on the top of the list for foodies across India. So what exactly is litti-chokha, you ask? “The litti is a ball made of dough (wheat flour) and stuffed with sattu (pitti) and then roasted [on open fire], while chokha is a blend of eggplants, potatoes, tomatoes and a whole lot of spices. It is not cooked like a regular sabzi, rather it is a roasted vegetable mix. Traditionally, it’s roasted over cow-dung [or coal or wood fire]. We use coal in our canteen,” shares Raghvendra Singh, head chef at the Bhawan.There is even a dedicated festival to this dish known as ‘Litti-Chokha Mela’. “It’s a unique five-day fair where people gather to make and eat only one kind of the recipe/dish, litti-chokha. Residents from all over the town of Buxar and nearby villages turn up in large numbers for this mela,” adds Singh.Sattu is another popular drink from the state known for its health benefits. “We fill litti with roasted sattu, we have sattu ka parantha, sattu drinks and much more. They are high in dietary fibre and serve as a good source of proteins. You can eat it as much, almost guilt-free,” adds Srivastava. For non-vegetarians, Bihari feast is a gastronomer’s haven. From mutton-litti, chicken-litti, mustard fish curry, bhuna mutton, fish fry, champaran handi meat, Bihari kebab, fish curry, prawn curry, potiya machhli there are options galore.“Indigenously originated in Middle Eastern cuisine, kebab is the most-loved dish among non-vegetarians. Bihari variant of kebab comprise juicy chunks of chicken or meat marinated in yoghurt and poppy seed paste. It is then barbecued till it turns golden. They are served best when wrapped in parathas with a squeeze of lemon juice on top,” says Singh.Champaran handi meat is a popular dish from the Champaran-Bettiah belt. “Handi meat gained popularity due to its unique cooking method and ingredients. Entire mixture of mutton, onion, grind spices and other ingredients are mixed with mustard oil and placed into an earthen pot over midly heated charcoal,” says Choubey.Bihari fish-curry, especially the rohu variety, with mustard paste, is another finger-licking delight. “The secret lies in the ingredients, which include mustard seeds, garlic, ginger, cumin, red chili roasted lightly before grinding . As the region of Mithila has a pisciculture tradition, machh-bhat has become the trademark cuisine of that region. Rohu, naini, bhakur, singhi, pothi are typical varieties of fish cultivated in Mithila. Fish curry, fried fish, fish-egg pakora, fish pickles are some traditional delicacies of the region.

13-09-2021||Patna||50-year-old woman in Bihar dies in police lockup, SHO, IO suspended||A senior Bihar Police officer has sought a detailed report on the mysterious custodial death of a 50-year-old woman at Piro police station in state’s Bhojpur district on Sunday amid allegations that she was physically tortured for four days in illegal detention.The local police claimed that the woman was detained in a murder case and hung herself inside the toilet adjacent to the lock-up inside the police station. She was immediately rushed to Sadar Hospital but was declared brought dead by the doctors, a police officer said, requesting not to be named.Deceased’s brother said his sister and her son were detained by Piro police on September 8 in connection with the murder of a rural medical practitioner Mantosh Kumar Arya and that his sister was illegally kept at a women constable’s quarter in the premises of Piro police station instead of the women lockup for four days. He alleged that she was physically tortured by policemen and demanded registration of an FIR against the Piro police station chief and investigation officer (IO) of the murder case.Explaining the reasons for the woman’s arrest, a local cop said she was detained after Mantosh’s body was recovered on September 1 following a missing complaint lodged by his family on August 29. He said at least six persons including the woman, her son, three cousins of Mantosh and the chief accused Birendra Ram were detained in the murder case on September 8.The deceased was a mother of five including a daughter. Two of her children worked in a private company at Rajkot in Gujarat, while her husband worked at Jamshedpur in Jharkhand.Shahabad range deputy inspector general (DIG) P Kanan told HT on Monday that he has directed Bhojpur superintendent of police (SP) to immediately suspend the station house officer (SHO) and the case investigation officer (IO). Earlier, the SP had suspended three women cops responsible for keeping an eye on the deceased for dereliction of duty.DIG has also sought an action taken report from Bhojpur police detailing incidents leading to the death of the woman, time and place of occurrence as well as the reason for her arrest or detention.On Sunday evening, Bhojpur SP Vinay Tiwari, along with a Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) team, reached the spot and gathered details about the incident. The SP said that an inquiry had been ordered into alleged lapses in the handling of the murder case. He added that the chief judicial magistrate had been informed and proceedings were being carried out as per the law.Meanwhile, political parties like the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the Congress, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) CPI (M), the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) CPI (ML) said that Bhojpur police’s action to “illegally” detain a woman, who did not have any criminal antecedent, in the police station for four days and subjecting her to physical torture cannot be termed as discharge of public duty. The opposition parties have termed it a case of misuse of powers.On Monday. More than 50 residents from Mothi and neighbouring villages shouted slogans outside Piro police station demanding judicial probe into the incident. The protests started at 10 am and continued till 3 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/50yearold-woman-in-bihar-dies-in-police-lockup-sho-io-suspended-101631528789043.html

While the personnel who died of Covid-19 belonged to various departments, almost 95% of them were teachers from the education department (basic education, secondary education, higher education and technical education). The government initially made a provision for ₹30 lakh ex gratia but this covered only the day the staff was on election duty. By this criterion, only 74 personnel died (40 due to Covid and 34 for other reasons) during election duty. The government later changed the definition of election duty to accommodate more personnel by increasing the duty period to 30 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/2097-govt-personnel-died-of-covid-during-election-duty-in-up-101631526688542.html

13-09-2021||Mumbai||Frame policy for vaccinating homeless: Bombay high court tells Centre, state||The Bombay high court on Monday directed the state and central governments to address the issue of Covid vaccination of the homeless and those with an unsound mind.Hearing a Public Interest Litigation by activist TJ Bhanu, a division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni said the authorities should frame a proper policy to vaccinate the persons identified by the state and inform the court of the same within three weeks. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Centre said a similar petition was being heard by the Supreme Court. He added that there was a provision in law for local authorities to shift the homeless to shelters and as per the Mental Healthcare Act, the police were duty bound to locate mentally unsound persons and either unite them with their family or shift them to institutions through which they could be given the jabs. Also Read | Uddhav Thackeray calls for a meeting with police chiefs, home dept officialsThe bench, however, sought to know why no proper decision was taken for vaccinating the mentally unsound though it had observed in the previous hearing that the May 27 advisory of the Central government did not contain any specific guidelines for such people. “The May 27 advisory does not cover mentally ill. If we do not choose to vaccinate mentally ill and he is left to decide, he would be threat to society, why don’t you come up with policy to vaccinate mentally ill,” observed the bench. The bench observed that the issue was regarding homeless persons too as there was no mechanism to identify if they were infected with Covid. The state government, through the additional government pleader, submitted that around 20,950 homeless persons were identified in July and around 1,761 mentally ill persons were vaccinated in that month. The bench noted that the affidavit was silent on homeless mentally ill persons and whether the 1761 vaccinated persons included them. The court then directed the state to file a better affidavit with steps to reach out to such persons within two weeks and posted the hearing of the PIL after three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/frame-policy-for-vaccinating-homeless-bombay-high-court-tells-centre-state-101631525548398.html
13-09-2021||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray calls for a meeting with police chiefs, home department officials on women’s safety||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is scheduled to meet the chiefs of police forces, Government Railway Police (GRP) commissioner and senior officials of the home department on Monday to discuss the issue of women’s safety in the state. Thackeray’s call for a meeting comes days after the rape and brutalisation of a 34-year-old woman rocked financial capital Mumbai.The Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government was subjected to intense criticism by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Leader of opposition in the legislative council Pravin Darekar said the patience of women has run out due to such “repeated” offences, which occur due to “carelessness of the government”.“The incident has only happened due to the carelessness of the government. We want an action plan for such crimes to not happen in the future. Rape incidents have happened in Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Amravati, Ahmednagar, Palghar and Vasai, where women were brutalised. Now the Sakinaka incident is chilling; it is as gruesome as the Nirbhaya rape case in Delhi,” Darekar said.Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' came out with an editorial on Monday condemning the rape but insisted that Mumbai is the "safest city" in the world for women and there should be no doubt about it in anyone's mind. "The rape and murder of the woman in Sakinaka has shocked one and all. But, Mumbai is the safest city in the world for women and there should be no doubt about it in anyone's mind," the party said.The editorial also condemned comparisons with similar tragedies in Hathras and Kathua, alleging that the culprits in such cases were protected by the state and there were delays in arrests but the 45-year-old accused in the Sakinaka incident was arrested by police without delay.The party also defended Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale's comment that police cannot be present at all the scenes of crime, adding that police in all states will agree with his opinion. Nagrale was criticised by a member of the National Commission for Women (NCW) for his comment."The statement is extremely unfortunate. Police can't run away from their responsibility,” Chandramukhi Devi, an NCW member told reporters on Sunday. Nagrale had defended Mumbai police by insisting that they responded in a timely manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-calls-for-a-meeting-with-police-chiefs-home-department-officials-on-women-s-safety-101631524741629.html
13-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM says Badals playing double game on farm laws||Balachaur (Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar): Sounding the bugle for the 2022 Punjab elections, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Monday accused Shiromani Akali Dal patriarch and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son and former deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal of playing a double game on the farm laws passed by the Narendra Modi government last year. Also read: States should give decomposers to farmers to prevent stubble burning: KejriwalCapt Amarinder Singh said that the Shiromani Akali Dal, as an ally of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, first endorsed the three farm ordinances but later did a U-turn under pressure from its rural constituency of farmers in Punjab. The chief minister took on the Akalis while addressing a function after laying the foundation stone of the first college of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) at Ballowal village in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district. Harsimrat part of cabinet when ordinances made “The three farm ordinances were made in agreement of the Shiromani Akali Dal, as Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal was a part of the cabinet that passed the ordinances,” Capt Amarinder said. He said that the former chief minister, Parkash Singh Badal, had issued a video statement, endorsing the farm laws and advocating that there was nothing wrong in the new ordinances. He accused the Akali Dal of abandoning the interest of farmers when its backing was needed and supporting them now when they are protesting the farm laws tooth and nail. Repeal laws unacceptable to farmers: CM to Centre Capt Amarinder Singh said that the Centre must repeal the three farm laws by amending the Constitution as the legislation was unacceptable to farmers. “The Punjab government debunked the three farm laws by passing laws in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha. The Congress is the first party to oppose the three laws and call an all-party meeting with farm leaders,” said the Punjab CM. He announced increasing the subsidy for fencing around farms in the Kandi area from 60% to 90%. He also announced the setting up of five horticulture estates in the state. Step-motherly approach towards Punjab: Tewari Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari told the gathering that the Centre was meting out a step-motherly treatment towards Punjab by toughening its stand on the release of ₹1,600 crore as rural development fund (RDF). Tewari said chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh was the first to raise a voice against the three farm laws. First PAU college outside Ludhiana PAU vice-chancellor Anirudh Tiwari said that the admission process for the first college of PAU outside Ludhiana has been completed and classes will begin by October. The batch comprises 60 students. He said that the PAU regional research centre at Ballowal has been doing research in the field of apple cultivation in the Kandi area and other varieties of oil seeds. Capt Amarinder Singh also handed over cheques for debt waiver to landless farmers and labourers. State education minister Vijay Inder Singla, Balachaur MLA Darshan Lal Mangupur and SBS Nagar MLA Angad Singh were present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-says-badals-playing-double-game-on-farm-laws-101631523568261.html

According to a police release on Monday, they received inputs from the chief minister’s office on September 8 that the chief engineer (public health engineering-water) received a note with a forged signature of the CM with directions that a contract worth over ₹3 crore be awarded to Lohit Construction. A case was lodged at Dispur police station and four persons of the company were called in for questioning.

13-09-2021||Delhi||States should give decomposers to farmers to prevent stubble burning: Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday urged the Centre to direct other states to start providing their farmers with a proprietary microbial solution that turns rice stubble into natural manure for free so as to prevent stubble burning, which is a major contributor to air pollution in Delhi-NCR. Addressing a digital press conference, Kejriwal said a third party audit by the Central government’s WAPCOS has found the microbial solution to be “highly effective” in converting stubble into manure. “The WAPCOS inspected 15 villages in four districts of Delhi and interviewed 79 farmers to understand whether the new decomposers have helped or not. The central government agency found that the farmers in Delhi are very happy with the results of these bio-decomposers,” he said. Citing the report, Kejriwal said 90% of the 79 farmers said their rice stubble decomposed in 15-20 days only. It found that wheat production in these farms increased by about 8%. Last year, the Delhi government had provided this microbial solution for free to all its farmers. In total, the Delhi government along with the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) – usually referred to as the Pusa institute, which developed this technology, used this on a total of 1,935 acres of farmlands in 39 villages of Delhi. Also Read | Delhi Police save man from jumping off Andrews Ganj flyover“The report states that farmers earlier had to plough the soil 6-7 times, but after using the new solution, the soil needs to be ploughed only once or twice. It also found that the level of organic carbon in these farms increased by 40%. Nitrogen content in these farmlands also increased by 24% and the quality of soil has also improved. The presence of bacteria that helps crops grow also rose by about 7%. The use of DAP fertilisers has also reduced to only 36-40 kilograms per acre,” Kejriwal said. He said the Delhi government had written to the newly constituted Air Quality Commission ,too informing them about this new technology developed by Pusa Institute. “But, they told us that it is only the Delhi government which thinks it has been successful and that the efficacy of the technology required a third party audit. So, we roped in Centre’s WAPCOS for the audit and they have submitted their report now. I will seek an appointment with the Union environment minister to share the findings of the report with him,” the Delhi chief minister said. “I urge the Centre to direct all other neighbouring states to start providing this microbial solution to their farmers for free so that we can curb air pollution this year which starts severing from around October 10 as stubble burning in the neighbouring states takes off,” he said. Kejriwal said last year in October, the Centre in its desperate attempts to control air pollution in Delhi-NCR, proposed heavy fines and even jail for polluters, including farmers who were burning paddy stubble, leading to the city’s deadly winter smog. “But the fault is that of the governments. The fault is not of the farmers. So, I hope state governments also adopt this new technology,” he said. Along with three new farm laws, thousands of farmers are also protesting these harsh measures, saying they cannot afford costly alternatives. Farmers across Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh typically harvest paddy in October and then set their fields on fire to clear rice stalks for the next crop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/states-should-give-decomposers-to-farmers-to-prevent-stubble-burningkejriwal-101631521828054.html

He had hidden it under the bed,” said Dinesh Joshi, ranger, Pithoragarh forest. Joshi said forest officials and special operation group of police raided Kapelshwar Mahadev temple in Kafladi village, 6-km from Pithoragarh district headquarter, on Sunday, following a tip-off that the 70-year-old ascetic, Chandan Giri, regularly delivered religious discourses sitting on the hide of a tiger, a banned article under the wildlife act.He was arrested for possessing a two-metres long leopard’s hide, which also had the skeleton of the animal’s head including its teeth. Generally, leopard hides are recovered headless, forest officials said. The ascetic told officials that it was gifted to him by one of his disciples some months ago. He was booked under relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act and produced in the court from where he was sent to jail on Monday, said officials. Joshi said that the hide appeared to be one-and-a half-years old. “The ascetic claimed that he used to deliver religious discourses sitting on the hide but it was recovered from under his bed, which suggests that the monk was up to something,” he said.

13-09-2021||Patna||Patna HC questions mining in heritage hillocks without environmental clearance||The Patna high court last week asked the Bihar government why it allowed private parties to extract raw material from the ‘Lomas’ and ‘Yagyawallakya’ hillocks in Nawada district, which carry great heritage value, without obtaining the requisite environmental clearances and if depredation of the ecology and biodiversity of Rajauli area in Nawada was considered before allowing the mining activities.The court said it prima facie found that environmental clearances was not obtained for commercial activity on the hillocks, situated just 3.5 kilometers from Koderma Wildlife Sanctuary, and asked secretaries of the Union ministries of culture and environment, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and principal secretary of the department of mines, Bihar government, to file personal affidavits in this regard within three weeks.The matter has been listed for next hearing on October 5, till when the cultural heritage and environment of the area will continue to receive protection under interim orders passed on July 20, 2021 by the bench of chief justice Sanjay Karol and justice Sanjay Kumar.A Rajauli (Nawada) resident Vinoy Kumar Singh had filed the case, seeking protection of the environment and the ecosystem surrounding ‘Lomas’ and ‘Yagyawallakya’ hillocks, named after ancient sages and carrying religious, cultural and historical significance evidenced in the presence of ancient temples, stairs and caves.Citing the Bihar District Gazetteer, Gaya, published in 1906 by the then Indian Civil Service (ICS) officer LSS O’Malley and other scriptures, identifying the hillocks as abode of sages such as Durvasa, Lomas, Gautam, Shringi and Yagyawallakya, the petition pleads for a survey in the area, granting the hillocks status of heritage and protected sites of great historical and religious value, and restrain on all ongoing stone quarrying and mining activities in the area.The petitioner has also sought the withdrawal of the no-objection certificate (NOC) granted for mining lease, citing distortion of facts in the enquiry report, such as claim that it was not forest land and there was no water source or river within 500 meters of the concerned site and that the local villagers had no objection to issue of mining licenses.The counsel for the petitioner, Brisketu Saran Pandey, said that following the July order of the court, work has stopped at the site. “The report submitted from the ground was wrong, as it completely ignored the sensitivity and heritage value of the ancient hillocks. I have also mentioned it before the court. It is an ecologically sensitive place and due precaution should have been taken before allowing any mining activity,” he added.Harjot Kaur Bamhrah, principal secretary-cum-mines commissioner, could not be contacted for his comment.The chairman of the recently constituted State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority, Bihar, Atul Aditya Pandey, who is also the head, department of Geology, Patna University, said the matter had not come before him so far. “I have just joined. But there is a clearly laid down procedure, which requires vendors to obtain a NOC from around 15 places before it is presented before the authority for review.

IMD’s observatory in Santacruz, considered representative of the city, recorded 39 mm of rain in the same period.As per IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai, “moderate rain in city and suburbs with possibility of heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places” is likely to continue for the next 48 hours.The department said that the rains were the result of a favourable synoptic situation arising from an active monsoon trough running across the country from east to west, in close proximity to cyclonic circulations associated with low-pressure areas over Rajasthan and the Bay of Bengal. For the north Maharashtra coast, southwesterly winds of 35 to 40 kmph speed will prevail.A spokesperson with the IMD’s regional centre in Mumbai said, “It will be a wet couple of days around Mumbai. As the low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal moves inward, into Odisha, it will sustain the sporadic rains that the MMR region has been receiving. There may be chances of heavier rains in some parts of north Maharashtra on September 14. Please wait for IMD’s update later today for the official forecast.”As per the district-wise forecast released by the IMD's regional centre Monday afternoon, Mumbai has been placed under an orange category weather alert on Monday, September 13 -- indicating likely chances of heavy rain, with very heavy rain at isolated locations -- followed by a yellow category weather alert on September 14, indicating likely chances of heavy rain at isolated locations.The intensity of rainfall is likely to reduce from Wednesday, when Mumbai has been placed under a green category weather alert, indicating only moderate rains. The India Meteorological Department classifies 15.6-64.4 mm as moderate rain while 64.5-115.5 mm rain as heavy, 115.6-204.4 mm as very heavy, over 204.5 mm as extremely heavy rain, and over 300 mm as exceptionally heavy rain.Raigad, Ratnagiri, Thane and Palghar districts, too, have been placed under an orange category weather alert on Monday, while Sindhudurg (the furthest in proximity to prevailing rain-bearing weather systems) has been placed under a yellow category weather alert. Palghar, which is the closest to the active monsoon trough, has been kept under an orange alert for Tuesday. Wednesday onward, all Konkan districts will receive only moderate rain, expect Palghar, when showers will continue to remain between heavy to very heavy.Nashik, Pune, Satara and Kohlapur districts in Madhya Maharashtra, too, have been placed under an orange category weather alert today, but are expected to see lighter rainfall from Tuesday. The entire state has been placed under a green alert September 16 onward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/moderate-to-heavy-rain-to-continue-in-mumbai-and-suburbs-till-wednesday-imd-101631507426039.html

All the three injured are women, who are undergoing treatment at Purnia Government Medical College and Hospital (PGMCH), a police officer said.Police have identified the deceased as Mohammed Jahangir, 24 and Mohammed Mursalin, 45, both members of rival groups who died during treatment at PGMCH.“The incident is related to a dispute between Mohammed Irshad and Mohammed Mursalin over one bigha land in the village,” Rupauli station house officer (SHO) Manoj Kumar said, adding, “Both the sides had called village panchayats several times to sort out their dispute but that hadn’t helped,” Kumar said. One of the deceased, Mohammed Jahangir, was the son of Mohammed Irshad. Rupauli and Bhawanipur police reached the spot soon after the clashes and recovered a country made pistol and used cartridges from the site. “A manhunt has been launched to arrest Mohammed Kaushar, brother-in-law of Mursalin, who allegedly shot Jahangir in his chest, leading to his death in the hospital during treatment,” the SHO saidPolice said the firing incident led to a fierce fighting between the two sides, resulting in grievous injuries to Mursalin, Angoori Khatun, Sameena Khatun, Jaynam Khatun after they were attacked with conventional weapons to avenge Jahangir’s death. Mursalin died in the hospital during treatment.Police said a few days ago, Rupauli police had tried to settle their land dispute amicably at a janta darbar (court for people) organised at Rupauli police station. “Even Rupauli circle officer (CO) tried to sort out the issue and when the two sides didn’t agree, the CO asked them to take the matter to the court.

13-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Why so happy, ma’am?||She is grinning. Her smile is sparkling brighter than her tiny nose ring. Munawar Begum’s only son has successfully completed his 10th standard. “See, this is Azimuddin’s certificate,” she says, flashing her mobile phone screen. Her hands are trembling with nervous excitement, making it impossible to read the online document.Somebody else in Ms Begum’s place might have grown used to the thrill by now; after all this happy development took place last month. But this is an extremely special occasion for her. “Nobody else in my family has achieved this feat.” The day the result came out, she cooked her son’s favourite meal—chicken korma and egg bhujji. In her 40s, Ms Begum runs a small street-side kiosk selling mouthfreshners in central Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin Basti. Sobering down a bit, she admiringly talks of her son. “His father died when he was just four months.” Ms Begum’s husband worked as a driver who succumbed to an accident. Having arrived two decades ago from her village in Assam, she singlehandedly raised her three children. “One of my daughters lives with her husband in Guwahati, the other lives with me… she is blind from both eyes.”The son has already started attending the 11th standard; his government-run school in nearby Jangpura has finally opened its doors following the easing of Covid restrictions. “The education is free but I have to pay for his course books and uniforms,” she observes. Now tapping her fingers with her thumb, as if making calculations, she talks of having spent 2,000 rupees in buying books “but I have to get 3,000 rupees worth of more books for Azimuddin.”That is an anxiety, but she believes she will manage it with the earnings from her kiosk. “My dream is that my son completes his 12th standard.”Ms Begum is aware of her son’s dream, too. “He wants to be in the police.” Even so, the lady won’t be completely at peace even if he realises his ambition. “My daughter’s daughter lives with me. She is in fifth standard and wants to be a school ma’am… I’ll be completely happy only if she attains her dream too,” she says, again flashing her infectious grin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-why-so-happy-maam-101631480741243.html
13-09-2021||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal re-elected AAP chief||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was on Sunday re-elected the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) national convenor, the top post in the party. Pankaj Gupta was re-elected party secretary and Rajya Sabha member ND Gupta, treasurer, said a senior party functionary.The party held its national council’s annual meeting on Saturday, when a 34-member executive council was elected. On Sunday, it held the first meeting of the newly-elected executive council. Both meetings were held over video conference.The decision comes at a time when the party is looking to expand beyond the Capital and preparing for assembly elections in six states — Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Goa and Gujarat – in the next two years. Delhi also goes to the municipal polls next year with the three civic bodies in the city currently ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Earlier this year, the AAP won 27 seats in the municipal polls in Gujarat’s Surat. It continues to be the ruling party in Delhi and is also the principal opposition party in Punjab.In January this year, the party held its previous national council meeting, which was delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. In that meeting, it passed resolutions extending tenures for the posts of national convenor and secretary from three years to five years, and removed a provision that prohibited re-election of the same person in these posts for more than two consecutive terms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/arvind-kejriwal-re-elected-aap-chief-101631480613354.html
13-09-2021||Chandigarh||Public bike sharing in Chandigarh registers 2,700 rides per day||A month since the first phase of the public bicycle sharing (PBS) project started in the city, 76,786 rides have been recorded, an average of 2,742 per day. There are 1,250 cycles and 155 docking stations in use currently and each bicycle was used 2.19 times a day on average.Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) officials say this is an encouraging start, with numbers likely to rise in the coming days, as the second phase will be launched.As per data obtained from CSCL officials, the average distance for each ride was 7 kilometres and average time was 1.6 hours. Overall, it has reduced carbon dioxide from vehicular emissions by 1,34,375.5 grams till now. In just under a month, the total numbers recorded are higher compared to when the Cycles4Change challenge programme was rolled out on December 10, 2020, with 250 cycles. Between December 10 and May 31, 61,296 total rides were booked and 53,450 people registered to use the service under the challenge. The bikes were ridden for 52,067 hours and 4,90,368 kilometres were covered. Calling the results encouraging, chief general manager of CSCL, NP Sharma, said, “With more bikes added under phase 1, we were expecting the numbers to go up, although we didn’t have any target. The second phase will be completed by October end and 1,250 more cycles and around 155 more docking stations will be added. By the end of the four phase project in 2022, we plan to add 5,000 cycles and make 617 docking stations, making it India’s densest PBS system.”The project is being implemented and operated by the concessionaire Smart Bike Tech Private Limited, Hyderabad, for a period of 10 years on public private partnership (PPP) basis with no cost to the administration.Vandalism plays spoilsportHowever, It hasn’t been all smooth sailing, with 193 cases of vandalism reported over the last month. As per officials, mostly the front basket of the bike, its seat and pedal were damaged. Some residents had even taken six cycles home in Burail about a week back. Sharma said, “These cycles are a part of the city’s infrastructure. Damaging them is hurting the city and is unfair to those who genuinely need them. We urge people to responsibly use this facility.”There were also glitches in the software in the beginning while booking rides and ending them. Usage charges were stopped till September 12 due to this and Sharma said that now these issues have mostly been resolved.Speaking about how to make the project more successful, Umesh Sharma from the civil engineering department of Punjab Engineering College, said, “Around 2,700 rides per day is a good number. Next, the authorities must focus on improving cycle tracks. At many places, the tracks have obstacles and aren’t properly lit, due to which cyclists have to drive on the main roads. This can lead to accidents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/public-bike-sharing-in-chandigarh-registers-2-700-rides-per-day-101631481864021.html

13-09-2021||Chandigarh||Deadly potholes return on Ludhiana roads after showers||Amid tall claims of development by the municipal corporation (MC) and Congress leadership, deep potholes on city roads continue to make driving a nightmare for commuters. Incessant rain over the past few days has further exposed the authorities’ apathy towards civic infrastructure, with several broken roads deteriorating further.Rainwater failing to clear out hours after showers cease, further puts commuters’ lives in jeopardy.MC’s expenditure of ₹212 crore on repair of roads in the five years between April 2015 to March 2020, as revealed through an RTI application, has failed to change much on ground, with roads getting run-down in no time.While its hot mix plant on Hambran Road has not been made functional due to the monsoon season, authorities have also failed to commence repair work using readymade hot mix material, despite directions to this effect by MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal in the past.Consequently, deep potholes dot roads in almost every part of the city, including Jagraon Bridge, Gill Road, Model Town-Jawaddi Road, Ferozepur Road, Focal Point and Railway Station road, all busy stretches. Internal streets in residential areas, including Model Town Extension, Field Ganj, Model Town, SBS Nagar, BRS Nagar, also remain in poor shape.While slamming the authorities for their failure in repairing the roads in time, residents have also raised questions over the quality of road repair works taken up by the corporation.A resident of Shastri Nagar, Balpreet Singh said, “Not even a single road in the city is in a good shape at present. Potholes can be witnessed on every road. Despite paying taxes, residents continue to suffer the consequences of broken roads, while MC continues to turn a blind eye.”Field Ganj resident Taranjit Singh, who owns a shop on Gill Road, said, “Waterlogging on potholed roads adds to commuters’ woes, as chances of accidents multiply. If MC cannot operationalise the hot mix plant in the rainy season, it should find an alternative. At some points, including the traffic signal near Arora Palace, there is always a fear that heavy vehicles may overturn due to deep potholes, a major risk to passing commuters.”On MC’s part, superintending engineer Tirath Bansal said the repair works were delayed as the readymade hot mix material was still being procured. “The material is now available and MC will begin repairs on Monday. However, it is not feasible to fix wide potholes with this material, so the focus currently will be on smaller repairs. Larger potholes will be addressed once the hot mix plant becomes operational after the rainy season. The plant cannot be used amid the rains, as quality of material is affected at large,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/deadly-potholes-return-on-ludhiana-roads-after-showers-101631476285488.html

13-09-2021||Chandigarh||Court must enquire into antecedents of accused while considering bail, says Supreme Court||Courts should enquire into the antecedents of an accused to find out if he has a bad record and is likely to commit serious offences while out on bail, the Supreme Court has observed. A bench comprising justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and M R Shah made the remarks while setting aside the bail granted by the Punjab and Haryana high court to a man facing a murder and criminal conspiracy case. The nature of the charge and the evidence are also vital factors while deciding on bail pleas, the bench said, adding the severity of the punishment in case of conviction also bears upon the issue. Referring to its earlier decisions, the bench said the deprivation of freedom by refusal of bail is not for punitive purposes but for the bifocal interests of justice. “Another relevant factor is whether the course of justice would be thwarted by him who seeks the benignant jurisdiction of the court to be freed for the time being. The court has also to consider the likelihood of the applicant interfering with the witnesses for the prosecution or otherwise polluting the process of justice. “It is further observed that it is rational to enquire into the antecedents of the man who is applying for bail to find out whether he has a bad record, particularly a record which suggests that he is likely to commit serious offences while on bail,” the bench said. The top court said that while granting of bail, the factors among other circumstances which are required to be considered are -- the nature of accusation, the severity of punishment in case of conviction and the nature of supporting evidence, reasonable apprehension of tampering with the witness or the apprehension of threat to the complainant, and prima facie satisfaction of the court in support of the charge. The SC’s observations came while it was hearing an appeal against a Punjab & Haryana high court granting bail to an accused in connection with an FIR at police station Sadar, Jalandhar, under Sections 302 (murder), 120-B (criminal conspiracy.), 34 (common intention), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of Indian Penal Code and section 25 of the Arms Act, 1959. The bench said the high court has failed to appreciate and consider the nature of the accusation and the severity of the punishment in case of conviction and the nature of supporting evidence. “The high court has also failed to appreciate the facts of the case; the nature of allegations; gravity of offence and the role attributed to the accused. As per the allegations, the accused Inderpreet Singh, respondent no.1 herein is the main conspirator who hatched the conspiracy along with other co-accused and that too from the jail. “The HC has also failed to notice the serious allegation of hatching conspiracy from the jail. The HC ought to have considered that if respondent no.1 – accused Inderpreet Singh -- can hatch the conspiracy from jail, what he will not do if he is released on bail,” the bench said. The apex court said that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the HC has committed a grave error in releasing Singh on bail and therefore the impugned judgment and order passed by the HC is unsustainable and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/court-must-enquire-into-antecedents-of-accused-while-considering-bail-says-supreme-court-101631476044160.html

13-09-2021||Lucknow||World Sepsis Day: Ignorance breeds life threatening multi-organ infection, say top doctors||Cases of sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by the dysregulated response of the body to infection, are increasing due to ignorance and lack of awareness among masses, said Dr Ved Prakash, head of department of pulmonary and critical care medicine, at the King George’s Medical University on Sunday.“Sepsis is third most common cause of death after heart disease and cancer and has a a very high mortality rate if not treated early,” Dr Prakash said while addressing a press conference on ‘World Sepsis Day’. “Most common site of infection leading to sepsis is the lungs, which contributes to around 35% of cases of sepsis. It is followed by urinary tract infection which contributes to around 25% of these cases. Other sources of infection can be gut infections and skin infections,” said Prof Apul Goel, senior faculty department of Urology, KGMU.“Cases of diabetic foot and crush injury often have to be treated for long period due to sepsis,” said Dr Vaibhav Khanna, director Healthcity hospital and a microvascular surgeon.“If infection is confined to one organ such as lungs, kidney or brain it is a local infection to an organ but if it spreads to other organs via blood (multi-organ involvement) is called sepsis,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general association of international doctors. Sepsis is very common in old age as elderly fail to understand the medical condition and often think their health issue to be age related. By the time they actually realise the seriousness, the infection spreads to multiple organs causing septicaemia or sepsis, said Dr Shukla, who also conducted an awareness session on the subject on Sunday.“Maintaining good hygiene level, correct use of medicine particularly antibiotics, preparing food hygienically, avoiding close contact with sick people, practising safer sex, and keeping vaccinations up to date are best ways to avoid sepsis,” he said. Risk factors for developing sepsis include old age, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and inappropriate use of antibiotics, said Dr BNBM Prasad, professor in the department of pulmonary and critical care medicine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/world-sepsis-day-ignorance-breeds-life-threatening-multi-organ-infection-say-top-doctors-101631475803494.html

As per information, the club had decided to float tenders to hire a caterer. For this, the DC constituted a committee under the chairmanship of PCS officer Neeru Katyal Gupta, with the general secretary, joint secretary, mess secretary and finance secretary as the members. After the tenders were opened on September 6, two bids were received – one from a local caterer and another from a Muktsar-based firm, for ₹1.4 lakh and ₹1.51 lakh per month, respectively.However, as stated in the show-cause notice, the six executive members recommended the local caterer for the contract, while bypassing the committee’s chairperson, despite a better offer by the other bidder. “It is against the financial interests of the club and the members should submit a reply within 48 hours on why action cannot be taken against them for the misconduct,” states the notice. On his part, Mahajan said no contract had been awarded yet, and only a recommendation had been made to the DC, who held the authority to take the final decision. “The Ludhiana-based caterer has worked with the club in the past and was found more appropriate, while the services of the Muktsar caterer were not found up to the mark by the members while evaluating the bids. The chairperson of the committee was also apprised of this before the recommendation was sent to the club president,” said Mahajan, while adding that they will submit a reply on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-6-lodhi-club-executive-members-put-on-notice-for-misconduct-101631474423430.html

13-09-2021||Lucknow||Aam Aadmi Party to take out “Tiranga Yatra” in Ayodhya on September 14||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will take out a “Tiranga Yatra” in Ayodhya on Tuesday (September 14). Manish Sisodia, deputy chief minister, Delhi, and Sanjay Singh, a Rajya Sabha MP and AAP’s Uttar Pradesh incharge, will land in Ayodhya on Monday for the event.Apart from doing public relations exercise for the party by meeting seers, the duo will also pay obeisance to Ram Lalla at Ram Janmabhoomi and Lord Hanuman at Hanuman Garhi temple. Giving this information, Sabhajeet Singh, state president of AAP, said the yatra will start from Gulab Bari and will end at Gandhi Park. However, AAP leaders’ meeting with seers is most likely to be confined with those men in saffron who are aligned with the non-BJP camp. Mahant Janmejay Saran leads the anti-VHP camp of seers in Ayodhya. “The AAP will present itself as an alternative to the BJP and the Samajwadi Party, the two main contenders in Uttar Pradesh’s political battle,” said Vaibhav Maheshwari, state spokesperson, AAP. “The Delhi model of governance of the Arvind Kejriwal government is before everyone to see,” he added. With assembly polls due in Uttar Pradesh early next year and construction of Ram Mandir going on there, Ayodhya has become the most favoured destination for political parties to launch their campaign. AAP is not the first party to include Ayodhya in its campaign trail for assembly polls. The Bahujan Samaj Party began its Brahmin Sammelan from Ayodhya on July 23. All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi and Jansatta Loktantrik Dal led by Kunda MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya also hit the campaign trail of their parties from Ayodhya.To recall, the AAP was the first political party to raise a question mark on land deals entered into by the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust. Starting with the AAP, the Samajwadi Party and the Congress had also alleged irregularities in these land purchase deals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/aam-aadmi-party-to-take-out-tiranga-yatra-in-ayodhya-on-september-14-101631474183440.html

Punjab minister for social justice, empowerment and minorities Sadhu Singh Dharamsot disclosed on Sunday that the government had decided to waive ₹50,000 each, from all kinds of loans that these persons had taken for self-employment through the Scheduled Castes Development and Finance Corporation.The minister added that the corporation provides these loans to SCs and Persons with Disabilities at low interest rates to fund their self-employment. The recovery rate of loans provided by the Corporation to the youth of the state at a lower interest rate is about 77%. He said that the youth was finding it difficult to repay these loans under the dire circumstances that had risen due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.“Previously too, the Punjab government has waived loans of 14,260 SC youth, amounting to ₹45.4 crore. Over the past four years, this government has given loan to the tune of around ₹82 crore to 8,662 persons from SCs,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-waives-rs-41cr-loan-of-10-000-scs-101631474003375.html

13-09-2021||Other||Prayagraj: Fake body creates website, tries to cheat job seekers via bogus ad||A case of fraud has come to light in the name of recruitment of 24,178 teachers and employees in government run schools of Uttar Pradesh. The unidentified fraudsters issued a fake advertisement in a leading Hindi daily on Saturday and created a bogus website resembling the official website of Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Service Selection Board (UPSESSB).They issued the want in the name of a non-existent organisation— Uttar Pradesh School Staff Selection Board— whose office, the website claims, is located in Allenganj in Prayagraj. “An advertisement has been issued for recruitment of teachers and college staff through a website www.upsssb.org closely resembling the official website of Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Service Selection Board www.upsessb.org. We wish to make clear that Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Service Selection Board has nothing to do with this advertisement. We have already initiated the process for lodging of an FIR in this regard,” said UPSESSB deputy secretary Naval Kishore in a communiqué.On the complaint of UPSESSB deputy secretary Naval Kishore, Colonelganj police registered an FIR against unidentified people in this connection under relevant sections of fraud and cybercrime late on Saturday night.“We have launched an investigation into the case with the help of cyber police cell and have begun efforts to identify those responsible for making the fake website and issuing a fake recruitment advertisement,” said inspector Suresh Singh, station house officer, Colonelganj police station.Additional director (secondary education) Mahendra Sev and secretary, Basic Shiksha Parishad, Pratap Singh Baghel through public notice have also made clear that no department, office or body by the name of “Uttar Pradesh School Staff Selection Board” is functional in the state and the advertisement issued by this fake board is “fully false and fake”.Claiming to be a UP government body, the website https://www.upsssb.org/ informs that Uttar Pradesh School Staff Selection Board has been formed vide UP Act No. 5 of 1982 passed by the Uttar Pradesh Legislature to establish School Staff (Selection Board) Act 1982, for the selection of teachers and management staff in colleges and institutions recognised under Intermediate Education Act, 1921.Under “Objective and Reasons”, the website informs that the aim of the body is to appoint “teachers and management staff in colleges and institutions recognised by UGC (Under Grant Commission), AICTE (All India Council of Technical Education) and MOE (Ministry of Education) governed by the State Government Education Act B, 1921 and regulations made there under.”It further informs that it was considered necessary to “constitute School Staff Selection Board at the state level to select Principals, Lecturers, Teachers, Accountant, Clerk, Management staff, Group D Staff, LT Grade teachers, and School Staff Selection Board at the regional level, to select and make available suitable candidates for posts in Degree Colleges (include all Art and Science colleges, Engineering Colleges, Hotel Management Colleges, Management Colleges, Women’s Colleges, Distance Education Colleges, Medical Colleges, BEd Colleges, and Teacher’s Training Institutes) and Institutions of the State”.Under the recruitment advertisement, the website that sports the photographs of UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and UP basic education minister Satish Chandra Dwivedi lists 17,486 posts of teachers, 3,800 posts of staff and 2,892 posts of class 4 employees seeking applications between September 11 and October 10 citing postgraduation, graduation and intermediate as the requisite qualifications for the three categories of posts respectively.

13-09-2021||Delhi||At Signature Bridge, lifts that didn’t lift off||Radha Mohan doesn’t mind the long hours of his job. A security guard at northwest Delhi’s Signature Bridge, the 50-year-old finds it more difficult to answer questions on when the elevators will start ferrying people to the viewing gallery atop the pylon of the bridge.“Every day, at least 100 people ask me about the observation deck; many of them believe that there is a restaurant up there. For the past one year, I have been telling them that it will open in three months. The truth is I do not when and if at all that lift will open for public,” he says, pointing towards the closed doors of the elevators, up a short flight of stairs from the road.Opened in 2018, the Capital’s Signature Bridge, India’s first asymmetrical cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge spanning the Yamuna river at the Wazirabad section has a viewing deck at a height of about 154 metres. For comparison, the iconic Qutub Minar is about 73 metres high.Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC), a Delhi government agency that executed the project, plans to transform the bridge into a tourist destination at a cost of ₹200 crore. Facilities such as parking, an open-air plaza, a circular air-conditioned eatery, a children’s play zone, and a park with an open gym on the western end of the bridge (towards the Outer Ring Road) have already come up, and are likely to be inaugurated soon.But a ticketed ride for tourists to this glass viewing gallery, which was touted as an important part of the Signature Bridge experience, has failed to lift off.The reason: elevators that aren’t exactly perpendicular to the ground. Or more accurately, lifts that are tilted.Officials in the electrical inspectorate of the Delhi government’s labour department, responsible for inspecting and granting licences to operate lifts across the city, are not amused at the inclined lifts inside the pylon of the bridge.The Signature Bridge has four lifts, with a capacity of 500kg each, installed at a cost of ₹12 crore on both sides of the pylon. Because the pylon is oblique in shape, two of the lifts in the lower arms of the pylon are inclined at a 60-degree angle; and the other two on the upper ends are at an angle of 81 degrees.A kink in the planSo far, officials in the labour department have inspected and cleared around 50,000 lifts across the city, but they’ve never encountered such a case before.“These lifts defy the very definition of a lift in the law that is followed in Delhi,” says a labour department official, who wished to remain anonymous.The official cited above isn’t referring to a flaw in the design. Inclined lifts are common in modern architecture across the world.Instead, he is referring to the colonial-era law, Bombay Lift Act, 1939, adopted by Delhi in 1942. “It will take nothing sort of an amendment in the law to allow us to give permission to these inclined lifts,” the official adds.Indeed, the Act defines lifts as a “hoisting mechanism” “designed to carry passengers” in a “cage” that “moves in a substantially vertical direction”.The company, which has installed the lifts at the Signature Bridge, says it has installed such lifts across countries, but this is the first in India. “The inclined lifts are very popular abroad... We are now installing another one in Shimla in a housing society on a hill,” says Sandeep Gupta, director of Maspero India. The firm has a joint venture with Maspero Elevatori, an Italian company that makes elevators.The parent company’s website has an entire section on inclined lifts. It cheekily says: “There is no slope our inclined elevators cannot climb...”But Maspero India did not anticipate that a colonial-era law will be a hurdle in operating the lifts for tourists. Currently the lifts are only allowed to be used by engineers for servicing bridge cables and other systems. “We never thought that the inclined lifts would face this kind of an angle-related hurdle. But it is not for us to obtain a licence to use the lift for tourists. We have fulfilled all our contractual obligations, and now we are looking after its maintenance,” says Gupta.Suspended, in betweenNow, DTTDC is hoping for an early resolution. Pawan Kumar, chief project manager at DTTDC, says the agency has sought permission a few times in the last year to use the lifts for tourism.“The labour department says there is no provision under which they can grant the licence to inclined lifts, but they have assured us that they will try to find a solution,” he says.To this, a senior officer in the labour department says there are also other issues that have to be addressed first. “We have pointed out a few other safety-related issues. There are no stairs to evacuate the passengers in case of an emergency. The monkey ladder they have installed simply cannot be used by common people. Let them sort out these issues, and then we will decide what to do next,” the official who wished to remain anonymous says.When asked if the labour department will recommend amending the law, he adds, “I cannot say anything at the moment.”Does it matter?The lifts may or may not open for the public, but the Signature Bridge is already a tourist destination. On a muggy monsoon afternoon, there are youngsters, families and couples thronging the site. One of the visitors is 26-year-old Vineet Chopra, a resident of Rohini, who has come to the bridge with two of his friends to celebrate his birthday. “ We are waiting for some more friends to come; it is my birthday and we will cut the cake here once they come,” he says.“This happens here all the time... I have had a hard time dealing with them. When the lift doors are open, many people want to enter and have a look inside. I keep shouting at them to stay away from the lift,” says another security guard at the bridge.Midway through this conversation, a car stops and its passengers ask Radha Mohan, standing nearby, the question he hates answering.“Is the lift open for people?”“It will open in five months,” says Mohan, who may have just extended his fictional timeline by two months for some reprieve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-signature-bridge-lifts-that-didn-t-lift-off-101631471556766.html
13-09-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP lawmaker meets SP chief Akhilesh Yadav||A first-time BJP lawmaker from Uttar Pradesh, Rakesh Rathore, met Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday, about three months after he had said that he would not dare speak against his party government for fear of being booked under the sedition charge. Rathore is an OBC (Other Backward Classes) leader from Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh.Both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and SP haven’t made any official comment on the meeting, but sources in the Samajwadi Party said at least eight BJP lawmakers were in touch.In May, the BJP MLA was apparently heard expressing “helplessness” when asked by journalists to comment on why a trauma centre set up in 2016 in Khairabad’s Jamayatpur area was still not functional. It falls in the Sitapur assembly constituency, from where Rathore was elected in 2017.Back in May, Rathore, 55, appeared to say in Hindi: “Hum zyada bolenge toh deshdroh, rajdroh hum pe bhi to lagega (If I say more, I will be booked for sedition too).” He also suggested that MLAs have little standing before the government when he questioned: “…vidhayakon ki haisiyat kya hai? (What is the status of legislators)?”To another query, he said sarcastically, “Bhaiya hum to wahi kahenge jo sarkar keh rahi, wahi sahi maano ... (All I will say is believe all that the government says).”A few days back, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had said that several BJP lawmakers, who feared losing tickets, would head for his party. Rathore was not available for comment on his meeting which was, however, confirmed by the SP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-bjp-lawmaker-meets-sp-chief-akhilesh-yadav-101631473583331.html

The idea is to educate students about soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country and the struggle of our sportspersons.”Ex-serviceman and war veteran Captain Manmohan Singh Bhullar appreciated the initiatives of the state education department.Local hockey Olympic legend Hardeep Singh Grewal also hailed the decision. “It will be a great gesture by the government if the names of the Olympians and the martyrs will be written on the school gates. People tend to forget the old legends but this will help the students to know about and remember them”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/schools-to-be-named-after-olympians-martyrs-ludhiana-deo-seeks-list-from-school-heads-101631473523289.html

Though he lost the election, his group won 11 seats out of the total 50.According to sources, Kulwant Singh is hoping to join the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and even had a couple of meetings with its state chief, Bhagwant Mann.

We had no option but to teach students at the gurdwara located nearby with the help of the local panchayat,” said Charanjit Kaur, a teacher at the school.Disturbed by the sorry state of the children studying there, sarpanch Kuldeep Singh had requested the NRIs to fund the new building.“We had a large panchayat land, which we donated for the construction of the new school building. We approached the NRIs in our village for funds and they agreed to help,” said Singh.Sarbjeet Singh, 59, one of the NRIs who runs a transport business in New Jersey, USA, said, “My son was just five-years-old when we shifted abroad 26 years back, and now, he is a doctor. Whenever I visit my native village, I feel bad to see that there has been no development. Moreover, it is disheartening to see my son’s friends struggling to fulfil the basic needs of their families. Therefore, when Kuldeep sought help, I immediately agreed as it was the only way I could do something for my people.” Devinder Singh, 64, a transporter from the USA, has decided to finance all the bricks that are being used for the construction. “I wish that the school is upgraded to a high school and declared a smart school as all the modern facilities are now available here,” he said.NRIs to be felicitatedMeanwhile, Davinder Singh Chhina, principal of the school, claimed that the education department will soon felicitate these NRIs for their noble work. “We also got financial help from the local villagers. Even the education department allocated funds for the same. A grant of ₹2.5 lakh was also received from the MP fund. DEO Lakhvir Singh Samra has already asked us to arrange a felicitation function to honour them all,” said Chhina.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-barmalipur-government-school-gets-new-building-with-aid-from-25-nris-101631472923323.html

13-09-2021||Mumbai||Rape survivor can terminate 29-week pregnancy: Bombay high court||The Bombay high court (HC) recently permitted a minor rape survivor to terminate a 29-week pregnancy even though there were no anomalies in the foetus. The decision came after the medical experts’ panel appointed by HC observed in its post-examination report that the minor was “anguished” by the pregnancy and the continuation of the same could impact her mental health.The division bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice Madhav Jamdar, while hearing the petition filed by the minor’s mother, was informed by advocate Ashley Cusher that the petitioner’s daughter has become pregnant after she was raped earlier this year. A first information report (FIR) in the case was registered at Tulinj police station, Nallasopara, in Palghar district. Cusher submitted that the minor was not willing to continue with the pregnancy as it would not only stigmatise her but would also have an impact on her mental health in the future. Hence, the termination of pregnancy be allowed. In an earlier hearing on September 7, HC had directed the dean of Sir JJ Hospital to constitute a medical board of experts and examine the minor and submit its recommendations. The report was submitted on September 9.The report observed that though no abnormalities were detected in the foetus, the minor was anguished by the pregnancy and continuation of the pregnancy could lead to pregnancy-related complications, including impacting the mental health of the survivor. In light of this observation, the board recommended medical termination of the pregnancy.After the bench perused the report on September 10, it permitted the petitioner’s daughter to undergo the termination of pregnancy at JJ hospital. HC also directed the authorities to preserve the blood and DNA samples of the foetus after terminating pregnancy and hand over the samples to the investigating agency to enable them to use it to bolster its case against the accused. The court then sought a report on the outcome of the termination and posted hearing of the petition to September 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rape-survivor-can-terminate-29-week-pregnancy-bombay-high-court-101631472743757.html
13-09-2021||Chandigarh||Leasehold properties the bane of Chandigarh administration||Hundreds of leasehold properties that can fetch the Chandigarh administration revenue in crores are lying vacant for the want of buyers.Nearly 70% commercial and industrial plots in the city are leasehold, allowing occupation for a limited period, mostly 99 years. Ownership rights in the case of such properties are with government agencies, such as the estate office, municipal corporation (MC) and Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB), while the freehold status gives the buyer complete rights over the property.Out of 189 leasehold properties put on auction this year, the CHB could get buyers for only eight. Now, it has decided to reduce their reserve price by 10-50% in yet another attempt to attract buyers.However, the CHB is not the only UT agency stuck with leasehold properties. The MC has failed to monetise more than 200 leasehold properties. Facing an acute fund crunch for long, the MC could generate more than ₹250-crore revenue with their sale.Although the number of vacant leasehold properties was not readily available with the UT estate office, a senior official said: “Despite several attempts, the department has not been able to find buyers for hundreds of leasehold commercial and residential properties.” Futile auctionsThe MC has prepared a list of over 200 commercial properties under its purview that are lying vacant. Several attempts to auction these properties went in vain.For instance, it tried to sell off 105 booths at Mauli Jagran six times, but failed. As many as 51 commercial sites in Sector 17 are also lying vacant despite two auctions. A 24-acre site for a specialty hospital in Manimajra, with a reserve price of ₹81 crore, was offered twice for sale, but found no takers.The UT estate office had conducted its last auction in November 2019 when all 10 freehold properties on offer were sold while there were no takers for 15 leasehold plots. “The department had generated a revenue close to ₹44 crore from the auction of freehold properties, whose total reserve price was around ₹27 crore,” said the estate office official.The CHB, in the past four months, has conducted four e-auctions for its 121 freehold residential properties and has been able to sell 87, earning ₹70.59 crore. In the same period, it has been able to sell only two residential and nine commercial leasehold properties, earning ₹1.74 crore and ₹4.73 crore, respectively.Why the mess“In leasehold properties, the allottee is required to pay yearly ground rent at 2.5% of the consideration amount for 33 years, followed by 3.75% for the next 33 years and 5% for the subsequent 33 years. Since this is a substantial amount and ownership rights are inferior as compared to freehold, people prefer to go for the latter,” said a senior UT official. “In the new business environment, a leasehold property carries inferior title, thereby causing impediments in joint ventures and raising capital. In Chandigarh, for commercial and industrial plots, one can’t even get a leasehold property converted to freehold. For residential properties, conversion charges are too high,” said Pankaj Khanna, president, Industries Association of Chandigarh.The conversion charges for residential leasehold properties vary from 12% to 15% of the consideration amount.“The Chandigarh administration has written to the Union government, seeking approval for allowing conversion of leasehold commercial properties to freehold. We have also recently sent a reminder to them, but have got no response so far,” said UT adviser Dharam Pal.Pal said that one option could be reduction in reserve prices to attract buyers. “The CHB has recently done so; other agencies can also explore it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/leasehold-properties-the-bane-of-chandigarh-administration-101631472683384.html
13-09-2021||Mumbai||BMC plans additional bypass road to decongest Dahisar check naka||In a bid to decongest the area around Dahisar check naka — one of the five entry and exit points of the city— the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to construct an additional bypass road that will ensure smooth traffic movement in the area.In the past few days, several citizens had taken to social media slamming state authorities over the traffic woes. Following this, city guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray held a joint meeting with officials from traffic police, BMC, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) and Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC).Each day, thousands of vehicles pass through Dahisar check naka, as along with the south Mumbai-bound traffic, it also handles cargo traffic going to Gujarat and towards Delhi to north of India.According to BMC officials, it has decided to shift the pandal it has set up for the Dahisar jumbo Covid-19 centre in order to free the service road. Additionally, it is also planning to construct a bypass road parallel to the service road on the south-bound lane that will help reduce traffic at Dahisar toll naka.Mridula Andhe, assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s R-North ward, under whose jurisdiction the area lies, said, “There were a few extension cabins from the Covid-19 jumbo care centre on the service road. They will be removed, and the service road will be handed over [for vehicular traffic]. This will ensure smooth movement of traffic.”Andhe added, “When it comes to long-term planning, we are exploring to construct a bypass road parallel to the current road on the south-bound lane. There are a few structures right now over which litigations have been filed. Once the matter is resolved, we will construct additional roads there, which will further decongest traffic in the area.”MSRDC officials said that currently a substantial amount of traffic is also due to the barricades of metro construction work. An MSRDC official said, “In the meeting, it was discussed that MMRDA will remove barricading from the stretches where work is completed. This will ensure smooth traffic movement. In addition to it, we have directed the toll contractor to ensure a smooth surface of the road.”The MSRDC official added, “Despite being mandatory, several vehicle owners do not have fast-tag or do not recharge it, resulting in traffic jams. We expect citizens to make use of digital mode for payment of toll.”According to Borivli resident Viraj Mamania motorists do not follow lane discipline at the toll naka. “Additionally, the road is full of potholes, which results in traffic even during non-peak hours. Also, the design at the toll naka is such that even adding one more lane will result in traffic. The only solution to this is shifting the toll naka further towards Mira Road.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-plans-additional-bypass-road-to-decongest-dahisar-check-naka-101631472624440.html

13-09-2021||Other||Was infuriated at Rajiv’s appointment as PM: Aiyar||Amritsar Former Union minister Mani Shankar Aiyar on Sunday said that he was infuriated when Rajiv Gandhi became the Prime Minister, the same day his mother Indira Gandhi had been assassinated. “What followed was diabolical. There was a massacre of a community going on in India (especially Delhi) and I had decided to not vote for Congress in the election to follow,” he added, speaking about his relationship with Rajiv at an event that Amritsar-based NGO, Phulkari, had organised on Sunday. Former India Today editor and author Kaveree Bamzai was the moderator. Speaking passionately about his childhood, Aiyar said that contrary to popular belief, he had a modest and strict upbringing. “My father passed away when I was very young, so our mother had to raise us on her own. We were almost on the street after my father’s passing. At times, I didn’t have anything else to wear except my school uniform,” he added. When asked about the role of women in the former diplomat’s life by Bamzai, Aiyar spoke about his mother and how, despite the hardships she managed to put her everything into her children’s education. He said, “I had a very privileged childhood without being rich: if we didn’t have new clothes that was never a big deal, but my mother made sure I studied at one of the best schools in India.”Phulkari president Deepa Swani said she was proud of the work her team had done online and very happy to hold their first event, post the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/was-infuriated-at-rajiv-s-appointment-as-pm-aiyar-101631472443808.html
13-09-2021||Delhi||40% patients hospitalised for Covid had low oxygen levels: AIIMS Jhajjar study||Nearly 40% of Covid-19 patients who were hospitalised had oxygen saturations below 94% at the time of admission, according to a pre-print study of 2,080 patients at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)-Jhajjar. Of those with hypoxia at admission, 21.45% didn’t have breathlessness, while 5.2% didn’t show any symptoms at all, the study said. The researchers said that hypoxia — a condition where the tissues and organs do not get enough oxygen — was one of the most important predictors of death in Covid-19 patients. The outcome was significantly worse in those with silent or happy hypoxia — patients who do not show symptoms like breathlessness and fatigue despite having low oxygen saturation. The case fatality ratio (CFR) — the proportion of deaths — was as high as 45.4% among those with silent hypoxia and 40.03% among those who had shortness of breath along with hypoxia as per pulse oximeter. “What the study shows is that hypoxia is not necessarily clinically evident in Covid-19 patients. Those with silent hypoxia continue working normally and by the time they reach hospital, it’s too late,” said Dr Sushma Bhatnagar, corresponding author of the paper and head of the department of onco-anaesthesia and palliative care at AIIMS. She said, “You know people say that our patient walked into the hospital absolutely fine but they did not return; this is the reason. By the time they reach us, the oxygen saturation is already 70 or 80%.” The normal oxygen saturation is between 95 and 100%, anything less than 94% is a cause for concern. The study, which is being published in journal Chest, also shows that silent hypoxia is more common in women. Of those who reported silent hypoxia, 41% were men and 59% women, which is a statistically significant difference. “We do not yet know why silent hypoxia was higher in women but it could be because women tend to ignore their health issues and hardly report a problem unless it gets too much,” said Dr Bhatnagar. The study also shows that majority of those with silent hypoxia started experiencing it in the first week after getting infected when the virus multiplies. But hypoxia with symptoms such as shortness of breath was mostly reported during the second week of infection when the body’s overactive immune system starts damaging the organs. The study also said that 65% of those with silent hypoxia came to the hospital in the first week of the infection, and 45.2% of those who had hypoxia with symptoms reached the hospital in the second week of infection. “Almost half of the patients with dyspnea (shortness of breath) as a symptom along with hypoxia were brought to the hospital on oxygen. However, only 35% (60) of patients without dyspnea had their hypoxia diagnosed before reaching the hospital,” the study states. With silent hypoxia significantly increasing the risk of death in Covid-19 patients, the researchers suggest that patients keep monitoring their oxygen saturation even when they are in home isolation. “Whenever people start experiencing Covid-19-like symptoms, people should start monitoring their oxygen saturation,” said Dr Bhatnagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/40-patients-hospitalised-for-covid-19-had-low-oxygen-levels-shows-study-by-aiims-jhajjar-101631472383365.html

Rae Bareli is the Lok Sabha seat of her mother and Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Her brother Rahul Gandhi, who lost Amethi Lok Sabha seat to union minister Smriti Irani in 2019, is now an MP from Wayanad Lok Sabha seat of Kerala. Priyanka, who worked as in charge of both the Lok Sabha constituencies till her entry into active politics in 2019, has the two constituencies on top of her agenda, as after winning Amethi the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is now making deep inroads in Rae Bareli too. Her visit to the two constituencies, however, comes after a long gap. After a day-long interaction with party workers in Rae Bareli, she left for Amethi late in the evening. The Congress workers informed her about the activities they carried out in the past and proposed to do in future. Priyanka also visited the family that lost three children in a wall collapse in Dodarpur village in Tiloi area of Amethi and condoled the deaths. “Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met party workers after her arrival in Rae Bareli on Sunday. She came to Rae Bareli after a long gap. Her last visit was in early 2020. Our party leaders have requested her to ensure that candidates are declared early on all the five assembly seats of Rae Bareli. She has assured to do so by later this month or early October. She has asked party workers for active participation in the party’s programmes, including the forthcoming Congress Pratigya Yatra,” said a senior Congress leader. “Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met office- bearers of district and city units and the frontal organisations. She also met the party’s former MLAs and candidates in 2017 assembly elections, as two of the party’s MLAs from Rae Bareli are no more with the Congress,” said another party leader. The Congress had won two of five assembly seats of Rae Bareli in 2017 assembly elections. Congress candidate Aditi Singh had won from Rae Bareli assembly seat while Rakesh Singh won Harchandpur assembly seat of Rae Bareli. Both Aditi Singh and Rakesh Singh have turned rebels and are considered close to the BJP. The Congress failed to win any assembly seat in Amethi in the 2017 assembly elections. “Rae Bareli and Amethi have been priorities areas for the Congress as these constituencies have been the party’s bastions in the past. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra should focus more on these constituencies instead of wasting time in areas where the Congress is weak or has no organisational structure,” said professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department, political science, Lucknow University. Earlier, after winding up her Lucknow visit, Priyanka left for Rae Bareli on Sunday morning and began by visiting the Hanuman temple at ‘Churwa’ on Lucknow-Rae Bareli road. She was accorded a grand welcome at Churwa and later at various points along her route.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/priyanka-on-mission-rae-bareli-visits-amethi-too-101631472327946.html

In the private sector, the coal stock at Rajpura Thermal plant will last only 4 days and 20 hours; the Talwandi Sabo plant has coal only for 4 days and 15 hours, with the GVK Goindwal having less than two days of coal in stock. In government-run plants of Ropar and Lehra Mohabbat, coal will last only for 7 days and 15 hours, and 5 days 12 hours, respectively, Standard guidelines of the Central Electricity Authority stipulate that all power plants located at a distance of over 1,000km from a coal mine must maintain a minimum stock of 30 days of coal at all times. All Punjab plants fall in this category. The power demand in the state is less than 10,000 MW. In the private sector two units each are running at Rajpura, Talwandi Sabo and Goindwal Sahib. In the state sector, only one unit at Ropar, which was running till Friday, has been shut to conserve coal, as demand has lowered. At the national-level, 91 thermal plants, of 135 such plants in all, with a capacity of 1.11 lakh MW are facing shortage of coal. Forty-two thermal plants under the supercritical category have less than five days of coal stock. The average coal stock in northern India is only for five days. The Union power ministry has asked Coal India Limited to replenish coal stocks at thermal plants under the critical or supercritical category on priority. Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) chairman and managing director A Venu Prasad said he was monitoring the coal situation, and was in touch with coal ministry officials to get more stock. “Power demand has dipped due to rain and thus we have shut our plants. The loading of coal has started. I hope that the situation will improve over the next few days. There is no need to worry,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/coal-crisis-hits-again-no-power-plant-in-punjab-has-required-stock-101631471964385.html
13-09-2021||Delhi||Nephew arrested for murdering wife of Pakistani spy who lived in old Delhi||Over a week after Pakistani national Mumtaz Parveen, 51, was found dead inside her house in Delhi’s Chandni Mahal area, the police have arrested her nephew from Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut for murdering her, senior police officers privy to the investigation said on Sunday.The police found Parveen’s decomposed body from her house on September 4, and were investigating the case as that of a murder.It was only after her mysterious death that neighbour got to know that Parveen was a Pakistani national who was once arrested for spying, circulating counterfeit currency, and helping operatives of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence. She was also convicted in related charges in 2007, but was released from the jail a year later on health grounds.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Jasmeet Singh said the accused has been identified as Farman (22). “Keeping in the view the sensitive nature of the case, the special staff of central district was tasked to crack the case. The post-mortem examination showed three deep, sharp cuts behind her head. During further investigation, the CCTV footage was obtained from the locality, and it was noticed that on August 30, a person was moving around suspiciously in the street where she [Parveen] lived. When more CCTV footage was scanned, it was found that at about 8pm the person de-boarded an auto rikshaw and entered the street. It was seen that after half an hour he was again walking back and forth in the street. However, his face was covered,” said Singh.An officer said that the relatives and neighbours along with other suspects were interrogated thoroughly and their call records were obtained but nothing suspicious was found. Police said, on 12 September, a secret information came in from one of their informers.“Subsequently, raids were conducted in Meerut and the culprit was nabbed. Farman has confessed his involvement in the case and said that his ‘khala’ (maternal aunt) Parveen tried to frame him and his family in a double murder case registered at Bara Hindu Rao police station two months ago. They also have property dispute with Parveen. Hence, he killed her,” the officer said.HT reported on September 8 that a copy of Parveen’s 2000 interrogation report after her arrest by Delhi Police’s Special Cell said she was born in Meerut and studied up to Class 5. At 15, she married a man named Sultan from Meerut and had three children with him. But by 1989, they had separated.The report said Parveen first visited Pakistan with her mother around 1990 to meet her maternal aunt in Karachi. There she married a man named Abdul Wahab Khan, a senior leader of the Muhajir Qaumi Movement-Haqiqi. In 1993, she got Pakistani citizenship. But that marriage also lasted only six years because she was unable to have a child.In 1996, while visiting India, Parveen met Kamran Gawhar, an ISI spy deported twice from India, onboard the Samjhauta Express. The police report says Gawhar, during this trip, convinced her to stay with him.On January 24, 2000, when she was arrested with Gawhar, police had also found fake currency of the face value of ₹8,000 on her. Police records show that Gawhar had entered India in 1994 and was deported in April 1999. He re-entered India under a false name in July 1999 and was deported in late 2000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nephew-arrested-for-murdering-wife-of-pakistani-spy-who-lived-in-old-delhi-101631471963254.html

The girls were handed over to their families, district police chief Siddharth Ambedkar said on Sunday.Ambedkar said during investigation, they got information regarding one girl being taken to Mahendraganj district of Haryana to be sold for marriage and another minor girl being taken to Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan for the same purpose.Accordingly, South West Garo Hills police, with the assistance of West Garo Hills police, arrested two women from Tura and another from Tikrikilla. These women were involved in the commission of the crime.During their interrogation, all three arrested women admitted to having taken the girls from Tura to Haryana with the help of some others.Ambedkar said another woman, a native of Tura but settled in the state of Haryana, has also been arrested for playing a key role in selling the girls and marrying them.Investigation in the case is in progress and more arrests are likely.Ambedkar described human trafficking as a matter of deep concern and said, “We appeal to the general public to be alert and report any missing person case, in the case of missing children and girls, promptly to the nearest police station”.“Early and prompt reporting will enable us to act quickly for rescuing the victim and bringing the traffickers to justice.

Built in 1903 during the British regime, the station which sports a heritage look stands out in the midst of the congested old city, drawing the attention of passersby. Now the National Chamber of Industries and Commerce (NCIC) has demanded that the station be developed as a heritage structure and a museum be set up to depict the glorious past of the Indian Railways. Built to serve business interests, the Agra city station was the loop line of Gadha Pada station and both were located close to Belanganj – the commercial hub of old Agra. Business thrived through these stations and Agra city railway station was once the pride of the Taj city, although stoppage of trains went down consistently at this station. “I visited the station recently with former chairman of NCIC Sitaram Agarwal and chairman of Railway cell SN Agarwal. The railway staff told us that there was no stoppage for any passenger train although goods trains coming from Tundla junction via Yamuna Bridge station passed through the station,” informed Manish Agarwal, chairman of National Chamber of Industries and Commerce (NCIC). “We have sent a proposal to the railway authorities, Member of Parliament from Agra and others, suggesting that developing Agra city station as a heritage railway station with a museum would be an added tourism attraction in the city of Taj. The station should be kept operational but its conservation could be undertaken on a heritage pattern,” he said. “Cast iron garden Victorian benches should be placed at the railway station and waiting room. It is said that lanterns were used here for lighting in the absence of electricity and this could be revived on one of the platforms, with bulbs placed in these lanterns for better light. The station could have expressive paintings related to the history of the Railways,” he said. “Very often special trains reach Agra with exhibitions and need to be stationed on a platform for long. Agra city station, if developed as a heritage station, could serve the purpose,” he said. “The four acres of land at the railway station could be used for enhancing greenery in the area. We have come to know that repair and maintenance work is being undertaken by the Railways with ₹76 lakh being sanctioned for routine work but proposal for heritage station is yet to be accepted,” said Agarwal. Rajeev Saxena, a veteran journalist well aware of Agra and its past, said that Agra city station had everything to make a heritage railway station and would be an attraction for people. “The railway station, built in 1903 by the British, had all amenities required. The station served the city’s business requirements, as it was located in the heart of old Agra. That was the time when over bridges were not laid for reaching one platform from another and the Agra city railway station has an underpass for this purpose. This underpass could be lit up and developed,” said Saxena. “While developing it as heritage station, a toy train could be added to attract families. The old system that worked for the railway could be illustrated in a museum,” said the veteran journalist. Vice president of Tourism Guild of Agra Rajiv Saxena agreed that the idea to develop Agra city station as a heritage structure would be brilliant. “It could serve as a window to this historical city which was once the capital of the Mughal empire,” he said. Public relations officer, North Central Railways, SK Srivastava admitted that there was no stoppage of passenger trains although they passed through Agra city station. “A letter with suggestion to de4velop Agra city station as heritage was received and has been forwarded to the department concerned of the Railways,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/demand-to-convert-british-era-agra-city-station-into-heritage-structure-101631471544028.html

13-09-2021||Delhi||Heritage Chandni Chowk opens in new avatar||Inaugurating the revamped section of the Chandni Chowk market on Sunday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said his government plans to develop the area as a hub for night tourism.As part of the first phase of the redevelopment project, the 1.4-kilometre stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid has been converted into a pedestrian-only zone between 9am and 9pm, besides providing several facilities for shoppers that throng to this heritage market such as benches, public toilets, street lights and specially designed cycle rickshaws for moving around the area.“We have noticed that pedestrians come here at night for a stroll. We plan on further extending the services of street food stalls to develop the area into a night tourism spot. People will be able to enjoy themselves here even after the markets shut till around 12am,” said Kejriwal.Appreciating the makeover, the chief minister said the area has undergone a massive overhaul that stood out in sharp contrast to its previous congestes avatar. The new-look Chandni Chowk was attracting tourists from across the city, he said.“Earlier, Chandni Chowk’s image was that of broken roads, traffic jams and electric wires hanging all around. Overall, Chandni Chowk had the image of a dirty, congested market. In the last three years, the Delhi government has carried out the redevelopment and beautification project in Chandni Chowk, and inaugurated it today. Not just the Chandni Chowk residents but people from all around Delhi are coming to see how Chandni Chowk has transformed beautifully,” said Kejriwal.Conceived by the Congress government in 2006, the ₹99-crore project was launched after a prolonged delay in December 2018 following the directions by the Delhi high court, which was also monitoring the project. The Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC) is the nodal agency for the redevelopment project.In December 2018, Delhi’s deputy CM Manish Sisodia laid the foundation stone for the redevelopment project and the transfer of facilities was completed. The Public Works Department (PWD) started work on the main project in March 2019. While the initial deadline was November 2020, it was later revised to March 2021 due to delay on account of the Covid-19 pandemic and legal hurdles in removing encroachments, including some religious structures. The inauguration of the project was scheduled for April 17 this year, but the second wave of Covi-19 halted the plans.In the first phase of the project, utilities such as electric cables and other networks were laid underground and dedicated lanes for non-motorised transport and walkways were constructed. Facilities such as toilets, ATMs, benches for visitors, bollards for seating and other utilities have been provided in the redeveloped space. Over a hundred refurbished cycle rickshaws have been pressed into service on the stretch.In the second phase, the façade restoration will be taken up by SRDC and PWD to provide a uniform facade to the market along the redeveloped stretch.Urban development minister Satyendar Jain, who was also present at the inauguration ceremony, said while major problems pertaining to roads and overhanging wires have been addressed, the area will witness façade improvement in the next stage. “We will further facelift the entire area and give it a splendid look. We will soon operate electrical vehicles that match with the look of the area for the convenience of the people,” said Jain.Sanjay Bhargava, president, Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said the groundwork on the project was initiated nearly 20 years ago. “Even before the idea of redeveloping Chandni Chowk was formally floated, we were meeting stakeholders to put forth our ideas for the market square. It has taken a lot of time and money since then, and we hope that the makeover will be a boon for business,” said Bhargava.He said a lot of money has been pumped into the project and sought a greater commitment from stakeholders for further development. “A lot of willpower and political commitment is needed if one wants to develop the area as a hub for night-time tourism,” said Bhargava.Anil Pershad, 77, one of the owners of Chandni Chowk’s iconic Chunnamal Haveli, said while the area’s beautification was welcome, the concerns of residents have not been taken into account. .“The market looks nice but it should be developed in a manner such that old residents and people who moved out are encouraged to return. At the same time, the inconvenience of residents should also be addressed. There is no arrangement for parking due to which residents face trouble while going in and out,” said Pershad.At the inauguration, some local residents and BJP members staged a protest against the implementation of restrictions on the loading and unloading of goods in the market. Ajay Bhardwaj, general secretary, Chandni Chowk district, said the ban on entry of motorised vehicles led to inconvenience for residents and traders in Dariba Kalan and other areas. “Dariba has been cordoned off with barricades on both ends due to which residents are facing a lot of trouble,” said Bhardwaj.Garima Gupta, managing director, SRDC, who has been involved with the project since June 2017, said the project demonstrated that pedestrianisation was the way forward.“The project is the epitome of the concept of creating sustainable urban spaces along with heritage conservation,” said Gupta. She said that while there were challenges, the team successfully faced them. “There is a great sense of satisfaction. The entire period of execution of the project saw massive involvement with different stakeholders. We worked with residents, commuters and business owners and took everyone along. We coordinated with different government agencies. There were obstacles too, such as the NGT ban, then the pandemic due to which workers left for their home towns. All such issues came up but we were able to successfully complete the work,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-heritage-chandni-chowk-market-gets-new-lease-of-life-kejriwal-inaugurates-revamped-stretch-101631471246151.html

13-09-2021||Delhi||ASHA workers in Delhi press demand for fixed remuneration||Screening residents across the city for Covid-19, monitoring patients in home isolation, encouraging people to get vaccinated and carrying out government-ordered surveys, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) have been at the forefront of the battle against the pandemic for a year-and-a-half now. But in that time, ASHA workers in the Capital have been fighting a lonely battle for better remuneration or a fixed salary, a demand that has had little yields so far.The Delhi ASHA Workers Association (DAWA) earlier this month wrote to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal demanding fixed incentive of ₹15,000 a month or to pay minimum wage. They also want the Delhi government to do-away with the point system to their core incentive. The minimum wage in Delhi currently varies between ₹15,000 and ₹20,976, depending on skill and educational qualification. Skilled labourers are paid around ₹19,000 a month.Currently, ASHA workers in Delhi get a core, guaranteed incentive of ₹3,000 per month if they are able to get six or more points, based on the number of institutional deliveries, children’s immunisations assisted by them or surveys carried out in their respective areas. The central government in April last year — days after the nationwide lockdown was put in place — announced an additional ₹1,000 to be given to ASHA workers for Covid-related work.These payments were stopped in April this year.Soni (32), An ASHA worker in west Delhi’s Nangli Vihar and the only earning member of her family, said that while HER workload has increased multi-fold since last year, her income has dropped considerably.“There is so much work load. In the past few months, we were asked to distribute iron supplements and then deworming medicines to children. We have been doing surveys for Covid-19 management. Sometimes, we are not able to meet our targets for incentives, because of which we don’t get paid much. It has become difficult to make ends meet,” she said.Shiksha Rana (46) has been an ASHA worker in east Delhi for the past 10 years. Her husband tested positive for Covid-19 in April this year, she said, for which he was in hospital for nearly a month. This has now left her in debt, and she said she blames herself.“I had to take a loan from relatives to pay the hospital bills. My entire family suffered because of me, because I was on Covid-19 duty,” said Rana.She added, “We all have been working so hard since last year. There is no medical benefit for us despite the fact that we have risked our lives. We should get a fixed salary, like all other government employees,” said Rana.DAWA has laid this demand before the Delhi government for over a year now.Usha Thakur, general secretary, DAWA said, “Our demand is that the Delhi government should give us at least ₹15,000 a month as salary or that we be paid the minimum wage given to skilled workers.”She also said the allotment of localities ensures an unequal payment system for workers.“Localities have not been distributed properly, due to which some ASHAs have areas where there are big low-income residential clusters while others don’t. As a result, some workers are able to get more incentives.”Kavita Yadav, the state coordinator for ASHA workers, All India United Traders Union Centre, said, “We have sought time from Delhi chief minister to discuss our concerns. These women have risked their lives while working during Covid. They should be given the status of government employees and paid accordingly.”The Delhi government declined to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/asha-workers-in-delhi-press-demand-for-fixed-remuneration-101631471124676.html
13-09-2021||Mumbai||IIT Bombay holds exams in hybrid mode; those on campus take tests offline||The Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) on Saturday announced that it is conducting its mid-semester exams in a hybrid mode – students currently staying on campus are being allowed to appear for exams in physical mode, whereas those off campus are appearing for exams online.“As per the state policy on the pandemic, we are still not allowed to go for physical classroom-based lectures. However, as many of our students are currently on campus, we thought of providing a real feel for the exam to these students by inviting them to write their exams in the classrooms by following all the Covid norms. This will help these students to be less stressed during the exam as we have been able to provide them with an ambience of exam rooms,” said professor Subhashis Chaudhuri, director, IIT-B.“Around 1,500 students who are currently on campus are attending lectures online. Most of them are appearing for the exams in physical mode,” added Chaudhari.The institute shut down completely on March 28 last year owing to the pandemic, with an early summer vacation announced on April 1. On June 25, the institute declared that the entire autumn semester will be conducted online in the interest of students’ safety. Since then, almost all teaching and academic activities, barring research work, have been held online. However, last December, IIT-B put in place a plan for the slow rebooting of research work and to determine which students should be called in first and how. A committee was set up with student and faculty representatives for the decision.While undergraduate students and incoming masters and PhD students can complete their semester remotely, research scholars and senior masters’ students have to mandatorily complete their research projects to complete their course work. Thus, scholars who needed access to laboratories for their work were allowed to come back to the campus on priority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitbombay-holds-exams-in-hybrid-mode-those-on-campus-take-tests-offline-101631471064588.html

Candidates said they expect to score well this year. The exam was conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) and centres in the city included five private schools.Raghav Sachdeva from Kurukshetra, who appeared for the exam at Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 33, said the paper was straightforward. “I was able to finish well in time. Biology was the most straightforward.” Himanshu Badoga from Dera Bassi, added, “The paper was along expected lines and manageable. Attendance also remained high with only one or two students absent per class.”32 questions repeatedMany coaching institutes have already started uploading the answer keys, as students were allowed to take the question paper home. Kunal Singh, who runs a coaching centre in Sector 34, said, “All concepts were covered in the paper and the level of questions improved this year. Talented students will surely score well. However, around 32 physics and chemistry questions were directly copied from other competitive exams, including previous year’s Joint Entrance Examination (JEE).”‘Instructions must be clearer’ City based NEET trainer Arvind Goyal added that the biology portion was along expected lines, however, the NTA needs to be more clear in their instructions. “We had to file an RTI for the optional questions to ask what will happen if all questions are attempted. NTA should clarify this, further after answering our RTI they should have put an online notice about this as well. A question was also out of the NTA prescribed syllabus “ he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/students-in-chandigarh-find-neet-scoring-101631470888038.html
13-09-2021||Delhi||Light spells of rain likely in Delhi this week, Met forecasts||The city is likely to get mostly light rain over the coming week, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in its Sunday forecast, as parts of the Capital received showers for the second straight day.According to IMD, on Sunday, the Safdarjung Observatory, considered representative of Delhi’s weather, received 41.1mm of rain between 8.30am on Saturday and 8.30am on Sunday, and then 1.2 mm rain between 8.30am and 5.30pm.“Light rain or thundershowers will continue till September 15-16. Another spell of moderate intensity rainfall is likely around September 16-17. This month will see rainfall on and off, with monsoon likely to withdraw late from northwest region including Delhi,” said a senior official, who didn’t wish to be named. Delhi on Saturday received 81.3mm rain in just three hours, starting 5.30am, which broke a 46-year-old record, making it the wettest monsoon for the city since 1975.The city has received 1,136.8mm rain so far this monsoon. It last received more rain in 1975, when Delhi recorded 1155.6mm rain.The all-time record, from 1933, stands at 1420.3 mm, according to IMD. The unusual monsoon this year has set another record — after 1944, which had the rainiest September on record, this year’s September has so far reported the most rainfall. With a good part of the month still left, this year’s September could become the rainiest since 1901, the year when earliest rainfall data is available.In just 11 days, the city has recorded 380.2mm rainfall, according to data. In September 1944, the city received 417.3mm rain.Unlike July and August that saw dry phases, September so far has not had any such spells, and the city has seen some rainfall on most days this month. “The continuous rain spells are mainly on account of easterly winds and frequently forming low pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal, which travelling up to north and central India are bringing rainfall,” the official added. According to scientists, Delhi has witnessed seven heavy rain events (64.4mm rainfall and above) this year, the highest ever. Normally, Delhi records just one or two such events in the entire season, between June 1 and September 30.“This monsoon has already featured in the list of the top five wettest seasons. We might break more records but we will have to wait for the final rainfall data,” RK Jenamani, senior IMD scientist, told HT on Saturday.Despite monsoon arriving in Delhi on July 13, making it the most-delayed in 19 years, the capital recorded 16 rainy days in the month, the maximum in the last four years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/light-spells-of-rain-likely-in-delhi-this-week-met-forecasts-101631470823642.html
13-09-2021||Noida||Nearly all in Gautam Budh Nagar have got first vaccine dose, says admin||The Gautam Budh Nagar administration is likely to soon stop administering first doses of Covid-19 vaccines, after jabs to more people than the official adult population count of the district, senior officials said on Sunday.Data from the district’s immunisation programme shows that Gautam Budh Nagar has an adult population of 1,589,815 people, while 1,618,215 got first doses of Covid-19 vaccines till 8pm on Sunday, according to the CoWin dashboard.District magistrate Suhas L Yathiraj however said that around 60,000 people “in some pockets” of Gautam Budh Nagar, mostly aged above 45, are yet to get a single vaccine jab.“Our vaccination teams are identifying the pockets where most of these beneficiaries live. We’ll launch door-to-door schemes and walk-in vaccination programmes for them, so that the entire eligible lot of beneficiaries can be vaccinated with first jabs. Once they are covered, we’ll stop offering first doses in our centres,” he said. These pockets include mostly rural areas in Jewar, Dadri and Bisrakh blocks, said officials. The nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme began on January 16 this year. In that time, Gautam Budh Nagar has administered a total of 2,230,642 jabs, and 612,427 have received both shots of a vaccine. Over two million of the jabs in the district have been shots of Serum Institute of India’s Covishield jab, and a bulk of the rest are doses of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.The district has added 63,383 cases so far since the outbreak of the pandemic, of whom 466 have died, showed state government data. The state added no fresh cases on Sunday, and has recorded an average of just one case each day over the past week. The excess vaccinated population in the district may be due to its floating population, officials said.“Being an industrial hub and due to its proximity to the national capital, a lot of people either come here to work every day or travel to other neighbouring places from the district. People from both these groups have received their jabs in the district. And, being a central government programme, we can’t stop anyone from getting their shots,” said Yathiraj. Dr Neeraj Tyagi, the district immunisation officer, said that door-to-door awareness campaigns have also been started, to encourage people aged above 45 to get vaccinated. “To clear their doubts and fear, we’ve have been telling them repeatedly that only vaccination can be the best safeguard against the Covid-19 infection. We’ll soon begin the door-to-door vaccination in their areas,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/nearly-all-in-gautam-budh-nagar-have-got-first-vaccine-dose-says-admin-101631470762610.html
13-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Residents raise issue with timers of traffic lights due to LED installation||At around 40 intersections in Chandigarh, where traffic lights are being upgraded to LED lights, their timers have not been functioning properly, according to residents. The timers indicate how many seconds are left before the light turns green, and if they malfunction, it can lead to mishaps, as per road safety experts.Madan Gupta Spatu, senior executive member of the Second Innings Association, said, “Even though traffic monitoring systems will be put up under the Smart City Project to intelligently control traffic, right now even the digital clock installed earlier on traffic lights have stopped working. When the light turns from green to red without any warning, people who stop their vehicle are in danger of being hit by the vehicle behind them.” Senior deputy mayor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu added that he has received many complaints about the issue. “Sometimes, the timer and the lights aren’t synced properly, which also leads to confusion.”Harman Sidhu, member of the Chandigarh State Road Safety Council, said, “This issue is particularly seen where older traffic lights are being upgraded to silver LED lights. While upgrading the traffic lights is fine, the earlier features must be retained. We as drivers have become used to these timers, and without them, chances of accidents will rise as vehicles speed up to try and pass the lights before they turn green.” He added that officials must solve this issue proactively rather than wait for complaints to pour in.However, chief engineer of the municipal corporation (MC), NP Sharma maintained this is not why the timers are not working properly. “The new LED traffic lights being installed in the city by the MC are maintained by a private contractor and they have a dashboard to check the real-time status of the working of lights and efficiency stays over 90%. Some faults are bound to come up and we request residents to call on the MC complaint number, 0172-2787200 if this happens and the issue will be resolved in a time-based manner,” he said.Officials of the UT administration added that traffic lights malfunction more during the monsoons as water can interfere with their functioning. The maintenance of the traffic lights isn’t done by the traffic police, but the personnel on duty convey complaints to the MC or UT authorities. Some of the timers and traffic lights are also turned off in the morning and evening during the peak time of traffic to manually regulate the traffic.Superintendent of police (SP, traffic) Ketan Bansal, said, “People have sent representations about this and traffic police personnel are deployed to manually direct the traffic wherever this happens. If people face this problem, they can contact the traffic helpline at 1073 or reach out to us on social media and we will get the issue resolved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-residents-raise-issue-with-timers-of-traffic-lights-due-to-led-installation-101631470644979.html

Data reveals that over the last three years, cases of speeding of vehicles have increased drastically. Between January and August this year, 302,941 people were penalised for speeding at the Vadgaon checkpost. Last year, 55,711 people were penalised for speeding while in 2019, 1,435 people were penalised for the same offence.Sanjay Jadhav, superintendent of police, highway state police (HSP), Pune, who is in charge of the Khandala and Vadgaon checkposts, said, “Speeding is one of the major violations followed by not wearing seat belts and lane cutting. With the help of CCTV cameras and speed guns, we are managing to keep tabs on speeding violations. The incidents of lane cutting are also increasing rapidly.”Around 60,000 vehicles pass through the 94km Mumbai-Pune expressway daily. Accidents on the expressway have been on the rise over the past few years due to non-compliance with traffic rules by drivers.To control undisciplined traffic, curb the rising number of accidents and ensure safe travel for motorists, the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) will activate an ‘Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS)’ along the Pune-Mumbai expressway. The project has been stuck for two years due to financial constraints but with Rs40 crore now available from the state government, the two-year-long tender process for implementation of the system will be finalised within a month. The total cost of the project is Rs160 crore. Under the ITMS, an average speed detection system will be installed at 39 spots and a lane discipline violation detection system will be set up at 34 spots to detect traffic violations. A MSRDC official said, “Three tenders have been submitted for it and one of them will be finalised and the company will be appointed. After that, the actual work of installing the system will start in six months by carrying out the next process. The work will be completed within six months from commencement.”Along with penalising people for traffic violations, the highway state police (HSP) has undertaken various initiatives for ensuring safe driving on the Pune-Mumbai expressway. “Under the highway mission, we are creating awareness regarding keeping heavy vehicles in the left lane. If heavy vehicles continue to be in one lane, traffic moves smoothly from other lanes,” Jadhav said.Another initiative of the HSP which is helping save the lives of injured motorists is Mrutunjay Dhoot, which is run by villagers who stay near the expressway. About Mrutyunjay Dhoot, Jadhav said, “We started this initiative under the guidance of Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay, additional director general of police (traffic), Maharashtra. In every village that touches Pune-Mumbai expressway, we have identified people who have been trained to provide first-hand medical aid to the injured. We have provided them with stretchers and a first aid kit. We have also linked them with nearby hospitals so that even before the police can reach the spot, treatment is provided to injured persons.”“A majority of deaths take place as medical help arrives late. With the help of Mrutyunjay Dhoot, we have saved the lives of around 500 people till now. Many people are in the bad habit of shooting videos instead of providing quick help which should be avoided,” Jadhav said.The HSP, with the help of village authorities, is building speed breakers on roads that connect directly to the expressway to avoid accidents. The HSP is also running an awareness drive to keep reflectors on while parking cars during the night.Tanmay Pendse, trustee of the Akshaymarg Foundation which works towards the safety of commuters on the expressway said, “There is a serious need to introduce driving education lessons in textbooks as majority of the people who drive are unaware of driving lessons and tend to speed. As the younger generation will be driving vehicles in future, they should be taught driving etiquette in school. Penalising is important so as to instill fear of breaking traffic rules. There should be a minimum Rs20,000 fine for speeding only then will it change people’s habits.”“Setting up an ITMS is most important for the Mumbai-Pune expressway. We (Akshaymarg Foundation) submitted a report to the government in 2016 after studying the expressway for 21 days. There has been a delay in setting up the system. ITMS becomes more important because the Mumbai-Pune expressway is so long that it needs a system more than humans for monitoring violations. Political will is a must only then will the ITMS be set up at the earliest,” Pendse said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/traffic-violations-on-pune-mumbai-e-way-speeding-tops-the-charts-101631465902311.html
13-09-2021||Pune||Pune district reaches 9 million mark for Covid vaccinations||PUNE In the past 10 days, Pune district has inoculated at least a million people with the Covid-19 vaccine, as a result of which, on Saturday, the overall number of people vaccinated stood at 9 million.Currently, Pune is behind Mumbai in terms of total vaccinations in Maharashtra. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Zilla Parishad, said, “Pune’s vaccination drive is clearly the best in the state as we have been able to pick up the pace in a very short amount of time. The best performing vaccination centres of the state are in rural areas of Pune and we are truly grateful to the incredible nurses, data entry operators, doctors and support staff who left the festivities in their homes and chose to be on duty to vaccinate.”“As the administration, we did not put any pressure on anyone to work on Saturday. On Saturday we could vaccinate 156,000 people of which 82,000 were in rural areas. It also noteworthy that Pune crossed the 9 million vaccination mark,” he added.“As per the Election Commission of India, 7.887 million is the eligible population for vaccination, as per the voter list which is updated from time to time,” Prasad said.Support from private players provided a much-needed boost. In addition to this, the Indian Red Cross Society provided a place for vaccination, cleaning arrangements, crowd control and furniture which helped create more vaccination centres in the rural areas. On Saturday the Pune circle crossed the 200,000 mark when Pune district saw 114,312 vaccinations. On Saturday, Solapur saw 83,505 vaccinations and Satara, 4,944 vaccinations. On August 31, Pune became the only district till day to vaccinate 200,000 people in a day. That was the day total totally, 8.14 million vaccines were administered, of which 5.94 million were first doses and 2.20 million were second doses. Vax supply remains erraticIn September, on multiple occasions, centres had to remain shut because of inconsistent supply of the vaccine.Dr Suryakant Deokar, PMC’s immunisation officer said, “We will not be able to vaccinate at any of our centres on Monday, neither Covishield nor Covaxin, because we have not yet got stock. In September, till now, we have had to keep our centres shut on multiple occasions. In August supply was quite steady and so it became easier for us to plan sessions and for people to ensure they can get their dose on time. However, this month has been a bit slower.” Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director of health services Pune circle, said that if supply remains consistent as it was in August, then the entire district could be fully vaccinated in the next three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-district-reaches-9-million-mark-for-covid-vaccinations-101631464043806.html
13-09-2021||Patna||Paswan’s death anniversary: PM, others pay rich tributes, Nitish skips event||Political leaders cutting across party lines and a large number of Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) workers participated in the first death anniversary function of former union minister and party founder Ram Vilas Paswan at his Patna residence on Sunday.Union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras, late Paswan’s younger brother and leader of the faction that broke away from Chirag Paswan-led LJP, arrived early to take part in the puja. Chirag had got the name of Paras printed on the card. Bihar Governor Phagu Chouhan, union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai, former union minister Ram Kripal Yadav, Deputy CM Renu Devi, health minister Mangal Devi, Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha and and chairman of the Legislative Council Avadhesh Narayan Singh also reached there to pay their respect.RJD leader Tej Pratap Yadav also visited Chirag’s house in the evening. Chirag had also met Lalu Prasad in Delhi.Earlier during the day, senior RJD leaders Abdul Bari Siddiqui and Shyam Razak and Congress leaders Shakeel Ahmad and Madan Mohan Jha visited Chirag’s residence.The notable absence was of Bihar Chief minister Nitish Kumar, who issued a two-line press statement in the morning to pay tribute to Ram Vilas Paswan. An LJP leader said no senior JD(U) leader was visible till evening, though it was not a political function.“It would have been better had he come here to pay tribute. Leaders cutting across parry lines have come here to pay their tribute. This is what my father was all about. I had tried to give invitation to Nitish Kumar also, but could not get appointment,” he said.Earlier, in a long emotional message, Prime Minister Narendra Modi described Ram Vilas Paswan as a close friend and a “great son of the nation, Bihar’s pride and a strong voice for social justice”, which Chirag shared on Twitter. Chirag wrote on Twitter that the PM’s message, epitomising his father’s life and work for the society in his words, gave him and his family strength.Nitish Kumar had, however, attended the “shradh” function of Ram Vilas Paswan ahead of the assembly elections despite the LJP announcing candidates against all the JD(U) candidates. The bitterness increased further after JD(U) was relegated to the third position for the first time in Bihar. LJP got reduced to just one seat and the MLA defected to JD(U).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/paswans-death-anniversary-pm-others-pay-rich-tributes-nitish-skips-event-101631463742762.html
13-09-2021||Pune||Experts raise red flag as Covid norms go for toss during festivities in Pune||PUNE Members of the state Covid task force on Sunday sounded the alarm, cautioning about a possible surge in Covid cases due to large crowds gathering for the ongoing Ganesh festival. The state government has made it clear it will not impose any additional restrictions, but has appealed to people to follow all Covid norms Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state task force, asked for caution as mass gatherings have increased in Pune and Mumbai. “We have to be on the red alert. We have to ensure that Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed. We must delay the third Covid wave for as long as possible,” Dr Joshi said. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the Maharashtra government on Covid-19, said that the last week of September will be crucial as Covid cases may increase post the Ganesh immersion. “Covid-appropriate behaviour is nowhere to be seen in semi-urban and rural areas. Even in the urban parts, only a few people have been following the Covid norms such as wearing masks. It is a dangerous sign. We have seen the effects of negligence. We should all be aware,” said Dr Salunkhe. Experts have concurred that that Pune and other districts in the western Maharashtra still remain a matter of concern. Currently, Pune still accounts for 25 per cent of active Covid-19 cases in the state, as per data with the state health department. “In the list of districts of concern, Pune and Ahmednagar are on top. Then comes Satara, Sangli and Solapur. Mumbai and Thane have now been included in this list. Test positivity rates vary here, but there should be a lot of emphasis on vaccination, masks and Covid- appropriate behaviour in these areas,” said Dr Joshi. Pune district saw its first Covid wave peak in September 2020, post the 10-day Ganesh festival. Last year, as per figures released by the state health department, Pune district reported 37,968 fresh Covid cases between August 22 and September 2, the period during which the Ganesh festival was celebrated. The district reported 31,110 cases between August 10 and August 21. As on September 9, Pune accounted for 12,758 active Covid-19 cases of the 50,000 cases in the state. This number is the highest for any district in Maharashtra. After Pune is Thane, with 5,000 fewer active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/experts-raise-red-flag-as-covid-norms-go-for-toss-during-festivities-101631463262171.html
13-09-2021||Mumbai||Sena to contest 20 seats in Goa, looks for MVA-like alliance||The Shiv Sena is set to contest around 20 seats in Goa, in an attempt to gain power in the adjoining state and to get the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of power. The Sena is exploring Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA)-like alliance possibilities in Goa.The party is also planning to field candidates in 80-100 seats in Uttar Pradesh election. Both states are due for polls in February-March next year.Senior Sena leader and party chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said, “In Goa, we are contesting the elections. We plan to contest around 20-21 seats in Goa. In Uttar Pradesh, too, we are planning to contest 80 to 100 seats of the 402 Assembly seats. For Goa, efforts are on to explore a formula like that of MVA. Let’s see if we succeed.” Party insiders said the Sena is exploring options to have alliance with regional parties in Goa. “There are smaller parties there; so, we can have an alliance with them, if not [it doesn’t happen] then we will contest solo,” Raut said.A Sena functionary said the party is looking to increase its presence in other states as well. With a sizable Marathi-speaking population and its Hindutva agenda, the party aims to take a step towards getting more legislators. “It is not that we are contesting elections after MVA or when Uddhav ji became the chief minister. We have fielded candidates in many states [polls] before, but now we can explore alliances with smaller parties and increase our base there,” said a leader. The Sena had fielded three candidates in 2017 polls in Goa, but lost deposit on all three seats and got 1.3% votes on the seats contested.Raut added that the Sena is expected to get support from local political outfits and farmers’ organisations in western UP. “In western UP, there are some farmers’ organisations who have said that they will back us. Smaller parties in UP have also extended support to the Shiv Sena,” he said, expressing confidence in the party’s chances in 2022. In 2017, Sena had fielded 57 candidates in UP, of which 56 lost their deposits. It secured 88,595 votes or 0.1% of the vote share.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sena-to-contest-20-seats-in-goa-looks-for-mva-like-alliance-101631462482892.html
13-09-2021||Pune||Monday musings: Rent seeking through Contractor-raj||Earlier this month, when Parivartan, a non-governmental organisation, released a report card on public representatives in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), an interesting fact came out: purchasing jute and cloth bags to distribute them to citizens in the past five years was the priority for most corporators in the city, besides focusing on drainage work. Of the ₹90.90 crore funds utilised by the corporators, nearly ₹15.31 crore was spent on drainage cleaning during the past four years followed by ₹12.57 crore on distribution of these bags, according to report by Parivartan. The distribution began after the state government imposed a ban on plastic bags in 2017, opening another door of opportunity for public representatives to “serve” people in their own way. For a civic body with an annual budget of ₹8,370 crore during 2021-22, spending ₹12.57 crore in four years may seem pittance. It, however, raises an important issue of misplaced priorities that PMC and many other civic bodies in the country are dealing with. But there’s a bigger question people residing in bigger cities need to answer: How likely are they going to react to such spending, which indicates mis-governance? People living in major cities are apathetic to it as they are busy with their life, which may involve more important things even if they keep grumbling about outlays not getting translated into outcomes. The assumption that the purpose of outlays is to produce outcomes may not necessarily translates into reality. “The purpose of the outlay is to create a broad justification for expanding the reach of the contracting state. The end is the awarding of the contract. But the nature of contracting is now producing systematic misalignments,” wrote Indian academician and former president at Centre for Policy Research, Pratap Bhanu Mehta in one of his articles. In Pune, awarding contracts at discretion has currently become a bone of contention between the BJP members and Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar. The municipal commissioner has been firm on his stand of cutting down ward level budget for elected members. These ward level works are often carried out by contractors selected by corporators. As seen in the case of distribution of jute bags, most ward level work is either duplication or spending on unnecessary stuff at taxpayers’ expense. Whether distributing bags or building roads or reconstructing the fairly new footpaths, the main interest for corporators – not just of the BJP but for all parties - is in awarding the contracts. These contracts, as we all know, have much to do with rent-seeking, which allow people in power to use their clouts to make money, which is another form of corruption. No wonder when the standing committee chairman Nitin Landge, his PA and three other civic officers at Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation were caught red-handed while accepting bribe, it raised no eyebrows. The bribe was for awarding contracts, said police officials. Yet the form of this level of corruption is so taken for granted, it did not generate any hullaballoo. The state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) arrested them soon after a meeting of the civic standing committee in August. The three civic employees were allegedly caught while accepting ₹1.18 lakh from the contractor, who was initially asked to pay ₹10 lakh for a work order for installing advertising hoardings. The amount was later brought down to ₹6 lakh, according to the ACB. It is because everyone loves contracts, big cities often see construction activity underway in one part or another, even as it may not add into city’s infrastructure neither it underlines social utility. Such contracts neither benefit cities or citizens, thus resulting in zero-sum game.

13-09-2021||Mumbai||12 Air India Airbus aircraft remain grounded due to want of engines||At least a dozen Airbus aircraft of the disinvestment-bound Air India are grounded since the past few years for engine replacement, but the airline is unable to perform the task due to shortage of funds.Airline sources said that with the national carrier almost set to go to private hands, whether these aircraft are put back into operation or not will depend on the outcome of the privatisation process.Despite repeated attempts, Air India spokesperson did not comment on the matter.An airline source said, “At least 12 Airbus 320 aircraft continue to remain grounded. The airline needs over ₹1100 crore to make them operational, which the management is unlikely to spend considering the ongoing privatisation process.”“Unless the new bidder comes in, fate of these aircraft will remain undecided,” the source added.In August 2019, the airline’s narrow-body fleet pilots’ body — Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) — had alleged that 19 planes were on ground for want of spares, resulting not only in huge revenue loss but also massive flight cancellations. The pilots’ body had questioned the airline management over this.In terms of the bidding process for privatisation of the airline, final bidders will submit their bids, marking the completion of the bidding stage, by September 15. Divesting Air India includes selling off government’s 100% stake in the state-owned airline that is incurring losses since 2007. As part of the exercise, the government also plans to sell its entire stake in Air India Express and 50% stake in Air India SATS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/12-air-india-airbus-aircraft-remain-grounded-due-to-want-of-engines-101631455942157.html
