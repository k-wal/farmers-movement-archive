While four members of the gang have been arrested, police said the gang is allegedly involved in at least 126 cases of cyber fraud across 16 states and Union Territories and have siphoned off over ₹1.1 crore from victims’ accounts. A 30-year-old woman came across a website claiming to belong to M/s Haldiram, and offered franchises and dealerships. Over the course of the next few days, she filled as many forms and paid ₹11.74 lakh in two months. Police said she was in touch with some ‘Haldiram officials’. A senior official from Halidaram told HT on the condition of anonymity. “There are no franchises of the brand. Every store has a separate owner.”When the woman was asked to pay another ₹1.6 lakh on some vague grounds, she realized she had been taken for a ride. She filed a police complaint, following which police busted the inter-state gang of cyber cheats. Anyesh Roy, deputy commissioner of police, Cyber Prevention and Detection unit’s (CyPAD) special cell, said during the course of the investigation, it was found that a large number of websites are running in the name of M/s Haldiram, and all these websites are offering franchisee of M/s Haldiram against consideration of huge amounts. It was also found that a large number of people across the country have fallen prey to such fake websites. “The fraudsters are using multiple bank accounts and operating a large number of bogus SIM cards in more than 36 smartphones to cheat people. We fetched all these details and found that the gang is spread out across the country. A team was immediately formed to nab the culprits. After several raids, four people, including the mastermind of the gang Vikas Mistry (24), were arrested,” said Roy. On examining the devices recovered from the accused and the data related to the fake websites of M/s Haldiram, police found that the suspects were also running fake websites of reputed brands, such as Amul and Patanjali. Police said the suspects developed the fake websites, got their similar sounding domains registered, and also promoted these sites through Google Ads for higher ranking and visibility so that every time a person searched about these brands on Google with relevant keywords, such as dealership, distributorship, franchisee, etc, he would be directed to the fake website. Explaining the modus operandi of the gang, Roy said that during interrogation, Vikas revealed that he, along with his associates, purchased the domain names of big brands such as Haldiram, Amul, Patanjali, etc., from various developers, including one Vinay Vikram Singh (37), who has been arrested. Singh developed the websites in such a manner that it seemed to be the genuine website of the big brands, said police. One phone number was also displayed on the website, said police adding that when someone called on the given number for distributorship of the brand, he was asked to pay fees on the pretext of various charges. “Vikas used to switch locations between Bihar and Ludhiana. In Ludhiana, he used to stay for months and do the same work with his relatives, who were given a commission from the cheated amounts,” said Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-arrest-4-for-running-fake-websites-of-major-brands-duping-people-of-over-1-crore-101630866577978.html

The suspect, Pravesh, 38, was working in the house at that time. “Pravesh left the house without informing anyone, and when my wife came outside her room, the jewellery was missing,” Bhat said in a police complaint.The domestic help did not come to work the next day. “When we contacted her and asked to come for work, without giving a specific reason, she said that she won’t be coming for work that day. On August 14, when she came for work, we confronted her about the theft, but she did not accept it,” Bhat added.The family pursued her to admit to the theft for the next few days, but she did not. Hence, Bhat filed a complaint at the Bisrakh police station on August 17.

The SIT is likely to question top officials of the Noida authority and collect relevant documents related to the controversial project, officials said on Sunday, adding that the team will stay in Noida for two days.The SIT has sought details pertaining to the first time map approval, its revision and under which rules the height of two towers in the project was allowed to be increased,” said a Noida authority official, requesting anonymity.The SIT was formed on September 2, two days after the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of Apex and Ceyane towers in Supertech’s Emerald Court project in Noida over grave violation of building norms. The court said the violation was a result of “nefarious complicity” between the Noida authority and the real estate developer.The four-member SIT, headed by UP industrial development commissioner (IDC) Sanjeev Mittal, will also probe the role of the officials to fix responsibility in the matter. The other members of the SIT include additional chief secretary (revenue) Manoj Singh, ADG (police) Rajeev Sabharwal, and UP’s chief town and rural planner Anup Kumar. The state government has given a week’s time to the team to submit the report.On September 2, the Noida authority, in a report, shared details of at least six officials involved in the process of sanctioning maps of the twin towers in the Emerald Court project. The names include the then chief architect and town planner and additional chief executive officer. On the same day, the state government suspended Mukesh Goyal, a manager in the planning department of the Noida authority, in connection with the twin tower case, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/sit-to-visit-noida-in-connection-with-supertech-twin-tower-case-101630865558327.html
05-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra aims to administer 20 million Covid vaccine doses in September||After administering a record-breaking 1,225,541 doses on Saturday, Maharashtra has set a target to inoculate over 20 million people in September, which comes to approximately 700,000 Covid vaccine doses per day from the average of 482,695 doses administered in a day in August. Currently, Maharashtra ranks first in terms of fully vaccinatedpopulation in the country with 17,261,027 citizens receiving both the doses. So far, the state has administered 62,940,932 doses. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, state public health department, said there would be boost in the vaccination drive. “We expect to give more than 20 million doses in September. We have been assured of the supply from the Central government, and if there is more production, the numbers may go up further. Private hospitals have also contributed significantly to vaccination drive,” said Dr Vyas. In August, a total of 14,483,870 doses were administered in Maharashtra, while the number stood at 12,143,140 in July. The state’s private hospitals have played an important role in vaccination as they have administered 9,397,393 doses, of which 3,903,807 were in Mumbai followed 2,469,350 doses in Pune. Currently, 45% of the total population of the state has taken at least one dose of vaccine. Mumbai tops the chart with 80% of its population taking at least one dose of vaccine. Around 35.7% population in the 18-44 age group has been vaccinated while the percentage for the 45-plus age group is 54.16%. The state government is aiming to ramp up vaccination as it could prove an important tool to contain the third wave and tide over shortage of oxygen, if it turns as severe as projected. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray described vaccine as a shield against Covid-19 virus. “We need to stop the third wave or at least postpone it. Citizens should fully support the vaccination drive. Doctors need to educate citizens that they should take both the doses. There can be cases where people have taken both doses and can still get Covid-19. However, the severity of the virus will be less,” he added. Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 4,057 new Covid-19 cases and 67 deaths. Mumbai’s tally of new cases was 495. The city also reported two deaths, pushing toll to 15,993. The total number of Covid-19 patients across the state has now reached 6,486,174. On Sunday, 193,193 Covid tests were done and the number of recoveries clocked 5,916. The total number of active patients in Maharashtra stood at 50,095. There are currently 50,095 active patients across the state, of which Pune tops with 12,325 patients followed by Thane with 7,273 and Satara with 6,603 active patients. The death toll has reached 137,774 with Pune leading with 19,303 deaths, followed by Mumbai with 15,993 and Thane with 11,324 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-aims-to-administer-20-million-covid-vaccine-doses-in-september-101630865557766.html
05-09-2021||Noida||Supertech effect: Noida authority begins crackdown against illegal construction in housing complexes||Facing criticism from the Supreme Court in the Supertech twin tower case, the Noida authority has launched a crackdown against illegal constructions in group housing complexes.On Saturday, the authority demolished some illegal flats in Assotech Windsor Court, a housing society in Noida’s Sector 78, officials said.The authority had in 2012 allotted plot number 04A in Sector 78 for the group housing project, and approved maps of five towers in which stilt parking at ground floor was allowed. However, the developer, Assotech Private Limited, built offices and flats in two stilt floors in tower H and F, said the authority officials. The officials said that some residents of the society filed repeated complaints against the illegal flats and constructions.As the illegal flats and offices are located at the ground floor, the authority is using JCB machines to demolish the unauthorised structures, the officials said, adding that the demolition work is being done cautiously to avoid any damage to other buildings in the complex.“Despite several notices, the developer did not demolish the illegal structures. Therefore, we started removing them on Saturday. The demolition work will continue for a few days,” said Mukesh Vaish, senior manager of the Noida authority who is leading the demolition drive.The developer had built two offices and eight flats in these two towers in the stilt parking area against the approved map. “We have demolished the illegal office space and five flats. The other three flats are sold and locked by the flat owners. We have given a week’s time to these flat owners to vacate so that we can demolish the three flats too,” said Vaish.According to the officials, selling units more than approved in a building map is a cheating. “Since the developer has sold these flats without registry, the other legal issues pertaining to illegal sale will come at the stage of execution of registry. But selling illegal flats is also a grave offence as it affects innocent buyers,” said another authority official, not authorised to speak to media.Assotech Group promoter Sanjiv Srivastav said, “We are filing a reply to the Noida authority’s notice in this regard.”The officials further said that the authority is also identifying illegal construction in other housing societies, where the approved maps are being violated. “We cannot reveal the society names now, but the action will be taken against each one found violating the norms,” said the official.On August 31, the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of Apex and Ceyane towers in Supertech’s Emerald Court project in Noida over grave violation of building norms. The court said the violation was a result of “nefarious complicity” between the Noida authority and the real estate developer.The apex court directed that Supertech will have to demolish the towers at its own expense and complete it within three months under the supervision of the Noida authority and an expert body such as the Central Building Research Institute. The top court also ordered that Supertech will refund money to all the existing homebuyers in the two towers within two months, along with an interest of 12% per annum from the date of their deposits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/supertech-effect-noida-authority-begins-crackdown-against-illegal-construction-in-housing-complexes-101630865497848.html
05-09-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks ailing Gadchiroli Naxal attack accused to apply for bail||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday asked Naxalite leader Nirmala Uppuganti to amend her petition to include bail as a final relief and directions to transfer her from prison to a palliative care hospice as an interim relief in her petition. Uppuganti, who was arrested in 2019 along with her husband for allegedly being responsible for the death of 15 policemen and a civilian in the Gadchiroli Naxal attack, is terminally ill with breast cancer and is being taken to Tata Memorial Hospital for treatment every alternate day. However, as facilities in Byculla Women’s prison were not conducive, she sought to be shifted to a palliative hospice from where she could be taken for her treatment. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing the petition, was informed by advocates Dr Yug Choudhry and Payoshi Roy that the alleged leader of CPI (Maoist), a banned organisation, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2018 and has been undergoing chemotherapy for the same. However, after her arrest in 2019 she missed her therapy and the cancer spread in her body. The court was further informed that Uppuganti had reached stage four of cancer and was suffering from multiple skeletal and lung metastases, and hence sought to be shifted to a hospice for palliative care for proper care during her final days. It was further submitted that as the Byculla prison, where Uppuganti is lodged, did not have proper facilities and she had to sleep on the floor in packed cells and was not provided hot water, these were having an adverse effect on her health. Public prosecutor Sangeeta Shinde opposed the plea saying Uggupanti was being taken to Tata Memorial Hospital every alternate day as directed by her doctors there. Shinde said the prison medical doctor had stated that Uppuganti was able to move around the prison and was being taken to the hospital regularly. After hearing the submissions, the bench sought to know why Uppuganti had not applied for bail along with her plea. “There is no prayer for bail. Even though we come to a conclusion that she needs medical care, how can we release her because there is no bail? You could have applied for bail and then the alternate of palliative care,” observed the bench. In response, Roy said the accused did not have anyone except her husband who was being held at Arthur Road prison and all her assets and belongings had been seized, hence even if she got bail she had nowhere to go. Further there was no one to take care of the bail formalities, hence she only sought shifting to a hospice. The court then asked the lawyer to amend the petition to include a prayer for bail and if not bail, then at least include why bail was not sought mentioning the grounds that were orally submitted to the court. The court then directed the prison authorities to take Uppuganti to Tata Memorial Hospital as per her fixed schedule and inform the court about her condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-ailing-gadchiroli-naxal-attack-accused-to-apply-for-bail-101630865317963.html

The contractors’ staff have been charging up to ₹50 for parking a car against the approved fee of ₹20, a practice that is also going on right under the nose of the civic body at the multi-storey parking lot near its Headquarters at Mata Rani Chowk. Complaints of fleecing are common at the parking lots in Bhadaur House, Sarabha Nagar main market and BRS Nagar as well, in absence of any check by MC.Apart from these four sites, paid parking was also introduced at Feroze Gandhi market, Sarabha Nagar Block-I market and Tuition Market in Model Town extension after parking contracts were awarded to two agencies over the past few months. As per the agreement, ₹20 was fixed for parking cars and ₹10 for two-wheelers. Besides, the contractors were told to issue e-tickets with the approved fee printed on it, but they have been blatantly using manual slips to overcharge visitors.A visit to the parking lot at Bhadaur House revealed that people parking cars were being charged ₹50 without any receipt. A similar fee was being levied at the multi-storey parking near MC office, where the parking staff was issuing manual receipts.“During a visit to the Sarabha Nagar main market, I was asked to pay ₹30 to park my car against a manual receipt. MC should conduct surprise inspections at all parking lots to stop fleecing of residents,” said Mohit, who lives in Civil Lines area.A shopkeeper in Chaura Bazaar, Gurmeet Singh said, “We have filed several complaints, but to no avail. Even people who are aware of the prescribed fee are forced to pay higher amounts to avoid altercations with the parking staff every time they visit a parking lot.” Despite several attempts, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu was not available for a comment.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said inspections will be conducted and contractors will face action if they overcharge visitors or fail to introduce e-ticketing which is mandatory under the agreement with MC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fleecing-at-parking-lots-visitors-paying-the-price-for-ludhiana-mc-s-apathy-101630865199334.html

05-09-2021||Other||Tokyo Paralympics:GB Nagar DM makesUP proud||LUCKNOW Success seems to be following Uttar Pradesh sportspersons these days. Just a fortnight ago, it was Varanasi’s Lalit Upadhyay, who as a member of the Indian hockey team won a historical bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics, and now it’s Suhas Yathiraj, the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar, bagging a silver medal in badminton at the Tokyo Paralympics on Sunday. The 38-year-old Yathiraj not only became the first civil servant of India to make a podium finish at the Paralympics, where badminton made its debut, but also the second individual from Uttar Pradesh after long jumper Praveen Kumar of Jewar, who finished with a silver medal a few days ago. Now, both are entitled to get ₹4 crore each as per the state government’s policy. All eyes were on Yathiraj on Sunday as soon as he stepped on to the court against World No 1 Lucas Mazur of France in the men’s singles SL4 category. From the very start, the 62-minute duel witnessed a ding-dong battle with Yathiraj winning the first game before Mazur levelling the match by winning the second game. The two produced their best and at times it was tough to pick out the winner, especially when the scoreboard read 1-all. But in the decider, Lucas continued his brilliant run to win the gold medal. Yathiraj should be incredibly proud of his effort as he became the fourth Indian para-shuttler to win a medal at the Paralympic Games in Tokyo. Yathiraj, who remained committed to his responsibilities, including the handling of tough situations during the pandemic-induced lockdown, has been an inspiration to many Indians, playing badminton in school to becoming an IAS officer and now a Paralympics medallist. Yathiraj, who hails from Karnataka and became an IAS officer in Uttar Pradesh in 2007, has impairment in one of his ankles. His parents always stood by him and made sure that the “disability” never became in an obstacle in his life and supported him to play in inter-school tournaments. But things changed dramatically when being the district magistrate of Azamgarh, he was inspired to take up the sport professionally by the para-badminton coach Gaurav Khanna in 2016. This completely changed his life. In the same year, Yathiraj made his mark on the international stage, becoming the first civil servant to win a gold medal at the Asian Para-Badminton Championship in Beijing, and owing to his success, he was given the award of ‘Best Para Sportsperson’ by the Uttar Pradesh government on World Disability Day. “Very emotional (moment). I have never been so happy and so disappointed in my life at the same time. Most happy because of the silver medal but most disappointed because I missed the gold medal by a whisker,” he said in a video message posted by the Paralympic Committee of India. “But destiny gives what I deserve and probably I deserved silver medal, so I am happy for that at least.” As expected, congratulatory messages started pouring in for him. “A fantastic confluence of service and sports! @dmgbnagar Suhas Yathiraj has captured the imagination of our entire nation, thanks to his exceptional sporting performance. Congratulations to him on winning the silver medal in badminton. Best wishes to him for his future endeavours,” PM Modi tweeted. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath too congratulated Yathirak on his success, whereas the IAS Association tweeted: “You won our heart!!! Entire nation is proud of you, Suhas L Y, #IAS DM NOIDA @dmgbnagar for winning #Silver in SL4 #Parabadminton #Cheer4Suhas #cheers4india #Praise4Para.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tokyo-paralympics-gb-nagar-dm-makesup-proud-101630864958983.html
05-09-2021||Mumbai||Include 210-ha vacant patch in SGNP to make up for encroachments: Mumbai NGO||A Mumbai-based environment group has written to the Maharashtra chief minister (CM) and the forest department recommending the inclusion of an estimated 210 hectares (ha) of vacant green land in Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), in a bid to compensate for forest land which has been lost to encroachers. The 210ha are divided across eight land parcels that abut the periphery of SGNP in Thane, Vihar Lake, Goregaon, Kandivli, Malad, Mira Road and Dahisar.In its recent letter to CM (dated August 20, and shared with HT last week), non-governmental organisation (NGO) Vanashakti also drew attention to a final judgment of the Bombay high court (HC), passed in 2004, which ordered that about 200ha of encroachments inside the national park be removed and resettled. Despite efforts, however, encroachments within the park have continued to balloon, and an official forest department report in 2019 had estimated about a tenth of SGNP’s 10,300-ha land cover to be under encroachment, with over 25,000 illegal structures inside the park.According to Vanashakti, there are about 30,000 non-tribal families (approximately 75,000 people) living within SGNP’s boundary. “Resettling them is nearly impossible, given the lack of space in the city,” wrote Stalin D, director, Vanashakti, in his letter to CM, which was subsequently referred to the forest secretary for action by the chief minister’s office. Stalin also pointed out the presence of large slum clusters within the park in Damu Nagar, Akurli, Poisar, Yeoor, Thane and Mulund.“We propose the state government stop this seemingly never ending dilemma. It is best to excise these areas from the park’s boundaries and include open spaces abutting the park. The slums may be given basic amenities and monitored using physical ground truthing, video shooting, geo spatial and biometric verification methods. We have made a preliminary survey using Google Earth and also through ground visits. Our estimation is that around 210ha of open green spaces exist around the park which can be assimilated into it using the Maharashtra Private Forests (Acquisition) Act, 1975,” Stalin wrote in his letter.The majority of the land proposed for inclusion in the park fall under the ‘no development zone’ land use category, and are also within the notified eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of SGNP.Another demand placed before the authorities is that of constructing a boundary wall, which was also one of the mandates given by HC 17 years ago. However, at many places, SGNP continues to have a porous boundary and the construction of the wall remains incomplete due to religious and political reasons. For example, the wall at the Mulund (West) border of the park has not been completed due to the presence of the Ayappa temple. Similar obstructions have prevented the boundary wall from coming up in Akurli and Kandivli areas, among others.It is argued that such a move – finishing the boundary wall after inclusion of new land parcels within SGNP – will be the most practical to execute as it will not require displacement or resettlement of affected persons. “Almost 17 years after a court order, non-tribal encroachments have not yet been removed from SGNP. Instead, thousands of new encroachments have come up and hundred plus acres of forest are lost. Hence, we have requested the government to seal off the slums and make a wall closing off the park’s boundaries from further anthropogenic intrusions,” said Stalin D.Despite attempts, SGNP officials were unavailable for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/include-210-ha-vacant-patch-in-sgnp-to-make-up-for-encroachments-mumbai-ngo-101630864957682.html

According to police, the accused, Jora Singh of Belsar village, Samrala, and Gursewal Singh of Kamalpur village, Samrala, were running the centre from a cyber cafe. They have been arrested.As many as 74 Aadhaar cards, five voter cards, three fingerprint impressions made using adhesive, three laptops, a fingerprint scanner, an iris scanner, pen drives and two printers were recovered from their possession. A stamp of Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Kuljeet Singh Nagra, which was used by the accused to verify documents, was also seized.Sub-inspector Yashpal Sharma said the police raided the cyber cafe following a tip-off and arrested the two men. They used to charge ₹800 to ₹1,000 for making Aadhaar cards without document verification, which posed a threat to the law and order situation in the state.“They are not authorised to run an Aadhaar card centre, but had obtained the UIDAI user ID and password of an authorised centre in Telangana, and had been using it for the past six months,” said the sub-inspector.“We are investigating how they got access to these details and the MLA’s stamp,” he added.The accused have been booked under Sections 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged 1[document or electronic record]) of the Indian Penal Code at the Focal Point police station.They were produced in a court and sent to three-day police custody. More information is expected from the accused during questioning.This is the second such operation uncovered by the police in the last 35 days.On July 31, the police had arrested three men for running a similar Aadhaar card enrolment centre in Tibba area. There too, 16 Aadhaar cards, 36 enrolment certificates, five PAN cards, five voter cards, two printers, a laptop, a fingerprint scanner and an iris scanner were recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/another-fake-aadhaar-centre-unearthed-in-ludhiana-two-held-101630864837757.html

There are many projects where work is yet to start despite allotment (having been done) or where projects have been left midway. Such matters were brought to notice during the review meeting,” said Azad.According to a senior MCG official privy to the matter, at least 193 projects of the engineering wing will be reviewed.“Most projects where work has not started on-ground despite allotment or has been left midway pertain to sewerage, drainage, and water supply projects. Focus will be given to such projects to check for discrepancies and accordingly, initiate action against the contractors concerned or officials, in case of laxity. Some of the projects date as far back as October 2019, and we will be reviewing projects on a case-by-case basis,” the official said, requesting anonymity.The official said that besides laxity in work, work on some of the projects could not be started as contractors either ran out of money, manpower or had disagreements with the MCG over the price of materials being used.Azad said that in the meeting, it was also realised that the MCG had not added clauses for levying penalties on delays with regard to a few projects.“We asked officials if they had taken action in a few cases. However, it was realised that the agreement with the contractors did not have any clause for levying penalties in case of delay(s). Directions have been issued to find projects with such clauses, and to sign a new contract with the requisite clauses if possible,” said Azad.During the meeting, MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja also set a deadline of 15 days for the engineering wing officials for on-ground work to start, following project allotment to contractors.MCG chief engineer TL Sharma could not be reached for comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-projects-to-be-reviewed-over-lack-of-on-ground-progress-101630864666403.html

At present, encroachments in 25 acres of plantation area have been identified, but more such encroachments are likely to be found. Both plantation areas and forest areas are being surveyed and final reports will be ready this week.”The official cited above said that the apex court is scheduled to hear a case regarding encroachments in Aravallis on Tuesday, where a status report of the action taken will be submitted. After the hearing, the next course of action will be decided. Meanwhile, the forest department is likely to demolish a few farmhouses in Gwal Pahari region of Gurugram later this week. In the last week of August, the Gurugram forest department identified encroachments on 225 acres of the Aravallis in the district. The encroachments comprise illegal farmhouses and residential colonies, concentrated in Sohna, Gwal Pahari and Raisina areas. Officials had also predicted in a survey report that the total area of encroachments is likely to exceed 250 acres in the district.According to the records of the forest department, 16,803 acres of the Aravallis are protected under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA). According to directives of the Supreme Court, the PLPA attracts protection under the Forest Conservation Act of 1980, which states that “no state government or other authority shall make, except with the prior approval of the central government, any order directing that any forest land or any portion thereof may be used for any non-forest purpose.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/aravalli-encroachments-on-25-acres-under-lens-drone-survey-to-be-completed-this-week-101630864664903.html

05-09-2021||Mumbai||Electric Vehicles: Push for courses and research in India||Amid policy push for electric vehicles (EV) from both Central and state governments, educational institutes are now setting up research centres and offering courses to bridge the skill gap in the sector. In July, several Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) as well as the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru launched new courses on EVs and renewable energy, design for Internet of things (IoT), business and sustainable development through the National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL), a joint initiative of IITs and IISc. The courses, taught by faculty from IITs and IISc, are free to all and can be accessed through the Swayam (Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds) platform of the Centre.The demand for EVs continues to grow in India and is driven by several major policy pushes and incentives from the Central and state governments. The Maharashtra government introduced an EV Policy in July, aiming at 10% of all newly registered vehicles in its major cities to be EVs. The state plans to incentivise to generate demand for EVs and also provide incentives for production of EVs. Meanwhile, central planning authority NITI Aayog intends that 80% of all two- and three-wheelers, 40% of buses and 30-70% of cars be EVs by 2030. Maharashtra environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray said, “The state is readying itself with blistering pace to transition towards green mobility solutions and EV will play an important role in getting us to 100% green transit systems. The EV Policy looks not only at demand and supply side stimulus but also at contemporary practices such as the zero emission vehicles (ZEV) programme. We also hope to create an ecosystem of clean energy production along with EV.” This drive for EVs has created a demand for a talent pool adept in the latest technologies in the sector. “[There is a demand for] Courses which can help learners to understand the urgency of climate change and its mitigation potential via clean mobility,” said Sahil Bhandare, climate fellow, EV Policy, ministry of environment and climate change, Maharashtra.To address this demand, institutes are offering cutting-edge courses in subjects relevant to the EV sector such as energy storage and monitoring, automotive health monitoring and diagnostics among others.In 2019, IIT-Delhi set up a Centre for Automotive Research and Tribology (Cart) to promote interdisciplinary research in EVs, energy storage and other relevant areas, said the institute’s director V Ramgopal Rao. Cart offers postgraduate programmes and also facilitates networking and collaboration among various industries, research labs and universities in India and abroad to carry out research in the area of automotive research and tribology (wear and friction).An executive programme in EV is in the works at IIT-Bombay, said Sidhhartha Ghosh, professor-in-charge, continuing education programme of the institute. “Our EV course is a certificate programme in Power Electronics and Motors for EVs. This course contains selected topics in the areas of electromagnetics, thermal and power electronics, mechanical and material selections, algorithms for motor design, inverter design and motor control that help in a system-level modelling. The course is being offered to equip learners with state-of-the-art technologies in the applied and integrated field of electric vehicles,” said Ghosh, adding that the course can be taken by graduates and graduating students of electrical or electronics engineering and related fields.Many traditional automotive companies are looking forward to training their existing engineers in the EV field, added Ghosh. “EV is a rapidly growing field where the demand from environmental concerns and government thrust are much higher than the requisite integrated skill set currently available in electrical, mechanical and electronics engineering sector. IIT-B is known for offering courses that are contemporary, experiential and on the cutting edge of technology. We are well placed to offer capacity building in the integrated and interdisciplinary technological field of EV,” he said.According to Saurabh Jain, research and public policy secretary (private) to Thackeray, institutions are following the lead and adapting to the growing needs of the sector. “The government has already incentivised opening up of research and development centres. Charging stations is a big area of interest as well as fast charging, standardisation of charging units, solar-powered charging infrastructure for an end-to-end clean ecosystem. ZEV is the future and we’re cooperating with governments, who’re already running the ZEV programme. Software and hardware on EVs and its charging units will require a lot of innovation if we are to enable EVs without range anxiety,” said Jain. Bhandare added, “Industries and academia can work in synergy to develop a plan which can be implemented in order to promote clean mobility. Industries can help the academia to develop a potential talent pool.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/electric-vehicles-push-for-courses-and-research-in-india-101630864601529.html
05-09-2021||Chandigarh||Canine threat: Punjab reported 14 dog bite cases every hour till July this year||Punjab has witnessed 14 dog bite cases on an average each hour in the past seven month, a situation termed serious by the health authorities. According to the State Rabies Control Programme (SRCP) data, a total of 72,414 dog bite cases were reported from 22 districts of the state till July. The SRCP authorities say as the August data is being complied.According to the SRCP data, Jalandhar saw 14,390 dog bite cases, or 68 cases per day, the highest in the state, followed by Ludhiana (8,000), Hoshiarpur (5,486), Patiala (5,484) and Sangrur (4,345), from January till July. Veterinarians say stray dogs are the main contributors while in numerous cases, patients complain of bites by pets. SRCP programme officer Dr Preeti Thaware said the data suggests that stray dog menace has grown in the past years.The state reported 1.1 lakh dog bite cases last year as against 1 lakh in 2017. The number was 1.34 lakh in 2019 and 1.14 lakh in 2018. “Owing to Covid-19 outbreak, fewer people were venturing out thus a marginal decrease in dog bite incidents was seen since last year. But the ground reality is the stray dogs are posing a serious threat to the human population,” said Dr Thaware.There is no official data indicating the fatality caused by dog bites.“Most of the patients abide by strict schedule of the four-vaccine dose necessary programme that is provided free of cost. If vaccines are not taken on the prescribed dates, a patient will have to repeat the cycle and it may cause unwanted health conditions,” she added.Animal rights activist from Ludhiana and former member of the Animal Welfare Board of India Dr Sandeep Jain said dogs become aggressive during monsoon, which is the mating season, and attack people due to excess body heat. “But sterilisation can reduce their aggressiveness as it brings down the hormone level. Sterilising bitches also can prevent them from many contracting diseases and increase their life span. The community should be educated about the general behaviour of canines to minimise dog attacks,” he added.Officials said a state panel regularly monitors and execute an organised anti-rabies programme.In the latest communication issued on September 1, the director, local bodies, has asked the municipal commissioners and additional deputy commissioners to ensure that organisations engaged in the animal birth control and anti-rabies programmes are in accordance with the norms fixed by the Animal Welfare Board of India.“District administration and the local bodies conduct dog sterilisation, but Covid-19 outbreak hindered the exercise since last year. Various districts are working to initiate sterilisation programme,” said an official of animal husbandry department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/canine-threat-punjab-reported-14-dog-bite-cases-every-hour-till-july-this-year-101630864598849.html

05-09-2021||Mumbai||Rashmi Shukla not named in FIR on leak of papers on cop postings: Mumbai Police||Mumbai Police, in an affidavit filed in the Bombay high court (HC), has informed that former commissioner of intelligence Rashmi Shukla has not been named in the first information report (FIR) related to data theft and leakage of confidential documents on the issue of transfers and postings of police officers in the state and hence, her petition seeking the quashing of FIR should be dismissed. The affidavit filed in response to Shukla’s petition stated: “The FIR is registered against unknown person and therefore, as the petitioner (Shukla) is not an accused in it, the petitioner has no locus to file the petition seeking its quashing.” During an earlier hearing of Shukla’s petition, senior advocate Darius Khambata – who represented Mumbai Police – made similar submissions, but had sought time to file a written reply to the petition. Khambata had argued that the data theft and the leaked documents were admittedly confidential and such documents coming into public domain was a serious offence, which had to be investigated. Referring to the FIR, the affidavit stated that the complaint was limited to sensitive and confidential information being leaked in an unauthorised manner to third parties from the state intelligence department (SID) and did not have any bearing on the content of the documents. In light of this, the affidavit stated that Shukla has sought quashing of the FIR on the basis that she has been purportedly falsely implicated in the case, while it is registered against unknown persons. The affidavit added that Shukla was issued notice merely to provide facts/ information in the investigation of the offences in the FIR and it did not mean that she was implicated in the case. The affidavit concluded that the allegation by Shukla that the FIR has been filed as an act of vendetta by the Maharashtra government is also erroneous and hence, her petition was not maintainable and should be dismissed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rashmi-shukla-not-named-in-fir-on-leak-of-papers-on-cop-postings-mumbai-police-101630864118120.html

05-09-2021||Mumbai||Chances of obesity among car users 1.14 times higher than walkers, reveals IIT-B study||A person, who prefers travelling by cab or car, is 1.14 times more likely to become obese than one who prefers to walk, finds a recent study by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B). The study, published in the September volume of the Journal of Health and Transport, found that across all age groups, walking reduces the chances of becoming overweight or obese significantly over those who prefer to take cars, three-wheelers, motorised two-wheelers and public transport. Gopal Patil, professor and Gajanand Sharma, a PhD student, both from the department of civil engineering at IIT-B, calculated the odds ratio or the statistical association between modes of transport and obesity across four age groups— up to 30 years, 30 to 50 years, 50 to 65 years and 65 and above. They found that the odds ratio or chances of being obese were the lowest across all age groups for those who preferred walking as their primary means of transport. “Usage of a walk and public transport not only lead to sustainability in the transportation system but also helps promote the health wellbeing of the society. Thus the policymakers need to invest in these active modes of transportation and promote their usage. In India, leisure-time physical activities are relatively less, compared to the developed nations. Thus, commuters should use the active modes of transportation whenever feasible. This helps in increasing their physical activity level and enhances their health wellbeing,” said Patil.The researchers collected data from 5,447 households in Navi Mumbai, of which they analysed data for 4,253 respondents. Nearly 40% of the respondents fell in the category of overweight/obesity. The data set observed an equal proportion of low-income and middle-income groups. Almost 53% of the respondents did not own a car and about 32% used motorised two-wheelers as the primary mode of travel. Only 6% used three-wheelers as the primary mode of transport. For 14.1% of the respondents, walking was the primary travel mode. Overweight/obesity was determined using the body mass index (BMI) value of respondents. The World Health Organisation defines obesity as a BMI over 25. In July, a WHO study revealed that worldwide obesity had tripled since 1975. In 2019, an estimated 38.2 million children under the age of five years were overweight or obese, WHO said. “Once considered a high-income country problem, overweight and obesity are now on the rise in low and middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings,” WHO had said. Shankar Das, professor and dean, School of Health Systems Studies at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, who was not a part of the study said, “Obesity is one of the rising public health issues as obesity and excess weight increases the risk of severe illness and compounds the existing health concerns. The trend analysis of recent data confirms that the prevalence of overweight and obesity in India is climbing rapidly than the world average. However, this significant issue does not find an adequate place in our health and nutrition policies.” Apart from travel patterns, researchers also analysed the socio-economic characteristics of the respondent. Monthly household income, education level, and age are used as variables in the analysis. They also measured the built environment within walking proximity and traffic analysis zone. “The study concludes that socio-economic characteristics such as income, education, and age influence BMI levels in society. Persons with high income and higher education levels have better access to higher economic, social, and environmental opportunities (e.g. gym, park, sports facilities, proper diet, awareness, and neighbourhood), making them less likely to become obese/overweight. In general, it is found that the chances of getting overweight/obese increase with age for all socio-economic groups. The built environment around an individual’s place of residence plays a crucial role in physical wellbeing parameters. The urban forms with appropriate population density coupled with a high walkable environment can reduce overweight/obesity chances. A neighbourhood with mixed land use can help reduce overweight/obesity,” Patil said.Interestingly, as the travel time by walk increases by 10 minutes, the change in the probability of being overweight/obese decreases for all age groups. “This shows an interesting pattern and can lead us to conclude that, as age increases, the odds of being overweight/obese are dominated by walking trips. This means that even though age has an increasing impact on overweight/obesity, this increasing effect can be controlled by investing more time on walking trips,” the study said. “I believe the prevalence and risk of obesity in India can be explained by socio-demographic factors such as gender, age, profession, geographical environment, socio-economic status, etc. The prevention and control of obesity-related diseases are critical public health and developmental challenges due to diminished economic productivity, rising healthcare expenditures and financial risks. Additionally, the coronavirus crisis has made the rift alarmingly evident in the country’s health system. The spread of adult and childhood obesity could increase the burden on our already burdened health care infrastructure,” said Das.“In recent times most Mumbaiites are familiar with healthy lifestyles, but changing behaviour is complicated and complex, not a simple and linear process because it requires somebody to disrupt a regular and habitual behaviour. However, we need a robust health action plan under effective leadership and evidence-based action on prevention, control, and interventions. Multiple surveillance approaches are necessary to collect comprehensive information for effective obesity-related diseases surveillance and cost-effective interventions. In addition, at the health systems and community level robust interventions may be launched with a special focus on systematic behaviour change communication, healthy lifestyle awareness, individual risk assessment/counselling and accessible NCD clinics may go a long way to prevent and control the burgeoning obesity-related health problems,” Das said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/chances-of-obesity-among-car-users-1-14-times-higher-than-walkers-reveals-iit-b-study-101630862017728.html

They have pointed out that online education is difficult for these children and a proper education is more like therapy for them. Since the onset of the pandemic, all academic calendars have collapsed and schools have not been able to function regularly.Sadhana Godbole, managing director of the Prasanna Autism Centre, said, “It has been almost 17 months since proper education of these specially abled children has come to a halt. We have autistic children at our centre and online education is not a viable option for them. These children are benefitted from in-person interaction. There has been a lot of talk about reopening regular schools but no attention has been given to the training and education of specially abled children. Their education is like therapy for them. Policymakers should give attention to this matter. We have been asking permission to conduct offline sessions with a limited number of students in class. A discussion in this matter at least should be started.”Radiya Gohil, founder-trustee of Prayatna Foundation, an organisation that provides multi-faceted education to students with Down’s Syndrome, cerebral palsy, autism, ADHD, De Lange Syndrome, Fragile X Syndrome and learning disabilities, too, said that in-person interaction is crucial for these children. “It is essential because online learning limits us in many ways. Also, parents are finding it really tough now to deal with behaviour issues and frustrations that have developed in students,” she said.According to experts however, while online education may not be an entirely suitable option, it helps to keep students and teachers in contact. Mridula Das, founder-trustee of Prayatna Foundation, said, “The response to online sessions has been good. Students were really happy to see their teachers and communicate with them. We have also facilitated online classes for some of our needy students by providing them with tabs, phones and data plans.”Meanwhile, state education department officials said that efforts are being taken to continue the education of students with special needs but the decision to reopen schools is yet to be taken. Dr Kamaladevi Awate, deputy director of the State Council of Educational Research & Training (SCERT), said, “We have created special online learning material for such students. Our officials have conducted meetings with the parents to inform them about special activities that are necessary for these students to carry out so that they can conduct such activities at home. We have provided this material to various schools and NGOs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-schools-for-specially-abled-want-policy-framework-to-resume-offline-education-101630860336789.html

According to Jagtap, he makes Ganesha idols from cow dung and when these idols are put in a tub filled with water at the time of immersion, it dissolves and this mixture can be used for planting saplings. The cow dung powder is mixed with soil and tamarind powder to give shape and structure to the idols, and coconut oil for a final finishing. Jagtap said, “Each idol is 22.86 cm long and weighs about 700gm, and it takes two hours to shape and sculpt an idol, in which my colleagues helps me.” Jagtap added, “This is our first attempt, so our goal this year is to only produce 100 idols, of which 10 have already been produced. These eco-friendly idols are provided with the service of home delivery by post/courier and are priced at only Rs500 to Rs600.” Keeping Covid in mind, Jagtap and his group have taken all the orders through mobile phones and security precautions will also be taken for delivery. Jagtap (25) has a postgraduate degree in political science and has been trained to make products from cow at Swanand Govigyan, Nagpur. Idols are traditionally made from plaster of paris (white chalk, also used as cement) which is inherently non-biodegradable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/purandar-idol-maker-is-dung-ho-about-eco-friendly-idols-101630859376687.html
05-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s monsoon trend this year is ‘peculiar’: IMD scientist||As Delhi is likely to witness more rainfall in the coming days, a scientist of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has termed this year’s monsoon trend in the national capital as ‘peculiar’.Talking to news agency ANI, Dr RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD, said, “In June, there was a rainfall deficit. However, in July it was comparatively more. In August, it reduced. But in September, we witnessed record-breaking rainfall [so far].”Delhi has already (till September 4) received 79 per cent surplus rain as against the normal monsoon rain of 552.6mm, IMD data showed. Before 2021, Delhi had received severe rainfall in 2018 and 2013 with 770.6mm and 876mm, respectively. The highest rainfall activity witnessed by the national capital was in 2010 when it received 1031.5mm rain. However, the catch is these data were recorded between June 1 and September 30 and, this year, Delhi has already received 988.4mm rain.Jenamani, however, said that in 2010, the rainfall was much more than 2021’s record rainfall activity. “If we consider rainfall after 2011, 2021 had the highest rainfall. Perhaps, September is yet to end. We are not seeing monsoon withdrawal in the near future,” he told ANI.Watch | Short intense rain spells is the new Normal Monsoon: What it meansHe also pointed out that the effects of climate change are the reason behind instances of “intense and heavy rainfall in a short span of time” seeing a rise. “This year, this trend is clearly visible in Delhi. [The] maximum rainfall of this season has been contributed by intense rain spells,” Jenamani said.Meanwhile, he predicted that a light spell of rain will commence in the national capital on the morning of September 6 or 7. The IMD scientist, however, informed that the spell will not be a downpour that was seen on September 1 and 2, and will instead be “light showers.” “On September 7 and 8, moderate rainfall has been predicted. This trend will continue till September 9,” Jenamani added to ANI.The scientist said that a new rain spell will begin on September 10, which may have heavy rainfall. He added that there is no orange alert issued in the national capital till September 9 and that drizzling will continue with no increase in the temperatures.According to IMD data, Delhi had a rainfall deficit of 46 per cent till July 16. But, a series of heavy spells of rain in July caused the monthly rainfall activity to end at a surplus of 141 per cent. This continued in August where rainfall shifted between a monthly deficit of 60 per cent to a surplus of 11 per cent – only to end with a deficit of 13 per cent. Therefore, in August, Delhi received 214.5mm of rainfall as opposed to the 247.7mm it typically sees in a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-monsoon-trend-this-year-is-peculiar-imd-scientist-101630858727115.html

The cyber team faces challenges in tracing fraudsters who are usually based in remote areas of other states and use bank accounts and SIM cards procured through fake documents. Moreover, the uncooperative attitude of bank authorities and network service providers makes their work more challenging and difficult, they say. It is worth mentioning that in the past few months, teams of cyber police station and cyber cell of Prayagraj police have succeeded in busting many gangs of fraudsters and also managed to recover the lost cash of complainants within 24 hours of the crime. They are also launching campaigns through social media and other means to create awareness among people to control cyber crimes. SHO, cyber police station inspector Rajeev Tiwari said 35 cases of cyber frauds had been lodged since the police station came into existence, including one case that was transferred from another police station. In four of the cases, charge sheet had been filed in the court while final report had been submitted in one case. Almost all of the lost cash in four charge -sheeted cases had been recovered from the fraudsters and it had also been returned to fraud victims in many other cases of cyber crimes. In total, cash around ₹45 lakh had been recovered from cyber fraudsters and ggiven back to the complainants, Tiwari added. A cyber police station official said although the cases of cyber crimes had been increasing, the team had to work with limited resources and often faced challenges due to non-cooperative attitude of banks and network service providers. “Cyber fraudsters use forged Aadhar cards, PAN cards and other documents for opening bank accounts and obtaining SIM cards. The banks and network service providers carry out OTP based verification instead of conducting physical or manual verification of the documents submitted. As the bank account used by fraudsters is opened on forged documents it becomes difficult to trace them. Moreover, the online fraudsters use fake documents for taking SIM cards which they use for a short period of time. Once the SIM card is thrown away, it becomes a difficult task to trace their location through electronic surveillance and arrest them,” the official shared. He said that bank officials took too much time in providing details of bank accounts used by cyber fraudsters. On an average, 10 days were taken to trace bank account of a fraudster opened on forged documents and freezing it. In case of cash withdrawn by fraudsters through ATM, banks also took time in providing CCTV footage which gave advantage to the culprits. In some cases footage was lost as banks deleted it after 60 days. The cyber police had also requested the court to issue guidelines to banks to provide required data to police within 24 to 48 hours of the request, the official added. Another cyber cell police official said that gangs involved in online frauds usually operated from other states, including Jharkhand, West Bengal, Delhi, Maharashtra and Gujarat and lured bank customers through SMS and social media platforms. While police in Mumbai, Gujarat and some other states were cooperative, cops in Jharkhand and West Bengal were often reluctant in providing necessary help, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/forged-papers-uncooperative-banks-cyber-police-face-hurdles-galore-101630859137284.html

05-09-2021||Patna||Covid vaccination of 12-17 year olds with comorbidities to begin from Oct||Covid-19 vaccination of children with comorbidities in the 12-17 years age group will begin in October, Dr NK Arora, chairman of the Covid-19 working group of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, said on Sunday. “We are prioritising children with comorbidities initially between 12 and 17 years to administer the Covid-19 vaccines when we begin their inoculation in October,” said Dr Arora, who was in Patna to deliver the fourth Dr CP Thakur oration at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), an autonomous medical college of the state government on pattern of AIIMS.He said vaccination of children below 12 years of age was expected to begin in the first quarter of next year. The results of vaccine trials for the younger children are expected by November. “India has 44 crore population below the age of 18 years of which 12crore are in the 12-17 years age group. This is a huge dimension. So, we will initially target children with co-morbidities even when we begin inoculating those below 12 years of age most likely in the first quarter of 2022. The country will begin vaccinating healthy children once the 94-crore adult population has been vaccinated,” he added. Dr Arora sounded a note of caution when he said the third wave of the pandemic was possible only if we lower our guards and do not follow Covid appropriate behaviour, especially during the coming festive season. “The third wave will be driven by a variant. At the moment, we don’t have a variant of concern. However, it is a community-driven issue. One has to be careful to avoid social and religious gatherings during the coming festive season. The possibility of the next wave will be driven by complacency and lowering of guard by the community on the one side and the administration on the other side. Though 70% of our population is exposed to the virus, 30% is still unexposed, and we still need to be careful,” he added. Dr Arora was averse to the idea of closing schools, as he felt it affected the development of children. He said four vaccines had already been granted emergency use authorisation and five more were in the trial phase. Among them were the messenger RNA vaccine of Gennova and the intranasal vaccine by Bharat Biotech that were in the first phase of the trial. Serum Institute of India (SII)’s Novavax, the Protein Subnit Vaccine by BioE and the BCG Vaccine (repurposing) of SII were in the third phase of the trial. “India will produce 1.8 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the year-end. Its production will increase to 2.5 to 3 billion doses next year,” he added. With 68 crore doses of the vaccine already administered, Dr Arora said India hoped to give another 100-110 crore doses of vaccine in the next four months..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/covid-vaccination-of-12-17-year-olds-with-comorbidities-to-begin-from-oct-101630854338479.html

He said he has started suffering from memory loss due to lacunar infarcts in six major lobes of the brain. The application further states that the urinary tract infection which the 84-year-old suffered from, has also not improved and he requires a hernia operation, all of which would result in further aggravation of his condition if he were asked to surrender to Taloja jail. Rao was granted bail in February and was released in March for a period of six months.The application for an extension, which was scheduled for hearing on Friday, September 3 before the bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, could not be heard due to a paucity of time. Senior advocate Anand Grover for Rao had sought an urgent hearing as the bail period was expiring on September 5 and Rao had to surrender to Taloja prison. After the National Investigation Agency (NIA) gave an oral assurance that they would not take coercive action the court had posted the hearing to Monday.The application for extension states that Rao was living with his wife Pendyala Hemlatha at a rented house in Malad (East) since he was released on bail on March 6 and had been reporting to Kurar police station through WhatsApp calling as directed by the HC in its bail order.The application states that Rao had not spoken to the media and has not made contact with anyone in India or abroad in the said period and only his daughters and nephew have visited and stayed with them for a short duration during the past six months.Referring to Rao’s medical condition, the application states that he has been going for regular medical check-ups to Nanavati Hospital where he had been shifted for the purpose of treatment prior to getting bail based on the HC order. The application states that Rao has been having bouts of headaches since his release and the neurologists at Nanavati Hospital suspect it to be a neurological problem that needs further investigation and constant supervision.Medical reports that show that Rao has suffered dead brain tissue which affects his intelligence as well as sensory and motor functions of the body have also been placed on record to show that Rao’s brain has shrunk. The application also states that Rao faces vision problems and needs cataract operation in both eyes. A report shows that he has suffered from an umbilical hernia that requires surgery and has also be attached to the application.In light of all the above problems and coupled with the urinary tract infection which Rao suffered while he was in Taloja jail, the application states that he should be granted an extension of six months to undergo the said surgeries and treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-varavara-rao-seeks-6-month-extension-of-bail-due-to-health-issues-101630852296823.html

05-09-2021||Pune||Pune Police on lookout for man in 18-acre Hadapsar forest land grab case||The vigilance cell of the Pune forest department has foiled an attempt to grab 18 acres of prime forest land near Hadapsar. The land is estimated to cost ₹200 crore as per the prevailing market rate, said, officials.According to the forest department, the accused Popat Pandurang Shitkal had allegedly got his name registered on the 7/12 extract by forging the signature of state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president and former minister Chandrakant Patil.The forest department in its petition pointed out that the accused had shown an 18-acre plot on survey No. 62 in Hadapsar as his private land which is, in fact, forest land. He unsuccessfully tried to register the said plot in his name and had appealed to the revenue officials. However, the officials had quashed the petition. Thereafter he went to High Court wherein the court directed the state government to take an appropriate decision.Meanwhile, his application before the revenue department of the government was rejected by the district collector and the divisional commissioner.He then approached revenue minister Patil in 2018 who also directed that his application be rejected. But he allegedly forged Patil’s signature and issued a fraudulent gazette notification of transferring the land parcel in his name. The officials at the land records department found it to be bonafide and correct, so they initiated the process of registering his name on the 7/12 extract.Later, the case was transferred to the forest department where deputy forest officer Rahul Patil gathered information regarding it and sought all the paper.Since it was forest land, it cannot be transferred to a private person as was the conclusion of the forest department report prepared under Patil’s supervision.Trupti Kolte, tehsildar, Haveli, who lodged the official complaint with the police, said “ The land documents furnished by the order was issued by the minister on January 31, 2018, and we, therefore, had transferred the forest land in his name. The man had produced 15 copies of the order, which he claimed was issued by the minister for deforestation or de-reserving of the forest land situated in Hadapsar.”“When I saw the order, I also believed that it was issued by the minister because it was per the government style with clarity and precision. The man had also submitted High Court citations, document proof and other papers. We issued a 7X12 extract, which gave ownership of the land to the individual last month,” she said.Range forest officer MJ Sanas who conducted the inquiry into the case, said, “The 18-acre forest land is in the possession of the forest department. In 2015, we put up fencing around the land and looked after its security.”“Before 1980, the government had transferred some land in the name of those who had been tilling it for years or those who had been evicted for construction of dams and other projects. However, after 1980, the rules have become stringent and transfer of forest land is not easy,” he said.“We informed the district collector that the said belonged to the forest department and has not been de-reserved by the government and accordingly legal action was initiated,” he said.Inspector Sheehari Bahirat, of Khadak police station, said, “We had lodged a case under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which includes cheating and forgery. A team has been sent to track the accused and a probe is on in the case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-police-on-lookout-for-man-in-18-acre-hadapsar-forest-land-grab-case-101630843655835.html
05-09-2021||Mumbai||Visually challenged in Thane badly hit during pandemic||Pinky Gavit, 29, a visually-challenged resident of Vangani, was in her seventh month of pregnancy when the lockdown set in last year. She sold small trinkets on local trains with her husband before the pandemic and the couple made enough for survival.However, three months into lockdown, when she delivered a baby, the couple could hardly manage one square meal a day. With the suspension of local trains, the couple had no job and her husband had to eat just once in two days to ensure she and the baby had enough.Like Gavit, hundreds of visually-challenged residents of Thane barely managed to make ends meet since the pandemic set in. According to the 2011 population census, Thane district rural and urban areas have 34,361 visually-challenged people. According to National Association For the Blind (NAB) India, in Thane district, 75% of the visually-challenged population are below the poverty line. Most of those in the cities have settled in Vangani and Ambernath areas due to low rentals. More than 200 families here are without a job in the pandemic.Gavit said, “People were wary of us as all our functioning is through physical contact, so many believe we are a potential source of the spread of Covid. When I was in labour, no one helped us to reach the hospital and I had to walk for two kilometres when finally the cops helped us. We do get help from NGOs but it is insufficient for survival.”Deputy director of the employment department of NAB, Arvind Narvekar, said, “More than 75% of the visually-challenged population are poor. They depend on hawking on trains and streets or are daily wagers. Not all of them could be educated, so when the trains were stopped in the lockdown, these people found it difficult to survive. They are still not allowed to take the train as not all of them are fully vaccinated.”Narvekar claimed that those who worked in factories or private establishments too lost jobs as most people believed the visually-challenged might not be able to maintain low contact at work places. Another social worker from NAB added, “The visually-challenged have to go about their work through physical contact. People do not trust them. Most call centre employees also lost their jobs in a similar way. A few who worked in orchestras or cultural programmes too had to shut shop in the pandemic.”NAB earlier used to take workshops where these people could earn some living. However, they were also stopped in the lockdown. NAB and other social workers were providing them groceries monthly, but now all of them are facing trouble after the second wave while the government has not announced anything for them, making it difficult for them to survive.Many residing in Thane have migrated from their villages in search of a job. However, they are barely managing the rent. A NAB volunteer working in Thane said, “People do not even help them cross roads with all the misconceptions in the early pandemic. They had to struggle through every day, they had no money to buy smart phones for the children or to pay electricity bills. The money from government schemes too got delayed as offices were shut.” Sandip Bilewar, 23, a physiotherapist from Ambernath, is partially blind and got a job as a physiotherapist before the lockdown in a Ghatkopar-based hospital. However, he lost it during the lockdown and is going from pillar to post in search of a job.“I am staying in a hostel in Ambernath and have approached many hospitals and the government for a job. However, no one is ready to give me an opportunity. I used to visit houses of people but now no one trusts us as they thought we cannot maintain hygiene and will spread Covid. I sent request letters to health ministers, MLAs, MPs to hire me at any Covid hospital but no one helped. Right now, I am practicing my physiotherapy on my friends and some blind families who need help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/visually-challenged-in-thane-badly-hit-during-pandemic-101630842997497.html

Bihar deputy chief minister Renu Devi on Saturday said the state government had requested the Centre for a first-hand assessment of the flood situation, which has affected more than half the state by destroying buildings, crops, roads, canals and embankments and disrupting train movement. According to officials aware of the developments, the Bihar government may seek Central assistance of ₹5000 crore and more due to the magnitude of devastation as per preliminary estimates. “The real magnitude will unfold once the water recedes. This time rivers have been in spate for a much longer time. At present, the main focus of the state government is immediate relief and rehabilitation,” they said, adding that the Centre should be generous in helping a financially poor state like Bihar fight the twin scourge of Covid and floods for the second year in succession. According to preliminary estimates, 53 persons have died and 2 million people, spread across 1652 villages in 83 blocks of 16 districts, have been affected by this year’s floods while 219,000 residents have been evacuated. According to Bihar government’s disaster management department’s data, ₹6000 each has been distributed among 795,538 families so far, entailing an expenditure of ₹477.32 crore. A rough estimation suggested that standing crops on more than 400,000 hectares of land were inundated. Extensive damage to flood-protection infrastructure including embankments has also been reported due to heavy discharge of water, which accentuated the problem further, owing to heavy silting in the state rivers, including the Ganga. The same issue was raised with the Central team after the 2016 floods. Earlier, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had requested that a team of experts be sent to make an on-the-spot assessment of the cause of floods to help find a permanent remedy to Bihar’s chronic problem. The main purpose of the team’s visit was to look into heavy siltation in the stretch of Ganga river in the state, a problem the chief minister has consistently attributed to Farakka barrage. The team had gone up to Farakka to examine the situation in the Ganga basin to submit its report, but Bihar’s flood woes have continued. Kumar had then also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the demand for review of the need for Farakka barrage and a national silt management policy. He has been in favour of dismantling the Farakka barrage. Though floods are a chronic problem in Bihar, the situation aggravated in 2016 and again this year after the Ganga river water level reached unprecedented level, playing havoc in several areas. Even Patna was under a serious threat of floods at one point. Embankments have been damaged on a stretch of 753 kms, zamindari bandhs—centuries old embankments erected by big landlords and royal courts to protect against floods-- have been damaged on a stretch of 84 kms, while spurs, studs etc. have got damaged on a stretch 157 kms, requiring nearly ₹1500 crore for repairs and reconstruction, as per state disaster relief fund (SDRF) norms. “I also visited flood-hit Khagaria on Saturday and saw that the devastation caused by floods was massive, but the good thing is that people have got timely relief and support. The government’s preparations before the floods have come handy in ensuring quick relief and rescue of the needy population,” said Renu Devi. She said the Central team will also visit some places. “We have already sent a preliminary assessment of the damages to the Centre. As water recedes, more assessment will be done,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/central-team-to-assess-flood-damages-in-bihar-state-seeks-adequate-assistance-101630826495163.html

The writer has also humiliated crores of people across the world who follow their ideology. "Before making these remarks, he should have thought that people with the same ideology are running the government now and are fulfilling raj dharma. If their ideology was Talibani, would he have been able to make these remarks? This shows how hollow his statements are," Kadam, who represents Kadam Ghatkopar West in the Maharashtra assembly, said in a video message. "We will not allow any of his films to run in this land of Ma Bharti till he apologises with folded hands to the functionaries of the Sangh who have dedicated their lives to the nation," he also warned.#संघ तथा #विश्वहिंदूपरिषद के करोडों कार्यकर्ताओ की, जब तक हाथ जोड़कर #जावेदअख्तर माफी नही मांगते. तब तक उनकी तथा उनके परिवार की कोई भी #फिल्म इस #माभारती के भूमि पर नहीं चलेगी. pic.twitter.com/ahWgVQWuvHKadam has said he will also protest against Javed Akhtar over his statement comparing Taliban and RSS and file a police complaint against him on Sunday.Ashutosh J Dubey, who said on Twitter that he is the legal advisor to the BJP’s Maharastra unit, has filed a complaint against Javed Akhtar with the Mumbai Police. “I have filed the complaint against #JavedAkhtar with the @MumbaiPolice for intentionally outranging to the RSS, VHP, and Bajrang Dal.

"Of course, the Taliban is barbaric, and their actions are reprehensible, but those supporting the RSS, VHP and Bajrang Dal are all the same," he added.He also said that he has “total faith in the basic sensibility of an average Indian.” “The majority of this nation is extremely decent and tolerant.

Currently, around 500 random antigen tests are being conducted at railway stations. The corporation plans to conduct similar random tests at busy markets, pandals and immersion sites as well. Pramod Patil, medical health officer, NMMC, said, “A total of 7,000 Rapid Antigen Tests and around 2,000 RT-PCR tests are conducted daily. This year during the festival, we have to fight Malaria, Dengue as well as Covid-19. So along with making sure that the Covid-19 norms are followed, we also need to ensure preventive measures for dengue and malaria. Regular checking of stagnant water and fogging at the pandal areas also needs to be done.” Depending on the availability of vaccines, the corporation also plans to have vaccination drive at the pandals. “If there is enough supply, we will have vaccination drives at whichever pandals possible. We will also be putting up hoardings and signages regarding Covid-19 at the pandals. We had a joint meeting with the police wherein we have informed them as well about the actions they should take against people not following the Covid-19 norms,” Assistant Municipal Commissioner Sanjay Kakade said. The Corporation also plans to have an arrangement wherein the residents not willing to step out for immersion can handover the idol to the designated persons visiting their area and they would further immerse it. The artificial ponds which were 132 last year have been increased to 156 this year in order to make sure that there is not much crowding at one place. There have been 132 applications for the pandals this year of which 120 were granted permission while there were 90 applications last year of which 84 were granted permission. “Every pandal should use only the one fourth of the road and there should be area left for the people to travel. The pandals should not be blocking any footpath or roadway. Such applications which can create blockage to the movement of public, have been rejected and in some cases, people have made double applications thinking that if one is rejected, another might be considered,” an official from NMMC said. Meanwhile, the cases of not wearing masks and not maintaining social distancing have also increased, ahead of the festival. In the month of August, around 1272 people were fined for not wearing masks and a total of ₹6.36 lakh was collected, 2075 were fined for not maintaining social distancing and fined ₹4.15 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-to-increase-covid-19-testing-ahead-of-festive-season-101630789285245.html
05-09-2021||Patna||Bihar floods latest flashpoint in JD(U)-BJP ties||Flooding in various parts of Bihar threatens to emerge as the latest flashpoint between the Janata Dal (United) and the Bharatiya Janata Party, the coalition partners in the state, with the Bihar administration planning to knock on the Centre’s doors again to seek implementation of a slew of measures, including framing a national silting policy and re-visiting the design of the Farakka barrage, which the state blames for annual floods.According to people aware of the details, the Bihar administration will take up the flooding issue with the Union government over the coming week.“On several occasions in the past few years, the state government has brought to the notice of the Centre how the Farakka barrage has become a reason for floods in the state, especially during the monsoon. The barrage is not designed to cope with the quantum of water that is now being released from its gates and there is no real-time data available for the same,” said a functionary aware of the details.The barrage with 109 gates across the Ganga in Murshidabad district of West Bengal was constructed in 1961 and completed nearly a decade later.Bihar’s minister for water resources Sanjay Kumar Jha told HT that he is hopeful the Centre would act on suggestions made by the state government. “Since 2017 we have drawn attention to certain issues that need to be addressed and we are hopeful that the government will act fast on these including re-visiting the design of the barrage,” he said.Heavy silting for one has been red flagged as a major cause of concern. The state blames the Centre’s lack of policy for not carrying out routing de-silting exercises that could prevent the annual loss of lives and property attributed to the flooding. The functionary said it is estimated that the Ganga carries a silt load of 736MT annually, of which about 328MT gets deposited in the upstream of Farakka barrage. “We had petitioned the Centre to take action for the silt deposition caused by rivers flowing in north Bihar from Nepal as well as on account of Farakka barrage on several occasions in the past… Because of siltation, frequent submergence of Patna and Bhagalpur are witnessed year after year,” the functionary said.The state blames massive shifting of river over the years because of siltation, saying even minimal discharge makes the water touch the danger level posing a threat to cities settled on its banks.The functionary said, “The barrage was meant to release water from the Padma and the Brahmaputra into the Hooghly but has ended up increasing the silt in the river.” The functionary added the barrage was designed for a discharge of 2.7 maillion cusecs while the amount of water that is currently released is significantly higher than that. “In 2021, the quantum of water released was nearly 32 lakh (3.2 million) cusec. This design limitation results in Heavy siltation and flooding in the upstream,” the functionary explained.The state has also flagged that many of the 109 gates remain closed during the peak flood season, pointing out that the gate operation is still not fully automated. It has also conveyed to the Centre that the barrage structure does not provide for adequate passage of silt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-floods-latest-flashpoint-in-jd-u-bjp-ties-101630787612460.html

The panel was constituted after a majority of the PU teaching departments expressed reservations regarding the use of a blended mode of teaching and learning. The panel will prepare a consolidated reply, which will be sent to the UGC.The questionnaires will be framed because feedback given by the departments was not uniform. Now, the departments will be asked to give a road map for the implementation of the blended learning proposal by answering specific questions. The questions may touch upon the extent to which the proposal can be implemented, courses to be included and infrastructure needs.“The university should implement the blended learning concept to the possible extent, which can be reviewed after some time,” said a committee member on the condition of anonymity. It was also discussed during the meeting that the varsity should carry out groundwork on the proposal, which will prove beneficial during the next visit of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council.“It is likely that some members from colleges may attend the next meeting of the panel,” said another member.Sub-committee formedA sub-committee has also been formed to study the concept note given by the UGC in May. The sub-committee will then give a presentation to the panel in the next meeting.The UGC in May had said that institutes will be allowed to teach up to 40% of each course, other than Swayam courses, online and the remaining 60% syllabus could be taught offline.Of the 49 PU departments that submitted their suggestions to the varsity, nearly 30 had either not favoured the move or sought a partial implementation of the blended mode proposal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/blended-learning-now-pu-depts-to-get-feedback-questionnaires-101630785445097.html

The plea will be taken up for hearing on Monday.On August 12, the high court had granted protection from arrest to Saini and directed him to join the probe within seven days.On August 2, the VB registered the case under the Prevention of Corruption Act and criminal conspiracy against the former DGP, along with six others, including public works department executive engineer Nimratdeep Singh and his father Surinderjit Singh Jaspal, who owned a house in Chandigarh’s Sector 20. The agency alleged Saini acquired the said house in a fraudulent deal with fake documents and questionable financial transactions.It says Saini went to the vigilance headquarters on the evening of seventh day when protection was to end and by when offices had closed. It was only to create evidence of him having being gone to join investigation although there was no intention. He tried to handover an application and then got himself photographed so that some evidence of him joining probe could be created, it has submitted, adding that he was to join probe in the Sector 69 office of investigating officer of the vigilance bureau, but chose to visit vigilance headquarters in Sector-68.Saini himself has headed the Punjab vigilance bureau and is well aware of the procedure of joining investigation and that office closes at 5pm. He went there without prior intimation to investigating officer, the plea says, adding that when he was summoned again on August 27 for September 1, he failed and conveyed that he was ill. “The excuse put forth is a blatant lie and an attempt to overreach the process of law and circumvent the orders of high court requiring him to join the probe,” it says, demanding that August 12 order be recalled and protection granted to him withdrawn.On August 18, Saini was arrested in a September 2020 cheating case when he had gone to vigilance office to join the probe in corruption case as directed by high court on August 12. A day later, high court had termed his arrest illegal and ordered his release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/corruption-case-punjab-vigilance-moves-hc-seeking-cancellation-of-bail-to-ex-dgp-saini-101630785324407.html
05-09-2021||Chandigarh||Tricity Buzz: Dharna Point on PU campus||The other day, Google Maps was showing the students’ protest site outside the office of Panjab University (PU) vice-chancellor Raj Kumar with the name: V-C office Dharna Point, Panjab University. PU students are demanding the immediate conduct of polls for their registered graduate constituency and the reopening of the campus for them. The protest entered its 22nd day on Saturday. Students also locked the main entrance of PU’s administrative block to press for their demands. On Wednesday, students heckled the vice-chancellor outside the law auditorium amid the Senate elections. UT reshuffle ruffles feathers A reshuffle of heads of departments was carried out in the Chandigarh administration last week. While most changes like that of the health secretary and the director, education, were on expected lines, the appointment of Debendra Dalai, a senior Indian Forest Service officer, as Citco chairman and secretary, tourism, came as a surprise. Some found the post generally held by an IAS officer go to an IFS official a welcome change, while many, particularly those from Punjab cadre on deputation to the UT, thought it was unfair. Petrol pump staff taken for a ride A smart youngster left petrol pump employees in Mohali stumped on September 3. He got the petrol tank of his SUV topped up and sped away without paying. Rakesh Koundal, an employee at the fuel station, told the police that the youngster asked him to fill the tank, which cost ₹4,878, but as he went near his window to collect the amount, the youngster sped away. A case was registered, and the car registration number was traced but it turned out to be fake. Cop without cap in trouble A Chandigarh Police constable posted at a judge’s residence in Sector 19 was placed under suspension after he was found without the cap on duty. All police personnel on security duty are required to be in full uniform and the cap is an integral part. The suspension came on the complaint of the judge. The constable claimed that he was not wearing the cap as he had a headache. SSP, security wing, Manisha Chaudhary suspended the constable for indiscipline and sent him to the police lines. Residents miss Badnore After former UT administrator and Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore completed his term, several resident welfare associations expressed their gratitude towards him and his service, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. The president of the Chandigarh Traders Association in Sector 17, Kamaljit Singh Panchhi, even wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to extend Badnore’s tenure. That was not to be and Banwari Lal Purohit took charge. Pooling in health resources As medical experts believe that the third wave of the pandemic can affect children, the UT health department has decided to link its paediatric centre at Government Multi-Speciality Hospital (GMSH) in Sector 16 with that of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER). Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services, said, “An IT hub is being set up in Chandigarh for connecting hospitals in the third wave through tele-consultation. Since the government hospitals have limited beds for children, we are linking the paediatric ICUs so that people can easily find a vacant bed in case of an emergency. Also, referral cases can be sent to PGI from other government hospitals.” Inputs by Hillary Victor, Munieshwer A Sagar, Shailee Dogra, Mandeep Narula, Rajanbir Singh and Dar Ovais||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tricity-buzz-dharna-point-on-pu-campus-101630785267252.html
05-09-2021||Chandigarh||Capt terms Badals root cause of farmers’ problem||Chandigarh Ridiculing the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) decision to set up a panel to hold talks with the state’s farmers, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday said no overtures could absolve the Badals of their responsibility in thrusting the draconian and undemocratic agri laws on the farming community. Considering that the Badals themselves were at the root of the problem, and the co-conspirators of the Centre’s anti-farmer agenda, the Akalis neither deserve nor can expect any understanding or forgiveness from the farmers, said the CM. The Akalis’ apathy towards the farmers was evident from the fact that even now, instead of understanding and relating with their pain, Sukhbir was refusing to recognise the protestors as farmers and was insulting them by alleging that they owed allegiance to other political parties, including the Congress, said Amarinder. Amarinder termed Sukhbir’s announcement of suspension of the party’s election outreach programme and formation of the panel to engage with the farmers as a desperate measure to woo Punjab’s voters ahead of the 2022 assembly polls. “But the farmers, and the people of Punjab are not fools, and your attempts to befool them with lies will backfire on you,” he warned the SAD president. He added that the state had completely and unequivocally rejected the Akalis, who had first looted them for 10 years in coalition with the BJP and then cruelly worked hand in glove with them to impose the farm Laws on the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-terms-badals-root-cause-of-farmers-problem-101630785266116.html

Identified as Gursewak Singh of Sector 66 and Inderjit Singh and Gurpreet Singh of Sector 70, the trio was arrested in December last year for public drinking.“There is no dearth of instances when people throw caution to the wind, virtually imperiling their lives and lives of other persons as well. It is an appropriate time to send a clear signal to the persons behaving in such a manner, that their conduct will not be condoned and that they will be severely punished,” observed judicial magistrate Mukesh Kumar Singla.However, taking into consideration the fact that the three are first-time offenders, court released them on probation for one year after they furnished bonds of ₹10,000 each. Court also imposed ₹2,000 as cost of litigation on them.On probation, a convict is released from confinement, but remains under court supervision with an undertaking to maintain good behaviour during the period. Any breach can land the convict behind bars for the remaining period. The trio was arrested on December 13, 2020, while they were consuming liquor standing next to Gursewak’s car near a wine shop at Sector 105. The car was also impounded, though the three were granted bail soon after. The report of the chemical examiner confirmed that the three were consuming whisky. A case under the Excise Act was registered against them at the Sohana police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/held-for-public-drinking-3-mohali-men-to-serve-one-year-probation-101630785086709.html

05-09-2021||Chandigarh||Harish Rawat asks people to vote carefully in 2022||Former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat on Saturday said a minor slip in voting in 2022 could cost people their freedom of expression. Describing 2022 Assembly polls in the state as a prelude to the next general elections, he said the Congress’ victory in Uttarakhand in 2022 would pave the way for the formation of a Congress government in Delhi under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi in 2024. “Even if there is a minor slip in voting, you will lose your freedom of expression and the freedom to make your own choices. In these elections you have to choose between democracy and the forces against it,” he said while addressing a public meeting in Kichha in the course of the party’s Parivartan Yatra. Kiccha was one of the two seats that Rawat had contested and lost in 2017 polls. The other seat he had lost was Haridwar (rural). “Our government will belong to the poor, the farmers, small businessmen and the unemployed,” Rawat said. He spoke against the three farm laws and the Centre’s alleged intention to finish Mandis and the MSP regime. Accusing successive BJP chief ministers in Uttarakhand of making unrealistic promises about filling up 24,000 vacancies in the state, he said if Congress comes to power at the Centre, one crore youths will be given jobs. He said if voted to power, the Congress would give a subsidy of ₹200 on LPG cylinders. Accusing the state government of stopping all welfare programmes started during his chief ministership, he said if voted to power, the Congress would revive all of them||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/harish-rawat-asks-people-to-vote-carefully-in-2022-101630784725087.html
05-09-2021||Mumbai||Covid fails to dampen festive spirit in Mumbai colleges||The usually colourful classrooms, decorated and lit up hallways of Mumbai colleges as part of their annual cultural festivals have now been replaced with virtual events. While Covid-19 dampened the spirit of students last year when several colleges chose to drop their festivals due to the lockdown, no one was caving in for another year. Online workshops, conclaves, pre-recorded events and live impromptu shows — colleges have left no stone unturned in ensuring that the essence of a cultural festival stays intact.After missing their annual festival for the first time in 2020 since its inception over 40 years ago, students of St Xavier’s College ensured they keep it alive and recently concluded Malhar, on August 29. While the usual fanfare which included dance events in the college foyer, music and elocution events in the main hall as well as other events happening simultaneously across several classrooms on campus was missing, the energy and fun quotient remained intact in the virtual fest as well.“Malhar is known for its richness and variety of events. We arranged everything, ranging from Conclave — the intellectual discourse of the fest, to performing arts, fine arts and literary arts events and managed to attract participation from city colleges. While some of the events were pre-recorded where participants were asked to send in their recorded entries in advance for judges to go through, some others happened live and were judged on the day of the festival itself,” said Gauravi Pradhan, a student of the institute and press organiser, Malhar 2021Similarly, mass media students of Jai Hind College in Churchgate recently concluded their virtual conclave, held on August 30 and 31, which brought together experts in the field of Bollywood, entrepreneurs, stand-up comedians, as well as workshops on phone photography for media students. The students are also working on their annual festival, Detour, which they hope to conduct online by the end of this year.In 2020, while several colleges decided to drop their festivals due to the rising Covid-19 cases as well as lockdown, many went ahead with online fests and managed to attract students from around the city and state. The country’s largest cultural festival, Mood Indigo by the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), hosted online dance, music, art and design competitions in 2020 and also managed to organise fund-raising virtual live concerts in order to help non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with Covid-19 relief. Similarly, Techfest, IIT-B’s technology festival, also went virtual with its events, and this year too, they are following the same pattern for the event.Vile Parle’s Mithibai College was one of the few city colleges that managed to conduct their annual cultural festival Kshitij last year as well. Carried out in two phases between November and December 2020, a host of events brought together celebrities and college students on a virtual platform.“Last year, the event was conducted completely in the virtual mode, but this year, we are hoping to partly conduct the event in physical mode as well. While the planning is on, we will wait for updates from the government before announcing our decision on the festival,” said second-year BA student Yashvi Gotecha, who is the chairperson, Kshitij 2021.Once again, many colleges are keeping their social cause events pegged at Covid-19 relief. Organisers of Malhar put up a hip-hop dance workshop — A Hook Step for Hope — and all funds raised through it were donated to Hemkunt Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-fails-to-dampen-festive-spirit-in-mumbai-colleges-101630784666554.html

After FOSWAC chairman Baljinder Singh Bittu raised the issue, many senior citizens complained to the SSP that the beat cops cannot be seen on the field and have stopped visiting their houses.When the e-beat system was launched, and especially during the initial days of the pandemic, the police department had said that beat cops will visit all senior citizens, especially those living alone, once a month to ensure their well-being. The beat cops are also supposed to patrol the area under their jurisdiction regularly, but FOSWAC members claimed that they are seldom seen on the field. Some members said that they don’t even know who are their beat cops, while earlier they used to be on first-name basis with them.SSP Chahal said: “We have an e-beat system and I will personally monitor the movement of beat staff through this. I will ask the station house officers and even the subdivision in-charges to send me regular weekly reports.” The SSP also said that he will ask the station house officers to hold regular meetings with resident welfare associations.The e-beat system was launched in 2019. There are around 111 beats in total, with each of the 16 police stations having four to nine beats under them as per the area of jurisdiction. The movement of the beat staff can be tracked through their GPS-enabled motorcycles and smartphones.Often known as the best city to retire in, Chandigarh saw the second highest rate of thefts against senior citizens, with 29.8 incidents per one lakh, in 2019, according to a report of the National Crime Records Bureau released in October last year. Overall, Chandigarh had the third highest rate of crimes committed against seniors (74.5 incidents per lakh population).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhssp-to-keep-an-eye-on-working-of-beat-cops-101630784665064.html

An 11-year-old girl was the latest to succumb to the disease on Saturday. She died during treatment late in the evening, acting chief medical superintendent of the Firozabad medical college Alok Kumar Sharma said.Uttar Pradesh’s principal secretary (medical education) Alok Kumar inspected a 100-bed dedicated hospital for dengue patients at the medical college and interacted with the patients admitted there. A six-member team of the Union health ministry, which was sent to Firozabad, held a series of meetings to review the situation and suggest remedial measures.As many as 179 new patients were admitted to different wards as well as the new ward which became operational on Saturday, while 54 were discharged following recovery.Till now, a total of 433 patients have been admitted to the medical college hospital, acting CMS Sharma said.For his part, Kumar, along with health officials, visited Firozabad, about 50 kilometres from Agra, on the instructions of chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The chief minister had been in Firozabad on August 30 and, two days later, Dr Neeta Kulshrestha was transferred from the post of chief medical officer on Wednesday (September 1). Kumar, who visited the children’s wards, ultrasound and x-ray centre and PICU (paediatric intensive care unit) of the 100-bed hospital, instructed officials and doctors to ensure effective control of dengue and viral fever. During his inspection, Kumar also visited the upcoming hospital on the same premises constructed by Uttar Pradesh Nirman Nigam at cost of ₹193 crore. He directed the project manager and the principal of the Firozabad medical college to make at least two floors ready at the earliest and begin with a 200-bed health facility to assist in the fight against dengue. Kumar also went to the primary health centre at Himaupur and went to the houses of fever patients in Abbas Nagar where ordered ambulances to get an 11-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy admitted in the Firozabad city hospital. Nodal officer Sudhir Kumar Bobde also visited the Firozabad medical college and the affected areas.(WITH PTI INPUTS)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/dengue-cases-in-firozabad-officials-review-situation-one-more-death-takes-toll-to-51-101630784546755.html

Mobile internet services, however, are yet to be restored.Even though barricades blocking different roads in Srinagar city were in place and security forces were deployed in large numbers, they were allowing people to move about. There was a good presence of people and private vehicles on the roads. Most shops and businesses, however, remained closed and public transport was off road. “Shops are closed but restrictions have been eased in the city centre Lal Chowk. Police and CRPF are not stopping people or private vehicles,” said a resident of Srinagar. The authorities had imposed a clampdown across Kashmir after the death of Geelani on Wednesday evening. Streets were barricaded and key roads sealed to restrict the movement of people in the clampdown similar to the one imposed after the nullification of the region’s semi-autonomous status in 2019. In Old City, people said restrictions were not as stringent on Saturday. However, some shopowners in Khanyar, who had tried to open for business, said they were asked to close. “Some roads were open while some remained closed. However, things were a bit easier than the past two days,” said Muneer Ahmad, a resident of Old City.Same was the case in different towns of the Valley. “Some traffic, mostly the light motor vehicles, resumed and banks have opened. The security forces are less in number on roads,” said Mohammad Abbas, a resident of south Kashmir’s Anantnag.In Kulgam , however, the restrictions were strict today owing to incidents of stone pelting on Friday. In Baramulla and Sopore towns in north Kashmir, private vehicles were plying while shops were closed and public transport was off the roads. Geelani, the face of separatism in Kashmir for over three decades, died on Wednesday after a prolonged illness at 91. The police action was presumably to avoid a mass gathering, which may have turned the region restive. Police said that the situation across Kashmir valley remained peaceful and no untoward incident was reported from anywhere on Friday. On Friday evening, IGP Vijay Kumar said that the voice calls on mobile service and broadband of all TSPs shall open in view of the peaceful situation. “However internet on mobile services shall remain shutdown till Sunday afternoon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mobile-broadband-services-restored-in-kashmir-101630784545185.html

Nathu Badhak, 43, suffered 8-12% burn injuries and was discharged from the civic-run Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivli, following treatment.The fire was reported at 7.11am and was extinguished by 9.30am, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) disaster management cell.According to Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) officials, the fire is likely to have broken out owing to a short circuit on the seventh floor of the residential building. “The fire was on the top floor and kept spreading towards the terrace. It was brought under control quickly and we did not have to vacate the building. We assume a short circuit to be the reason behind the fire, but we will have to investigate the cause,” an MFB official said. The building also houses several commercial offices. No citizen was injured during the incident.Meanwhile, Archie Vora, a resident from the nearby building, said, “The fire started early in the morning when many residents in and around the building were asleep.

05-09-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali: Cop linked to ex-DGP Saini’s case alleges assault||A head constable posted with the vigilance bureau in Mohali was assaulted by two unidentified men near Chappar Chiri in Mohali, police said on Saturday. According to the FIR, the victim, Varun Kapoor, is assisting the VB’s financial intelligence unit in-charge in investigations into the land fraud and disproportionate assets cases against former Punjab director general of police Sumedh Singh Saini. A writ petition and bail plea regarding these cases are listed in court, and he was on his way to Kharar with some important data on his laptop when the assailants struck on Thursday night, Kapoor told police. Kapoor was in his SUV when two men on a bike pointed at his car’s tyre and signalled him to stop near Acme Heights around 8pm on Thursday. Thinking that he has a flat tyre, the cop stopped the vehicle and peeped out after lowering the windowpane.Finding an opportunity, one of the men allegedly tried to pull him out, but the seat belt saved him. As the men rained blows on his face and arm, Kapoor somehow managed to speed away though the assailants gave him a chase for some distance.Kapoor alleged that while attacking him, one of the men had said: “Tujhe CCTV ki video viral karne ka bada shauk hai, aaj tera shauk poora karte hai (You are very fond of making CCTV footage viral; let’s teach you a lesson today).” CCTV control and technical work of the vigilance police station in Mohali is under Kapoor. Notably, after former DGP Saini was arrested a couple of weeks ago, a CCTV video was circulated on social media that showed him falling unconscious in the lockup. “A case has been registered on the complaint of the head constable. The matter is being investigated,” said Satinder Singh, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Mohali. Sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code have been added to the FIR registered against the two unidentified men at the Balongi police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-cop-linked-to-ex-dgp-saini-s-case-alleges-assault-101630784365027.html

These feelings of betrayal, subjugation & anger are absorbed & passed on from one generation to the next,” she said.Mufti alleged that every policy is meant to humiliate people here.“Instead of reaching out, every successive policy is undertaken to humiliate & collectively punish J&K. These punitive actions compound this sense of betrayal and rage,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/claims-of-j-k-enjoying-equal-rights-a-barefaced-lie-mehbooba-101630784185491.html

Between August 28 and September 3, 2,279 cases and 15 deaths were reported in the city, owing to which the tally surged from 743,154 to 745,433 and toll increased to 15,987. However, though the cases surged, the number of deaths has gone down in the city.The daily positivity rate that was below 1% for the past few weeks has also now crossed the 1%-mark.However, experts said that this surge cannot be called the start of the third wave yet.With the rise in the number of cases in the past seven days, number of tests also increased. According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data, between August 21 and 27, 210,140 tests were conducted in the city, wherein 1,893 results came positive (positivity rate of around 0.90%). Between August 28 to September 3, 256,214 tests were conducted, of which 2,279 results came positive, which means the positivity rate was 0.88%. Overall, 9.3 million tests have been conducted in the city between February 3, 2020, and September 3, 2021. The overall positivity rate is 7.94%.Dr Rahul Pandit of Fortis Hospital, Mulund, who is also a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said, “We have opened up since August 15, and with this opening up there was some spike expected in the number of cases. But we still have a chance to control this figure to around 400. If we do not adhere to Covid-19 protocols, there will be further increase. Also, this is not the start of the third wave. But I will say that the third wave is at the door, knocking. It is for us to remain cautious now.”Meanwhile on Saturday, the city reported 413 cases and four deaths. The city’s case tally is 745,846 and toll 15,991. Mumbai’s recovery rate is 96% with 723,386 recoveries.

05-09-2021||Chandigarh||Lal dora: UT admn to form policy on Punjab, Haryana pattern||Pursuing a comprehensive policy on the regularisation of construction outside the lal dora in Chandigarh villages, the UT administration will be formulating a policy on the pattern of models applicable in neighbouring states like Punjab and Haryana.After a Bangalore-based consultant, appointed to study and offer solutions to the problem, made a presentation on the issue, the administration directed it to examine how the neighbouring states had addressed the problem. A lal dora (red line) separates village habitation from adjacent agricultural land.A comprehensive policy is being examined in consultation with the Indian Institute of Human Settlements (IIHS), Bengaluru. A meeting of UT officials and IIHS representatives met here on Friday. The IIHS are expected to submit a draft policy on village development, regularisation of illegal structures and extension of lal dora.“The consultants in our next meeting will be submitting a report incorporating the lessons learned from neighbouring states. We have asked them to study areas like Delhi, Panchkula and Mohali and make recommendations based on it,” said UT adviser Dharam Pal.Notably, the administration is mulling extending the lal dora and regularising the constructions that have been undertaken outside the existing lal dora.Policy in worksIn January this year, the then UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had directed senior officials to work on regularisation of illegal constructions outside the lal dora. He had stated that since there was a lot of construction outside the lal dora area, the administration should formulate a scheme to regularise these.Political parties and village residents had also been consistently asking for extension of lal dora and regularisation of constructions outside it.The regularisation of illegal constructions in villages and lal dora extension has gained added importance this year as MC elections are slated in December. Recently, 13 villages were added to the MC. Now, votes from 26 villages will be a major component of total city votes. The issue is important in villages and will play a major role in elections.Constructions galore outside lal doraArchitects and heritage conservationists are demanding that these illegal constructions should be removed to protect the city’s character.The UT urban planning department, too, has consistently flagged the large-scale illegal construction and colonisation in villages of Chandigarh. It has repeatedly written to the MC commissioner, deputy commissioner-cum-estate officer and land acquisition officer (LAO) to take immediate action to stop illegal construction.“Most city villages and semi-urban areas, including Kishangarh-Manimajra, Hallomajra, Maloya, areas around Bapu Dham near Sukhna Choe, Khuda Ali Sher, Kaimbwala, etc, have unauthorised constructions that have taken the form of colonies in recent months with the land mafia becoming active. Earlier most of these constructions involved renting out spaces, but sale of smaller plots has also come to light now,” said a senior UT official.Unauthorised construction picked up pace after the city’s villages were transferred to the municipal corporation, said the official. “One way of regularising these constructions is by extending the lal dora. But such constructions are in violation of the Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952, which is applicable to areas outside a village’s inhabited area. Also, in some areas constructions have been done in violation of high court orders on protection of Sukhna catchment area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/extension-of-lal-dora-ut-admn-to-form-policy-on-punjab-haryana-pattern-101630783886438.html

05-09-2021||Mumbai||Is Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi set to lose Raju Shetti as alliance partner?||The ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) may lose the Raju Shetti-led Swabhimani Paksha as an alliance partner as the ties between both the sides have strained. Shetti on Saturday said that it is up to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) – one of MVA’s major partners along with Shiv Sena and Congress – to fulfil the promise of giving one seat to his party in the legislative Council or “stabbing him in the back”. He said at an appropriate time, he will do a “correct programme”, a term used by Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis in an election rally for dislodging the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government. “The decision to fulfil the promise or stab [him] in the back has to be taken by the NCP. I don’t care. I didn’t go to them [MVA] begging for the position [of Council member]. I have not held a post for over two years but the respect among people for me has not reduced. I will do a correct programme at an appropriate time,” Shetti told reporters on Saturday. His reaction came after speculations over MVA submitting a fresh list to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari with one change in the list of 12 names – recommended by the state cabinet last November – to be appointed as governor-nominated members to the state legislative Council. A delegation of MVA leaders headed by chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, along with deputy CM Ajit Pawar and state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, had met the governor on Wednesday evening.Meanwhile, NCP chief Sharad Pawar has expressed his surprise on Shetti’s statements. He also rejected the speculations that MVA has requested Koshyari to remove Shetti’s name from the 12 nominees’ list.“Based on his contribution in the fields of agriculture and cooperation, Shetti’s name was a part of the list submitted to the governor by CM and deputy CM. The decision [to appoint him as a member of legislative Council] was taken by us, but the final decision has to be made by the governor. I am surprised how he can make such a statement. We have honestly done our work. I have fulfilled the promise made [to him] and am waiting for the governor’s decision. What Shetti says is his choice,” Pawar said, responding to the Swabhimani Paksha leader’s remarks.Shetti, a farmers’ leader, is currently holding a five-day-long march against MVA government, demanding more relief to the people affected by floods that had taken place in western Maharashtra in July. He said the relief package declared by MVA government is inadequate. NCP, which had recommended his name to the Council from the party, is reportedly upset with Shetti over his stand taken against MVA government. NCP leader Ajit Pawar had on Thursday said that according to new information, a person who was defeated in a recently-held election cannot be nominated for the Upper House and that they are verifying the same. This triggered talks of MVA replacing Shetti’s name.Shetti is a former parliamentarian from Hathkanangale constituency in western Maharashtra. His party was also part of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in 2014 but chose to walk out of it for not fulfilling the promise to double the income input cost as minimum support price (MSP) of farm produce.Political analyst Hemant Desai said Shetti will not continue with MVA if he is not appointed as an MLC.“It is almost certain that Shetti will not continue his alliance with MVA if not appointed as an MLC. But even if he’s appointed, he will continue his fight in farmers’ interest and future clashes with MVA government are expected. One can’t deny the fact that Shetti was defeated by Shiv Sena parliamentarian Dhairyasheel Mane from Hathkanangale, which means if MVA decides to contest the general polls in 2024 as a coalition, then Mane will be the MVA candidate from that seat,” Desai said.

Soon after arriving in Amethi, she inspected the oxygen plant at the trauma centre at Jagdishpur. A district that didn’t have a single oxygen generation unit had now become self-reliant in medical oxygen, she said. “The district now has seven medical oxygen generation plants,” she said in an apparent swipe at the Congress which represented the Amethi Lok Sabha constituency for decades. The Congress has only lost Amethi thrice, including in 2019 Lok Sabha election when Smriti Irani won on the BJP ticket. “In the past seven decades, there was no good hospital. Now, various schemes and initiatives meant for the poor are reaching the masses,” she said.The Union minister also launched the ₹ 276.14 crore drinking water scheme for Dhanapur and Baraulia villages of Amethi. She described Amethi as her home and said she had looked to fulfill all that she has promised for the district.“Due to Yogi Adityanath government, Amethi now has its own Covid-19 testing centre. That means Covid samples would no longer be sent outside for testing and hence save time and deliver quick results,” she said.She said Amethi now had a sports ground to promote sports activities in the rural areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/smriti-irani-launches-veiled-attack-on-congress-in-amethi-101630783406195.html

Srinagar deputy commissioner (DC) Mohammad Aijaz Asad, while chairing a Covid review meeting, directed the chief medical officer and all zonal medical officers to scale up the percentage of the vaccination in the district. Centre asks J-K, U’khand to focus on second vax dose of 60-plus populationThe Centre on Saturday asked eight northeastern states, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir to focus on the second dose vaccination of the 60-plus population, saying the coverage in some of these states was ‘unsatisfactory’. The vulnerability of people aged above 60 to Covid-19 makes this exercise of prime importance, the Centre told these states.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan chaired a review meeting with representatives from Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Uttarakhand and the northeastern states, Arunachal Pradesh; Assam; Manipur; Meghalaya; Mizoram; Nagaland; Sikkim and Tripura.According to the health ministry, the inoculation of both doses among the 60-plus population in Assam, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Meghalaya is unsatisfactory. In the meeting, the states and UTs were also asked to quickly saturate the first dose coverage among the 18-plus population.The health ministry added that the attention of the states was brought to the fact that the administration of the first dose has progressively outpaced the administration of second dose.“It was suggested that states earmark doses, earmark days and target the completion of the exercise for these beneficiaries,” the ministry said. The details of balance stock of 0.5 ml syringes, vaccination coverage among special groups such as transgender persons, persons with disabilities and prisoners and among women, were also discussed.The ministry said the states and UTs were advised to closely monitor the stock from state-level stores to cold chain points, check rational distribution and restrict vaccine wastage to below 2%, and update data on eVIN (electronic vaccine intelligence network) daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jk-sees-116-cases-1-death-in-last-24-hours-101630783166128.html

So far, the city has received 427.9mm of rainfall, against a normal of 721.7mm – a 41% shortfall.Chandigarh IMD director Manmohan Singh says, “Rain is likely to stay below normal in the region, which includes Punjab and Haryana, due to the prevailing weather conditions. It is unlikely that we will receive any more heavy showers in the city.”The low-pressure areas over the Bay of Bengal which head towards the north-west are essential for rainfall in the city. However, this year the low-pressure systems stopped in central India. More showers in the offingThe city is likely to receive up to 20mm rainfall in the coming days. On Saturday, only 1mm rainfall was recorded at the Sector-39 India Meteorological Observatory, while 13mm rain was received at the airport.The maximum temperature also increased from 31°C on Friday to 33.1°C on Saturday.

After the catchment area received heavy spell of rain last week, the water was released from Panshet and Warasgaon. As of September 4, total stock of four dams – Temghar, Warasgaon, Panshet, Khadakwasla has 93.26% of water storage (27.19 TMC) while last year it was 99.43% (28.99 TMC). The water storage is 1.8 TMC less than last year. On Saturday, 600 cusecs of water was released from Warasgaon and Panshet respectively. “As the rainfall activity is less as compared to last week there is no need to release water now. Due less rainfall activity in the month of August, water storage is less compared to last year, it is expected to go up in the last week of September,” said an official for the state irrigation department. The water stock in Khadakwasla is 40.35%, it was purposely brought down by the irrigation department to accommodate water from Panshet and Warasgaon dams. “Warasgaon is filled to its capacity while Panshet has 95.78% of water storage.

Dr Vishal Mishra, assistant professor of biochemical engineering, said that according to the United Nations World Water Development’s report titled ‘Valuing Water’, freshwater use has increased six-fold globally in the last century. “Despite this, more than 80 percent of the wastewater is discharged into water streams without treatment. The conventional water treatment process currently in place is extremely costly. These include high electricity costs, sludge disposal and huge amounts of carbon dioxide emissions,” he said. “Biological wastewater treatment mediated by microalgae would clean the wastewater up to 90% and also high-quality compost in the form of microalgae biomass will prove to be very useful,” he added. Vishal Singh, a PhD student in the research team, said that machine learning tools have been successfully implemented to optimise microalgae-based wastewater treatment process and the research has been published in Netherland based Biochemical Engineering Journal (IF3.97). The information gained from this research can aid in experimental design, lead to large-scale wastewater treatment and can be used for designing microalgae based tertiary wastewater treatment plant. “Besides, it could be easily integrated with current secondary wastewater treatment plants, where treatment is carried out by bacteria. Microalgae wastewater treatment plants can even entirely replace the current conventional wastewater treatment plants,” he said. “The treated water generated from the microalgae-based treatment plant meets the criteria set by WHO and can be easily discharged in the rivers. Moreover, the treated water can be used for irrigation and cleaning purposes and thus would help decrease the load on available natural freshwater resources,’ Singh said. “This will benefit society by solving the problem of the shortage of drinking water,” he said. “The protein supplement and microbial biomass produced after water treatment can be used for the production of animal feed, fertiliser and biofuel. Microalgae also consume a large amount of carbon dioxide from atmosphere during the process of photosynthesis and generates oxygen,” he said. “Decreasing the load of carbon dioxide in atmosphere by microalgae will resolve the issue of global warming to a great extent,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/microalgae-tech-to-treat-water-waste-iit-bhu-research-101630781785596.html

NCP corporator Laxmi Dudhane built the school in Kothrud and it was inaugurated by Pawar. Pawar said, “Usually whenever we attend a municipal corporation programme, we find projects named after elected members’ relatives. I don’t want to make any comment about it but I liked dedicating this school after Kalam.” Pawar said that e-learning is very important and it is important to introduce IT to kids from school days.” Pawar said, “Kalam and I worked together for two years and he was my advisor when I was defence minister. He was very humble and simple. During this era he wrote one letter to me which is now at exhibit hall in Baramati. The letter highlights the relationship between scientific community and politicians.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pawar-hails-apj-kalam-s-name-for-e-learning-school-in-pune-101630781784234.html
05-09-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | Stay at home but don’t become a couch potato||With stay at home, work from home and quarantine becoming an integral part of our lives, many of us are using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to binge on unhealthy food and skip workout. This is dangerous as eating healthy and staying fit are all the more important during a pandemic. A well-balanced nutritious diet helps keep the immune system up and running and ward off disease. Diet, physical activity and health are all interlinked and influence our physical, mental, and social well-being.Cut out junk Our lifestyle will determine whether we will remain healthy or fall sick and how effectively we will be able to fight an infection. During a pandemic, it is especially important to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, which are rich in vitamins and minerals and fibre. Junk food does not provide us with the right amount of calories, and nutrients. Besides, processed food increases our proclivity to develop disease and may also lead to weight gain. Simple change in our daily diet can go a long way in our quest for longevity and improving quality of life. It will also help manage symptoms of diseases one has already developed. Healthy eating involves replacing foods that contain trans fats, excess salt, and sugar with more nutritious options.Stocking up on healthy snacks to keep the hunger pangs at bay is always a good idea. Instead of having sweets or salty snacks, one should opt for healthier options such as nuts, cheese, yoghurt (preferably unsweetened), chopped or dried fruit, boiled eggs, or other locally sourced healthy options. We must ensure that our diet has adequate: Carbohydrates : They help maximise the body’s ability to use glycogen to fuel short and high-intensity exercises. They are an ideal source of energy as they are readily converted into glucose. Fat: Provides us with extra energy to fuel our body for longer exercise sessions. It insulates our bodies and also protects our vital organs. Protein: It helps improve muscle-protein synthesis, prevent muscle damage, promote recovery and boost the immune system. Vitamins and minerals: Vitamins and minerals are only needed in small quantities, but their role is essential for overall health and proper functioning of all body systems. Stay active Maintaining an active and disciplined lifestyle will help reduce our medical expenditures.A sedentary lifestyle is usually associated with an increased risk for chronic disease, loss of movement, and decreased immune health. Even while confined to our homes, a person should devote 150 minutes to moderate-intensity exercise and 75 minutes to high-intensity physical activity per week, or a combination of both. One should focus on: 1.Strength and core strength: This is the amount of force a muscle can produce against some form of resistance. Improving core strength can help improve balance and motion.2. Aerobic capacity and endurance: This is the ability of our heart and lungs to get oxygen to our muscles. During aerobic activity, we repeatedly move large muscles in our arms, legs and hips. It leads to deep breathing and helps maximise the amount of oxygen in our blood. Our heart beats faster, which increases blood flow to our muscles. 3.Flexibility, mobility, and stability: Flexibility is the capacity to move through the our active and passive range of motion. 4. Balance and coordination: Balance is the ability to stay in control of your body’s movement and coordination is being able to move two or more body parts with measureStay hydrated Good hydration means getting the right amount of water before, during, and after exercise. Water regulates our body temperature and lubricates our joints. It helps transport nutrients to give us the energy to keep healthy. If we are not hydrated, our body cannot perform at an optimal level. Plain water is any day better than sugar-sweetened beverages, which provide empty calories.(The writer is a freelance contributor)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-stay-at-home-but-don-t-become-a-couch-potato-101630781605520.html

It is about the joie de vivre that coloured the twine and threadwork of the man.Principal Bhupinder.The teacher who gave not lectures but lessons in living life. The Principal who taught how to live a principled and spirited life. How to be a rainbow on the greyest and gloomiest of days. The life and soul of tricity’s litscape, first and foremost. A former Principal of Government College, man of letters, self-trained shutterbug and all that, later.This is not an attempt to sum up the man, who was more than the sum of many parts. That’s best done by those who knew him longer or better.This is about those who knew him briefly, as brief as his numbered bursts of breaths when corona knocked on the door.He burst upon our literary circle and the tricity’s litscape in signature style.When yours truly had to field Q&A from a veteran with swag, peering from behind a tripod parked in the wings of the Press Club Hall staging my book launch, little did one know then that a bright ‘n’ bold breed had arrived on the tricity’s literary scene.A pair of black goggles, a vibrant wardrobe, a vocabulary that could give the likes of Shashi Tharoor a run for their money, and a photography paraphernalia with its piece de resistance – a mic that was a thundering match for the mouth pieces of any Aaj Tak or Republic – is what announced him.Vlogger Principal Bhupinder had arrived.The teacher who was more a student. Self taught. Self motivated.The Man in the Red Shirt.It was not about bold and bright sartorial styles. It was about a lone ranger trying to colour his life.It was about a littérateur looking for a Lit family outside of family, in a universe where blood bonds apparently loved his bank balance or bungalow rather than him.It was about a bachelor’s lonely heart looking for the colours of love ‘n’ life in the lyrics of Dev Anand’s “Abhi naa jao chhod ke” when he tagged us in his version of Binaca Geetmala -- ‘Bhupinder Geetmala’.“I’ll try not to tag you all so much on Facebook. Your Timeline has more my posts than yours,” he once gregariously remarked. I reassured him that I didn’t mind him tagging me. (Incidentally, he was the first to bestow upon me the ‘Humour Express’ tag). I truly didn’t mind, for the tags were throbbing signals he was up and about. The tags. The blips, on the social media’s pulse that told us that ‘chief cheer-leading officer’ (CCO) Principal Bhupinder was in action. The Facebook ‘blips’ that bespoke of his pulse rate.Then these blips began petering out at the peak of the pandemic. A sense of unease gripped.An unease that spurred one to frantically call him and fellow authors for organising any help that was needed.An unease born of life’s lessons from many summers ago.An unease born of knowing that sometimes when life is about to give with one hand, it takes away with the other.Seasons ago, just before life was about to gift me my baby, it was my father whom it had snatched. That same sense of unease now returned. My every particle, every pore became a prayer. A prayer that all those who are a part and parcel of my writerly journey should be there.This time, a literary ‘baby’, my new book, on the way to being born. This time, the tricity lit circle’s father figure snatched.Those ‘blips’ of his tags on the litscape’s pulse metre never to return.chetnakeer@yahoo.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/witerati-principal-bhupinder-the-rainbow-on-litscape-101630781424934.html

The suspect uses the logo of the company and identifies himself as a manager at the company and offers pre-approved loans to customers of the finance company, according to the complainant. A complaint was filed by a 35-year-old resident of Hadapsar who works as risk manager at the company. “The complainant is a manager at the company. The caller used his company’s name to bait customers,” said sub-inspector S Salvi of Khadki police station who registered the case. According to his complaint, the calls to four of the witnesses were made between February 21 and March 10. In one month, the accused managed to steal ₹.48,187 from four customers, according to the complaint. The witnesses fell for the rules and transferred the money to the various bank accounts that the caller provided to each one of them, allegedly on multiple occasions. However, when the loan money was not deposited in their account, they called up the real helpline of the company only to find that they were duped. A case was registered under section 420 (cheating) of Indian penal code along with section 66 (C) and 66(D) of the information technology act at Khadki police station. Police Inspector (crime) Sangeeta Jadhav of Khadki police station is investigating the case further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/4-customers-of-finance-firm-duped-by-man-claiming-to-be-manager-101630781364239.html

05-09-2021||Pune||Take online darshan of Pune’s Dagdusheth Ganpati this year||For the second consecutive year, the Dagdusheth Ganpati mandal, one of the prominent Ganpati mandals in Pune, has decided to cancel celebrations and keep it simple by holding the ten days’ festival within the main temple itself. However, the mandal is introducing an “augmented reality” darshan of Bappa for devotees seeking online darshan as this is the 129th year of Ganpati celebrations for the mandal and the decision has been taken keeping the safety of Punekars’ in mind in the time of Covid-19.At a press conference held on Thursday, Ashok Godse, president of the Dagdusheth Ganpati mandal, said, “Just like last year, there won’t be any big pandal, decorations or rush of people taking darshan. Even the volunteers and trustees of the mandal will not step inside the temple for 10 days and our priests will perform daily pooja and aarti. On the second day of Ganpati, five women as representatives will perform the traditional Atharvashirsh Pathan pooja inside the temple. Most importantly for devotees across the world, we will provide a live online link for darshan through augmented reality technology so that they can watch, experience and even perform aarti of Shrimant Dagdusheth Ganpati Bappa from the comfort and safety of their homes. Our appeal to all Punekars is not to visit the temple but take darshan from home in the live online mode.”Pune city mayor Murlidhar Mohol, Pune joint police commissioner Dr Ravindra Shisve, and trustees of the mandal were also present at the press conference.Mohol said, “Considering social responsibility and safety of our loved ones, this decision of the Dagdusheth Ganpati mandal is appreciated and I appeal to all other mandals to follow suit. This will give a positive message to all Ganpati mandals across the state and we should help our Covid warriors, the police department and concerned government bodies to stop the spread of the virus.”While Shisve on the occasion said, “The Pune pattern of the Ganpati festival has been much appreciated all over the state since the last year and we are glad that the Dagdusheth Ganpati mandal is the torch-bearer for other mandals. This will ease the pressure on the police department with regard to crowd management and other safety issues during the festival. Still our police bandobast will be there for traffic monitoring and safety but our appeal to Punekars is to take darshan online this year.”Permission denied to Dhol Tasha steady playingAbout granting permission to Dhol Tasha pathaks for steady on-the-spot playing, Shivse said, “We are getting many requests and demands from the Dhol tasha pathaks, Ganpati mandals and even from mayor Murlidhar Mohol to give permission for steady on-the-spot playing of dhol tasha. But it is not possible as it will lead to crowding and spread of the virus. So we are not going to give permission to any of the processions and even steady dhol tasha playing during the Ganpati festival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/take-online-darshan-of-dagdusheth-ganpati-this-year-101630781005633.html
05-09-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | Curriculum for a gender equal world||In India, women and girls are brought up in a socio-cultural context steeped in discrimination and inequity. Such social conditions often manifest in the form of social norms that perpetuate violence and discrimination against girls and women. Statistics paint a grim picture. In 2018, the National Family Health Survey, 2018, noted that 33% married women in India have experienced physical, sexual, and emotional spousal violence, and around 90% women have experienced some form of sexual harassment in their lives. Adolescent girls are particularly vulnerable, they find themselves undervalued, neglected and unloved in their own homes and communities. Restricted mobility, low priority for schooling, early marriage, confine them to domestic roles.Therefore, it is critical to look at the barriers that hold us back from becoming a gender equal world. Social development will be equally important to sustain India’s economic growth prospects. It is heartening to see the growing awareness among government and private sector stakeholders about the need for building a gender equal world. Over the years, government initiatives such as Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP), Mahila Shakti Kendra (MSK), the Adolescent Girls Scheme and Female Entrepreneurship Programme have helped improve the gender equality index but there is still a long way to go. Private sector participation will be critical in further enabling and ensuring this.Emulating the Punjab model Early this year, the government of Punjab partnered with Breakthrough and J-PAL South Asia to integrate a gender sensitisation curriculum for adolescents into the syllabus for all government middle schools in Punjab. The department of school education in Punjab will work with Breakthrough to train teachers to integrate the curriculum for Classes 6 to 8. The syllabus will be introduced in 4,500 schools across the state. With 23,000 trained teachers, the curriculum is expected to reach an estimated six lakh students. The education department will take responsibility to train the teachers and familiarise them with the curriculum.Gender-sensitive programmes In 2012, we created the ‘Taaron Ki Toli’ programme (TKT) or gang of stars to promote gender-sensitive behaviours among young adults. Taaron Ki Toli is a school-based, gender equity programme for adolescent boys and girls. The programme offered 28 fortnightly, 45-minute classroom sessions and 12 assembly sessions. It was piloted in Haryana, a state with the most skewed sex ratio in the country, to cover children in government schools in Classes 6 to 8. The programme was evaluated in a randomised control trial by JPal, South Asia, over 2.5 years, covering 14,000 children across 300 schools. The results were heartening: the gender attitudes and behaviours of both boys and girls had shifted.Significantly, a more significant change was seen in boys’ behaviours, which might be because they have comparatively few social constraints. The most significant shifts were seen in perceptions around norms related to girls’ higher education and paid employment.We ran a similar initiative called the adolescent empowerment programme in eastern Uttar Pradesh from 2016-2021. The programme sought to engage with adolescent girls and boys aged between 11-19 years to understand how they demand and access gender equity in health and education in their homes and community for themselves and others. The evaluation of the programme was done in February this by NRMC. The findings showed a significant decrease in earlya nd underage marriages.Today, it is more than important to create similar programs to drive social and behavioural changes to build a gender equal world. These programmes, after due evaluation and testing, should be incorporated in the school curriculum. Schools provide the unique opportunity of directly dealing with the future change makers and through them, those closely associated with them. Partnerships with governments States like Kerala, Maharashtra have taken proactive steps to re-look at their school curriculum to make it more gender inclusive. Similarly, the programme adopted by the government of Punjab will increase student awareness on constitutional values and promote gender sensitive attitudes among students from an early age. Similar collaborations between the government and the development sector experts and organisations will yield significant positive results. The government of Punjab has taken a crucial step towards addressing it. Such initiatives by the governments both at state and central levels can encourage inter-gender and intergenerational constructive dialogues and build awareness about human rights to help adolescents identify their right for education, health and a violence-free life. Similar steps by other state governments can definitely help in building a gender-equal world.(The writer heads the leadership building ,research and development programme at Breakthrough India, a women’s rights organisation in New Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-curriculum-for-a-gender-equal-world-101630780885172.html

What Shetti says is his choice. We are now awaiting Governor to take a call on the list.”Earlier, reacting to report, Shetti had said the NCP had promised a seat in MLC to his party. His reaction came after talks of MVA submitting a fresh list to the governor with one change. A delegation of MVA leaders headed by the chief minister (CM), along with deputy CM Ajit Pawar (Nationalist Congress Party) and state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat (Congress), met the governor on Wednesday evening.Speculations are doing rounds that they have requested him to remove farmer leader Raju Shetti’s name from the list. Shetti is a former parliamentarian and heads political outfit Swabhimani Paksha. His name was recommended from NCP’s quota but the party is reportedly upset with him over his stand taken against MVA government.NCP leader Ajit Pawar On Thursday said according to new information, a person, who was defeated in a recently held election, cannot be nominated for the Upper House, so they are verifying the same. This triggered talks about MVA replacing the name of Shetti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/shettis-nomination-pawar-says-party-done-its-job-honestly-101630780764170.html

After councillors and mayor Balkar Sandhu slammed the company for its alleged poor performance, principal secretary of local bodies department, AK Sinha, convened a meeting with both the parties in Chandigarh on Saturday. Mayor Sandhu, senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra, leader of opposition in MC House Harbhajan Singh Dang, leader of Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) councillors Swarandeep Chahal, and BJP local bodies cell in-charge Inder Aggarwal were among those present in the meeting. The councillors criticised the company officials over poor maintenance of streetlights and lack of maintenance staff and machinery, while the company raised the issue of pending bills amounting to ₹9 crore, due to which the working of the firm had been hit badly. Leader of opposition in the MC General House Dang said, “Poor maintenance of streetlights is a major issue and residents have been raising hue and cry over the defunct streetlights, due to which many areas of the city are left in the dark during the night hours. The company has failed to depute the required number of maintenance staff and teams visit wards on a weekly basis. They do not even have hydraulic ladders to repair the streetlights. There should be one team in every ward and maintenance should be done on a regular basis.”Senior deputy mayor Malhotra said that the company has failed to improve the working in the last two years and residents have been bearing the brunt. The councillors stated that the online system to keep a check on the functioning of lights was also not working properly, but the company has assured to improve the working in the coming time. Mayor Sandhu said, “One last chance has been given to the company despite the repeated complaints from the councillors. If the company still fails to improve in a month, then a House meeting will be organised to terminate the contract.” Survey finds 4,000 lights missingThe MC has found at least 4,000 streetlights missing in about 50 wards of the city during the survey ordered by the mayor in July. The company had earlier claimed in its survey that 900 lights were missing and over 1.2 lakh lights have been installed in the city.The councillors stated that the company had agreed to install 1.5 lakh lights under the contract, but now they are claiming that there are just 1.3 lakh points. After the meeting, the company has now assured that the lights will be installed at the missing points.Senior deputy mayor said the company has also been directed to install additional 15% streetlights as per a clause in the agreement as streetlights were still missing from a number of areas in the city. He added that the pending payment will be released once the firm’s functioning improves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/led-streetlights-ludhiana-mc-warns-firm-of-contract-termination-101630780584793.html

The current hospital lacks basic screening technology for animals and with the new building, it would be a self-sustained centre but would be completely run by the government, the administration will also change the fee structure once the new complex comes up which will also have a crematorium for animals, vaccination center and grooming center. As per the plan submitted by the Zilla Parishad for approval of expansion of the existing polyclinic into a super speciality hospital, it would cost ₹5,72,88,558 of which ₹4.83 crore would be spent for construction. The existing fee structure of nominal ₹1-5 for services availed would be revised to ₹10-50 to break even the operation cost. Along with fee revision, a technical advisory committee would be put in place, veterinary experts would be appointed and it would provide services like vaccination, IPD services, OPD services, diagnosis, treatment, medicines, ambulance, grooming center and vet crematorium. Ayush Prasad, CEO, Zilla Parishad said, “As of now, the services are limited and so to expand the polyclinic into a super speciality hospital our team visited and studied the hospital in Hyderabad. “This hospital will have the potential to become a regional centre and act as a speciality veterinary hospital not just for Pune but for nearby districts. Although we do have referral hospitals in rural areas, this will become a referral hospital to major surgeries and specialised care. The rate revision would only be to ensure that the centre is self sustained,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-vet-polyclinic-to-become-centre-for-specialised-animal-care-101630780524226.html

So, 70% of eligible beneficiaries got the first dose while 38% have been fully vaccinated in the district.Out of the 8.142 million vaccine doses administered in the district, 1.880 million or 23% were administered in the month of August alone. Out of these 1.880 million vaccine doses, 695,158 were administered in Pune city (Pune municipal corporation); 426,138 were administered in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC); and 758,766 were administered in Pune rural. Out of the expected 8.53 million beneficiaries in the district, 5.94 million got the first dose while 2.20 million were fully vaccinated. This is 70% of the eligible beneficiaries who got at least one shot of the vaccine and 38% who got both shots of the vaccine, which, by the end of July, was only 53% of the eligible beneficiaries who had got the first shot of the vaccine and 18% were fully vaccinated.Sachin Edake, district immunisation officer said, “This massive jump in the number of vaccines is because of the consistent supply of vaccines from the state and Centre. However, the reason why Pune could cross the ‘two lakh vaccines a day’ milestone and has been the only district in the state to do so can be attributed to a major contribution by the Bajaj group which contributed over two lakh doses along with syringes helping us expedite the vaccination process and break a new record.”On Saturday, Maharashtra broke a new vaccination record as the previous best single day record for vaccination was bettered and 1,161,141 Covid-19 vaccines were administered till 6 pm which would further increase later, informed Dr Pradip Vyas, principal secretary of the state public health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/august-vax-drive-in-pune-highest-count-since-jan-first-vax-doses-rise-by-17-second-20-101630780404139.html
05-09-2021||Delhi||Mismanagement worsens chaos at Ashram Chowk||There seems to be no end to the traffic nightmare at the busy Ashram intersection as poor site management at the ongoing construction on a 750-metre underpass has ensured that the commuters are at the receiving end since the beginning of work in 2019. The project has already missed four deadlines.HT on Saturday visited the intersection, which is used by at least 350,000 vehicles every day, and found that the junction is in complete mess owing to poor management of construction site, reckless dumping of debris, and sheer absence of traffic monitoring checks on prohibited vehicles. Construction of an underpass at the junction by Delhi government’s public works department (PWD) was going on in full swing, but the peripheral work such as laying of new pipelines and walkways has added to the choke points for the traffic.Poor site managementThe absence or poor placement of barricades around peripheral works on the stretch from New Friends Colony towards Lajpat Nagar has left commuters at the mercy of contractors. Pipelines are being laid for which parts of the road are dug up with zero barricading. Cars, buses, two-wheelers, and even pedestrians, are all forced to use the same narrow road. Mounds of soil and other debris has settled on the road. On the same stretch, there is another portion dug up right in the middle of the road where men were seen working in the middle of traffic with zero barricades or signage cautioning motorists.A Delhi government spokesperson said the situation has worsened because of the incessant rains. “Work on the Ashram Chowk project is going on with rapid progress and is expected to be completed within a couple of months. The government has made ample provisions at and around the project site for the safety of commuters. The present situation has risen as a result of heavy rainfall in the city and measures are being taken to overcome it,” the spokesperson said.No traffic police deploymentDespite being one of the most busy traffic intersections in the city, HT found no traffic police personnel on the spot on Saturday. At the main junction beneath the flyover, traffic from three sides merge on to a narrow strip leading to long traffic jams on all sides. Despite traffic signals, the barricades at the spot confuse the commuters who often come in each other’s way leading to snarls.Special commissioner (traffic) Muktesh Chander, however, said the traffic police does monitor the situation on the ground closely. “I went with my whole team and those from the PWD department. A complete survey has been done on the stretch. We have asked the PWD to expedite work at the Ashram underpass. Permission for the construction work related to the loop that joins the Outer Ring Road will be done only once the construction at the underpass is complete. We have increased the number of traffic police personnel on the ground because pedestrians use the crossing,” he said.Dumping of debrisHT found that the concessionaires have dumped mounds of soil and debris along the roads at several spots, further narrowing down the way for vehicles and leaving no option for pedestrians but to walk amid moving traffic. New bus stops have been built and the old ones are also operational, but all of them have become informal dumping grounds of construction waste.Prohibited vehicles still plyingThe traffic police has put up boards prohibiting movement of inter-state buses and commercial vehicles towards Nizamuddin but HT found on Saturday several state roadways buses plying on the stretch. A number of medium-sized goods vehicles were also seen on the road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mismanagement-worsens-chaos-at-ashram-chowk-101630778904928.html
05-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi transport minister Kailash Gehlot challenges order in BJP MLA Gupta’s suit||Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot has moved the division bench of the Delhi high court against an order by a single judge who refused to grant an ex-parte injunction in a suit that the minister has filed against Delhi BJP MLA Vijender Gupta for allegedly making defamatory remarks against him over the procurement of 1,000 low-floor buses by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC).The matter is listed for hearing on Monday before a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh.On August 28, the Delhi high court declined to grant ex parte interim relief to Gahlot in his civil defamation plea seeking the removal of alleged defamatory statements and posts shared by Gupta on social media. The court, while issuing summons to Gupta, also gave him 30 days to respond to the suit saying that prima facie no personal allegations were made against Gahlot.Challenging the order, Gahlot has said the single judge was not correct in her view in refusing him interim relief as it “overlooked” specific tweets which made alleged scandalous remarks against him.In his plea, Gahlot said that Gupta, in his tweets, made direct imputations on him which were defamatory, scandalous, vengeful and made without any basis or after any due diligence.Reacting to the development, Gupta on Saturday said he will defend his stand in the court. “I will apprise the court of the facts of the case, and defend my stand,” the legislator said.Gahlot has also filed a criminal defamation case against Gupta, in which the judge has taken cognizance of his allegations and asked him to appear on September 18 to record his statements.On July 12, Gupta had written to LG Anil Baijal demanding a CBI inquiry into the alleged scam involving procurement of 1,000 low-floor buses by the Delhi Transport Corporation.A three-member committee that probed the matter has recommended scrapping the tender of the AMC (annual maintenance contract) of buses finding various “lapses”, he said. There has been “irrefutable evidence of irregularities and violations in the AMC bid”, he had stated, alleging “criminal conspiracy and connivance”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-transport-minister-kailash-gehlot-challenges-order-in-bjp-mla-gupta-s-suit-101630778724783.html
05-09-2021||Delhi||IMD forecasts more intense rains, Delhi headed for wettest monsoon in a decade||With India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting another intense rain spell over Delhi and adjoining areas between September 6 and 10, this could be one of the wettest monsoons for the city in at least over the past decade, IMD scientists and weather experts said.Compared to the normal monsoon rain 552.6mm, Delhi has already had a 79% surplus -- 988.4mm rain so far, shows IMD data. Monsoon in Delhi is officially considered between June 1 and September 30. It has also exceeded the monsoon season’s average rainfall of 648.9mm.“This is already the highest rainfall received so far during the season since 2010 when 1031.5mm rainfall was received. Now, with another week of rain forecast, it may even surpass the 2010 mark. From September 6-10, another moderate to heavy spell of rainfall is likely over the northern plains including Delhi-NCR,” said a senior IMD official who asked not to be named.As per IMD rainfall data, till Saturday, the city gauged 232mm rain whereas the normal September rainfall count is 125.1mm. Between August 31 and September 2, Delhi received 230 mm rain. With 112.1mm 24-hour rainfall on September 1, Delhi received the highest single-day rainfall for the month in the past 19 years, IMD said. On August 21, Delhi received 138.8mm rainfall in 24 hours, the highest for that month in over 14 years.“These intense rain spells over the past week, and during the past month, have led to surplus rain. The most recent heavy spell was a result of a deep convergence line forming from Gujarat to Delhi along with the monsoon trough being in the normal position. Another low pressure system is forming over the Bay of Bengal, which will gradually travel to the northwest region from September 6-10, and may result in heavy rain during this time,” said R K Jenamani, senior IMD scientist.This monsoon has been a season of extremes for Delhi. First, the monsoon was delayed by 16 days and finally hit the city on July 13. IMD data shows that till July 16, Delhi had a rainfall deficit of 46%. However, this was soon over with several heavy spells of rain in July as it ended in a monthly rainfall surplus of 141%. In July, Delhi received 507.1 mm rainfall, compared to the normal 210.6 mm. Then August had two dry spells, one of which lasted for 10 days. Rainfall in August oscillated from a monthly rain deficit of 60% to a surplus of 11%, and then ending with a deficit of 13%. August received 214.5mm rainfall against the normal monthly rainfall of 247.7 mm.Independent weather experts said monsoon has behaved odd this season. From dry spells to intense rain, it has been oscillating from one extreme to another, and may result in the city having one of the wettest monsoons in many years. “The dry spells were mainly because both the frequency and intensity of low-pressure systems that form over the Bay of Bengal, which bring rainfall to different parts of the country, were too low. The systems that formed in between brought the heavy spells. September, however, is going to be good in terms of more spells of rain not just in Delhi, but the whole of northern plains and central India,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, Skymet, a private forecaster.Explaining the reasons behind this, he said, the frequency of formation of low-pressure systems has increased over the past fortnight. “With more systems forming and travelling over the northern plains, more rain is expected. Rain activity is likely to get intense from September 7-10. Then mid-September, another system is likely to form bringing in more showers. Last year, September was largely dry receiving only 20.9mm monthly rainfall,” said Palawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/imd-forecasts-more-intense-rain-spells-delhi-headed-for-wettest-monsoon-in-a-decade-101630777584819.html

05-09-2021||Chandigarh||Row over prime land’s sale in Ludhiana: DC refutes fixing reserve price||Four days after Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) chairman Raman Balasubramaniam refuted allegations of undervaluing a prime commercial property in Model Town Extension and said its reserve price was fixed by a deputy commissioner’s panel, the latter rebutted the claim on Saturday. LIT had auctioned the 16,344 square yards (3.79 acres) land, among around two dozen properties, on August 16. Having a reserve price of ₹91.86 crore, the land was sold to Ritesh Properties and Industries limited for ₹98.38 crore, including 6% cess.Claiming that LIT grossly undervalued the prime land, whose market price is around ₹300 crore, the Bharatiya Janata Party had demanded cancellation of the auction.According LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam, the reserve price was fixed by a committee headed by deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Kumar Sharma. However, the DC denied the claim and said rates for selling residential plots and commercial booths were finalised on LIT’s request. As per information, LIT had asked the Price and Rent fixation committee, headed by the DC, to fix the reserve price for around a dozen LIT properties situated in different scheme areas in December last year. The list included commercial plots and built-up booths in Model Town Extension (400 acre) scheme. A meeting of the committee was held in February, and attended by cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, MLA Surinder Dawar and mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu, among others. DC Sharma told HT during that meeting, only rates for residential plots and built-up booths in Model Town Extension were fixed, at ₹28,103 per square yard and ₹56,207 per square yard, respectively. “There is no mention of a 16,344 square yards commercial plot in that list, so no reserve price was decided for it. The LIT chairman or officials can answer how they interpreted the rates fixed by the committee to determine the reserve price of this chunk of land,” he added. On his part, Subramaniam said there seemed to be some miscommunication, as the reserve price was finalised by the DC committee only and proceedings of the meeting were available with LIT. “Reserve prices for residential and commercial land were fixed by the committee. We would have sought the price (for the 16,344 square yards plot) separately if it would have any built up area,” the chairman claimed. BJP seeks FIR against LIT chairmanMeanwhile, alleging scam in the matter, the BJP through a complaint to the DC, on Saturday, demanded an FIR against the LIT chairman.BJP leader Bikram Sidhu alleged that the chairman committed fraud at the behest of a cabinet minister and some close aides of the minister were also involved in it. “The LIT had once proposed to earn around ₹400 crore by establishing a Food Street at the site and now put the land on sale against a reserve price of ₹91.86 crore only. An FIR should be lodged against the chairman and others involved in the case. The government should cancel all auctions organised by the chairman and an inquiry should be marked in all cases,” Sidhu said. Balasubramaniam refuted the allegations, stating that Sidhu’s claims were baseless and without any proof. “All protocols were followed and LIT auctioned the properties as per norms after getting permission from the state government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/row-over-prime-land-s-sale-in-ludhiana-dc-refuses-fixing-reserve-price-101630776445163.html
05-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police not conducting proper investigation into northeast riots cases: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday alleged that the Delhi Police is not conducting a proper investigation into cases related to the northeast Delhi riots which took place in February last year.Pointing out that charge sheets have been filed in only 35 out of over 700 riots cases, senior AAP leader and Kalkaji MLA Atishi, addressing a press conference, said, “Delhi saw a horrific series of riots in February 2020. We all saw how northeast Delhi saw deadly rioting with extreme violence and arson. Today, even after 1.5 years, the Delhi police has taken no action or conducted any proper investigation and it is evident from the fact that the courts have repeatedly questioned the investigation of Delhi police. All we want to understand is why is the Delhi Police not carrying out a proper investigation for these riots. Is the Delhi police protecting someone in the investigation?”“One might say that we are raising this issue as a political party as the Delhi Police comes under the BJP. But in reality, not just the AAP, even the courts -- be it the sessions court, High Court or the Supreme Court -- have raised questions on the investigation procedures of the police,” Atishi said.On the issue of the appointment of special prosecutors, which has led to a tussle between the Delhi government and the Centre-appointment Lieutenant Governor (LG), Atishi said, “When the special prosecutors were asked in the courts why they were not informed of the matters or did not present the facts of the investigation properly, then they said that they called the Delhi Police repeatedly to get information about the cases, but were not even briefed about the investigations.”A subsequent statement by the AAP added, “This makes it clear that the Delhi police and the LG working under the BJP do not want the Delhi riots to be investigated.”Despite multiple attempts, the Delhi Police did not comment on the matter.The Delhi government and the LG were involved in a tussle over appointment of special prosecutors, after the former refused to appoint special prosecutors suggested by the Delhi Police, saying that there is a high chance of collusion. The LG has also rejected a list of special prosecutors suggested by the Delhi government.The matter is currently being heard in the high court.The L-G office did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-not-conducting-proper-investigation-into-northeast-riots-casesaap-101630775304798.html

It looks like the work of someone she knew. A man who lived with her in this house had died some years ago. She lived alone so it could also be a case related to property dispute,” said an investigating officer, who asked not be named.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Jasmeet Singh said, “We have registered a case of murder. Investigation is on.”According to police, Mumtaz Parveen married Kamran Gauhar, a Pakistan national, some time between 1998-2000. Gauhar was later convicted on terror charges and spying and deported to Pakistan. Parveen had also got a Pakistan citizenship on the basis of her marriage with Gauhar, but police said she had recently applied for an Indian citizenship.Preliminary investigation in the case has revealed that Mumtaz had shifted to Chandni Mahal around 2000 from Karol BaghThe Delhi Police special cell had arrested her husband Gauhar for supplying explosives to another person and circulating fake currency at the behest of ISI in 2000. Parveen, who was also arrested for helping in her husband’s activities, was convicted and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in 2004.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwife-of-alleged-pak-spy-found-murdered-in-her-house-in-chandni-mahal-101630775004474.html

The Delhi BJP, however, denied the allegation calling it “baseless”.Addressing a press conference, AAP chief spokesperson and Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj said the North MCD passed a resolution on September 1 to give all the land and buildings they have to “their loved ones” for free.“BJP is preparing to run away from MCD, and is preparing to distribute all the assets and income sources to its own people for free. The BJP-ruled MCD is selling every expensive plot of land it has for very cheap prices. Preparations are underway to auction the hospitals. All the parks of MCD are about to have shops inside them. BJP is preparing to earn money by handing over the roads to the food vendors. BJP-ruled MCD sold Novelty Cinema land worth ₹150 crore for just ₹34 crores; Dangal Maidan will be sold for one-fourth the price,” said Bhardwaj.The Delhi BJP said the AAP lacks basic understanding about the functioning of the MCDs. “For decades, dozens of charitable organisations have been working out of premises owned and provided by the MCDs and running dispensaries, schools for the differently abled and orphans. Most cremation grounds in Delhi are owned by MCDs, but they are maintained and run by charitable NGOs. In fact MCDs extend financial aid to some NGOs,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.“This week’s North MCD’s standing committee proposal to handover few vacant health department premises to charitable NGOs for running health dispensaries is in line with the decades old tradition, and it is sad that the AAP is trying to malign this good scheme with political vendetta,” the BJP spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjp-selling-mcds-assets-ahead-of-elections-next-year-alleges-aap-101630774224753.html
05-09-2021||Other||OP Chautala scores 88 marks in Class 10 English compartment exam||Former Haryana chief minister and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) chief OP Chautala on Saturday reportedly became the oldest student in the history of the Board of School Education Haryana (BSEH) to pass the Class 10 examination after the board announced his English compartment exam result in which he scored 88 marks.The 86-year-old had appeared for his English compartment exam on August 18 at Arya Girls’ Senior Secondary School in Sirsa. The board had provided him a Class 9 girl student as a writer as he had suffered injury in hand after meeting with an accident near Gurugram.Earlier, Chautala was among the 39,000 students who had passed the Class 12 exam with 33% through open schooling. The board had passed all the students enrolled through distance mode with 33% as they could not conduct the exams due to the Covid-19 crisis.Chautala’s Class 12 result could not be declared as he remained absent in the Class 10 English exam under the National Institute of Open Schooling in 2017. He had passed Class 10 when he was lodged in Tihar jail while serving sentence in the teachers’ recruitment scam.BSEH chairman Jagbir Singh said he had congratulated Chautala’s personal assistant for the leader passing Class 10 English exam as the former CM was busy addressing a meeting.“He became the oldest student under our board to pass Class 10 exam. After he scored 88 marks in English, he passed Class 10 with first division. We will release Chautala’s Class 12 results after he writes an application that he has passed his compartment exam,” the board chairman said.Reacting to the INLD chief’s result, his son Abhay Singh Chautala said his father had quit studies due to family compulsions.“My grandfather Devi Lal was in politics. Chautala had left the school to take care in farming, and to educate his younger siblings. My father used to visit the Tihar jail library during his jail term where he read newspapers and books,” he said.‘Not easy for Chautala to get admission in UG course in govt college’As per educational experts, it is difficult for Chautala to get admission in an undergraduate course in any government college in Haryana as he had scored just 33% in Class 12.Thousands of students who had passed in the Class 12 exam through distance mode are protesting the board giving them 33% score and are accusing the BSEH for the poor result.“There is no chance that these 39,000 students along with Chautala can get admission in any government college in Haryana due to low percentage,” experts said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/op-chautala-scores-88-marks-in-class-10-english-compartment-exam-101630768043694.html
05-09-2021||Pune||Your Space: Reopen educational institutes in Pune for fully vaccinated||The administration is taking steps to resume offline classes at schools and colleges in Pune. Though the civic body claims to be prepared to tackle the anticipated third wave and reported cases of the virus variants, what steps should be taken to ensure students, staff and those related to running the institution are not exposed to a possible virus risk? Readers share views. Post second wave cases, avoid reopening of schools It is true that online education cannot replace the in-person teaching experience. Children are now glued to screens from morning till night and because of the current situation, there seems to be no way out of it. But as a parent, the idea of sending children to school still appears to be a risky one. We have seen that adults are not following the Covid preventive rules. It is a difficult task to control children’s behaviour when they get together with their friends. Even if all the teaching, non-teaching and supporting staff iare vaccinated, the vaccination of the children has not begun yet. So, how will we ensure that the virus won’t spread among them? I think parents would feel a lot safer if the Covid vaccine for the children is made available and after a major portion of the section is vaccinated, schools are reopened. Even in the case of adults the cases have been recorded even after full vaccination. So, even if the administration is saying that the Covid health infrastructure for the children is ready, learning from the second wave we should not take risks. Kavita Joshi Reopen schools under Covid safety cover Some parents are sceptical of reopening of schools, but there is also a huge section of them who are willing to send pupils to educational institutes. Though it is accepted that operations of educational institutions would not be as it was before the pandemic struck, we still need to find a way to reopen them. This is a matter of the entire generation. Recently, I read in newspapers that a task force has recommended guidelines to reopen schools. All the stakeholders should reflect on them. With some adjustments and precautions, educational establishments could be reopened. Teachers and non-teaching staff have been going to school for the day-to-day work. With few classes and batches of students, offline lessons could be restarted. Santosh Arkade Onus on college students to follow safety norms I have been missing my campus life. Most of my friends have taken at least the first dose of the vaccine. With proper precautions and fully vaccinated attendance, I think offline classes can be restarted. It is everyone’s personal responsibility to follow the Covid-appropriate behaviour. College students are adults and they should be responsible to follow these norms. Also, colleges should maintain sanitisation and hygiene at the campus and classrooms. College canteens could be a major hotspot for the transmission of the virus. So, it should be made sure that rules are followed there too. Also, most of the outstation students have given up their hostel and PG rooms. Proper guidelines will have to be issued for these establishments if students will have to return for offline classes. Dhanashree Bhagat Reopening of schools will help working parents Working parents are facing issues taking care of kids when schools are closed. Parents who work from home can manage, but those who need to step out for their respective jobs are facing many challenges. Also, the screen time of kids has increased exponentially. A solution has to be found to address this issue. There is still a risk of Covid infection, but offline classes for higher standards could be arranged. With vaccination, Covid-appropriate behaviour and alertness, classes can be resumed in campuses. Students are missing out on the experience of offline schooling and it is important for their personality development. Chitra Ingole Restart schools with 25% student count Schools have restarted in villages where there are no reported Covid cases. In the city, it is difficult to implement it because students come from across all localities. Instead of having offline classes for all of them at once, student count of one batch should be kept at 25% and parents can drop them at school instead of taking a school bus. Though it will cause inconvenience to many, it is worth taking keeping the safety of students and school staff in mind. Children have become irritated and frustrated sitting at home. School or colleges are socialising spaces for them. Once the vaccination of teaching and non-teaching staff is completed, schools could be reopened with only 1 or 2 classes. Then gradually it could be resumed fully. There is still a risk of the third wave, but we cannot be sure how many such waves would come. So, instead of stopping our lives, we have to find a way around it. Now when Covid cases are low, we can try to store as much experience of normal life with Covid-appropriate behaviour before another possible wave comes our way. Pradip Khengare Reopen offline classes for undergraduate, postgraduate programmes Reopening of educational institutes especially for the undergraduate and postgraduate programmes need to be considered by the government. Though education is being imparted through online format, there are many aspects of the on-campus education system which not only improves the efficiency of learning and teaching, but also contributes to the overall development of the students. It can be reopened in stages with priority to final year students. However, I feel that the reopening needs to be considered only when vaccination of the entire staff of the educational institution and the students is complete with two jabs of the vaccine. While, reopening of campuses of primary and secondary schools can be kept on hold for this academic year considering the fact that the vaccines for the age group below 18 years are yet to be available. Preeti Joshi Conduct offline classes for students with no access to online tools While the administration might be taking steps to reopen schools and colleges, it is important for us to remember the fact that the pandemic is not over yet. Resuming offline classes in areas where positivity rates are high and online learning is feasible, is a recipe for disaster. However, some students living in rural areas do not have access to the tools necessary for online education. Hence, schools and colleges should be reopened while online education is continued. Students who can continue with online education should be encouraged to do so; while other students should have an option of offline education available to them. When schools and colleges are reopened, social distancing norms must be followed and proper sanitisation should be maintained. Vaccines must be distributed quickly to all those who are in immediate need. Hoping to see a positive change in the future! Sara Kasture Staff should be fully vaccinated To ensure a Covid-safe environment for the students all necessary precautions such as wearing masks, social distancing, sanitising of hands and temperature checks should be followed before entering the campus. Schools and colleges should regularly disinfect classrooms and washrooms to maintain hygiene. The civic body should prioritise getting staff members vaccinated. If classes are conducted in multiple batches, it will provide adequate safety and reduce the risk of infection.

05-09-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: Reopening of theatres in Maharashtra state... after a long wait||I was writing about something else when there were multiple messages informing that theatres are set to open in Maharashtra on November 5. And there were suddenly multiple feelings and questions. There is no doubt in my mind that I am happy about this. Let me state this at the outset. There is a sense of relief too. After nearly eight months, theatres are set to open again and it is after six months that the government has made a concrete statement about theatres. The future of cinema halls is still uncertain, but we will get to that later. But when I read the WhatsApp message, I did not understand why they have chosen a date that is more than two months away. Of course, they have tried to explain it by saying that the workforce will need time to get the theatres in working condition and that the fifth of November is Global Marathi Theatre Day. I, somehow, am not too convinced with the logic. Theatres will not need two months to get back into working condition. As far as getting the entire machinery rolling is concerned, with the rehearsals, opening and booking theatre slots, time required for publicity, I still don’t think a wait time of two months is necessary. I wish they understood that it is going to take time to get the audience back in theatres. The culture of going out for a play or a movie has taken a hit. I have no doubt in my mind that it will resume, but it will take time! And the only way to deal with it is by restarting the theatres sooner. Any delay we cause in reopening theatres is going to delay this process further. Also, while theatre artists – both onstage and backstage – have definitely suffered during the past two years, there is very little conversation happening about theatre producers. When the term “producer” is heard, it is assumed that the person is wealthy and might not need any assistance from the state. That is far from the truth, especially in such extraordinary times. And producers will only benefit when performances restart! I don’t know how a fifty per cent capacity will help them, but it’s a start nonetheless! Also, coming back to the point of two months, malls were reopened on a much shorter notice. Only fully vaccinated people are allowed inside. The capacity of malls is much larger. Then why can’t this model be used? I am sure there are some explanations, then why aren’t those communicated to the public? Why is there such a blatant lack of communication between the artists and the government? It might also be a wait and watch policy with respect to the third wave. I mean, who can predict it anymore. Just typing “Third Wave in India” on Google will offer so many differing reports from reliable publications that it is best not to get in this debate! Whenever I go out of the house, I can see that life has resumed to normal, or at least it appears to be. Restaurants are crowded. People are roaming about on the street. In-person meetings are now being preferred over online ones. And this is just in a two hundred metre radius of my house. I have never understood the government apathy towards art forms, and since I work in theatre, I will say theatre. New theatres are built and are closed for renovation. Architecture of the venues isn’t planned well. Is it so hard to employ people with a good aesthetic sense? If we can do it for much smaller projects, why can’t the government? People from the theatre fraternity are seldom consulted about it. And this is just about the venue. I haven’t even started about policies and laws for artists. This is not a rant against any particular government, but about the attitude in general. This is not the first time I have written about it, and the way things are going, I am pretty sure it won’t be the last.

05-09-2021||Pune||Accused made ‘extra-judicial confession’ in Dabholkar murder case, says lawyer||Sachin Andure, one of the two alleged shooters of Narendra Dabholkar, allegedly made an extra-judicial confession about having killed him to a restaurant owner in Aurangabad days after the rationalist was found dead in Pune in 2013, special public prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi submitted in the case on Friday. The defence questioned the veracity and admissibility of the evidence.A new set of draft charges submitted by Suryavanshi include Sections 120(b) (criminal conspiracy) read with 302 (murder), 302 with 34 (common intention), and 302 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) along with Section 16 of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and Sections of Arms Act against the four accused in the murder. IPC Section 201 (destruction of evidence) has been invoked against a fifth accused.The defence urged SR Navander, the special judge appointed under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) to hear the case, to consider a trial involving all charge sheets submitted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), including the one which has contradicting claims about the pair of shooters who killed Dabholkar.Two bike-borne assailants shot dead Dabholkar in August 2013 and the investigation into the murder was handed over to the CBI a year later. In the first charge sheet filed in the case in September 2016, the CBI named Virendra Tawade as the main conspirator and Sarang Akolkar and Vinay Pawar as the shooters. A supplementary charge sheet was filed in February 2019, naming Andure and Sharad Kalaskar as the two shooters. Another charge sheet was filed in November 2019, against advocate Sanjiv Punalekar and his aide Vikram Bhave, naming them as co-conspirators.The CBI included the extrajudicial confession in the supplementary charge sheet. Along with this, the prosecution said there are four eyewitnesses to the confession.Advocate Virendra Ichalkaranjikar, who represents the accused, said two of the eyewitnesses identified the two men who were earlier named as shooters--Akolkar and Pawar. “The prosecution will not tell you this. When the first charge sheet was filed, one pair of men was incriminated, and my client was called the mastermind (Tawade). Three years later, another charge sheet is filed in which two different men are shooters, but my client is still the alleged mastermind.”Suryavanshi also cited the statement of businessman Sanjay Sadvilkar, who allegedly provided weapons to Tawade. Sadvilkar’s statement was recorded in the first charge sheet the CBI filed in 2016.Ichalkaranjikar said in the first charges sheet, Sadvilkar was quoted as saying the two men, who had come with Tawade were Akolkar and Pawar. “The CBI changed its course of direction later on. What they filed was a supplementary charge sheet. Once the first charge sheet is filed, the direction of the investigation is final.”Suryavanshi also referred to a forensic expert Nilesh Wagh’s psychological assessment of Andure, Kalaskar, and Punalekar, and added he said the statements made by the two shooters during the recreation of the crime scene were truthful.Ichalkaranjikar questioned the admissibility of the expert opinion.“Even after a polygraph/narco test, what is the evidential value of Wagh’s inputs? None. Just like there is no evidential value to a statement of a co-accused against an accused,” said Ichalkaranjikar.On August 20, eight years after Dabholkar was killed, the CBI submitted “draft charges” in the special UAPA court that will hear the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/accused-made-extra-judicial-confession-in-dabholkar-murder-case-says-prosecution-as-defence-questions-veracity-101630740624376.html
