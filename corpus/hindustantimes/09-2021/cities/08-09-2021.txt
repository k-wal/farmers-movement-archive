Yogi Adityanath, who reviewed preparations for Modi’s visit with senior officials of the district, said 400 colleges in Aligarh, Etah, Kasganj and Hathras districts would get affiliated to the upcoming university. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi would allocate land to investors investing about ₹1500 crore in Aligarh node of defence corridor. The chief minister visited the site of the defence corridor and inspected the model of the upcoming state University. “Beside traditional education, this university would provide education in skill development and also offer job-oriented courses. The university will become an axis for development of Aligarh,” he said. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given sanction for six nodes of the defence corridor in Agra, Aligarh, Lucknow, Jhansi, Chitrakoot and Kanpur. For the Aligarh node of defence industrial corridor, 200 acres of land have been reserved. The Prime Minister will also allocate land to 19 investors investing about ₹1500 crore in this defence corridor in Aligarh,” said the CM. “Aligarh district is known for its hardware products and locks. The hardware industry has been included in One District One Product plan. Now Aligarh would also be known for defence equipment manufactured in the defence industrial corridor,” Yogi said. “The Prime Minister’s visit symbolizes the respect which both state and central government hold for great reformist Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh and the programme on September 14 would be a tribute to him. Youths of Aligarh would not only get an opportunity for modern education but also find job avenues. The association with defence corridor project would further strengthen the commitment towards ‘Made In India’” said Yogi. AMU, other parties forgot Raja’s generosity: Yogi Chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath on Wednesday complained that except the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), all other parties and even the Aligarh Muslim University ( AMU) forgot the generosity and martyrdom of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh who provided land to AMU on which the present varsity stood. It was the BJP, which was showing respect for Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh, he claimed. Addressing BJP leaders and party workers during his Aligarh visit on Wednesday, he said,” Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh was a great freedom fighter thinker, reformer and writer and it was his concern for education that he gave land for Aligarh Muslim University and worked for spread of education in the nation. It was, however, unfortunate that AMU and other political parties forgot the generosity of the Raja,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pm-to-lay-stones-of-state-varsity-aligarh-node-of-defence-corridor-up-cm-101631125782963.html

This was revealed in the latest Geographic Information Survey (GIS). Despite having a number of tax inspectors, LMC has been unable to locate these properties which are within the municipal limits. As a result, apart from loss of property tax, these houses have also not been paying sewer and water tax to Jal Sansthan. Sardar Patel ward corporator Girish Mishra said, “The officials of LMC are responsible for these missing properties. Presently there are 5,75,238 properties registered with LMC for paying tax. But only 4.3 lakh houses are paying regular property tax to LMC, while there are 1.75 lakh houses which have not paid any sort of tax even once.” These startling figures were highlighted when the GIS report was presented in front of officials last Sunday. Municipal Commissioner Ajay Dwivedi said, “The GIS report has revealed some new properties and LMC is doing physical verification of these properties, which is essential before reaching any conclusion. All these properties would be brought into the tax system of LMC. However, LMC is still evaluating these properties and a final report is awaited.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-municipal-corporation-has-no-records-of-44-862-houses-finds-gi-survey-101631125182385.html
08-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai records over 500 Covid cases first time in 7 weeks||Even as the state’s daily Covid-19 caseload continues to hover around 4,200 for the past few weeks, Mumbai’s figures have been steadily increasing, making it a cause for concern for authorities. Although authorities clarified that curbs would not be re-imposed immediately, local authorities have been directed to take due precautions to avoid crowding during Ganeshotsav. Maharashtra reported 4,174 new infections, taking its tally to 6,497,872, while Mumbai, for the first time in seven weeks (since July 15), crossed the 500-cases mark. The city on Wednesday reported 532 new cases. The Covid-19 case tally has now gone up to 747,605, while Mumbai also reported four deaths due to Covid-19, taking the toll to 16,004. Over the past two weeks, the number of Covid-19 cases in the city has been steadily increasing. Mumbai reported less than 300 cases per day until the last two weeks of August, which increased to over 300 cases since. There are 4,273 active cases in the city.The tally of active cases slightly reduced to 47,880 as 4,155 recoveries were reported in the last 24 hours. It also saw 65 casualties and the total number of fatalities stood at 137,962. Ahmednagar reported the highest toll with 12 deaths. It was followed by Raigad with 11 fatalities.State again registered highest one-day inoculation on Wednesday by administering 1,455,749 doses till 9pm, taking the tally of doses administered to 65,520,560. Though the state stands second in total doses given, it tops chart of fully vaccinated citizens in the county. A total of 17,978,805 citizens in the state have got both their doses, while 47,541,755 people have been inoculated with their first dose. “The health machinery of the state is making all the efforts to make our vaccination drive against Covid-19 pandemic successful and setting records as well. On September 4, we vaccinated 1,227,224 people and on August 21, 1,104,465 doses were vaccinated,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, health department.Amid the threat of crowding during Ganeshotsav, government banned physical “darshan” of Ganesh idols at pandals during the ten-day Ganeshotsav festival starting from September 10. An order issued by the home department has stated, “Darshan shall be made available online by the organisors.”“The decision was taken considering the rise in daily cases in Mumbai and other areas. We all know that lakhs of devotees visit community mandaps for physical darshan of Ganesh, which ultimately will result in crowding. We are not in a position to take any sort of risk, when a threat of a potential third wave is looming large on us,” said a senior health official, wishing not to be named.State, however, is unlikely to re-impose curbs anytime soon as the authorities feel, that there is no rise in cases in the state, barring a few exceptions.Dr Vyas, made a presentation before the state cabinet on the Covid situation. “He (Dr Pradeep Vyas) informed us that though there is no rise in daily cases, but our testing has been reduced significantly. Earlier, the state used to conduct over two million tests a day, which has been reduced to around 1.7 million a day. It also means that the active cases may be more than what we are seeing today,” said a senior minister, requesting anonymity.There are five districts, including Mumbai whereas rise in Covid-19 cases has been experienced and most cases are coming from these areas only. In the 10 days (between August 29 and September 9), the state has reported 41,425 cases, of them 28,373 (68.49%) cases comes from Pune (9,062 cases), Ahmednagar (7,544 cases), Satara (4,261 cases), Mumbai (3,919 cases) and Solapur (3,587 cases), according to a presentation prepared by the state health department.Going by the prediction made by experts, the state government is expecting a rise in Covid-19 cases between September 15 and the first week of October, which could also be the beginning of the third wave. In the last 24 hours, the state tested 179,408 samples and had a positivity rate of 2.32%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 11.74%, according to the data issued by the state health department.Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap has demanded for the opening up of film and drama theatres and swimming pools at the earliest as these sectors and the workforce dependent on them are suffering hardships. Jagtap said the entertainment industry has suffered losses of Rs4,800 crore in the last 18 months because of the lockdown. He has also demanded to resume 23 BEST routes, which have been discontinued from September1.

08-09-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP picks new election team, aims to strike caste balance||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership on Wednesday put into effect Mission UP 2022, appointing a new election team headed by Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, an Other Backward Classes (OBC) leader from Odisha, for Uttar Pradesh where the assembly election is due early next year.The new election panel described by a BJP leader as “Team Modi in UP” also combines an interesting caste mix for the polls. The team headed by an OBC, has a Dalit, a Rajput, a Vokkaliga, a Bhumihar, a Brahmin, Yadav and a Jat.While playing on the perceived neglect of the community, various opposition parties have been wooing Brahmins. Yadavs are considered loyal to the Samajwadi Party, the state’s main opposition party.As for the Jats, the ongoing farmers’ protest against the Centre’s three new farm reform laws mainly comprises Jats, party leaders admitted. The appointment of the new election panel also coincided with the resignation of Uttarakhand governor Baby Rani Maurya, a Dalit leader from Agra in Uttar Pradesh, two years ahead of the closure of her five-year gubernatorial term. BJP leaders indicated that she could be given some key political assignment in UP. Suspense is rife about her new role, especially with four names for MLCs yet to be declared and a possible ministry expansion of the Yogi Adityanath government still on the cards. The BJP’s new UP panel has Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal, a Dalit from Rajasthan, Anurag Thakur, a Rajput from Himachal Pradesh, Saroj Pandey, a woman Brahmin leader from Chhattisgarh, Shobha Karandlaje, a woman leader belonging to the Vokkaliga (upper caste) from Karnataka, Rajya Sabha member Vivek Thakur, son of party veteran from Bihar CP Thakur, a Bhumihar, former Haryana minister Captain Abhimanyu, a Jat, and Annapurna Devi, a Yadav. “Captain Abhimanyu, a member of the UP election panel is a Jat who has relationships in western UP. In Vivek Thakur, we have a Bhumihar leader. While the community may just have about 2 per cent vote bank, it has sizeable pockets of influence in eastern UP. As luck would have it after the appointment of Manoj Sinha as the lieutenant governor of Jammu and Kashmir, we just have Surya Pratap Shahi, the agriculture minister of UP, as a Bhumihar face so the new appointment is just right,” a BJP leader said. “It does appear to be a caste bouquet for a state due for elections and where caste matters have a huge impact. But mind you, these leaders are not just about caste for together they pack great experience and expertise,” said Irshad Ilmi, a veteran journalist. When asked if Baby Rani Maurya’s resignation as Uttarakhand governor and the likelihood of her assuming an active role in politics came as a surprise, a BJP leader said, “That’s the beauty of the new BJP. Such surprises have become routine now and it’s difficult to pick the party leadership’s mind.” “You may recall in 2019 the BJP leadership had got Phagu Chauhan, six- term lawmaker from Ghosi assembly constituency in eastern UP, to quit as MLA and appointed him as Bihar governor ahead of the assembly polls in the neighbouring state. In Babyji’s case, it could well be a case of a governor quitting for re-entry into active politics,” a party leader said. Baby Rani Maurya had unsuccessfully contested the assembly election from Etmadpur seat in Agra in 2007. The BJP also named in-charges for all six organisational regions of UP. Lok Sabha MP Sanjay Bhatia has been put in charge of western UP. Bihar lawmaker Sanjeev Chaurasia will look after the Braj region. National secretary Satya Kumar will be in charge of the Awadh region. The BJP’s national co-treasurer Sudhir Gupta has been made in charge of Kanpur region. The Gorakhpur region in charge is national secretary Arvind Menon and Sunil Ojha would look after the Kashi region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-bjp-picks-new-election-team-aims-to-strike-caste-balance-101631125002647.html

During its first ward sabha held on Saturday, Sahakar nagar citizens’ forum (SCF) asked Pune Municipal Corporation to address the menace of stray dogs and start shuttle bus service between Sahakarnagar and Swargate. Following the ward Sabha, Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML) started the bus service on Tuesday while Mayor Murlidhar Mohol, who also attended the meeting said the civic body will look into other demands. More than 200 members/residents signed-up on-the-spot to discuss and present their issues to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials. Besides Mayor, ward officer Pradnya Potdar; divisional commissioner Jayant Bhosekar; elected corporators Aba Bagul, Ashwini Kadam and Mahesh Sable; and nominated member Subhash Jagtap were also present. “Almost all bus routes from Sahakar nagar have been terminated over the past few years citing losses but citizens demanded better public transport connectivity and during the ward sabha, PMPML traffic manager Zende and PMPML director – the mayor himself, took a spot decision to start a shuttle service from Sahakar nagar to Swargate,” said Amit Abhyangkar of SCF. “From some documents that SCF procured through the right to information (RTI), we realised that three tenders had been awarded and work completed on the jogging track using paver blocks at Tulshibagwale colony ground. However, we did not find any such track on the ground,” Abhyangkar said. On the issue of stray dogs where there have been an increasing number of clashes between dog lovers and citizens afraid of canines. “We filed an RTI and found out that a person has been awarded a contract for neutering dogs. But while the tender is for neutering 1,000 dogs per month, only 992 dogs have been neutered over the past 18 months. Also, the contractor is not following tender norms. When this discussion came up, a health department official who was present at the sabha assured that the contract terms will be enforced,” Abhyangkar informed. Mayor Mohol tweeted about the success of the ward sabha and urged others to follow in the footsteps of SCF to facilitate direct interaction between residents and authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sahakarnar-citizens-forum-calls-for-action-against-stray-dogs-101631124885466.html

The cash-strapped PMC could ill afford this as cash compensation for the Katraj to Kondhwa road-widening project alone would have cost it a whopping Rs700 crore. Besides, costs have been further escalating due to delays in project completion. The civic body has already missed the original September deadline for widening of the Katraj to Kondhwa road on account of land acquisition.Vikram Kumar, municipal commissioner, said, “It has become a tough task to complete a big project with cash compensation, so we plan to use credit bonds. These can be given to people whose land falls under the project instead of cash.”Credit certificates will now be issued to land owners which can be used while paying tax returns to the PMC.“Once the proposal is approved by the standing committee, the PMC plans to use credit bonds in other major projects as well. Credit bonds seem the most feasible option right now for fast-tracking development projects,” said a corporation official on the condition of anonymity.The widening of the 17km Shivane to Kharadi road was proposed in 2016 and it was originally scheduled for completion in 2018. Nearly three years past the original deadline however and the project is still incomplete.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-to-acquire-land-for-road-widening-projects-via-credit-bond-101631124884806.html

The survey revealed that commonly occurring health issues in women such as PCOS, breast cancer and endometriosis are still subject to taboos and stereotypes, reflecting the current state of women’s health in India in poor light. As part of the study – aimed at finding the social, cultural and medical outlook for working women and arriving at solutions involving various stakeholders – women working in white-collar jobs shared details of the health-related stigmas they face and how these lead to social pressures and professional issues.The study found that though nearly 50% of the working women surveyed are either diagnosed with or know someone else diagnosed with issues such as infertility, breast cancer and PCOS, they are still hesitant to discuss them despite most employers taking initiatives to help address these health issues. More than 80% of the women studied also felt that their male colleagues lack sensitivity when it comes to women’s health-related concerns. Moreover, 52% of the working women studied found it difficult to manage their health alongside work, with the percentage of such women being the highest in the retail sector (67%).Namita Thapar, executive director, Emcure Pharmaceuticals, said, “The study indicates that besides health issues, there are multiple professional and societal stereotypes that women are exposed to, which can lead to stigmatization and affect their professional performance. Ignorance and lack of awareness and acceptance will only make these issues more difficult to diagnose and resolve.”Preeti Karmarkar of Nari Samata Manch, a Pune-based women’s organisation that deals with violence against women including domestic violence and sexual harassment at the workplace, said, “These findings, though unfortunate, reflect our gender realities. The prevalent patriarchal gender system is dichotomous, giving more social power to men over women. The discomfort that women experience talking about health issues and the insensitivity of men towards their women colleagues is a telling comment on our society. Along with these concerns reflected in the study, sexual harassment at the workplace is another problem that women encounter. It shows that much effort is required to develop gender-friendly workplaces where women will be seen as equal partners.”The survey also found that over 90% of working women face a conflict of interest while balancing familial/personal and professional obligations and about 84% working women have faced stereotypes/ judgments around their period (menstruation cycle) such as being told not to go near sacred places or into the kitchen or even to hide their sanitary napkins. The study also found that 66% of working women think society considers women suffering from endometriosis as unsuitable for marriage||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/50-of-women-not-comfortable-discussing-health-issues-survey-101631124884092.html

The woman’s statement to NIA also revealed that Vaze had been paying her ₹50,000 every month since August 2020, two months after he was reinstated in service.The 36-year-old-woman, a resident of Mira Road, is separated from her husband and works as an escort. She told the agency that she met Vaze in 2011 and that he became her client in 2013.According to the statement, Vaze was thereafter in continuous touch with her. Initially, he had allegedly lied to her saying he was a businessman but later told her that he was a police officer under suspension at the time. The woman had business relations with Vaze and the two had started two firms in 2016 in the name of the woman’s son. It was allegedly Vaze’s idea to set up firms to deal in rental of electric two-wheelers. As Vaze was not earning well then, he had told her she should put her escort service money and buy some four-wheelers and rent them out to support her.In 2017, Vaze had allegedly asked the woman to become a director in one of his companies, set up to create a chain of maintenance workshops for two-wheelers and rental franchises. The woman claimed she invested ₹17 lakh in the company, but due to lack of support from two other partners, the business could not be started. She added that in 2019, Vaze tried to revive the business and changed it to rental of electric two-wheelers. In January-February 2020, Vaze purchased 30 electric scooters for the company at the cost of ₹15 lakh, however the company did not make profits in view of the Covid-19 lockdown.In June 2020, Vaze asked the woman to stop working as an escort as he was reinstated in service and would earn enough to support her. Following this, Vaze started paying ₹50,000 per month to the woman since August 2020.The woman was spotted visiting Vaze in a posh south Mumbai hotel on February 18 and 20 this year. NIA questioned her over images preserved on the scanning machines installed at the entrance of the hotel which showed pictures similar to bundles of currency notes.The woman told NIA that on February 15 she had visited Vaze’s office near Crawford Market and collected ₹40 lakh from him and then returned the same to him on February 18 at the five-star hotel after sorting and removing old notes from the bundles. She further said that Vaze told her to remove notes with 786 in their numbers.Further, while leaving the hotel on February 19, the woman took ₹36 lakh cash with her and returned it to Vaze the next day.The agency has found ₹1.5 crore in the bank account of the company in which she was a director. When questions, the woman told the agency that only Vaze could tell who had credited the money in the company’s accounts.She also failed to give satisfactory answers when questioned about ₹39 lakh in her bank account. She has, however, stated that she was not earning anything from any of the companies formed by her.The agency has also found that she had removed ₹5 lakh from a bank locker held jointly by her and Vaze on March 18, five days after Vaze’s arrest. The woman allegedly handed the money to her brother, asking hi m to find a good lawyer in case she was arrested. The woman later fled to her hometown Banaras along with her son.The case against Vaze and nine others pertains to the recovery of the explosives-laden vehicle near Antilia, residence of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, on February 25. A note threatening his family was also recovered from the vehicle. Thereafter on March 5, the body Thane-based auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran, who owned the said vehicle, was found in a creek at Reti Bunder near Mumbra.NIA subsequently took over the investigation and arrested Vaze in connection with both cases. Vaze was dismissed from service in May. The investigating agency later also arrested encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma and four others — Santosh Shelar, Anand Jadhav, Manish Soni and Satish Mothukari — in connection with the murder case. The agency claimed that the four accused acted on the instructions of Vaze and others, and allegedly strangled Hiran to death and dumped the body in the creek.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/woman-seen-with-sachin-vaze-at-five-star-hotel-in-mumbai-was-an-escort-nia-101631123862314.html

The redevelopment of the colony, which houses around 3,700 families, is expected to generate 33,000 additional homes, the government said. Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada), which is the nodal agency for the project, got clearance from the state cabinet that granted ‘special project status’ to the redevelopment.Motilal Nagar 1, 2 and 3 were built in 1960 to chiefly house people belonging to the economically weak sections. Though it has 200-sqft houses, many have extended their rooms owing to paucity of space. According to a statement from the chief minister’s office, there are around 5,300 tenements, including 1,600 hutments and slums and 3,700 houses on the 50ha land. The project will be executed by the developer under redevelopment guidelines for 33(5) of the Development Control & Promotion Regulations (DCPR), 2034 on behalf of Mhada. “The tender for the project will be finalised based on the agency that will provide the maximum share of the remaining built-up area (BUA) to Mhada, excluding the rehabilitation portion,” the statement said.Out of the approved area of 1,600 sqft for residential, the developer will bear the cost of construction for 833.80 sqft additional area being given as per the redevelopment guidelines, the statement added. Similarly, for an approved area of 978 sqft for non-residential use, the developer will bear the cost of construction for 502.83 sqft under the said guidelines.Housing minister Jitendra Awhad tweeted after the cabinet, “#MHADA will redevelop the biggest layout #MotilalNagar in # Mumbai...Changing skyline of #Mumbai...#BDD to start with A better life in a better place (sic).”Expedite BDD redevelopment work, CM tells officialsChief Minister Uddhav Thackeray took stock of the progress on the redevelopment of the BDD Chawls in Mumbai and directed officials to expedite the work.

I went to ask for the keys but the guards (in the lobby) refused saying they needed permission from their superiors,” said Singh in his police complaint. Singh alleged that the guards then misbehaved and assaulted him.Upon hearing the commotion, several residents gathered in the lobby area hearing the commotion, he said.Singh, in the complaint, said he suffered several injuries and that when he tried to retaliate, he was held back by another resident.Despite multiple attempts, Singh could not be reached for comment.A guard at the society, who did not wish to be named, said that Singh created the ruckus first when he pulled the guard on duty by his collar and slapped him for refusing to give him the key.Police said an eyewitness called the local police post in-charge, following which a team of personnel was rushed to the spot.“A case has been registered against the security-in charge and another guard based on the complaint of the resident. The matter allegedly escalated after he slapped a guard but the way he was attacked was very brutal. We have detained eight security personnel and are questioning them. We are scanning the CCTV footage also. Due action will be taken against all erring parties,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.Tej Prakash, president of the Apartment Owners Association of Lotus Boulevard society, said, “Following the incident, we immediately called for a resident’s forum. It has been decided that the security agency needs to be changed. We will come up with a plan in the next few days”Residential bodies across the city have condemned the incident.“Internal discords result in such unpleasant situations. Engaging untrained/ unskilled security personnels is another reason for such unfortunate situations.

The most important of these shortcomings was the availability of medical oxygen,” the CM said. As on Tuesday, 88 out of the 190 proposed oxygen plants have become functional in Madhya Pradesh so far, Chouhan said. “These 88 plants have a generation capacity of 45,890 litres per minute,” he added. With the start of oxygen production in Madhya Pradesh, now there will be no need to get the life saving gas from other states, Chouhan said. “Our target is to set up oxygen plants at tehsil-levels and all the district headquarters. Besides, oxygen concentrators have been provided at places where oxygen plants are not installed,” he added. There are total 52 districts in the state. Chouhan said out of the 190 oxygen plants proposed in MP, 102 are being set up with the help of the Centre. On Tuesday, MP reported 11 new cases of coronavirus, taking the tally of infections to 7,92,281, while the death toll stood at 10,516 as no fresh casualty were reported during the day, as per official data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/88-oxygen-generation-plants-operational-in-madhya-pradesh-cm-chouhan-101631121046180.html
08-09-2021||Mumbai||High population, fewer Covid cases: BMC study on Mumbai wards inconclusive||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) month-long study, which started in the end of July, is inconclusive on why some civic wards reported fewer novel coronavirus cases despite high population. The BMC is now awaiting the results of the fifth serological survey in order to connect the dots with their initial findings of the study. Officials said this exercise will help them understand if sero prevalence was a factor leading to high or low burden of Covid-19 cases in some wards. HT had reported earlier that since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, wards A (Fort), B (Dongri) and C (Kalbadevi) saw the fewest infections among all 24 wards. For instance, on April 7 last year, when the city was at the peak of the first wave, these three wards had fewer than seven cases each. On the same day, however, G-South (Elphinstone) ward, by D (Nana Chowk), E (Byculla) and K-West (Andheri West) ward saw 78, 59, 46 and 43 cases, respectively, the highest number of patients across all wards. The ward-wise difference is also visible in the data shared by the BMC. For instance, till September 6 this year, B ward recorded a total of 3,963 cases, the lowest in the city. It is followed by C and A wards, with 6,896 and 16,571 cases, respectively. On the other hand, K-W (Andheri West) has recorded 55,613 cases, the highest in the city. Similarly, R-Central (Borivli) and K-East (Andheri East) have registered 51,898 and 46,625 cases so far. Anticipating a third wave, the BMC decided to study the infection pattern of Sars-CoV-2—the virus that causes Covid-19, but the results have been inconclusive. “We have found that some wards have performed more tests, which pushed their cumulative Covid-19 cases. But testing is directly proportional to the number of infected patients. A ward with more active patients will record more tests, as it also includes contact tracing. Thus, it doesn’t prove that testing is the only reason for ward-wise Covid-19 disparity,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC. He also added that higher population was also considered as one of the contributing factors. A few crowded wards like L (Kurla) and M/East (Deonar, Govandi), with a population of more than 800,000 and 900,000, respectively (as per the Census 2011), recorded fewer Covid-19 cases. “We couldn’t find an explanation why some crowded wards recorded higher cases while others didn’t. The findings therefore haven’t been conclusive,” he added. To understand if sero-prevalence was the reason behind fewer Covid-19 cases in some wards, the BMC has conducted a fifth ward-wise serological survey which will help them gauge how many people in a population have been infected with Covid-19 and have developed antibodies. The results are expected to be announced this week. Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair hospital, Mumbai Central, stated that prevalence of a virus depends on various factors such as size of the population, movement of the public, demography and prevalence of antibodies. “As seen in the previous sero surveys, a large number of slum dwellers and younger population have developed antibodies which help curb fast transmission of the virus. So, there is a possibility that wards with higher young demography may have developed better resistance against the virus which is attributed in controlling its spread. This hypothesis can be established with the latest sero survey,” he said. The BMC has predicted that the city could record 1.25 lakh Covid-19 cases in the anticipated third wave. So, it is essential for the BMC to chalk out the reasons behind ward-wise variation of Covid-19 cases, which will help them plan better if the city witnesses another surge, said BMC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/high-population-fewer-covid-cases-bmc-study-on-mumbai-wards-inconclusive-101631121943922.html

All patients are undergoing treatment at home, officials said.The district had reported at least 250 dengue cases last year when the pandemic hit the nation. The first case was found on September 15, but no instance of double infection (Covid and dengue) was reported then. District epidemiologist Dr Sunil Hari said after it wreaked havoc in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the department is on high alert.“We have started preparing a flu ward and special OPD services that were earlier being used for coronavirus patients. Sampling will be increased and private labs have been asked to report every case to the department,” he added. There are currently five active cases of Covid in the district. Dr Hari said the larva of female aedes aegypti mosquito is mostly found in the back tray of refrigerators filled with water and empty tires. Dr Kuldeep Singh, chief medical officer, said several teams are checking coolers and other objects at houses and alerting the residents about the larva that can develop into mosquitoes within 14 days.“We are also advising patients to stay in bed nets as if a mosquito bites the infected person, it can act as a carrier and might infect others,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/five-cases-of-dengue-reported-in-ambala-101631120623533.html

Mohol asked the municipal commissioner to supply water to the merged villages through water tankers if needed.In what was the first PMC general body meeting held offline after a long gap, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) members Yogesh Sasane, Deepali Dhumal and others demanded that the water crisis in these merged villages be urgently resolved. While the corporation had started recovering water tax from these villages, no attention had been paid to the water shortage they were facing even during the rainy season, the NCP members said. The crisis was acute in the Uruli Devachi and Phursungi villages, they pointed out.Responding to their demand, the mayor said, “If necessary, the municipal administration should provide additional water tankers. Even the commissioner will call a meeting with these members in the next two or three days and sort out their problem.”Meanwhile, the mayor assured that all three general body meetings this month would be conducted offline if possible. He said that he was in favour of holding the meetings offline and had written several letters to the state government to that effect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/supply-water-to-merged-villages-through-tankers-if-necessary-mayor-to-pmc-101631120441381.html

An outbreak of the Nipah virus is currently seen in Kerala.Leveraging the large footprint of Truenat machines deployed across the country for diagnosis of infectious diseases such as TB, Covid-19, and Hepatitis, a Truenat testing kit for he Nipah virus will help diagnose eh virus rapidly, on demand, and closer to affected people, resulting in effective management of the disease and containment of the spread of the virus. The kit has been made in collaboration with a Goa- based firm Molbio Diagnostics.Sriram Natarajan, director and CEO of Molbio Diagnostics said, “Covid-19 has brought out the importance of early and accurate testing for better disease management. Truenat is the first platform to be authorised by the DGCI for Nipah virus testing.” Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging zoonotic disease that causes severe infections in humans. Signs and symptoms range from asymptomatic to acute respiratory infection and fatal encephalitis. Prior to the current reported case from Kozhikode, when a 12-year old boy died on September 5, India had reported three NiV outbreaks in the past - Siliguri in 2001, Nadia in 2007 (West Bengal) and Kozhikode and Malappuram in Kerala in 2018.“The R&D work on the Truenat test for Nipah virus was first started in 2018 in collaboration with the National Institute of Virology, Pune (ICMR), to enable the detection of the infectious virus during outbreak situations. The ability to quickly deploy the platform to the point of need and the rapid testing capability makes it a powerful tool in diagnosis and containment of the Nipah virus. This collaboration with NIV allows us to react quickly in times emergencies,” said Dr. Chandrasekhar Nair, director of the company.Truenat is a battery-operated, IoT-enabled point of care RT-PCR platform developed and manufactured by Molbio. The platform can test for nearly 30 diseases, and results take less than an hour. Truenat is a WHO approved frontline platform for TB diagnosis and approved by ICMR for TB, Covid-19 and other diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nivs-truenat-test-kit-gets-emergency-use-approval-from-dcgi-for-nipah-virus-101631120201423.html

The case was registered against the Bhujbals and others in 2015 on a complaint of a Chembur resident who claimed that the company had planned to sell 2,344 flats and had collected ₹44 crores but had not developed the project.Additional session’s judge HS Satbhai allowed the discharge application of all four persons, under section 239 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) for discharge.The complaint was registered on June 13, 2015, by one Yunus Shaikh. Sameer and Kesarkar appeared when summons were issued against them and were granted bail immediately.The state claimed that the four applicants who have applied for discharge are directors of Devisha Infrastructure Private Limited (DIPL). The applicants along with others hatched a conspiracy and projected that they will develop project Hexworld on 25-acres of land in Kharghar. However, they were fully aware that DIPL had no lands in its name, no construction permission and no possession of the land. They misrepresented to potential flat buyers by concealing the above facts with a view to cheat them and sold 2,344 flats and collected ₹44.04 crores from buyers. The possession of the flats was delayed, the construction has been completed only up to the plinth, and till 2011 DIPL had no permission to undertake any constructions. The sale proceeds were deposited in a designated account, however, the same was not used for construction and was siphoned off for personal use of the applicants. Neither the booking amount was refunded nor the flat was handed over to the flat purchasers. The charge sheet was filed in the matter on February 25, 2016.The Bhujbals and the other two applicants were represented by advocate Sajal Yadav and Sudarshan Khawase, who argued that Alibag magistrate court, after going through the documents, had said there is no prima facie evidence to infer that since the date when the accused’s company started receiving booking amount, there was an intention on the part of the accused to cheat the informants and the witnesses. The court had also said that a case is not made out against the accused under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code for cheating. To charge a person for cheating there has to be any intent in this case the directors had no fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making the promise. The inability of fulfilling contractual obligations due to reasons beyond the control without culpable intent is not an offence.The court after hearing both the parties on Wednesday discharged the four applicants and posted the matter on September 20 for further hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-relief-for-pankaj-sameer-bhujbal-in-2015-case-101631119902711.html

The arrested men were identified as Vicky alias Vitul Vaman Kshirsagar (33), a resident of Sane Guruji nagar near Ambala canal in Pune; Manoj Sambhaji Patole (33), also a resident of the same area; and Mahesh Inderjit Agarwal (25), a resident of Lohia nagar. The men were arrested around 10pm on Tuesday by a joint team of unit three and unit four of the Pune police crime branch.“We are looking for two more people in the case. The weapons they were carrying were quite deadly. The complainant had come to me after looking at the CCTV after the incident happened over suspicions about these men,” said Amitabh Gupta, commissioner of Pune police.Kshirsagar, who is the main accused, is hopeful for his brother Rakesh Kshirsagar to win in the upcoming local body elections in Pune. The 33-year-old man also used to work for the BJP member whose murder he was arrested for plotting.“The case has been strategically registered in the light of upcoming elections. The allegations are baseless and a case has been registered purely based on suspicion against the accused. The court has rejected the demand for seven days police custody,” read a statement from defence lawyer Vijaysinh Thombare.The plot took place in a restaurant called Hotel Saffron on Shastri road in Navi peth at around 3pm on September 3. Kshirsagar arrived at the restaurant while Ghate was drinking tea – both with a few men accompanying them. The complainant submitted that Kshirsagar desisted from attacking him because Ghate was with multiple party workers and outnumbered his alleged potential attacker.“The complainant tells us that the main accused probably believed that killing him would clear the path for his brother in the local body elections,” said commissioner Gupta.After learning about Kshirsagar‘s intention, Ghate claims to have checked the CCTV footage of the restaurant where he was drinking tea to find that the accused were carrying a bag which was later found with deadly sharp weapons.A case under sections 115, 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) of Indian penal code was registered at Vishram Bagh Police Station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3-remanded-to-police-custody-for-plotting-murder-of-bjp-corporator-dheeraj-ghate-101631119781418.html

So much so, that a Whatsapp group comprising the residents and Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) officials has been formed to address the problem. Notwithstanding, power outages continue to occur frequently, the residents pointed out.Sathi Nair, a resident and member of the Koregaon park mohalla committee, ward number 21, said, “We were facing this issue earlier as well but the frequency of power outages has increased since last month. The problem has become severe. The daily lives of residents are getting impacted because of this problem. Because of the pandemic, many are working from home. Power outages have become a serious issue in their professional lives as well. For us, it is really annoying because power gets cut-off unexpectedly at any time…”Some residents claimed that their electrical appliances have suffered damage due to fluctuations in power supply, not to mention the additional expenditure of electricity generators that housing societies have had to endure.Ashutosh Nanda, a resident of Koregaon park, said, “My refrigerator turned inoperative because of this issue. We have constantly written to the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) regarding this problem but it has not been resolved. Officials keep giving inexcusable explanations for the problem. We have been paying our bills on time, that too for frequently interrupted power supply!”Asked about the problem faced by residents, MSEDCL officials claimed that power outage issues can occur during the rainy season. “Power outage may happen if it is raining or the mainline trips. It cannot be denied that power outages do occur but they are not all that frequent. I will have to collect more data on how many times outages have occurred,” said Satish Kulkarni, additional executive engineer, Wadia sub-division, Pune MSEDCL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/koregaon-park-area-residents-see-red-over-frequent-power-outages-101631119721339.html

08-09-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow may host Junior Men’s Hockey World Cup again||Hockey India, the game’s governing body in the country, has reportedly “approached” the Uttar Pradesh government and Uttar Pradesh Hockey to host the 12th edition of the 2021 Men’s Junior World Cup in Lucknow from November 24 to December 5.The state capital earlier hosted the event in 2016 when Mandeep Singh-led India won their second trophy, beating Belgium 2-1. India lifted their maiden trophy in 2001 when they defeated Argentina 6-1 at Hobart in Australia.The event was originally scheduled to be played at Guwahati, but due to some uncertainty, Hockey India has approached Uttar Pradesh Hockey. The hosting rights for the 2023 event have already been given to Malaysia.“Things have changed a lot since the Covid-19 pandemic halted domestic hockey in March last year. Now, we are hoping to have the event in Lucknow on the same dates,” a Hockey India insider said on condition of anonymity.He confirmed that Hockey India officials visited the state capital last week to take stock of the situation.“Everything is perfect in Lucknow, both at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium at the Guru Gobind Singh Sports College and also at the Padma Shri Mohd Shahid Hockey Stadium at Vijayant Khand Stadium in Gomti Nagar,” he added.The official said that the 2016 event was a great success with the presence of a 20,000-strong crowd at the Dhyan Chand Stadium.“Eight players from the 2016 gold-winning Indian team were part of the (national) team which won a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics,” he said, adding, “Lucknow has always been a lucky place for Indian hockey. Here, the sport lives in everybody’s heart.”He, however, said that unlike the 2016 event when a huge sum was spent, especially on relaying the turf at the Dhyan Chand Stadium and construction of Mohd Shahid Stadium, the event won’t require big expenditure this time.“Hockey India has already approached the state government and we are expecting a positive response soon,” said the official, adding, “The event would boost the sporting stature of Uttar Pradesh as well as Indian and Uttar Pradesh hockey.”The move comes soon after India ended a 41-year medal drought in hockey with the men’s team winning silver at the Olympics after 41 years at the Tokyo Games last month. Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised Indian hockey in his “Man Ki Baat” programme on the occasion of the National Sports Day on August 29.The Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government felicitated the Indian hockey team and six other medalists at the Tokyo Games with ₹42.03 crore at a function at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana stadium in Lucknow soon after the athletes came back to India in August. The UP government now plans to felicitate the Paralympians who won medals at the Tokyo Paralympics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-may-host-junior-men-s-hockey-world-cup-again-101631119062117.html

These parties were not concerned about promoting Muslim leadership but used Muslims as a vote bank, he said. “The AIMIM stopped the BJP from expanding its base in Telangana. It defeated the BJP candidate on Auranagabad Lok Sabha seat in Maharashtra. The saffron brigade failed to make inroads in Hyderabad as well,” said Owaisi while addressing the ‘vanchit-shoshit’ conference in Sultanpur on Wednesday.Owaisi announced the name of Mirza Akram Beg as AIMIM candidate from the Sultanpur assembly seat for 2022 assembly election. The AIMIM chief said his party was fighting for a share in power for the Muslim community. “Political parties only remember the Muslim community when the election draws closer. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav considers Muslims a mere vote bank. The SP has been a mere spectator to the harassment and exploitation of the Muslim community in UP,” he added.“The suppressed communities should fight for social justice. Voters have power to make a Prime Minister or chief minister. The deprived and the community will have to vote for a party that is fighting for their rights,” emphaised Owaisi.To grab votes of the Kurmi community in the coming assembly elections in UP, the BJP made a prominent Kurmi leader Anupriya Patel a minister in the union cabinet, he said.Shaista Praveen, wife of gangster turned politician Atiq Ahmed, who joined AIMIM on Tuesday, read the message of Atiq who is lodged in Sabarmati jail in Gujarat. “The SP and the BSP have exploited the Muslim community as a vote bank,” stated the message.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/parties-remember-muslims-only-when-polls-draw-closer-owaisi-101631118881985.html

Gupta announced this on Wednesday in the light of a case of gang-rape of a 14-year-old girl, which has not gained much traction in political circles as well“We are already in the process of formulating some new rules which will make public transport providers think twice before committing such crimes in the future. I cannot reveal the specifics at this point as I believe in making a statement after implementation. Various stakeholders are being consulted and the full effect of it will be felt after the Ganapati festival is over,” said commissioner Gupta.Regional transport officer Ajit Shinde said that he was in no position to make any comments as he had not had an interaction with the police commissioner yet. The commissioner was asked about safety of public transport facilities after this case became the second such incident in recent months, to have been initiated from a public transport depot. The 14-year-old girl was kidnapped by an autorickshaw driver from Pune railway station. The involvement of two workers of the Railways department has invoked quick action from the railway department, resulting in their suspension.The girl is believed to have been sexually assaulted by 13 of the 14 arrested men. She was found travelling to Chandigarh on September 5 with a man, her friend, whom she met in Mumbai. On August 31, she had come to the railway station to meet him, but he had not shown up at the time.The police have formed five teams in order to gather evidence and put together a timeline of the multiple locations that she was taken to after she was kidnapped around 10pm on August 31. All the arrested men are in police custody till September 16 – most are autorickshaw drivers who are friends of the main accused who first kidnapped her.“He is facing charges of kidnapping as the girl is a minor and he was taking her away from her parents. As of now, he is not facing sexual assault charges,” said Commissioner Gupta.The Pune police will also ask the state government to appoint a special public prosecutor in the case to ensure a speedy trial in the case, according to Gupta. The case will be tried in the fast track court meant for Pocso cases.Special women’s atrocity court?Chitra Wagh, head of the BJP’s women’s wing of Maharashtra, visited Commissioner Gupta and commended the work done by the police by arresting all the accused within two days.“I discussed the idea of a special women’s atrocity court in order to get speedy trials for cases under Sections like 376 (sexual assault), 354 (sexual harassment/molestation), 509 (outraging modesty of a woman), and 498(a) (domestic violence) of the Indian Penal Code. Why did none of these men feel the need to stop and question themselves while handing her around?” asked Wagh, while interacting with the media after her meeting with Commissioner Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/stricter-rules-to-ensure-safety-of-passengers-on-public-transport-pune-police-chief-101631118761338.html

The Bill was first originally tabled in the assembly in its budget session in March and was referred to the panel for deeper examination. The amended Bill was tabled in the assembly for consideration by labour minister Satyananad Bhokta on Wednesday and was passed by the House without any further discussion amid pandemonium due to the continued disruptions of proceedings by BJP legislators. However, earlier in the day, while speaking on the issue of employment policy and jobs for the locals in the House, chief minister Hemant Soren said, “The select committee report on private sector jobs bill has been tabled. It is one of the first steps in providing jobs to the locals.” Andhra Pradesh became the first state in 2019 to pass a Bill providing for 75% quota for locals in private industrial jobs. In June this year, Haryana passed a similar law, reserving 75% of private sector jobs with monthly salary of less than ₹50,000 for locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-assembly-clears-bill-to-reserve-75-of-pvt-sector-jobs-for-locals-101631117201175.html

I will also meet Lalu Prasad Yadav tomorrow in Delhi. My aim is to invite everyone who has worked with him to pay their tributes,” Chirag Paswan told reporters.Tejashwi said his ailing father, RJD chief Lalu Prasad, might even come down to Patna to attend the event if his health permits.Paswan said he hoped to meet Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar with an invite. “I have sought an appointment. Making a demand on his time is tough, especially when it involves me,” the LJP MP from Jamui said.

The same vehicle was used by the two accused, Rahul Verma and Lakhan Verma, on July 28 for mowing down the judge, police have maintained. The second case, registered by Jharkhand police August 13 and re-registered by CBI on Tuesday, pertains to theft of three mobile phones belonging to one Purendu Vishwakarma by Rahul Verma on July 27-28 night. Vishwakarma has told police that since his phones were inexpensive, he didn’t file a complaint immediately.

As part of its phased unlock plan, Bihar has allowed schools to resume offline classes since August 16. In a letter to the education department here on Wednesday, the Commission said public and private schools should be directed to arrange online classes too along with the offline classes. Every public and private school should conduct all examinations online till December 2021 to ensure that every student is able to participate, the panel has recommended. “Though schools have been asked to follow strictly the Covid guidelines and keep things sanitized and maintain social distancing, parents and guardians are still not sure whether the child would be safe in schools,” Pramila Kumari, chairperson, State Child Rights Protection Commission, said. She said several parents had approached the Commission to express their fears and made written representations to ask schools to allow online classes. DK Singh, chairman, Bihar Public School and Children Welfare Association, said most of the schools have stopped online classes as offline classes got started from August 16. “All other institutions and public places too have reopened.

Officials are also looking for a quack who allegedly administered an injection to two children, suffering from fever and abdominal pain, leading to their death at Sirsha village in Amanaur block of Saran district on Monday. “We have around 50-60 cases of respiratory diseases due to viral infection in the 90-95 children admitted in our paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), which has a capacity of 102 beds,” said Dr Gopal Shankar Sahni, professor and head, department of paediatrics at Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur. At the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH), all 84 beds in the paediatric unit were full on Wednesday. The previous day, 87 children were admitted as against 84 beds available. “We have an additional 42 beds for paediatric Covid-19 patients in the maternal child health building, where total 106 beds are for Covid-19 patients. We may shift some children there in case of a surge in cases of viral fever. No Covid-19 patient was admitted here in last five days,” said Dr Binod Kumar Singh, professor and head of paediatrics and also NHCH medical superintendent.Meanwhile, there was an increase of 21% in admission of patients to the paediatric ward through the outdoor patient department (OPD) on Wednesday, as compared to admissions on August 31, said Dr IS Thakur, medical superintendent at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), the oldest medical college in the state. The PMCH paediatric ward was almost full. “As many as 165 of our 190 beds in paediatrics department are occupied. The remaining 20-25 beds are reserved for clinical viva voce of MBBS medicos, whose examinations are underway,” Dr Thakur said. Around 80% beds in the paediatric unit were occupied at AIIMS-Patna, said its professor and head, Dr Lokesh Tiwari. “As many as 42 of the 48 beds in paediatric wards are occupied. However, this is nothing unusual, as 70%-80% bed occupancy is the usual norm at our institute throughout the year. We have all kinds of patients, including four to five of respiratory illness,” said Dr Tiwari. As many as 24 cases of acute respiratory illness cases were reported at Government Medical College Hospital (GMCH) at Bettiah. “We have 30 beds and are making arrangements for another 39 beds,” said Dr Pramod Tiwari, medical superintendent of the GMCH. Two similar cases have also been reported in Motihari, said Dr Anjani Kumar, civil surgeon of East Champaran district. The 76-bed pediatric ward of the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) was overcrowded with children admitted during last four days with suspected viral infections. A surveillance team has collected samples for testing. The doctors, however, said there was nothing to worry about, and that the manifestation of viral fever in children was an annual feature. “The onset of viral fever in children has been slightly early this year, but it has nothing to do with Covid-19. It normally begins before the onset of winter. The viral infection is acute bronchiolitis, which is associated with wheezing and cough and in a few cases fever and dengue. The infection is not at all fatal, but the fear of an anticipated third wave of Covid-19 is making parents panic and rush to doctors,” said Dr Nigam Prakash Narain, a retired professor and former head (paediatrics) at the PMCH and former vice-president of National Indian Academy of Paediatricians. “The infections are of four types — bronchiolitis, which affects children less than two years of age, and is caused either by respiratory syncytial virus or para-influenza virus; flu-like illness, dengue and adenovirus (2-3 weeks of severe cough with vomiting),” added Dr Narain. First Japanese encephalitis case in 2 years Meanwhile, the state reported its first case of Japanese Encephalitis (JE), a virus spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes, in last two years. An 11-year-old boy of West Champaran was admitted to the SKMCH on Tuesday for the same. His condition was said to be serious.

This will help the state meet norms that call for integrating land records with the food grain procurement, which is scheduled to start from October 1. The system is being implemented for the first time in state. The Centre has mandated Punjab and other paddy growing states to link procurement to farmers’ land and to the yield to check bogus billing and the malpractice of adding previous seasons’ produce to the current procurement. On getting the average figures, per acre purchase by state purchase agencies and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) will be frozen at a particular limit. The state’s paddy yield varies between 27 quintal per acre to 35 quintal per acre. “We have the yield figures and will share these with the department. There is not much variation in yield from season-to-season, just 2-3%,” said director agriculture SS Sidhu. The district-wise yield figures will be linked to the procurement portal. Farmers bringing more than average produce will not be accepted. “We have to deal with the issue cautiously, so that we are within the procurement norms and also ensure that farmers do not suffer,” said a food department officer. State remote sensing centre figures show that paddy, including premium variety basmati, is sown over 72.5 lakh acre. Of this, basmati is sown over 12 lakh acre. For procurement in the upcoming season, the agriculture department has pegged total paddy arrival to 191 lakh tonne for which a Cash Credit Limit (CCL) of ₹42,000 crore has been sought from the Reserve Bank of India. The agriculture department has started crop-cutting experiments and the results will coincide with start of procurement next month. As the Centre is pushing for mandatory land record integration with food grain procurement the state government has started a process for its 10.5 lakh farmers. The food department has started arranging camps in mandis along with the arhtiyas to compile data of around 40% of the farmers, who are not clearly covered under any category as yet. The Centre has made it compulsory for Punjab to carry out procurement after taking land details from farmers, who will get their payment (MSP) for their produce (wheat and paddy), only when the revenue record of their agriculture land is linked to the Public Finance Management System (PFMS). In rabi (wheat) procurement season this year, the state had implemented the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system, through PFMS, by transferring crop payment directly into farmers’ bank account, bypassing the traditional system of routing payment through the arhtiyas (commission agents).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-food-dept-seeks-paddy-yield-of-districts-to-start-new-payment-system-101631116181727.html

The Maratha leader had put his protest for the restoration of the Maratha quota on hold after a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and other ministers in June.“We were told that the state will take immediate steps on the demands we raised before them. Barring the funding for SARTHI and the announcement of its sub-centre Pune, all other demands remain unfulfilled. The state government has failed to make an adequate allocation for Annasaheb Patil Arthik Magas Vikas Mahamandal. It has not made provisions to recruit the community candidates, who have cleared all exams, by making legal provisions under quota. No strong steps have been taken to ensure that the review petitions filed in the Apex court come for the hearing,” Sambhajiraje said in a press conference in Mumbai.He has also demanded that the state government should immediately begin the collection of the community data to prove its backwardness. “There is no need to wait for the ruling in the review petition. There is no alternative to collect fresh data after the Supreme Court turned down Gaikwad commission’s report,” he said.The Maratha leader said that the agitation has been put on hold to avoid crowding in the wake of the threat of the third wave of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-outfits-want-fresh-data-to-prove-backwardness-for-reservation-in-maharashtra-101631115041795.html

Party chief Sharad Pawar asked the party leaders to start preparations. They were directed to become aggressive against the wrong policies of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government and raise their voice on issues that are directly related to the common people, such as a spike in prices of fuel and LPG cylinders.NCP ministers were also asked to resolve local issues related to people, hold visits of districts, flood-hit areas and ‘janata darbars’ (public courts) by following Covid-19 protocols.The party has also decided to field Other Backward Classes (OBC) candidates on the seats reserved for the community in the local bodies and fell vacant following a verdict of the Supreme Court over political reservation of the OBC community. The decision was taken in case the Apex court directed the state election commission to hold by-polls of the concerned local bodies.NCP also declared that they are not in favour of holding elections in any of the local bodies until the issue related to OBC reservation is resolved, said Nawab Malik, national spokesperson, NCP.More than 15 municipal corporations (including Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane), 29 of 36 district councils and over 90 municipal councils will go for polls over the next one year. The election bandwagon to these local bodies in such a huge number is considered as the ‘mini assembly polls’.“Pawar saheb asked the party leaders to become vocal on issues directly related with the Central government especially LPG gas, fuel prices as people are very much affected. As we are unable to hold large public gatherings owing to Covid restrictions, he directed to go among people on the issue by following Covid protocols,” Malik said.“In the next five-six months elections of local bodies such municipal corporations, municipal councils, zilla parishads and nagar panchayats are expected to be held and NCP leaders should start their preparations. Ministers were asked to help local leaders in resolving issues related to the people. As far as the alliance is concerned, the decision will be taken at a later stage, based on the local situation. It is not necessary that there will be an alliance (with MVA partners) in all the local bodies,” Malik told reporters after the meeting.NCP had contested 114 seats in the state assembly elections held in 2019 and won 54 seats.The leaders present for the meeting were asked to explain the political situation of the district, public issues at the local level among others. Around 55 leaders expressed their views and opinions in the meeting that lasted for almost six hours.“The most common problem raised by the leaders was the disconnection of power connection of the farmers over non-payment of power bills. The leaders said that the farmers are already facing serious financial problems and disconnection of power bills have added to their woes and the action started by the power company needs to be stopped immediately,” said an NCP leader, wishing not to be named.“To this, Pawar saheb asked the ministers to see what can be done to provide relief to the farmers in these testing times,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-start-preparations-for-mini-assembly-polls-sharad-pawar-tells-ncp-leaders-101631114981761.html

08-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: In an unusual case, woman gives birth to triplets without C-section||In an unusual case, a 32-year-old woman from Bhiwandi had triplets through a normal delivery early on Tuesday. Doctors said that the case was rare also because the woman was in her 35th week of pregnancy and that the babies were conceived naturally and not with the help of assisted reproductive technology. The woman, a housewife, was in her hometown in Uttar Pradesh due to the pandemic. Despite being pregnant, she did not seek any gynaecological scan till June, when she and her husband, a daily wage labourer, returned to Bhiwandi. “We put her on regular follow-ups after she came to us for a check-up and had planned her cesarean section,” said gynaecologist Dr Humaira Shaikh, who conducted the delivery at Bhiwandi’s Royal Hospital. “We also gave her blood transfusions during the follow up as she was anaemic,” she said. On Tuesday at around 12.15am, the woman experienced pain in the abdomen. By the time she was rushed to the hospital, she was already in labour. “We carried out preliminary investigations and realised that we can go ahead with a normal vaginal delivery as the first baby was in a vertex position,” said Shaikh. Commonly during birth, the baby’s head comes out first and this is known as the vertex position. Shaikh and her team had kept the backup of the C-section ready. An anaesthetist was on standby in case an emergency procedure had to be undertaken. Before the second baby was delivered, the woman was shifted to the operation theatre. However, the second baby was also in the vertex position and could be delivered normally. “The third baby was in a horizontal position, but we got enough space to move the baby and go ahead with the delivery,” said Shaikh adding that the babies- two boys and a girl- weighed 1.7kg, 1.8kg and 1.9kg respectively. “They are low weight babies but stable with no respiratory issues,” she said. A natural conception of triplets is seen in one in 8,000 cases. “Delivering triplets through a normal delivery at 35 weeks is also rare,” said Mumbai-based gynaecologist Dr Jatinder Kaur who practices at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital. Kaur has delivered triplets at 35 weeks once in her 15-year long practice through a C-section. “In higher-order pregnancies, maternal complications like postpartum haemorrhage are known. Expert neonatal care is also essential. Therefore, it is advisable to plan a C-section in advance,” said Kaur. Dr Ashok Anand, head of the gynaecology department at the state-run JJ Hospital agreed that it was an unusual case. “It is common to see triplets in an In-vitro Fertilisation (IVF) case, but rare in a natural conception. Also, such multiple pregnancies are always delivered via C-section procedures to lower the risk of complications,” he said. Anand said he recalls delivering triplets normally only once at JJ Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaiin-an-unusual-case-woman-gives-birth-to-triplets-without-csection-101631114681812.html

08-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Drone, boats to monitor illegal liquor brewing in coastal areas, mangrove belts||The state excise department now has an eye in the sky in the form of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to aid its crackdown against illicit hooch manufacturers. The department has been given a drone and boats to patrol coastal areas and mangrove belts, where this liquor is brewed illegally. The pilot project, which has been launched from Thane district, may soon be replicated across Maharashtra, including Mumbai, Raigad and Palghar.Kantilal Umap, commissioner, State Excise, Maharashtra, said that the state excise staff in Thane district had been given a drone, seven mechanised boats and four paddle boats through the District Planning Committee’s funds (DPC). This equipment cost around ₹1.25 crore. “We have requested for this to happen in Palghar as well. We are also eager to get this modern equipment for use in the Mumbai suburban district,” he added.Hooch is brewed largely in coastal areas, mangrove belts, marshy lands and areas with dense vegetation and forests, which law-enforcing authorities found difficult to access. The drums containing the brew are often buried for fermentation on the banks of water bodies like rivers and creeks, especially during the monsoons.“We lacked our own boats to crackdown on illegally-brewed liquor. For a raid, we had to rent boats from local residents who may be afraid of or even hand-in-glove with these bootleggers. They may refuse to co-operate or even leak out information. Having our own fleet of boats will help us conduct raids effectively,” said Usha Verma, director, vigilance and enforcement, State Excise.The department is also undertaking a special drive against hooch and duty-evaded liquor from other states from 5 September to 8 October.Nilesh Sangade, superintendent, State Excise, Thane, said after they received the drone and boats a month ago, they used drones to reconnoitre areas and check where liquor was being brewed illegally and followed it up by raids using boats. Around 12 such raids had been conducted in a fortnight. Some areas in Thane where hooch is produced are the creeks, Kariwali, Ulhasnagar and Dombivali.Between 1 April and 31 August, state excise officials have filed 10,195 cases across the state for production, sale and transport of illicit liquor, arrested 4,377 people and seized liquor and vehicles worth ₹21.60 crore.Hooch, or tharra, khopdi, and gavthi daaru as it is referred to, is often laced with dangerous chemicals like methyl alcohol to make it more potent and give the drinkers a stronger ‘kick.’ However, despite the obvious risks to life and health, this is often consumed by the poor and working-class, as it is sold at rates as cheap as ₹10 per pouch or glass, as against country liquor, which is priced at around ₹50 per bottle.In 2015, over 100 people lost their lives after consuming hooch at Malvani. Similarly, this illicit alcohol also caused the deaths of around 90 people in Vikhroli in 2004 and 101 people at Tardeo in 1991.An alcohol tragedy at Khopoli in the 1970s led to the state government formulating the country liquor scheme in 1973 to make good quality liquor available to the working class at cheap rates.The bootlegger mafia is said to have been born after the decision of the Morarji Desai government in the Bombay Province to impose prohibition in 1952. One of the prominent liquor mafias of Mumbai was the dreaded underworld don Varadarajan Mudaliar, who manufactured the brew in areas like Dharavi and supplied it across the city.Hooch manufacturing processLow-quality black jaggery, navasagar or yeast, peels of citrus fruits like oranges and sweet lime are mixed with water and kept for a few days in a barrel. This barrel is submerged in water in shallow creeks, nallahs and rivulets for a few days to aid fermentation.Some bootleggers even add organic waste, lizards, rodents, leather chappals, as this is supposed to make the brew stronger.After the brew ferments, some ‘masala’ is added to this wash, and it is put on a wood-fired ‘bhatti.’ A pipe collects the condensed steam.This liquor has around 16 to 17% alcohol content, and chemicals like ethanol and methanol are added to it for a stronger ‘kick.’ However, excess infusion of methanol may lead to fatal consequences like the loss of vision and even death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaidrone-boats-to-monitor-illegal-liquor-brewing-in-coastal-areas-mangrove-belts-101631112402286.html

Earlier, the party used to organise the programme at divisional and district headquarters. But the programme will be organized on the premises of the grand memorial located in Lucknow, she said.BSP office-bearers were entrusted with the task of transportation of party workers from various districts to the state capital. After paying obeisance to the Dalit icon, Mayawati will address party workers and motivate them to challenge the might of the BJP, SP and Congress in the assembly polls.Mayawati directed party leaders to organise cadre camps in Dalit dominated villages to enlighten workers about the strategy for the 2022 polls. “Along with launching membership drive, the workers should donate to the party coffers for the election campaign,” she said.Before the 2012 and 2017 assembly elections, Mayawati had organised programmes on the premises of Bhimrao Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram memorials to mobilise Dalit supporters.After successive electoral defeats in the 2012 and 2017 assembly elections and desertion of senior leaders, the party cadre had been lying low. “Even when the BSP lost in the assembly election, Dalits stood solidly like a rock behind the party. Attempts by rival parties to lure Dalits failed and the BSP is proud of the support of the Dalit community,” she said.A BSP leader said the party chief directed office-bearers to strengthen booth committees in all the 403 assembly constituencies. Leaders coming from the Dalit community will head the booth committees in majority of the constituencies, he said.In a tweet on Wednesday, Mayawati said party leaders and office-bearers had been directed to strengthen the party organisation to the polling booth level. During the visit to Kanshi Ram memorial on October 9, party workers will follow Covid protocol and cover their faces with mask, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/expand-bsp-s-base-among-sarv-samaj-maya-tells-partymen-101631109328642.html
08-09-2021||Chandigarh||PU allows students to pay semester fee in instalments||Panjab University (PU) has allowed students to pay their semester fee in four instalments again this year considering the problems faced by them during the pandemic. The decision was taken after a varsity panel made the recommendations to allow students to pay fee in instalments during a meeting in August. The communication in this regard was issued by the varsity administration to heads of teaching departments on Wednesday. The development comes after students submitted a representation to PU last month.“In the wake of difficulties faced by the students (due to prevailing situation of Covid-19), the competent authority, on the recommendation of the committee, has allowed the payment of course fee for the session 2021-22 in four instalments instead of two, in anticipation of the approval of the syndicate,” reads the communication issued by PU.It also states that if a student does not deposit the full fee within the time prescribed for the fourth and the last instalment, then a late fee of ₹2,000 will be charged.Last month, many student bodies had written to the dean student welfare (DSW) after students were asked to pay fees by August 24, asking the varsity to implement the previous year’s system of allowing payment in instalments. They also asked students not to pay the fees unless their demands were accepted. “The university is very insensitive that it took so many days to address such a small issue. But it is our win and the hard work of student leaders,” said Ankur Goyat of the Youth For Swaraj (Y4S). Departments to maintain recordThe heads of the departments have also been requested to maintain a proper record of fees deposited by students. They have been asked not to release the DMCs/degrees without seeking clearance from the fee checking (students section) of the accounts department. Students were allowed to pay their fees in four instalments last year after a series of protests. PU has already decided to suspend the annual hike in semester fees for varsity students and those studying in affiliated colleges for the second year in a row.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-allows-students-to-pay-semester-fee-in-instalments-101631109149088.html

The Lucknowite feels that till last year it was tough for filmmakers to find audience without big stars but then OTT turned the things for good. “I had completed writing the film in 2019 and was working on the post-production since last year. After the film was ready, I started meeting theatre owners in Mumbai and was given a slot that i knew would never attract audience. So, eventually I released my debut feature as a director on OTT and I am extremely happy that it will get a wider audience now.” Talking about his new film, Ghosh says, “After releasing two short films in the last few years, this story was in my head. I was working on the script that was based on a real life event that happened a few years back. The subject of my film Ganda Baccha is about the youth of our country who have lost their way and end up in a crime-terror nexus,” says the Salesman and Chinky My Foot, director. Winner of Gomti-Gaurav Samman says he is a mix of Bengali and Ganga-Jamuni culture and that well reflects in his stories too. “Be it theatre, TV or films I believe in telling stories that are real and helps me to give something back to the society. I have shot this project at real locations in Malihabad, near Lucknow.” He has written shows like 9 Malabar Hill, Basera, Intezaar Aur Sahi, Dariba Dairies besides being a director as well as a creative director for Ansh and Mr & Mrs Sharma Allahabadwale before coming up with his own production house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ott-will-help-us-get-a-wider-audience-anupam-ghosh-101631108905499.html

Also read: Watch: Afghan Sikhs flee from Taliban, take refuge at Delhi gurudwaraCapt Amarinder Singh had promised such a meal to the Punjab players who had participated and also won medals at the Tokyo Olympics during a felicitation function last month. It was discus thrower Kamalpreet Kaur who initiated this request to him during the felicitation function. “The Punjab CM has a big heart. I requested him for such a get-together, and he was kind enough to agree to it. It feels wonderful when a person of his stature values athletes. I am excited to join other athletes during the dinner and taste all the delicacies which sir will cook. I will never forget this gesture. I am foodie but a vegetarian, so will be eyeing the vegetarian dishes,” said Kamalpreet, who hails from Kabar Wala, Malout, a village in Muktsar district. She had finished sixth in the discus throw event at Tokyo. Capt loves cooking for guests Capt Amarinder Singh had said during the function that he was not a foodie but loved cooking for his guests. It is expected that the players will be served a royal Patiala treat from pulao, lamb, chicken, aloo and zarda rice. Expressing delight over the dinner invite, Indian men’s hockey team captain Manpreet Singh said, “The whole country has bestowed us with so much love and warmth. It is unimaginable. The Punjab CM has been kind, encouraging and treated us all as his children. I’m looking forward to the dinner and spending time with the athletes and CM sir.” During the felicitation function on August 12, Capt Amarinder Singh had elevated Manpreet from the post of deputy superintendent of police to superintendent of police.

The clause relates to detection, deletion (from electoral rolls) and deportation of foreigners who entered Assam illegally after March 25, 1971. On Tuesday, Assam govt. and AASU agreed on forming a panel to implement clauses 6, 7, 9 and 10 of the accord. The Assam Accord was a tripartite agreement signed in 1985 between the Centre, the All Assam Students Union (AASU) and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad (AAGSP) that brought the six-year-long anti-foreigner movement in the state to an end. While some provisions of the accord, which primarily sought detection and deportation of foreigners who entered the state after March 25, 1971, have been implemented, several others, including Clause 6, have remained unfulfilled. “It is surprising that both the state government and AASU remained silent on Clause 5 while they formed another committee to seek ways to implement other clauses in the accord. The heart of the Assam Accord has been taken away,” Congress MLA and leader of opposition in state assembly Debabrata Saikia said. On Monday, AASU and state government agreed on forming an eight-member sub-committee consisting of three Cabinet ministers and five AASU representatives. It has been given a timeline of three months (after formation) to prepare the accord implementation roadmap. The sub-committee would look into all aspects of the accord including Clause 6 that deals with providing constitutional safeguards to Assamese people, Clause 7 on economic development, Clause 9 on securing the India-Bangladesh border to prevent further infiltration, Clause 10 on prevention of encroachment of government lands, AASU chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharya said. “A committee constituted by Centre has already submitted its recommendations on implementing Clause 6 of the accord. No action has been taken on that and instead another new sub-committee has been formed. This seems like a ploy to confuse the public and distract them from the real issue,” said Saikia. Clause 6 of the accord states, “Constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards, as may be appropriate, shall be provided to protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people”. In February last year, a 13-member committee formed by Centre had submitted to the state government its recommendations of how to implement Clause 6. “The government has killed the basic premise of Assam Accord i.e. Clause 5, which deals with detection, deletion and deportation of illegal foreigners,” said Md Aminul Islam, MLA and organising secretary of All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF). “The present chief minister was a minister for the Assam Accord implementation for 10 years in previous governments. He failed to do anything at that time and now a new drama has started with creation of another committee as the present government doesn’t have any agenda for development,” he added. Following Tuesday’s meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Pijush Hazarika had said that both the state government and AASU decided to move ahead first with issues on which both sides didn’t have any dispute and then focus on all other aspects of the accord. “We discussed on ways to implement clauses 6, 7, 9 and 10 of the accord. Talks were also held on issues on which both sides had differences and try and find ways to move forward,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/opposition-questions-govt-aasu-silence-on-crucial-clause-5-of-assam-accord-101631103684499.html
08-09-2021||Chandigarh||An inspiring tale of a ‘grand’ mother, unsung superwoman||The devastating wave of my mother’s sudden demise had dismantled the wholesome configuration of our house like a house of cards. However, enhancing her stature to an unmovable rock in the whirlpool of sorrows, my gritty granny towered tall and stately in exhibiting her tough role, wiping our tears in public and her own in private. Despite her age, she forsook her comfortable living back in the village to join us in the bustling city life to help her son’s family rise from the ashes bit by bit. Her unexpected stance to undertake an uphill task of rearing three young kids, including my two elder siblings, put the speculation of dad’s second marriage at rest against our forthright reservation in accepting a new lady as our stepmother. Taking up multiple roles to the circumstantial needs was her inspiring flair. Getting up too early like a diligent homemaker, she’d prepare breakfast for the entire family, and pack four tiffins for dad’s office and three school going children. Accustomed to living in the green and spacious rustic settings, she never whined about her personal stifling travails, dedicating her entire living to forging a promising future for all of us besides leaning a comforting shoulder to her bereaved son mutely battling his inner longings for his departed better half. To engage in a long-winded conversation with each one of us in the evening was her unbroken routine with a covert aim to ensure pangs of loneliness didn’t overpower us at the melancholic light of the twilight. What indeed strengthened the family’s balance sheet were her hawk-eyes, keeping a tab on our routine expenditure. Anyone, including breadwinner dad, would get a dressing down lest they dared to splurge on needless things. Her occasional tightening of the noose around her adrenaline-bound grandchildren driving high on hormonal imbalances getting through their impressionable age successfully averted our expected derailing from righteous paths. The truth is, healing powers of time failed to fill the motherly vacuum in our lives, but our grandmother’s presence did help ease our angst. The tough time slowly flew by, giving way to prosperous years. Both my sisters got married in well-to-do families, and I too got a government job and a supportive spouse. Scooting down memory lane, my heart often fills with utmost respect to grandmother’s priceless contribution besides experiencing a sinking feeling over an insidious thought how our future would have spelt, had she not donned the role of our ‘mother’, earning the much-deserved epithet of being our ‘grand’ mother. Holding my newborn son in her arms scaled her unsung accomplishments to a higher mark, straddling three generations of different timelines inextricably entwined in the web of her love and care. She would sit her great grandson upon her toes in locking cross of her veined legs to bathe him with lukewarm water, dress him as the most loyal babysitter, and rock his cradle singing familiar lullabies until his working parents returned home. Cut to the present, she gets him ready for school, slipping his tiffin and notebooks into his bag, seats him in his Montessori van and picks him in the afternoon. Our entire clan, spanning people of all ages, lovingly calls her with a universal name, Beebi Ji, unmindfully underlining one gospel truth that addressing an unsung ‘superwoman’ like her with one specific relation would indeed belie her exceptional virtue of fitting into multiple roles at composite levels and above all, shifting gears to the need of the hour. sandeep.charnoal@gmail.comThe writer is an Amritsar-based professional in the banking sector||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/an-inspiring-tale-of-a-grand-mother-unsung-superwoman-101631103444795.html
08-09-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s tales: 350-year old Peshwa-era Katraj nahar keeps Pune water secure even today||PUNE Every year during the monsoon months, I am awakened by frantic calls from residents of the peth areas. The agitated residents narrate: “Our basement is flooded, madam! We have recently shifted into a new building and we do not know the source of the water, but it is flooding our entire basement. What should we do?” I direct them to the PMC’s water department. Such calls are regular during the monsoon months and people wonder why. It is because of a perennial water source under various peths which modern development and city governance have chosen to neglect; a matter of great embarrassment indeed.I have often said in my talks that Pune’s development is directly a function of water and it is more so during the 18th century, the formative years of urban Pune.Any urban settlement, even in the medieval times could not develop without sufficient and secure water sources.As the great visionary Nanasaheb Peshwa envisaged and planned the development of the peths, trade, religious complexes, gardens and so on, making permanent public arrangements for water proved to be critical task. Before this, the limited Pune population subsisted on seasonal streams, river water, and wells. The water, then, was not always clean and had to be fetched from distances. Now, the Sahyadri hills and forts are well equipped to supply water through rock-cut tanks and a network of stream and lakes, but the plains of Pune demanded a different strategy. Various Dakhhani sultanates such as Nizamshahi of Ahmednagar and the Adilshahi of Bijapur had mastered the art of harnessing water for large settlements. This can be seen in the form of various nahar or canal systems in Aurangabad, Junnar, Bijapur, and Ahmednagar thanks to the efforts of able administrators such as Malik Amber. Inspired by such systems, Nanasaheb Peshwa envisioned a water system that would not only provide water throughout the year, but also be clean and available at the doorstep. For this, two streams flowing near Katraj village, the Fadtari stream and the Navlaicha nala, were selected for creating dammed lakes. Two lakes were commissioned to be built, a smaller one upstream and a lower one with a bigger capacity as per the sloped terrain. Work began in 1749 for the upper lake with a dam wall of 600 feet in length and eight feet wide. The wall was equipped with holes at various levels which could be opened and closed either to store water or to allow the flow further. The main storage lake was built between 1755 and 1757 at a lower level. The wall of the storage lake measured approximately 1,000x15 feet and was around 40 feet high. The two lakes were connected in such a way that silt from the stream and rain water would settle at various storage levels and allow clean water to flow on to the next stage. The excess of water from both lakes drains into the original Ambil stream.The water from these storage lakes was brought to a settlement via a long, underground aquaduct stretching 8km across, via a dug channel. The dug channel was 30 feet below ground, six feet high and 2.3 feet wide, water-proofed with brick and lime mortar. The channels travelled from various areas such as Katraj, Indiranagar, Padmavati, Arnayaeshwar, Sanas chowk, Wadia hospital, Kala houd tank, Badami houd tank, Bhau maharaj bol , Tulshibaug, Kotwal chawadi, Faraskhana, and Nanawada to Shaniwar wada. On its way it branched off and irrigated numerous public and private tanks, wells and wadas of prominent Peshwa-period sardars and nobles. It ultimately meets the river Mutha through an underground channel at Onkareshwar and Amruteshwar ghats. Most of the water supply to private homes came from wells which were narrow in circumference and were either stone or brick- lined. Some used the Persian wheel to draw water, especially for irrigation of gardens.The channel travelled along the gentle slope from lakes to various parts of medieval Pune and was provided with air release and settlement ducts. These ducts are called “utshwas” literally meaning exhaled breath or air. These “utshwas” were built at every 30 metres and at places where the canal changes its direction. An eight to 10 feet deep well was built below each “utshwas”, to allow clean flow of water and collection of silt at the base which was regularly cleaned. At certain places, water from an “utshwas” well could be collected by building a small wall and then accessed via a tap.Stone pipes and taps were used at certain locations to regulate and access water flow. Such pipes and attachments can be seen preserved at the Bharat Itihas Samshodhak Mandal’s museum. Public tanks built over Katraj nahar during the Peshwa period proved to be great utility and convenience for residents of various peths. These public tanks were elaborate structures built to provide water for washing, cleaning and drinking and were located at prominent places. The Peshwa archives inform us about the logistics of building one such Kotwal tank by the Kirad caste. The Beldars use to specialise in demolition, quarrying stones, rebuilding terraces and entire structures. Around 175 Beldars, plus their women, 200 labourers and 305 draft animals such as donkeys and male water-buffaloes were employed to complete this average-sized project. These numbers offer us good idea about what an enormous feat of construction the entire Katraj water system was. In its heyday, the Katraj system would provide 2.3 million to 2.5 million litres of water every day to medieval Pune. The Katraj water system network amongst other water sources of the Peshwa period has single-handedly contributed to the flourishing and rapid urban development of Pune, ensuring water security.Most of these public tanks were operational till today, but have been encroached upon or engulfed by road widening. Few such as Nana houd opposite Nana wada are still in use. Various wadas and even apartments who have kept the wells are effectively using clean water of the Katraj nahar as additional water supply, even today. However, the irresponsible digging of deep foundations for new constructions and abrupt closing of the channel has led to a break in continuous flow at various places and leads to flooding.The original Ambil Odha was not diverted when the Katraj water system became operational. In 1755, Nanasaheb Peshwa built a bund across the Ambil stream, to divert the stream out of the city to avoid flash floods and to supply water to the Parvati lake.Shrikrishna Bhagwat, Shriram Bhagwat and Nandkumar Bangude were the young researchers who traced the entire underground Katraj canal and travelled underground to explore it first-hand during the last decade. Pallavee Gokhale, an archaeologist and GIS expert has scientifically studied the entire route and for the first time, prepared 3D maps to demonstrate the entire canal system, through scaled maps.Through such numerous efforts, we Punekars are made well aware of a monumental endeavour of public utility and proud heritage in the form of Nanasaheb’s “Katraj Nal yojna”. Now, the onus is on us and the governing bodies of the city to cherish and revive this invaluable khajina*!

08-09-2021||Jaipur||Former Rajasthan assembly speaker Kailash Meghwal to move censure motion against LoP||Former speaker of the Rajasthan Assembly and sitting BJP MLA Kailash Meghwal has decided to move a censure motion against Leader of Opposition Gulabchand Kataria over his controversial statement against Maharana Pratap and Lord Ram in the recent past. Meghwal has written to party president JP Nadda claiming Kataria’s statements have damaged the image of the party. He has also written a letter to BJP state president Satish Poonia informing him that he will move a resolution against Kataria in the party’s legislature meeting ahead of the assembly session which will begin on September 9. In April, this year, while campaigning for by-polls in Rajsamand, Kataria had triggered a row by making derogatory comments about legendary Rajput ruler Maharana Pratap. Around the same time, he had also said that, if the BJP had not been there, Shri Ram’ would have been in the sea. The remarks had led to widespread criticismThe resolution will condemn Kataria for his statements and comments about Maharana Pratap and Lord Ram which caused the party to lose the by-polls, indicates Meghwal’s letter written to Poonia on September 4. Meghwal has asked Poonia, who is also an MLA, to convene the proceedings of the meeting as the censure motion is against the leader of opposition in the assembly.. In the letter written to JP Nadda, Meghwal has referred to Kataria’s remarks about Maharana Pratap and Lord Ram. He said that the party has suffered a huge loss due to Kataria’s controversial statements. Reacting to the issue, Kataria said that he had heard that Meghwal would bring a censure motion against him at the BJP legislature party meeting, and he was ready for whatever decision the party takes. “I am ready for whatever decision the party takes about me,” he said in a video message. BJP leaders, however, refused to comment on the issue. People close to state party chief Satish Poonia claimed that no such letter has been received. Political analyst Manish Godha said Meghwal and Kataria have had differences since the beginning but this letter seems be related to the upcoming by-polls of Vallabnagar where Kataria is opposing Randheer Singh Bhindar. Bhindar is known to be close to former CM Vasundhara Raje, and Meghwal too is close to Raje. Commenting on the letter, transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said that the questions which Meghwal has raised are important. “Though it is their internal matter, the questions which he has has raised are important,” said Khachariyawas. Health minister Raghu Sharma said that infighting in the opposition party has clearly surfaced and is visible. “The sort of circumstances which have been created clearly shows that BJP is an indisciplined party. There are six CM candidates in BJP. The party recently took out a Jan Aashirwad yatra but what they are seeking blessings for?” Sharma asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/former-rajasthan-assembly-speaker-kailash-meghwal-to-move-censure-motion-against-lop-101631099962935.html

08-09-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Congress recommends action against MLA Solanki for cross-voting||The Rajasthan Congress Committee has forwarded the recommendation of the observer appointed for the election of Jaipur Zila Pramukh post suggesting action against party MLA from Chaksu Ved Prakash Solanki to the party high command. The observer in his report to state party chief Govind Singh Dotasra has held Solanki responsible for the partynot being able to win the post of Jaipur Zila Pramukh. Senior Congress leader and observer for Jaipur Zila Parishad polls Mumtaz Massih blamed Solanki for the cross-voting. “We have submitted our detailed report with facts and have recommended strict action against Solanki. He betrayed the party,” said Massih. A senior leader familiar with the development said the state party chief has forwarded the recommendation to the party leadership for necessary action. The Congress in Jaipur, despite receiving the mandate in the Zila Parishad polls with 27 seats and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) settling with 24, lost the post of Pramukh as two of the ruling Congress candidates switched sides. The two belonged to Chaksu assembly constituency, where Solanki, who is considered close to Sachin Pilot, is the MLA. Reacting to the charges, Solanki has stated that this is a conspiracy to malign the image of Pilot. “I take responsibility, as for cross voting it is the MLA who is responsible. But has cross voting happened only in Jaipur? What about Bharatpur, Dausa, Nagaur etc, everyone should take the responsibility and punishment should be for all,” he said. Solanki said he had urged the state party chief and election in-charge to confine the party candidates at one place to avoid horse trading but nothing was done. “The election management and coordination should have been effective. I was continuously saying that our people aren’t working properly. There was no organisation –everyone was campaigning in the election but none from our side. There was no planning,” he said. A senior MLA close to Pilot said cross-voting had happened in other districts too, including that of the state party chief. “The entire plot is to dent Pilot’s image,” he said. Political analyst Manish Godha said Jaipur was not an isolated case of cross-voting because similar incidents took place in other districts. “But in Jaipur, Gehlot camp got an opportunity to target the Pilot camp, that too swiftly. Nobody knows what has happened. But the high command is informed that they (Pilot camp MLAs) haven’t changed,” he said. The party leaders including CM Ashok Gehlot, Dotasra and the sports minister reacted sharply on cross-voting. The CM had stated that people involved in horse-trading are those who tried toppling the government earlier. State Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasra too said that it was the partymen who betrayed the party. “Democracy was dismantled, robbed, and a game of bribery played in the election of Zila Pramukh in Jaipur. It is our people who have betrayed the party. We are taking the report and those stabbed in the back will not be spared,” said Dotasra addressing newspersons on Monday. Commenting on the people who switched sides and action that will be taken them, Rajasthan sports minister Ashok Chandna on Tuesday called them traitors. “I have no complaints with BJP but there are some who are working for them while being in Congress. They have sold themselves to BJP and the intention is clearly visible on their face,” said Chandna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-congress-recommends-action-against-mla-solanki-for-crossvoting-101631096422805.html

08-09-2021||Mumbai||Sachin Waze planted bombs near Antilia to regain ‘supercop’ clout, says NIA||Dismissed Mumbai Police assistant inspector Sachin Waze planted explosives in an SUV outside Antilia to orchestrate a terror threat and regain his clout as a ‘supercop’, National Investigation Agency (NIA) said in its chargesheet filed last week.On February 25, this year, an SUV with gelatin sticks and a threat letter was found parked illegally on Carmichael Road, near businessman Mukesh Ambani's residence, Antilia. The owner of the vehicle, Mansukh Hiran, was found dead in a creek in Thane on March 5, days after claiming that his vehicle had been stolen. Police arrested Waze on March 13 on conspiracy charges.The NIA chargesheet named Sachin Waze as one of the main conspirators behind placing the explosives-laden vehicle, with a fake registration number, and a threat note. The probe agency also said that Waze played a key role in the murder of Thane-based trader Mansukh Hiran.Waze was suspended from the police force in 2004 — in connection with the Khwaja Yunus suicidal death case — before being reinstated in 2020, when he was posted in the Crime Intelligence Unit of Mumbai Police.The  NIA mentioned in its chargesheet that Besides, Waze hatched the conspiracy to extort money from wealthy and prosperous individuals by instilling fear of life in them. While heading the Crime Intelligence Unit, Waze handled some of the sensitive cases, and during the course allegedly collected huge amounts of money through extortion and used parts of them to commit the crime."He (Waze) wanted to regain his clout as an ace detective/encounter specialist. Thus, he hatched a conspiracy to place the Scorpio laden with Gelatine sticks (explosives) and a threat note addressed to chairman of a major business group near his residence," the NIA mentioned in its chargesheet.The NIA chargesheet elaborated how Waze asked Hiran, who he knew from earlier, to leave the vehicle at a pre-determined location, after which Waze himself drove the vehicle to Carmichael Road and parked it there, after planting gelatin sticks and a threat letter in it. Waze also asked Hiran to lodge a complaint that the vehicle was stolen.Waze also tampered with the registration plate of the vehicle and installed a forged plate bearing the number of another vehicle that belonged to the convoy of Mukesh Ambani's wife, Nita.When the security detail of Ambani family found the parked vehicle, Waze led a team to the spot and got the high-profile case transferred to the Crime Intelligence Unit.“The wording on the threat note ‘agle baar connect hokar aega‘ (next time the bomb will have wires connected) clearly depicts [the] intention of Waze for furtherance [of] acts to re-establish himself as a supercop by staging a fake encounter as to regain his lost glory,” the NIA chargesheet said.The disgraced police officer initially tried to make the bomb scare look like an organisation called ‘Jaish ul Hind’ was behind it. Soon after, he tried to convince Hiran to take responsibility for placing the car near Antilia. When Hiran refused, Waze conspired to get him killed with the help of encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma, as Hiran was aware of the entire conspiracy and could “spill the beans”, the NIA claims.Waze then began destroying evidence, such as CCTV footages, vehicle entry register at the police headquarters, and the mobile phone he used, to cover his tracks.The NIA alleged in its chargesheet that Waze financed his conspiracy through an extortion racket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-waze-planted-bombs-near-antilia-to-regain-supercop-clout-says-nia-101631092098664.html

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi dated September 3, researcher Ranjit Kumar, who is also an associate of late MP from Vaishali, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, said the lawmaker had demanded for the bowl to be brought back till his death September 2020.

In 2010, in response to Singh’s request to the ministry of external affairs, then minister SM Krishna had said that the bowl was earlier at Kandahar and was restored to Kabul Museum during the time of President Najibullah. “The then minister also said that as the bowl carries inscriptions in Persian, a team of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) would be sent there. A team was sent there in 2014, but nothing came out of it,” he said. PK Mishra, former regional director of the ASI and a part of the team that visited Kabul in 2014, said, “The inscriptions have a few lines in Brahmi script which proves it to be from the time of Lord Buddha.

Sudesh Mahto, former deputy CM and president of AJSU Party, an ally of the BJP, asked the CM to also inform the House about his electoral promise to expand the reservation for the Other Backward Castes (OBCs) in the state to 27% from existing 14 %. AJSU Party, too, has taken a clear stand in favour of caste census. “It’s good that you have sought time on caste census, let us know what happened to the 27% OBC reservation. That should not be an issue now as the Centre has already delegated the power to list OBCs to the states,” Mahto said.

08-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai got heavy rains during the night, but worst is over||Mumbai received 78.7mm of rainfall in the 24 hours ending 8.30am Wednesday, owing to the passage of a low pressure zone (originating from the Bay of Bengal) over the Konkan coast. Despite predictions of heavy rains during the day, officials say that the most intense showers have passed by the city at night, and that the day is likelier to see only light to moderate showers.“The rains which began late last night were the result of easterly winds brought on because of the low pressure area, which passed almost directly over northern Mumbai. As a result, the suburbs got more rain than South Mumbai. The low pressure area is travelling quite fast, and since it has moved beyond the city and towards Gujarat, there is no worry of flooding in Mumbai,” said a meteorologist with the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional centre in Mumbai.Also Read | Pollution from tarballs in Mumbai: Who is to blame for it?A popular independent weather forecaster, who goes by the name of Weatherman of Mumbai on social media, said Mumbai had “a narrow miss” on Wednesday morning, after initially speculating that the city may receive over 300mm of rain between September 7 and 8. Doppler radar images from this morning showed rain-bearing clouds dumping moisture a few kilometres off the coast, after being pushed seaward by easterly winds. Experts have said that unless the wind direction changes to westerlies, there will be no heavy showers in Mumbai during the day.However, officials have asked citizens to remain alert and continue following IMD’s official warnings. KS Hosalikar, head of IMD’s surface instrument division in Pune, pointed out that the latest available satellite images (from 9.30am) show formations of very dense cloud mass over the north Arabian Sea, particularly over Palghar, Dahanu, Daman and north Konkan region, along with scattered clouds over northern madhya Maharashtra and north Marathwada, indicating that there is still some chance of heavy rains in the region.The IMD has placed Mumbai, Thane and the remainder of the Konkan districts on orange alert for today, while Palghar has been placed under a red category alert, indicating chances of very heavy rain with extremely heavy rain at isolated locations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-got-heavy-rains-during-the-night-but-worst-is-over-101631079500578.html

She said going by the preliminary reports, bats are suspected to be the main carrier of the virus, but more studies are needed to pinpoint the exact trigger. Many experts said the affected areas are also infested with wild boars and their samples will also be taken for testing. A team from the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases Laboratory from Bhopal will co-ordinate more such studies, she said. Forest minister AK Saseendran, who is also camping in the city, said special permission will be granted to capture boars and other animals for testing. Samples of domestic animals and pets were also taken to weed out suspicion, he said. Experts said the strict protocol in place due to Covid-19, like masking, physical distancing and no overcrowding, really helped the state blunt the impact of Nipah. “Due to Covid-19 protocols, this time Nipah transmission will be limited. Prevention of Covid-19 really helped fight Nipah also,” said immunologist and public health expert D Padmanabha Shenoy. Many experts like him said the main source of the virus should be identified to check its further outbreak. This is the third time the state is witnessing the onset of virus in four years--in 2018 it claimed 17 lives in Kozhikode, in 2019 a youth was infected in Ernakulam but later cured and in 2021, the virus has claimed the life of a 12-year-old boy in Kozhikode. Many experts have asked the government to develop an integrated multi-disciplinary approach to tackle repeated incidents of zoonotic infections and set up high-tech animal and virus testing labs. Many zoonotic diseases such as Sars, avian influenza, swine flu and monkey fever have been reported in the state in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-more-samples-test-negative-for-nipah-kerala-almost-out-of-danger-minister-101631079020655.html

08-09-2021||Jaipur||Sachin Pilot turns 44; his supporters plant saplings, release video on him||Jaipur’s Civil Lines today wore a festive look on the 44th birthday of senior Congress leader Sachin Pilot.The lane next to Rajasthan Governor’s house was closed for traffic with Pilot’s supporters coming from across the state. Pilot’s posters across the state, on every crossing and lanes created a political buzz, especially in the Congress leadership.While a faction in Congress and analyst called today’s programme a show of strength, people close to Pilot called it an expression of people’s love. “I want to thank all those who sent their wishes, and those who came and gave their support, wishes and blessings. I hope to continue to get similar love and support,” Pilot said.A group of his supporters, Sachin Pilot Fans club, also released a 57-second video clip projecting the leader as the future of Rajasthan, presenting his vision for the state without making any reference to the Ashok Gehlot government.On his birthday, his supporters also planted hundreds of thousands of trees across the state on Monday and Tuesday. The plantation drive was being conducted across 200 assembly constituencies and the target was to plant 1 million trees across the state.Pilot met his supporters and party workers at his residence in Jaipur from 11am amid continuing tensions with the state unit of the Congress over the delay in Cabinet rejig. Mukesh Bhakar , a Congress MLA who is also close to Pilot, said, “The scene today outside Pilot’s residence was stupendous...it showed the love people have for Pilot, that, when he holds no post.”A state minister said, “Pilot is making all efforts to maintain his relevance. This is not the first time, he does it to remain in charcha (public eye).”Political analyst Manish Godha said the effort is to show his strength and how much people support him. Such a programme, especially during the ongoing political crisis, is a message to the party high command that he has mass support.CM Ashok Gehlot tweeted his best wishes to Pilot, “Wishing you a very happy birthday Sachin Pilot ji. May you be blessed with happiness, good health and a long life,” he posted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/pilot-turns-44-his-supporters-plant-saplings-release-video-on-him-101631077220038.html
08-09-2021||Jaipur||Day after Congress loses Jaipur Zila Pramukh seat, infighting resurfaces||Infighting in the Congress has resurfaced, a day after the party lost the Jaipur Zila Pramukh seat because of cross voting. Despite receiving the mandate in Jaipur Zila Parishad with 27 seats, and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) settling with 24 – the post of Pramukh went to the Opposition BJP as two of the ruling Congress candidates switched sides. The two belonged to Chaksu assembly constituency, where the MLA is Ved Prakash Solanki, who is considered close to Sachin Pilot. Commenting on the people who switched sides and action that will be taken them, Rajasthan sports minister Ashok Chandna on Tuesday called them traitors. “I have no complaints with BJP but there are some who are working for them while being in Congress. They have sold themselves to BJP and the intention is clearly visible on their face,” said Chandna. “The complaint will reach the leadership...the future course of action will be accepted by all,” said the minister. Chandna, who is known to be close to CM Ashok Gehlot, reacted a day after the CM made a statement that the people involved in horse trading are the same ones who tried toppling the government earlier. State Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasra too accepted that it was the partymen who betrayed the party. “Democracy was dismantled, robbed, and a game of bribery played in the election of Zila Pramukh in Jaipur. It is our people who have betrayed the party. We are taking the report and those stabbed in the back will not be spared,” said Dotasra addressing newspersons on Monday. Acting swiftly, the observer for Jaipur Zila Parishad has submitted his report to Dotasra, blaming Solanki for the cross voting. “We have submitted our detailed report with facts and have recommended strict against Solanki. He betrayed the party,” said Massih. Reacting to the direct and indirect charges, Solanki said, “The entire conspiracy is to malign the image of Pilot.” “I take responsibility, as for cross voting it is the MLA who is responsible. But has cross voting happened only in Jaipur? What about Bharatpur, Dausa, Nagaur etc, everyone should take the responsibility and punishment should be for all,” he said. Solanki said he had urged the state party chief and election in-charge to confine the party candidates at one place to avoid horse trading but nothing was done. “The election management and coordination should have been effective. I was continuously tsaying that our people aren’t working properly. There was no organisation –everyone was campaigning in the election but none from our side. There was no planning,” he said. The ruling Congress government in Rajasthan managed to maintain its dominance in the election of Pradhan for 78 Panchayat Samitis held on Monday. Congress won 49 Panchayat Samitis and BJP 25. Congress and BJP both formed three Zila Parishads each, out of six where elections were held. Political analyst Manish Godha said the Gehlot camp has got an opportunity to target the Pilot camp. BJP MLA and spokesperson Ram Lal Sharma said the Congress infighting has been going on for years and losing Jaipur Zila Pramukh seat is the result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/day-after-congress-loses-jaipur-zila-pramukh-seat-infighting-resurfaces-101631077159965.html

We have taken permission before organising this programme since it will be too late to announce puja protocols after the by-polls," said Banerjee who is likely to contest the bypoll from Bhabanipur in south Kolkata.She urged puja organisers to "strictly follow Covid-19 safety protocols and wear masks".After reviewing the situation amid the threat of a third wave of Covid-19 pandemic, the state would decide on lifting the night curfew as many puja revellers go out pandal hopping during that hour, Banerjee said."We will review the Covid-19 situation and then decide on whether to host the (Durga Puja) Carnival," she said.In the carnival, organised by the West Bengal government, selected Durga idols are showcased in a procession at Red Road here.Banerjee urged people to maintain peace and tranquillity in the state.The Bengal CM also said that she has requested the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to declare Durga Puja as an Intangible Cultural Heritage and a global festival, as a large number of people from various communities assemble to celebrate it.This year the five-day festival of Durga Pujas will be held from October 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/durga-puja-2021-mamata-grants-rs-50k-to-each-committee-discount-on-power-tariff-101631074393652.html

The decision was taken at a meeting on Monday evening attended by chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, senior ministers and bureaucrats with representatives of AASU, Assam’s premier student organisation that had spearheaded the six-year anti-foreigners stir that culminated in the signing of the accord in 1985. “The meeting was held in a very cordial atmosphere and it was decided that in order to prepare a framework for implementation of the remaining clauses of the accord, the sub-committee will be formed,” minister for implementation of Assam Accord, Atul Bora, told journalists after the meeting. The sub-committee will consist of three cabinet ministers of Assam government and five representatives of AASU. It has been given a timeline of three months (from the tie of formation) to prepare the accord implementation roadmap. “The sub-committee will look into all aspects of the accord including Clause 6 that deals with providing constitutional safeguards to Assamese people, Clause 7 on economic development, Clause 9 on securing the India-Bangladesh border to prevent further infiltration, Clause 10 on prevention of encroachment of government lands,” AASU chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharya said. The implementation framework will also incorporate the demand for updating (re-verification) the NRC released two years ago, addressing flood and erosion problem, rehabilitation of martyrs’ and victims’ family of Assam Agitation etc. The meeting also decided to prepare an action plan consisting of three demands of the AASU i.e. creating a chair in the name of Dr. Bhupen Hazarika in Tezpur University, Guwahati University and Dibrugarh University, beautification of Hazarika’s ‘Samadhi Kshetra’ in Guwahati and incorporation of cultural values and teachings of Hazarika in the school curriculum. The Assam Accord was a tripartite agreement signed in 1985 between the Centre, the All Assam Students Union (AASU) and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad (AAGSP) that brought the six-year-long anti-foreigner movement in the state to an end. While some provisions of the accord, which primarily sought detection and deportation of foreigners who entered the state after March 25, 1971, have been implemented several others including Clause 6 has remained unfulfilled. Clause 6 of the accord states, “Constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards, as may be appropriate, shall be provided to protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people”. In February last year, a 13-member committee formed by Centre had submitted to the state government its recommendations of how to implement Clause 6. There has been no progress on that front after that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-aasu-agree-on-forming-panel-to-implement-assam-accord-101631074880166.html

Unfortunately, the NBA sensation is yet to get a job offer from the state government.The 20-year-old who is 6-ft 10-inch tall was selected for the NBA Summer League in August this year based on his commendable performance in NBA-G league Ignite.After returning from Los Angeles 10 days back having clinched the NBA Summer League championship for his club SAC, Prince is yet to garner the attention of the Punjab sports authorities.Talking to Hindustan Times, Prince said, “I have many job offers from various parts of the country including Indian Air force, but I want to serve in Punjab Police. Unfortunately, even after achieving the feat, I am unable to get the attention of the state government as no one has offered me any job here.”‘Players need to feel secure’Pitching the same, general secretary of the Punjab Basketball Association, Teja Singh Dhaliwal, said that the government needed to understand that players were the real life heroes and not the management. “Financial support is important for the growth of players and to strengthen the foundation of a player from the initial stage. Our country has forgotten many such heroes. Future of our players should be secured and they should be insured by the government with respectable jobs so that they feel secure,” said Dhaliwal.Prince feels that even though the sport was gaining popularity in India since NBA had started organising tournaments, there was still a need for the government to pitch in and play a pivotal role in uplifting the game in the country.“Government should organise special league tournaments in India like we have IPL for cricket as playing with international stars will boost the local talent,” he added.‘Watching Lebron play was dream come true’Rising from a small village of Dera Baba Nanak in Punjab’s Gurdaspur, meeting NBA legends like Lebron James was a dream come true for Prince: “I am grateful to my coaches Jaipal Singh, Harjinder Singh and to Teja Singh Dhaliwal, for polishing my talent here at the academy because of which I could reach NBA. Watching the likes of Lebron play in front of my eyes was nothing less than a dream come true.”Sharing his four-year journey playing the game, Prince revealed that he was 16 when he reached Guru Nanak Stadium in Ludhiana and It was the first time ever that he saw a basketball ground.Prince is inspired by his own local teammate and a senior basketball player from the academy, Palpreet Singh Brar, who also played for NBA before him. Giving a message for budding players, Prince said that players needed to remain determined and focused in order to live their dreams.The district sports officer (DSO), Ravinder Singh, commenting on the issue said that the government would be happy to offer a job to Prince. “Since he brought laurels to the country, Punjab government will be happy to offer him a job. There is a procedure for hiring players which may take some time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianabased-nba-player-seeks-job-in-punjab-police-101631051216916.html

The adjacent drain, clogged with plastic bags, has turned ethereal in the twilight gold.In her early 20s, Shahana Khatoon is unhurriedly walking along the station’s foot overbridge, towards her home in Shaheen Bagh. The pathway is crowded with men. There’s a stray dog, too. But Ms Khatoon is too occupied in her thoughts to care for the immediate world around her. She isn’t even turning to look at the orange sun as it dips in slow motion at the rear of the Jasola Vihar-Shaheen Bagh station. May be because there’s so much for her to look forward to. Having completed her Master’s in English from Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University some months ago, she plans to do a PhD. A resident of the south Delhi locality where she lives with her parents, Ms Khatoon is also a daytime Gurugram dweller — she started her first full-time job in a start-up in the Millennium City (Udyog Vihar, Phase 4) in June, as a content writer. Additionally, she has arrived at perhaps the most significant milestone in her life. ‘Chaotic, in bits and pieces’, her slim collection of poems, her first book, was published last month.“There are things inherent to my identity that I can’t change, such as my name, my gender, my religion, my nationality, my caste. I never asked for any of these.” As men continue to pass on both sides of her, she talks of how she let poetry complicate who she is. “When I write poems, I try to create a self that incorporates both my given identity and my chosen identity.”Ms Khatoon agrees to share a poem with us.AlmondsWhat do you do when your lover is in your city -Do you close your windows?Do you close your doors?Do you sit under the same sky and try to measurethe distance that isn’t in miles any more?Isn’t it thrilling to witness the distance shrinking,as if almonds turning into raisins,as if apples becoming pines,as if peaches becoming wine.And what do you do when your lover is in your city-but you aren’t lovers any more -Can almonds ever turn into raisins?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-poet-from-shaheen-bagh-101631045380972.html

After a surprise visit on the installation site of smart meters on Monday, Pal had expressed his disappointment at the slow progress of the pilot project. “The project was started in 2016, but not even 50% of it has been completed. The system hasn’t been developed,” Pal had said. State-owned REC is implementing the project.Around 30,000 smart meters under the pilot project are to be installed in four sectors (29, 31, 47, and 48), six villages (Faida, Ram Darbar, Hallomajra, Raipur Kalan, Makhanmajra, and Daria), and the industrial area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/smart-meters-chandigarh-administration-wants-rec-to-speed-up-project-101631045277220.html
08-09-2021||Chandigarh||Apartments case: SC allows Chandigarh admn to submit survey report||The Supreme Court has permitted the Chandigarh administration to submit a survey report on identification of residential properties where there has been transfer of shares outside the family. The order in this regard was passed by the apex court on Monday. It took note of submissions made by the UT, which claimed it has already conducted the survey. The apex court directed the UT to submit the report within one week and said the high court can proceed with the hearing of pleas before it after taking into account the report. The HC is requested to adjudicate the dispute in the writ petition at the earliest, preferably within two weeks, the apex court said. The SC was hearing a plea from a Sector-27 resident, which opposed the survey. Acting on it, the SC had stayed the HC order. It was in July, when the HC had directed that those residential properties transferred or sold after December 31, 2019, wherein the shares were transferred to a person outside the family of the original owner, be surveyed. The HC order had come on a batch of petitions pending since 2016, seeking prohibitory orders on conversion of residential plots into apartments. Residential plots in Chandigarh are meant for single-dwelling units. However, in recent years, they are being sold floor-wise to multiple owners, which would “destroy” the city and put additional burden on infrastructure, the petitioners had argued. The matter was taken up in the HC on Tuesday too, but was adjourned for September 16 as the apex court order was not available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/apartments-case-sc-allows-chandigarh-admn-to-submit-survey-report-101631045155956.html
08-09-2021||Delhi||Can latest speed curbs make roads safer for two-wheelers?||A friendly motorcycle race among a group of youngsters on the Yamuna Expressway on June 25 turned fatal for Mehrauli’s Rahul Teotia, 28, when his motorbike collided with another. His friend, Yash Kumar, 30, who was riding pillion, was severely injured.This was not an isolated incident. Fatal two-wheeler crashes are common in the Capital, and the victims are often young stunt bikers. The law has so far proved inadequate to curb this menace despite several initiatives in the past, including meetings with youngsters from schools and colleges to discuss safe driving practices, community awareness programmes among residents’ welfare associations, and engagement programmes at traffic junctions.Now that the Capital’s traffic police has brought two-wheelers under the ambit of speed restrictions through an order effective from June 11, it plugs a law-enforcement gap through which cases of speed violations involving two-wheelers fell through in courts.All two-wheelers on city roads are now meant to adhere to a speed limit of 50km/hr. On high-speed corridors and expressways, where the speed limit for four-wheelers has been set at 70km/hr, two-wheelers have a limit of 60km/hr.Legal loopholeTraffic police officials say that, previously, two-wheeler speed violations were recorded based on the limits set for four-wheelers (which is 50km/hr in most parts of the city). Most riders used to get away without paying fines for violations as road signs didn’t indicate speed limits for two-wheelers, and they could feign ignorance about the restrictions in court.“Technically, the speed limits for two-wheelers were not notified. The signage in the city also does not specify the speed limits for two-wheelers, so an easy escape for owners was to say that they were not aware,” said a senior traffic official on condition of anonymity.Delhi government data showed that of over 10 million vehicles registered in the city till March 2020, 7.3 million were two-wheelers. Delhi traffic police estimates also show that of the total road accident fatalities, two-wheeler riders form the biggest group at 45%, followed closely by pedestrians (24%) and cyclists (20%).Traffic police data shows that, in 2020, 4,178 accidents were reported in Delhi of which 1,163 were fatal. Another report by the department stated that last year, nearly 30-40% of road accident deaths and injuries involved two-wheeler riders or those riding pillion. In a 2019 study conducted by the traffic police, the share of two-wheeler victims in road accident cases was between 32% and 42%. It also highlighted that while private cars were involved in the highest share of fatal road accidents at 33.10%, two-wheelers were involved in 24.47% of the crashes.A deeper dive into the numbers shows that, in 2019, 496 two-wheeler riders lost their lives in road accidents, while 2,110 were injured. This number was only marginally lower than the 570 deaths and 2,542 injuries recorded in 2018, and 557 deaths and 2,680 injuries in 2017.Often, it is not just the two-wheeler riders that have to pay the price for rash and dangerous driving.Usha Devi’s (52) world turned upside down in 2015 when a speeding motorcycle hit her as she was waiting to cross the road near Zakhira crossing in west Delhi. The accident left her bedridden for 18 months, with fractures to her leg, hip, and spine.“I have metal rods in my leg, and I still cannot walk without support or stand for more than 30 minutes. I had to quit my job as a supervisor at a factory after the accident, and it was only a year ago that my daughter got a job and we have settled. The accident changed my life forever...,” Devi said.Police and road safety experts say that the fatality risk is higher among two-wheeler riders due to their tendency to speed and the low protection the vehicle provides. Traffic police officials say two-wheeler riders in the 19-27 age group speed the most and also form the largest share of fatalities.“With the speed limits now notified under law, enforcement teams will be better equipped to catch violators,” a senior traffic police officer said on condition of anonymity, adding that the general public will also feel more confident now about reporting speeding motorcyclists.Call for more signageSewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, who was part of the speed review committee that helped decide the revised speed limits, said that the traffic police and the road-owning agencies in the Capital must now ensure that speed signage is revised to include the limits for two-wheelers.“Revising it will ensure that commuters know that they will be prosecuted if they flout the limit and also create better awareness,” Ram said.Other experts said that while Delhi is “better off” compared to other Indian cities in terms of the availability and placement of road signage, cities such as Hyderabad and Chennai have recently collaborated with traffic experts and organisations to install new signage with accurate and inclusive information.Since 2017, the Chennai traffic department along with the road-owning agencies there have been working towards installing inclusive signage for two-wheelers, cyclists and pedestrians at strategic locations.Amit Bhatt, director (integrated urban transport) at the World Resources Institute (India), who was also part of the speed review committee, said, “While it is not possible to pictorially depict all categories of vehicles, it is important that the three important categories be represented — two-wheelers, four-wheelers and large commercial vehicles... [It] is still in the works.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/can-latest-speed-curbs-make-roads-safer-for-twowheelers-101631044974863.html

08-09-2021||Delhi||Another step towards airport flyway||The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has started work on preparing detailed drawings of a 14km elevated corridor from Barapullah near Thyagraj stadium to Mahipalpur bypass in south Delhi that is aimed at decongesting the areas around the eight government residential colonies that are being redeveloped by the Union government.According to senior CPWD and National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) India officials, with the Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) having approved the project in July, the approximately ₹5,000-crore plan will be sent for the final ratification by the Union cabinet.The corridor was not part of the initial redevelopment plan for eight General Pool Residential Accommodation (GPRA) colonies -- Kidwai Nagar, Nauroji Nagar, Netaji Nagar, Sarojini Nagar, Mohammaddpur, Thyagraj Nagar, Kasturba Nagar, Srinivaspuri---consisting of more than 25,000 dwelling units.Besides helping manage the expected increase in traffic volume on Road Road and other arterial stretches around the redeveloped colonies, the six-lane corridor will provide direct access to Indira Gandhi International Airport for commuters travelling from south, central and east Delhi.A senior CPWD official who is privy to the matter said, “We doing the detailing work, which includes preparing drawings of the corridor based on the approved alignment. This is done before we can float tenders for construction. The detailing work will take at least two-three months.”According to the approved alignment, the road corridor will start from Barapullah flyover near Thyagraj stadium and pass by Aurobindo Marg, Brigadier Hoshiyar Singh Road, Africa Avenue, Vivekanand Marg, Nelson Mandela Road, Vasant Kunj Road and Mahipalpur Bypass, and touch down at National Highway-8. The Delhi government’s Public Works Department (PWD) was tasked with finalising the alignment and getting it approved from UTTIPEC.With the Delhi government in the final stages of acquiring an 8.5-acre land parcel in the Yamuna riverbed which will pave the way for the completion of the extension of the Barapullah corridor up to Mayur Vihar, commuters from east Delhi will have an almost signal-free access up to the airport once the 14km corridor is also completed.The approved alignments provide ramps for traffic to get on and off the corridor at INA Brigadier Hoshiyar Singh Marg, Africa Avenue, and Nelson Mandela Road. “Ramps have been provided to the corridor near all the residential colonies in the plans,” said a Delhi PWD official.Earlier this year, the Union housing and urban affairs ministry decided that the cost of the corridor will be included in the total redevelopment expense that will be recovered from the sale of commercial space at a centre coming up at Nauroji Nagar.A senior CPWD official said, “The corridor was not part of the initial plan which included redevelopment of eight government residential colonies. Cabinet approval will be needed to include this corridor in the overall project.”A senior NBCC India official who is aware of the development said: “It has been decided that the cost of the project will be recovered from the sale of commercial components. The process is on to take necessary cabinet approval. The corridor will be completed along with the redevelopment of the colonies.”With close to 25,000 dwelling units proposed as part of the massive GPRA residential project, traffic experts say the neighbourhoods will cause an unprecedented rise in traffic load on an already exhausted Ring Road.Experts said the Ring Road has reached the saturation point in terms of traffic volume, and there was no further scope for road widening.Sarvagya Srivastava, former engineer-in-chief with Delhi PWD, said, “The redevelopment of these colonies will result in tremendous increase in the traffic in the surrounding areas. The Ring Road is saturated and there is no further space for widening. This corridor is the need of the hour. As it will be an extension of Barapullah flyover, it will reduce the travel time, specially to those going to the airport, for thousands of commuters. Currently, all routes to the airport from south and central Delhi experience heavy traffic.”A study by the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) on “accessibility to airports” in 2017 found that reaching Delhi airport is far more difficult when compared to travel to the local airport in other cities.The study found the average speed in the 5km radius of Delhi airport is 16.1 kmph, and it increases only after 12-13km, and then remains constant till 20-22km.Sewa Ram, head of the department of transport planning at SPA, who conducted the study, said the corridor or an alternate route to the airport is required as all the existing routes are already congested.He also stressed on the need to upgrade the infrastructure on other arterial roads in order to avoid congestion in the future.Sewa Ram said, “Barapullah is facing a congestion issue since the starting and end points have not been designed properly. At INA, where it touches down, road space is not sufficient for the smooth flow of vehicles. Similarly, the road network near Sarai Kale Khan was not planned properly.“Similarly, besides developing the 14-km elevated corridors, the agencies should upgrade the surrounding arterial roads so that intended purpose is achieved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/another-step-towards-airport-flyway-101631044132334.html

08-09-2021||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal to open new-look Chandni Chowk||The ₹99-crore Chandni Chowk redevelopment project, aimed at decongesting and conserving the heritage structure of the Mughal-era market, is likely to be inaugurated by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday.As per the minutes of an August 26 meeting attended by nodal officers for the project, all work was to be completed by September 5. However, officials say that some final touches such as fixing a few CCTV cameras and placement of plants needed to be finished.A senior PWD official privy to the details said preparations are going on in full swing for inauguration of the revamped stretch between the Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid.As part of the first phase of the redevelopment plan, the 1.3-km Chandni Chowk stretch between the two landmarks has been revamped and made a no-go zone for motorised vehicles. During the pandemic, as the market shut down, there was a massive loss of business, but as things seem to be coming back to normal, the agencies anticipate shoppers returning to the market once again.Conceived in 2006, the Chandni Chowk redevelopment project was launched after a prolonged delay in December 2018 following the directions of the Delhi high court, which is also monitoring the project.In the first phase of the project, utilities such as electric cables were taken underground and dedicated lanes for non-motorised transport and walkways were constructed. With the overhead mess of wire becoming a thing of the past, the skyline of the once-congested market looks much cleaner now.Facilities such as toilets, ATMs, and benches and bollards were also set up.In the second phase, the façade restoration will be taken up by SRDC and PWD. A uniform façade will be implemented on the stretch.Sanjay Bhargava, president Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said while the inauguration was around the corner, some work was still pending. “There are pending issues. Transformers were to be removed from the Fountain Chowk. That has not happened. Streetlights are yet to be installed at some places. Unless all the aspects originally outlined are completed, the project will not be completed,” he said.The PWD official quoted above, however, said all work will be finished to meet the deadline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/arvind-kejriwal-to-open-new-look-chandni-chowk-101631042001046.html

The firm will also operate and maintain it for five years, said a UT official.“This is Indian’s highest air purifier which will cover around 500-metre radius around Transport Chowk,” said a spokesperson. The administration is treating it as a pilot project. Originally, five spots were shortlisted to install it, but the Transport Chowk was chosen due to the highest volume of traffic and thus vehicular emissions at this junction, said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-gets-its-first-air-purification-tower-at-transport-chowk-101631043836089.html

It includes the names of Priyanka Tibrewal and Biswajit Sarkar among others,” said a senior BJP leader on condition of anonymity.An advocate, Tibrewal is the vice-president of the BJP’s state youth wing. She was also a petitioner in the post-poll violence cases in the Calcutta high court, which ultimately resulted in the court ordering a CBI probe.Biswajit Sarkar is the brother of BJP worker Abhijit Sarkar, who was murdered allegedly by TMC workers in Kolkata on May 2, the day election results were declared. Biswajit is among the petitioners to move the Supreme Court, seeking an SIT probe into allegations of post-poll violence.The list also includes Tathagata Roy, veteran BJP leader and former governor of Meghalaya and Tripura, who has slammed some of his party colleagues over the debacle in the state elections. Rudranil Ghosh, who was the BJP candidate in the constituency in the elections earlier this year, also features in the list.West Bengal Congress chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said his party won’t be fielding anyone against Mamata Banerjee. “The Congress high command has decided that the party will not field any candidate against Mamata Banerjee. It is because that would help the BJP.”TMC leader and spokesperson Tapas Roy welcomed the Congress move.“It is good that good sense has prevailed, and the Congress has realised that fielding a candidate against Mamata Banerjee may help the BJP in turn. As far as the BJP’s candidates are concerned, they can field their central leadership. They would lose with such a huge margin that in future they would think twice before contesting an election,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-bjp-sends-6-names-to-fight-mamata-banerjee-in-bhabanipur-bypoll-101631043776061.html
08-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh airport: Approach lights on runway to ease fog woes||In a major relief from grounding of flights due to fog, the Chandigarh International Airport has installed approach lights with touchdown zone on the runways, which will allow operations at a visibility as low as 550 metres instead of the existing 1,200 metres. An upgrade to the existing CAT-1 instrument landing system (ILS), it will become operational from October 1. It was carried out by Tata Power Strategic Engineering Division, after the defence ministry reportedly said that the installation of the advanced CAT-3 ILS was not viable. The CAT-3 ILS allows flights to operate even at a visibility of 50 metres.For the past few years, flights operating from the airport remain grounded from mid-December to mid-January due to foggy weather. “There will be no grounding of flights in foggy weather as we have installed 180 approach lights with touchdown zone on runways. Nearly 95% of the work is over and the entire work will be completed by September end. We will make it operational from October 1,” said Ajay Bhardwaj, chief executive officer (CEO) of the airport.Bharadwaj said the new system will allow pilots to land with the help of instruments if they cannot establish visual contact with the runway, especially in foggy conditions, even when visibility is down. At present, the airport faces frequent cancellation of flights in peak winter, when visibility drops due to fog.The airport got the international tag six years ago, and in April 2019, round-the-clock operations began, allowing landing of wide-bodied aircraft. However, no big aircraft is in the pipeline yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-airport-approach-lights-on-runway-to-end-fog-woes-101631043595864.html

08-09-2021||Chandigarh||PU senate: Polling for graduate constituency on September 26||After deferring it last month, Panjab University (PU) on Tuesday announced that the election for the registered graduate constituency of varsity senate will be held on September 26.

The election date is also subject to the approval of one of the states (Uttarakhand), where polling booths are also to be set up for the registered graduate constituency. The polling for the constituency was earlier scheduled to be held on August 18, but was deferred by PU on August 13 citing the non-availability of required polling booths in Punjab and Haryana at that time.After deferring the polls, PU had last month again written to Delhi and Uttarakhand, seeking facilitation of the setting up of polling booths for the conduct of polls. While the directorate of higher education (DHE), Delhi, has asked Delhi University to take necessary action and follow up the matter, PU hasn’t received any response from Uttarakhand yet. The registrar of the Delhi University, north campus, has been directed to coordinate with the registrar-cum-returning officer, PU, regarding the conduct of polling for the registered graduate constituency.Last month, the State Council of Educational Research and Training, Punjab, had informed PU that schools can be made available for setting up booths for senate polls on Sundays.Of the eight constituencies of PU senate, the registered graduate constituency is the largest with around 3.61 lakh voters, who elect 15 members to the senate.

08-09-2021||Mumbai||Pollution from tarballs in Mumbai: Who is to blame for it?||Despite the visible problem of tarball pollution on city shores, officials from multiple government bodies – including the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the environment department – said they do not have the legal mandate to address the issue. This has drawn the ire of experts and citizens, who said that the problem needs an urgent fix to curb the impact on both marine ecology and public health.The origin of these tarballs – blobs of weathered petroleum mixed with debris and sand – which have been showing up on shores between Gujarat and Karnataka for decades, is still ambiguous. A 2013 paper by the National Institute of Oceanography had linked tarballs found in south Gujarat to offshore drilling rigs in Bombay High. A second paper in 2014 also came to similar conclusions about tarballs found in Goa. Bunker oil and ballast water discharged into the open sea can also lead to the formation of tarballs, which can be as small as coins or as large as footballs. In other instances, they may emanate naturally from seepages in the ocean bed.In Mumbai, too, tarballs have been washing up on city beaches for several years during the monsoon, when strong onshore winds and changing currents bring them to shore. However, due to a dearth of publicly available studies, and the lack of any official response plan at central and state levels, experts can only venture calculated guesses as to where they come from – though there is an overwhelming anecdotal consensus that the primary source is offshore hydrocarbon exploration by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) at Bombay High oil fields. An ONCG spokesperson denied this allegation and declined to provide a comment this story.But the origins of these pollutants are only half the concern. As Shaunak Modi, director of the Coastal Conservation Foundation (CCF), said, “We need to consider the impact this oil is having on both marine life and the general public. Oil, whether crude or processed, floats on the surface of the water, and there is no doubt that animals living in the uppermost column of the ocean are coming into contact with this material.”Yashwant Sontakke, joint director (water), Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), referred to the occurrence as a “routine phenomenon”, and pointed out that it does not have a legal mandate to either monitor or resolve complaints of marine pollution. “They are a natural occurrence, and even in developed countries, they are seen along the beaches. The only solution here is to actively clean them up, and that is the responsibility of the local administration where the pollution is reaching. At the moment, there is no national or state-level plan to tackle the issue,” he said.Modi, who previously observed dead fish lying amid tar deposits in Mumbai, also recollected a recent incident when he was involved in rescuing a sea turtle covered in oil. Just four days ago, a finless porpoise (protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972) was found dead on Juhu beach amid oil deposits. “We can’t conclusively say that the porpoise died due to the tar, of course, but the state government, the maritime authorities and city administration need to initiate the first steps toward understanding the scale of the problem. Simply cleaning up the beach when the tarballs arrive is not a solution,” he said.BMC said they have been cleaning up the deposits regularly in demand to citizens’ response, but emphasised that they, too, do not have any legal mandate for undertaking further steps. Prithviraj Chavan, assistant municipal commissioner at K-West ward (Andheri), did not respond to requests for comment. A junior official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “BMC’s job is not pollution control. Let us assume that the tarballs are coming from the crude oil industry or from ships. We do not have the power to fine them. That is the job of the maritime authorities or the pollution control board. I can’t be sure, but if it was in our power, we would have already taken action against them.”The environment department, meanwhile, said that the responsibility to address pollution from tarballs lies with MPCB. “The right authority to tackle this problem is MPCB, which comes under the environment department. It does not directly come under my purview,” said Narendra Toke, director, environment and climate change department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pollution-from-tarballs-in-mumbai-who-is-to-blame-for-it-101631042397217.html

While leaving the hospital, Pimple spoke to the media and requested all the authorities concerned to find out the motive behind the attack.“Although it has been said that the accused is a hawker and the incident occurred while we were clearing illegal hawkers at Kasawadavli, I feel that this is a planned incident, as earlier in the week, we had taken action against illegal structures and hotels during the anti-encroachment drive. The attack took place while we were returning to our vehicles after the completion of the drive. If he was indeed a hawker, he would have reacted immediately [during the drive]. Moreover, I have been in this field for 11 years but have never experienced any such reaction by hawkers,” said Pimple. She also expressed gratitude to all those who extended support.Pimple added: “I am a Navy officer’s sister and have courage. I will not stop with this incident. It will take a month for me to recover but I shall join with the same vigour to take action against encroachments.” Earlier in the day, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray at an online inaugural function in Dombivli said no mercy will be shown to hawkers and strict action will be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-asst-civic-chief-wants-to-know-motive-behind-attack-by-hawker-in-which-she-lost-2-fingers-101631041735724.html
08-09-2021||Lucknow||Modi to lay foundation of university in Aligarh named after Jat king||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Aligarh in western Uttar Pradesh on September 14 to lay the foundation stone of a state university named after Jat king Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh, after whom the RSS-BJP had in the past wanted renaming of the Aligarh Muslim University. This will be the first of the many visits of Modi ahead of the 2022 assembly election in UP, BJP leaders said adding that a detailed itinerary of the PM was being worked out. Last year, Modi had virtually attended the centenary celebrations of AMU but ahead of 2022 UP polls, much political symbolism is being attached to his visit to lay the foundation stone of a state university in Aligarh after Singh, the erstwhile king of Mursan (in Hathras district), who belonged to a community currently at the forefront of the farmers’ stir across the state against the Centre’s three farm laws. Ahead of PM’s visit, chief minister Yogi Adityanath would visit Aligarh on (September 8) Wednesday, a state government spokesman said. The CM would review preparations for the PM’s visit and issue necessary instructions to officials, the spokesman said. Interestingly, Mahendra Pratap Singh, a leftist in his political ideology, had defeated BJP stalwart and former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee from Mathura in 1957 when Vajpayee had contested on a Jan Sangh ticket while Singh as an independent. The farmers’ stir (majority of protesting farmers in UP are Jats), backed by the opposition parties, has been gaining momentum ahead of the UP polls and the BJP’s Uttar Pradesh unit has been targeting the stir through a series of cartoons depicting Yogi Adityanath as a no-nonsense chief minister. “It’s clear that closer to elections, BJP would want to re-emphasise the point about the neglect of freedom fighters or patriots like Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh. Since he happened to be a Jat too, the political symbolism of the move to get the PM to lay the foundation stone of another university in Aligarh is obvious. However, none should object as Singh was a true freedom fighter who deserves all credit,” said Irshad Ilmi, a political commentator. AMU officials admit that the Jat king had in 1929 given 3.04 acres of land to the university on a 90-year lease that expired in 2019, the year when the Yogi government announced to set up a state university after the late king. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, whose office confirmed the PM’s visit, had said in a public meeting that the Jat king had posed a big challenge to the British and later was believed to have set up a provisional government in Afghanistan. “The Raja was dead against Muhammad Ali Jinnah and had in a letter to Mahatma Gandhi described him as a snake,” claimed Aligarh BJP chief Rishi Pal Singh. “We are proud that a university has been named after a patriot who was against Jinnah and all lovers of his ideology. It would have been befitting had AMU honoured the great leader who had been the president of the provisional government at Kabul in 1915 and who donated land for AMU,” the BJP leader said. Back in 2018, the party’s Aligarh MP Satish Gautam had written to the AMU vice chancellor objecting to a portrait of Pakistan’s founder in the university. The Rashtriya Lok Dal, an ally of the state’s main opposition Samajwadi Party, has welcomed the decision to set up a university after the Jat king.RLD spokesman Rohit Agarwal said party chief Jayant Chaudhary has welcomed the decision. “Raja Mahendra gave land to AMU and was a great freedom fighter. We welcome the decision to honour his legacy and in fact demand a Bharat Ratna for him,” the RLD spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/modi-to-lay-foundation-of-university-in-aligarh-named-after-jat-king-101631041618562.html

The counting of votes will take place on October 3 – the week before Durga Puja celebrations kick off in Bengal. What to expect at the campaign?The TMC chief will launch the campaign following a meeting with her party workers in south Kolkata, those familiar with the development told news agency PTI. “Mamata Didi will address party workers tomorrow and give them direction on how to campaign and the issues that will be highlighted,” a senior TMC leader said, adding that the party leadership mentioned that the campaign must held be in adherence to norms necessitated to check the spread of Covid-19.According to news agency PTI, the chief minister will address her party workers as well as leaders of all eight municipal wards of the Bhabanipur constituency at an auditorium.Another senior TMC leader told PTI that the party’s state president Subrata Bakshi has been given the charge of ward number 63, while party general secretary and state minister Partha Chatterjee has been assigned wards 71 and 72. Additionally, state minister Firhad Hakim and other senior TMC leaders have been tasked with looking after the remaining wards that fall under the Bhabanipur constituency. “This has been done to ensure that Didi (Banerjee) wins the seat with a record margin,” the TMC leader added. Why is it important for Banerjee to win?Banerjee had lost to her former aide Suvendu Adhikari by a close margin of 1,956 votes from Nandigram constituency in the assembly polls this year. However, as TMC came back with a thumping majority, Banerjee was sworn in as the chief minister for the third time. As per the Constitution, the TMC supremo has to win on any seat in the state to have the chance of becoming a member of the state assembly. In fact, she has to win before November 5 to remain the chief minister’s position.TMC’s Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, who originally won the Bhabanipur seat, vacated it for Banerjee to contest. Where do the opposition parties stand?West Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury confirmed on Tuesday that his party won’t field any candidate for the Bhabanipur bypolls, news agency ANI reported.As far as BJP is concerned, party’s state general secretary Sayantan Basu informed PTI on Tuesday that they will announce the name of its candidate against Banerjee in a couple of days.Also Read | TMC officially fields Mamata from Bhabanipur home turf"The Election Commission has decided to hold by-elections on September 30. We had the idea that it would be held sometime later. But we must obey the EC order. We don't oppose independent constitutional bodies like the EC, unlike the TMC," Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said. What is Banerjee’s record in Bhabanipur?Banerjee is herself a resident of Bhabanipur, and has won twice in the previous two assembly polls. She has been contesting from the seat ever since TMC came into power in Bengal by routing the Left Front after its 34-year rule.It was for the first time this year that Banerjee decided to contest from the Nandigram seat in what seemed to be a power tussle between her and Adhikari, who left the TMC to join the BJP a few months before the assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bhabanipur-by-polls-mamata-s-plans-to-ensure-she-remains-the-cm-of-bengal-101631039639064.html

At least six persons, including four from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were injured in the clashes which occurred with the CPM at two separate places in the district on Monday. Soon after the arrest, the CPM alleged that the arrest was illegal and demanded they be released soon. Sonamura sub-divisional police officer Banoj Biplab Das said that four cases were lodged regarding the clash incident, including one suo moto case, by the police as few of them received minor injuries and their clothes were torn. “We didn’t arrest anyone illegally. The four were arrested today in relation to the clashes targeting Manik Sarkar’s programme. Currently, they are in judicial custody till September 10,” said Das. The CPM also alleged that one of their party members, identified as Subhash Deb, was assaulted by a group of BJP-backed cadres and was taken to a local hospital from where he was referred to Govind Ballabh Pant (GBP) hospital in Agartala. The police said that they didn’t receive any complaint regarding this. “We rescued him after getting the information and took him to the hospital. The incident has no relation with Manik Sarkar’s programme,” said Banoj Biplab Das. The BJP refuted the allegation of attacking any CPM supporter. “The CPM believes in violent politics. They attacked and injured our activists. We didn’t attack any of them,” said BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tripura-police-arrest-4-suspects-in-clashes-targeting-leader-of-opposition-s-programme-101631040176177.html

This came after a delegation of Indirapuram residents met the GDA vice-chairperson, Krishna Karunesh, on Tuesday and urged him to look into the matter at the earliest.Members of the federation of Association of Apartment Owners (AOA), including women members from Ahimsa Khand II, raised issues like dilapidated roads, inadequate sewerage and drainage systems, and demanded a height barrier to stop movement of commercial vehicles in the area. “The condition of the roads has worsened, and we cannot even remember when these were repaired the last time. The silt cleaned from the drain is dumped on roads, which leads to clogging and overflowing. Bad roads and waterlogging during the monsoon affect the residents badly,” said Alok Kumar, founding member of the association.Ahimsa Khand II comprises 22 high-rise residential buildings, and it is located next to the Kanawani village in Ghaziabad. It is estimated to have a population of nearly 50,000 people. “The drains have also been encroached and must be removed. We also raised the issue of provision of public toilets in Indirapuram which is non-existent. Indirapuram is expected to have a population of four lakhs, and public convenience is much-needed here,” Kumar added.“We have been demanding a height barrier since 2015 as commercial vehicles freely move in our areas, posing risks to the residents, especially the children. They also damage the roads... The GDA vice-chairperson has promised to resolve the issues at the earliest,” said Shaili Singh, member of the association’s women wing.Karunesh said, “The residents raised all the issues faced by them, and we try to resolve those within September itself. Some issues are related to infrastructure, but the generic issues can be resolved if coordinated in a better manner. We will first consider land usage, and then construct public toilets...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/indirapuram-residents-seek-resolution-for-civic-infra-issues-101631039703263.html
08-09-2021||Noida||Okhla Bird Sanctuary improving habitat ahead of arrival of migratory birds||Noida: The forest department is improving the habitat in Okhla Bird Sanctuary (OBS) by making mounts, platforms and barriers in the wetland and removing hyacinth to welcome migratory birds there, officials said on Tuesday.The annual exercise of “habitat improvement” often takes around two months, they said. “Before the migratory bird species start arriving here, we work on the maintenance of the sanctuary to make it more welcoming to flocks, so that they stay here for a longer period of time. For this, the most gruesome task is to remove hyacinth which spreads across the lake by the end of monsoon, to such an extent that one cannot even see the water. Removal of hyacinth is important because migratory birds are mostly waterbirds... We will also tie up 20 mounts of hyacinth and as many bamboo platforms over the lake for roosting birds,” said Arvind Mishra, range forest officer, Okhla Bird Sanctuary.Several barriers will be made as 70% of the sanctuary is covered by water, Mishra said, adding, “Hyacinth is one of the major issues here. The water in the wetland has a flow and thus hyacinth is being carried in by the Yamuna river. So, during the birding season, we build several bamboo barriers to stop this from entering the vicinity of the sanctuary. Sometimes, when the water plants cover over 100-metre radius, the barriers break and need to be repaired again. We cannot put nets because that’s harmful for aquatic animals like turtles as they get stuck. Also, snets are banned under the wildlife Act... This annual task costs between ₹30 and ₹40 lakh.”Meanwhile, several patches along the sanctuary fell into the river on Tuesday, making huge craters. These are being repaired, said the officials.The OBS, spread over 400 hectares, is home to nearly 350 species of birds and attracts many migratory birds during the winters, and passage migrants during the summers. Migratory birds start arriving in the sanctuary in October and the maximum number of birds are seen around December. According to the Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) 2021, held by the Wetlands International South Asia (WISA) and the Gautam Budh Nagar forest department in January, 8,068 birds of 73 species -- 27 local migratory species and 46 migratory species -- were counted in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/okhla-bird-sanctuary-improving-habitat-ahead-of-arrival-of-migratory-birds-101631039577000.html

In the police station, SHO Sujeet Upadhyaya seized his mobile phone while a sub-inspector slapped him. The advocate was illegally detained for three hours. He was released after we intervened,” he said.The lawyers protested for about five hours from 11am-4pm. Later, a delegation of advocates met additional commissioner of police (law and order) Love Kumar and demanded suspension of the two police officers. Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said that the advocates’ delegation demanded an FIR against the police personnel and their suspension. “We offered to form a committee to investigate the matter. But the delegation did not agree to this,” he said.SHO Upadhyaya said a police team was conducting checks on September 1. “A barricade was placed on the road. Nagar stopped the car near the barricade. He was heavily drunk and was not able to remove his car. Then the personnel brought him to the police station. The advocate also refused to undergo a medical examination. We made a general diary entry and later released him,” he said. When contacted, Nagar refused to comment, saying that the GB Nagar Bar Association is handling his case. Despite repeated attempts, additional police commissioner Kumar could not be contacted for a comment.Meanwhile, the Bar Association has called a meeting on Wednesday to discuss further course of action in the case, Bhati said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-advocates-protest-at-police-commissioner-s-office-alleging-harassment-by-cops-101631039575002.html

It could be possible that the driver had taken a U-turn midway, along the expressway, to take the wrong side. We have 38 CCTV cameras along the expressway (from Phase 4 in Dasna to Meerut) and those are connected to our control room at Kashi toll plaza. We will check the CCTV footage to understand what had actually happened.”“We provide the traffic violation data to the Ghaziabad traffic police, but they have not been able to establish links with our systems,” Garg said, adding that Phase 2 (from UP-Gate to Dasna) along the DME has 40 CCTVs which are connected to the Dasna control room, but the link for data transfer is yet to be established between the NHAI and the Ghaziabad traffic police systems.Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic), said, “We have checked footage from four CCTV cameras, but could not spot the driver entering the expressway via the wrong side...

The chief minister’s statement came after over thirty children in three schools of the state tested positive for Covid-19.While reviewing the Covid-19 situation of the state, Patnaik said that from America to Kerala the Covid-19 cases are increasing in different places, therefore there is a need to follow the Covid guideline strictly.“As the children have not been vaccinated yet, we have to be careful for them,” he said, adding that the educational institutions would be held responsible if reports of negligence come to the fore. He also directed the local administration to form special teams to inspect the educational institutions regularly.Patnaik’s warnings came on the day when about thirty four school students from three different schools in Dhenkanal, Bargarh and Angul were detected with Covid-19. Kanapura High School in Kamakhyanagar area of Dhenkanal district was closed for a week days after twenty people, including fourteen students, tested positive. In a private school in Bargarh district, 14 students tested positive in the last two days while in Angul district two students were found infected with the virus.Odisha school and mass education minister Samir Dash said the investigation is on to find out how did the school students get infected. “After receiving the reports, we have launched a probe into the matter.

08-09-2021||Delhi||Pakistani spy’s dead wife’s life was a mystery like her death, say neigbhours||New Delhi: Until Saturday morning, when the decomposed body of a 51-year-old woman in the Chandni Mahal area was found inside her house, not many in this busy Walled City neighbourhood knew who she really was. For most residents, Mumtaz Parveen was a temperamental woman who lived alone and kept to herself, fed cats regularly, and fought with neighbours over trivial issues. It was only after her mysterious death last week that people got to know that she was a Pakistani national who was once arrested for spying, circulating counterfeit currency, and helping operatives of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence. She was also convicted in related charges in 2007, but was released from the jail a year later on health grounds. A little after midnight on Saturday, Delhi Police broke open house number 480 in Chatta Lal Miyan bylane where Mumtaz lived and found her decomposed body inside. The nature of the injuries on her body suggested that she was murdered. Police have registered a case of murder but are yet to arrest anyone. Locals are curious as to how nobody knew that a convicted prisoner with links to Pakistani intelligence lived in their midst, and who murdered her and why. “I have seen her for 10-15 years but knew nothing about her past, especially her Pakistan connection. She lived alone and did not interact with anyone. We always saw her feeding cats. She would buy meat from a butcher here nearby and feed cats outside. Her kids lived in Meerut but did not visit her. This was also strange,” Fahim (45), who goes by a single name, said on Tuesday afternoon. Other neighbours said Mumtaz fought over trivial issues like water flowing outside her house or people dumping garbage outside her house. “Maybe our elders knew about her past but no one viewed her with suspicion. She appeared harmless,” said another neighbour, requesting anonymity. A copy of Parveen’s 2000 interrogation report after her arrest by Delhi Police’s Special Cell said she was born in Meerut and studied up to Class 5. She reportedly told the police that she dropped out and started doing daily chores “because of financial constraints”. At 15, she married a man named Sultan from Meerut and had three children with him. But by 1989, they had separated. “She was divorced by her husband because he did not like her hi-fi lifestyle,” the interrogation report said. The report said Parveen first visited Pakistan with her mother around 1990 to meet her maternal aunt in Karachi. There she married a man named Abdul Wahab Khan, a senior leader of the Muhajir Qaumi Movement-Haqiqi. In 1993, she got Pakistani citizenship. But that marriage also lasted only six years because she was unable to have a child. In 1996, while visiting India, Parveen met Kamran Gawhar, an ISI spy deported twice from India, onboard the Samjhauta Express. The police report says Gawhar, during this trip, convinced her to stay with him. When she returned to Pakistan, she filed for divorce and Khan paid her a sum of ₹10 lakh as alimony. She later confessed to the police about helping Gawhar pass off as an Indian national and circulate fake currency. On January 24, 2000, when she was arrested with Gawhar, police had also found fake currency of the face value of ₹8,000 on her. Police records show that Gawhar had entered India in 1994 and was deported in April 1999. He re-entered India under a false name in July 1999 and was deported in late 2000. “They were arrested by the Special Cell. She was a key operative of the ISI. She was even convicted by a court. We had all forgotten about this woman until Sunday when we heard the news of her murder. The murder is certainly not connected to terrorism. For Pakistan, she was of no use,” said an officer, who asked not to be named. While most of her neighbours said they knew nothing about Parveen’s past, Mohammed Ahmed Saifi (age), a social worker and resident of the area, claimed she had once divulged details of her past. “Maybe there are a few like me, who knew she was a Pakistan national. She treated me like her own brother. Maybe she wanted to share her life story,” said Saifi who knew her for the past 15 years. He also recalled her telling him once that Khan was a “high-ranking officer” in Pakistan. “They separated when he found out that Mumtaz had undergone tubectomy after having three children at a young age. I also have faint memories of Gawhar, who lived with her, in another house nearby. She was not always a Pakistan national but she died as one,” Saifi said. While police are yet to arrest anyone for her murder, Saifi suspected that the murder could be the result of a property dispute or enmity. “I spoke to her during the lockdown. There was a man named Wakil Ahmed who visited her. She had told me that Ahmed was murdered earlier this year and that her life is also in danger. But she also told some other neighbours that the man died of Covid-19. She was mysterious all her life. Her death is also one,” Saifi said. According to police, Gawhar was deported around nine years ago after completing his sentence. They said Gawhar and Mumtaz were married and initially lived in Karol Bagh area.Pakistan High Commission officials said they have not been informed of the reported case. “ Once they inform us about the case, we will ascertain if the deceased was indeed a Pakistan national or not,” an official, who asked not to be named, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pakistani-spy-s-dead-wife-s-life-was-a-mystery-like-her-death-say-neigbhours-in-delhi-s-chandni-mahal-101631038615569.html
08-09-2021||Delhi||Why two charge sheets on same Delhi riots complaint, court asks Delhi Police||The court trying cases pertaining to the 2020 north-east Delhi riots has sought a report from the Delhi Police for including the same complaint in two charge sheets, asking the prosecution on whether it would amount to “double jeopardy” – the legal principle that a person cannot be tried for the same crime twice in the same jurisdiction.The two charge sheets relate to cases of rioting and destruction of property. The court was conducting proceedings related to a case filed by a person named Zeeshan and seven others, registered under FIR number 117/2020. Zeeshan’s same complaint was also included with 16 others in a separate case, filed under 109/2020.The court had discharged three people in that case on September 2.“On September 2, this court had discharged the accused persons in FIR No.109/2020, PS Dayalpur. In the said case, one of the complaints tagged along with the main complaint was of Zeeshan’s. The matter was investigated...as well and charge sheet in the matter was filed. The said matter now stands disposed of…“In this case (117/2020), FIR was registered on the very same complaint by Zeeshan. The matter was again investigated and charge sheet filed. The learned special public prosecutor was asked a specific question as to how the present charge sheet is sustainable,” said additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said.The question of law here, essentially, becomes of how the proceedings against the accused in the second case can continue when they have been discharged in the first one, for the same sections of the crime in the same jurisdiction, justice Yadav said.Special public prosecutor (SPP) DK Bhatia sought time to take instructions, following which the matter was posted to September 9 for further hearing.On September 2, the court while dropping all charges against Shah Alam (26), Rashid Saifi (23) and Shadab (26), had come down heavily on the police for their failure to conduct a proper investigation in the north-east Delhi riots.In another riots case, the judge had asked the prosecution if it was permissible under law to club complaints pertaining to two incidents on two different dates under one FIR.The case filed under FIR 117/2020 involves suspended municipal councillor Tahir Hussain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/why-two-charge-sheets-on-same-delhi-riots-complaint-hc-asks-delhi-police-101631038255577.html

There are no protests (at Vasant Vihar) and nothing remains,” he submitted.In view of the change in circumstances, the judge closed the proceedings initiated by the association while refusing to pass any order in relation to the formulation of a policy on “congregation of foreign nationals/asylum seekers/refugees”.Ejaz submitted that “last time also, there was a Rohingya crisis and people started gathering”. “It has become a routine now for people to gather and protest (outside UNHCR),” he said.Additional standing counsel Satyakam, appearing for the Delhi Police, said “a small nudge goes a long way” and “nothing remained” in the petition in the absence of any protest at the site.Taking note of the submissions, justice Palli said “nothing survives (in the petition). I’m not inclined at this stage.” She declared the petition “dismissed as withdrawn” and gave liberty to the petitioner to approach again if the need arises.On September 3, the high court had directed the Delhi government and the police to ensure that number of Afghan nationals, protesting outside the UNHCR office, is reduced and that they strictly follow all Covid-19 protocols.The high court said that the law was the same for everybody and questioned the authorities as to how 500 persons could gather for a protest when the guidelines did not permit it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/afghans-no-longer-protesting-outside-unhcr-office-police-inform-delhi-high-court-101631037655432.html
08-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi gets light rain, IMD says more showers likely this week||New Delhi: Parts of the national capital received light rain even as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast light to moderate rain in the city over the next few days. Light rains were reported on Tuesday evening in south Delhi areas such as Connaught Place, East of Kailash and Lajpat Nagar, and in east Delhi’s Shahdara and Laxmi Nagar areas.Last week, IMD officials predicted an intense spell of rain between September 6 and 10. “A low pressure area has formed over the Bay of Bengal and is gradually treading towards north and central India. The thundershowers may be followed by light to moderate rainfall, and a heavy spell may occur around September 9,” said a senior IMD official. Scientists and weather experts had said that this could be the one of the wettest monsoons for the city in at least over the past decade.Compared to the normal monsoon rain of 572.9mm till this time of the year, Delhi has already had a 74% surplus -- 994.6 mm -- rain so far, shows IMD data.Monsoon in Delhi is officially considered between June 1 and September 30. Between August 31 and September 2, Delhi received 230 mm rain. With 112.1mm 24-hour rainfall on September 1, Delhi received the highest single-day rainfall for the month in the past 19 years, as per IMD data. “The intense spell in the beginning of the month was followed by light rain on and off in parts of the city. This month so far has not seen a completely dry phase. Also, with the rain forecast over the next few days, it may end up being one of the wettest monsoons over the past 10 years,” the official said. IMD data shows that it was in 2010 that Delhi had received the maximum rainfall --- 1031.5 mm --- over the past decade. Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, skymet, a private forecaster said that unlike July and August that saw dry phases in between heavy spells, September will see light rain activity on and off. “Delhi could receive good rainfall between September 9-10. Then, another system is likely to form over the Bay of Bengal around mid-september, which too could bring good rainfall in Delhi and surrounding region,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-gets-light-rain-imd-says-more-showers-likely-this-week-101631037595643.html

08-09-2021||Mumbai||BMC bans gatherings, darshan in Ganesh pandals amid 3rd Covid wave fear in Mumbai||Amid fear of a third Covid-19 wave, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has banned any type of procession or gathering and physical darshan of devotees inside Ganesh pandals. The civic body has instead asked the mandals to arrange for online darshan.The BMC has limited the gathering of people during immersion of the idol to not more than 10 people in the case of Ganesh mandals and not more than five people for those who are taking the idol home.The BMC has ruled that those residing in sealed buildings have to make their own arrangement for immersion inside their house and those mandals inside containment zones have to arrange for immersion inside the pandals or postpone the immersion.The civic body has appealed that those who take part in immersion should preferably be fully vaccinated. The same cap is kept for the arrival procession of the Ganesh festival on Friday. The BMC has also appealed that environment-friendly Ganesh idols at home should be immersed in a bucket or drum, if possible. The BMC has also appealed to citizens to use artificial ponds for immersion and to perform aarti before reaching the site of immersion. The BMC in a statement said, “Instead of the traditional method of performing aarti at the site of immersion, the aarti should be performed from the start point at mandals or inside the home to ensure minimum time taken at immersion site.” The BMC has also appealed to citizens to follow all Covid-19 protocols like maintaining social distance, wearing a mask etc.”Further, the civic body has also asked Ganesh mandals to not stop their vehicle anywhere during immersion and to drop the idol at collection centres of BMC. The officials will do immersion in the sea.An appeal is also made to Ganesh mandals to give priority to the immersion of idols at the nearest artificial immersion site, rather than going to the sea.The BMC further said, “Ganesh mandals should not take the vehicle carrying the idol from the mandap to the immersion site at a very slow speed like a procession but should take the vehicle to the immersion site at a normal speed so as not to injure the idol in the vehicle. It is strictly forbidden to stop the vehicle during immersion and allow devotees to take darshan/ worship of Ganesha idol on the roads.”Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar on Tuesday appealed that citizen should adopt the concept of ‘My house, My Bappa’ wherein one celebrates the Ganesh festival inside their homes only. Pednekar told news agency ANI, “Citizens should celebrate festivals at their home only and even mandals should ensure that they do not gather inside the pandal. We also need to take all precautions considering third wave is not going to come but it is already there.” The BMC has maintained that the third wave has not yet arrived, and the next 30 days will be crucial.Further, children and senior citizens have been advised to stay away from the immersion site.Meanwhile, there are a total of 73 natural immersion sites in Mumbai and further 173 artificial sites at 173 locations. The BMC will also set up an immersion desk where citizens can keep their idols at artificial ponds. Every year, over 10,000 Ganesh mandals celebrate the festival and over 150,000 lakh homes take the idols to their home. However, since the past two years, the celebrations have been toned down owing to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3rd-covid-wave-fear-in-mumbai-bmc-bans-gatherings-darshan-in-ganesh-mandals-101631036703213.html
08-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police sub-inspector robbed of ₹40,000 in RK Puram||A 31-year-old Delhi Police sub-inspector was waylaid, assaulted, and robbed of ₹40,000 and documents by three unidentified bike-borne assailants when he was returning home on his bike in south Delhi’s RK Puram, police said on Tuesday. A case of robbery and common intention was registered at the Vasant Vihar police station. No arrest was made till Tuesday evening.Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh said the sub-inspector, Kunal Kumar, is posted at Bindapur police station. He lives with his family in Munirka. The officer was returning home from the police station when the crime took place on Saturday night, the DCP said.Police said the sub-inspector, in his complaint, said he left the police station after work on his motorcycle and was not in his uniform. Around 10.30pm, near the Swami Malai Mandir in RK Puram’s Sector-7, three men on a bike waylaid him, forcing him to stop. The alleged assailants began attacking him with their helmets and stones. Since the police officer was also wearing a helmet, he did not receive any head injury. They also damaged his motorcycle before robbing him of his wallet and a packet that contained money and documents, the police said.“We have registered a case under Indian Penal Code’s sections 392 (robbery) and 34 (common intention) on the sub-inspector’s complaint and are looking for the suspects,” said DCP Singh.The police are scanning the CCTV cameras installed on the routes that the suspects took after the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-sub-inspector-robbed-of-40-000-in-rk-puram-101631036275155.html
08-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai to Ahmedabad bullet train project may miss 2023 deadline||The Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project may miss its 2023 deadline. The construction work for India’s first high-speed train corridor has gained momentum in Gujarat, but is stuck in Maharashtra due to opposition to land acquisition.With 30% land acquisition in Maharashtra by the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL), the body that will undertake the construction of the corridor, the deadline of the project is likely to be extended. To speed up the land acquisition work in Maharashtra, minister of state for railways Raosaheb Danve will meet NHSRCL, Western Railway and collectors of Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts in Mumbai on Wednesday. “I will be discussing the bullet train project at length on Wednesday with all officials. All concerns will be discussed,” said Danve on Tuesday. Of the 508.17km of the project, 155.76km is in Maharashtra, 384.04km in Gujarat and 4.3km in Dadra and Nagar Haveli. The estimated cost of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project is ₹110,000 crore, of which ₹88,000 crore will be funding from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The project has a completion deadline of 2023. As per NHSRCL, overall 75% of the land required for the corridor has been acquired for the project, of which 28% is in Maharashtra. At least 97% of land acquisition has been done in Gujarat and 100% in Dadra and Nagar Haveli. The body recently invited tenders for design and construction of track for double high-speed railway line between Vadodara and Sabarmati depot in Gujarat and has started on-ground construction work in the state. Civil work contracts for the construction of five railway stations, Sabarmati terminal, construction of 28 steel bridges crossing over railway lines, rivers, highways and road structures have been awarded. “In Gujarat, nearly 90% of the land has been handed over to the contractors for the construction work and the work is going on in full swing,” said a senior NHSRCL official. In Maharashtra, the body has invited bids for the construction of the underground railway station at BKC. The last submission date for the bid is in December and the construction is likely to start mid-2023. “Construction work can only begin once we have 90% of the land in our possession. Efforts are on to get the required land before construction-related contracts can be awarded in Maharashtra,” added the NHSRCL official. After taking charge as the railway minister in July, Ashwini Vaishnaw conducted a detailed review meeting of the high speed corridor project and directed the NHSRCL officials to speed up work and take steps to increase land acquisition in Maharashtra. “We are in constant discussions with the Maharashtra government regarding land acquisition and are working to acquire the land required in the state,” said the official. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had earlier questioned if the bullet train project was of any benefit to the state and the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) appeared non- committal on the project after coming to power. Danve said, “The bullet train project is targeted to improve development in the area and it will help the state.” Further, the railway ministry is looking into completion of the bullet train corridor project in Gujarat by 2023. Passenger associations have asked for keeping the politics aside and focus on the development that will be done after the bullet train corridor becomes operational. “Initially, when Rajdhani Express between Mumbai and Delhi was supposed to start, people thought it would not be profitable and there was hesitancy. The train is now the most popular train on the route. Politics over bullet train should be kept aside by the state and central government and the focus should be overall development of both the commercial hubs and the country. Construction work in Maharashtra should be started soon,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-to-ahmedabad-bullet-train-project-may-miss-2023-deadline-101631036215411.html
08-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to discuss reopening school for classes 6-8 at next DDMA meeting||New Delhi: The Delhi government is planning to discuss the reopening of schools for students of classes 6 to 8 in the upcoming Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) meeting as per the graded response advised by the expert committee, officials in the education department said on Tuesday.“Since the current DDMA order is valid till September 15, the discussions on the next step will happen before that. The expert committee constituted by DDMA called for a graded response, meaning schools will first reopen for classes 9 to 12 followed by 6 to 8, and then primary classes if the situation remained conducive. Now that schools have started functioning and we haven’t seen the spread of the coronavirus in schools or violation of Covid-19 protocols, we propose to discuss reopening of classes 6 to 8 in the next phase,” a senior official of the education department said, requesting anonymity.In August, DDMA set up a committee of experts that included officials of education and health departments to work on a strategy for re-opening schools and educational institutes in Delhi. The committee submitted its suggestions on August 25, recommending graded reopening for schools beginning with students of classes 9 to 12 followed by junior classes.Schools in the national capital were allowed to reopen for classes 9 to 12 from September 1. The DDMA order issued on August 30 asked schools to follow all SOPs on Covid-appropriate behaviour and rope in parents while planning the measures to be undertaken by schools to ensure safety. Several private schools have expressed confidence over reopening schools for junior classes.Malini Narayanan, chairperson of the National Progressive Schools’ Conference which has 122 Delhi schools under its umbrella, said that private schools were mostly keen on having younger students back to school.“Studies have shown that younger children are more resilient than older ones and students in the age group for classes 6 to 8 are have also learned how to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Though there are some apprehensions, parents and children across schools are mostly keen about the resumption of in-person classes. If schools reopen for classes 6 to 8, more students will be coming to school which might help schools start transport and school bus services. That will be a big factor in getting more students back to school as lack of bus facilities is a major problem for parents.”Several health experts also recommend reopening schools for all age groups as there is no evidence that it would lead to a greater infection risk among children. The Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine also came out with an advisory report on Sunday pointing out that keeping children at home further may lead to lasting social and developmental impairment along with increasing inequality among privileged and underprivileged children.“School closures not only exposed the socio-economic educational inequality but also exacerbated it as it relied heavily on family support and resources available both in the home and at the school. The closure of schools has not only differentially interrupted the learning of students but also restricted their opportunity for overall physical, social and emotional development in a way that could have lasting repercussions,” the report stated.However, government school principals have expressed concerns over the reopening of junior classes. Government school principal Sukhbir Singh Yadav, president of Vice and Principals’ Association of Delhi, said, “Our staff has been engaged in Covid-19 duties including those at the airport, working at vaccination centres at schools and hospitals. Even available trained graduate teachers (TGTs) are busy with classes 9 and 10 because the students have been split into multiple groups to follow physical distancing. There is also a space crunch in several schools. Besides, the festive season is coming and in such a scenario, it would be prudent to wait a few weeks till taking a call on the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-next-ddma-meeting-delhi-govt-to-discuss-reopening-school-for-classes-68-101631036035374.html
08-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: DTC signs deal to build seven charging stations in its properties||Delhi will soon get dedicated charging and battery swapping stations for electric vehicles (EVs) at seven properties, including bus depots,owned by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Tuesday, after signing an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a private firm for setting up the infrastructure.The charging stations, which will come up at Dwarka sector-8, Dwarka sector 2 depot, Mehrauli terminal, Nehru Place terminal, Okhla CW-II, Sukhdev Vihar depot and Kalkaji depot, will be built by Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL) in collaboration with the DTC.Once commissioned, EV owners will be able to track the availability of slots at the charging stations even on the Delhi government’s One Delhi mobile application, said the minister.“Each location will have a total of six charging points -- three for two- and three-wheelers, and three for four-wheelers. Once installed, these locations, the real-time availability of charging points will also be shown on the One Delhi mobile app of the Delhi government,” said Gahlot.Further, CESL will, wherever feasible, integrate solar rooftops and connect it to battery storage systems (BSS), thereby using renewable energy to power the charging stations, he said.According to the MoU, Energy Efficiency Services Limited, through its subsidiary organisation CESL, will procure, install, operate and maintain charging units and related infrastructure at the location of the DTC area, at its own cost. It will also pay DTC a monthly amount of ₹1 per kWh of energy dispensed.If the space required by the concessionaire is more than three ECS (equivalent car space), then DTC will levy a further ₹2,000 extra per ECS per month.CESL will start work immediately and set up the charging stations in four months, the government later said in a statement.On August 7, 2020, the AAP government notified the Delhi EV Policy 2020 -- unveiled in December 2019 by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal -- with an aim to reduce air pollution and to kickstart the economy by spurring demand. It envisages that 25% of all new vehicle registrations should be battery electric vehicles (BEVs) by 2024. The policy offers subsidies, and road tax and registration free waivers, for electric vehicles bought in the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhidtcsignsdeal-to-build-seven-charging-stations-in-its-properties-101631035556549.html
08-09-2021||Delhi||Lack of infra delays rollout of e-buses, says transport dept||The roll-out of the first batch of electric buses in Delhi, scheduled for November this year, has been delayed by about two months, senior officials privy to the matter said on Tuesday. Now, Delhi is likely to get its first set of e-buses only by January 2022. Officials said the launch was delayed because the charging infrastructure for these buses is still not ready and is likely to take at least another three more months to be commissioned. Also, the two manufacturing companies that are to provide the e-buses are yet to show their final prototypes to the Delhi government, which is another reason for the launch being pushed to January.A total of 300 e-buses are being procured by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), a first in the national capital. Of these 300 e-buses, 200 are to be provided by JBM while the remaining 100 will be manufactured by Tata Motors. “The induction of 300 electric buses by the DTC at one go will be the largest engagement of its type by any state transporter in the country. There will be a slight delay of about two months because the depots are still undergoing all refurbishments. The power department and discoms have sought more time as setting up the charging infrastructure involves the laying of heavy duty lines,” said a senior DTC official, on condition of anonymity. In March this year, the DTC approved bids for procuring the 300 air-conditioned, low floor e-buses. These buses were to start arriving by October and the entire fleet was to be inducted by February 2022. However, the brutal second wave of Covid-19 slowed down the project as all non-Covid projects were put on hold by the government. The induction of these buses was then pushed to November. Now, officials said the roll-out of the first batch of buses is likely only by January 2022. The depots that are being readied with the adequate charging infrastructure include the Subhash Place depot, Mayapuri depot, Rohini-2 depot, Rajghat-2 depot and Mundela Kalan depot. Under the scheme, the buses will operate a minimum of 140km in a single charge. The operator will provide the driver and the DTC will depute its conductor on these buses. The operator will also be responsible for maintaining buses/batteries throughout the concessionary period of 10 years. The cost of electricity consumption will be borne by the DTC, officials said. Apart from that, last month, the Delhi government gave its go-ahead for procurement of another 465 e-buses under the cluster scheme — buses are run by private operators — and tenders are expected to be floated soon, a senior transport department officer said. The Delhi government intends to procure at least 1,000 e-buses under the cluster scheme and 300 under the DTC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lack-of-infra-delays-rollout-of-electric-buses-likely-only-by-jan-2022-says-transport-dept-101631035316027.html
08-09-2021||Chandigarh||Politicians, drug smugglers complement each other, nexus difficult to break: HC||Chandigarh The high court has lamented that the politician-smuggler nexus is very difficult to break in drugs cases because they complement each other. “…politicians require easy money and muscle power for their political aims, which the drug smugglers are more than willing to provide. In return, they seek political patronage so that their nefarious activities go unchecked and without hindrance,” the bench of justice HS Madaan observed, adding that the political patronage provided to drug traffickers meant that the law enforcement agencies of the region would be under pressure from political bosses and turn a blind eye to activities of drug smugglers. The bench was dealing with bail pleas in a 2019 FIR registered in Sangrur. The allegations were that during elections, one of the accused had got 2 quintals of poppy husk from a person in Tohana area of Haryana. Those accused in Haryana were named by the main accused in his disclosure statements. They were before court seeking anticipatory bail and arguing that on merely basis of disclosure statements, they can’t be arrested. The issue of right to equality too was raised before the bench. The court observed that the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, has met with limited success in checking drug trafficking and drug abuse and the main reason for it is laxity in the implementation. “It is a lucrative business; many a times smugglers are having political patronage in running the racket and police too have been found hand in glove in some cases. The end result is that drug peddling is flourishing day by day instead of being brought under control,” the court said further adding that faulty probes and failure to implement provisions of the law are another reason for the menace. The bench also criticised the role of judiciary stating that at times some courts do show misplaced sympathy for the accused, which rather proves to be counter-productive. On fundamental rights of a person under the constitution, the high court observed that “for enjoying such right and protection, the act and conduct of a person should be clear and clean and not shady and doubtful”. The court added that while deciding on bail pleas, courts have to keep in view the ground reality that police of the region is not much trained in scientific investigation and necessary resources and infrastructure for collecting other evidence are limited. “The custodial interrogation is much more effective and productive since no person of average intelligence, who is under the protective umbrella of pre-arrest bail, would utter even a single word, which may be read against him subsequently, and if custodial interrogation is denied, that would hamper the investigation,” it said, adding that while deciding on bails, petitioners’ past involvement in criminal cases too can be taken into consideration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/politicians-drug-smugglers-complement-each-other-nexus-difficult-to-break-hc-101631034776940.html
08-09-2021||Delhi||2 Delhi Police constables arrested for running extortion racket||Two Delhi Police constables have been arrested for allegedly running an extortion racket with the help of a civilian, who is still absconding, senior police officers said on Tuesday. Two cases of kidnapping and extortion, filed on the separate complaints of two businessmen from central Delhi, have been solved with their arrest, police said.The constables, identified by their first names, Sumit and Pramod, were posted in the first battalion of Delhi Armed Police (DAP). Both of them were suspended and the procedure to dismiss them has been initiated, senior officers said. Searches are being conducted to nab the third suspect, identified as Manjeet. All three are from two villages near Kanjhawala in outer Delhi, said a senior police officer, who asked not to be named.Explaining the modus operandi of the three men, the officer said they impersonated officials of the copyright and trademarks division and conducted fake searches at business establishments, factories and shops in central Delhi’s Karol Bagh.“They used to apprehend the owner of the business establishment and make him sit in their car on the pretext that they were taking him to their office for further interrogation and investigation. After driving around the city for a while with the businessman, they would demand money to “settle the matter”. They would force the businessman to call him family and arrange the money for his release,” said the officer.On August 27, a second police officer said the trio went to the shop of a jeans manufacturer, Ashok Kumar, on Tank Road near Karol Bagh, and identified themselves as officials from the trademarks division. They accused Kumar of manufacturing duplicate jeans of a prominent brand and told him that they had come to conduct a search after receiving a complaint. They then put Kumar in their i10 car.“Inside the car, they demanded Kumar to give them ₹5 lakh to settle the matter and release him. After negotiations, they agreed to release him for ₹3 lakh. Kumar’s family members paid the amount after which they released him. Kumar later approached the Prasad Nagar police and filed a complaint. A case of kidnapping and extortion was registered and investigations were started,” the second officer said.While the Prasad Nagar police were making efforts to identify and nab the suspects, a similar crime was reported at the Desh Bandhu Gupta (DBG) Road police station on September 3 by the owner of an automobile spare parts shop in Karol Bagh. The suspects extorted ₹4 lakh from the businessman’s family to release him.Investigators said they scanned CCTV cameras installed at the shops and the routes that the suspects took. One footage helped the police spot the registration number of the i10 car that was used in the crimes. The car was found registered in the name of constable Sumit’s wife.“We interrogated Sumit after the victims identified him as of one the suspects. After being confronted with the evidence, he admitted to the crime and led us to the other constable, Pramod,” the first officer said, adding that they are trying to find out if the suspects were involved in more such extortions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-delhi-police-constables-arrested-for-running-extortion-racket-duping-2-businessmen-of-money-101631034655141.html
08-09-2021||Delhi||AAP slams UP, Haryana, Punjab Rajasthan for ‘failing to control stubble burning’||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana and Congress-led governments in Punjab and Rajasthan of failing to control cases of crop residue burning, one of the major contributors to air pollution in the Capital during winters.“The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has found that the Congress-ruled states Punjab and Rajasthan, and BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have done nothing to prevent stubble burning. The governments in all these states have failed to subside and provide machinery to farmers to prevent stubble burning,” said AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj in a press conference at the party head office in central Delhi.He further said, “The Commission for Air Quality Management has rejected plans submitted by Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan for controlling stubble burning and taken note of the absence of any groundwork on part of the governments in these states. The Commission has warned that if the third wave of Covid-19 coincides with stubble burning pollution, then it may prove fatal.”Uttar Pradesh and Punjab are going to the assembly polls early next year and the AAP is contesting in both states. On August 25, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced that police cases registered against farmers for stubble burning will be withdrawn by the government.Ahead of the harvesting season, CAQM on August 22 asked Delhi and neighbouring states to ensure the adoption and application of a standard protocol developed by ISRO for estimation of crop residue burning events using satellite data.The commission, mandated to devise and execute plans to prevent and control air pollution in the national capital region and adjoining areas, has also asked Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to develop a time-bound comprehensive action plan, in consultation with stakeholder agencies responsible for monitoring and reporting of crop residue burning events, based on the protocol.Meanwhile, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “Bhardwaj’s comments on pollution due to stubble burning in neighbouring states is an excuse to ultimately evade responsibility of stopping stubble burning in Delhi. It is surprising to see Bhardwaj blaming the four neighbouring states but remaining silent on what the Delhi government is doing to help them curb pollution due to stubble burning. Farmers there are forced to burn stubble as it is economically not possible for them to get it removed from their lands. Delhi has crores of rupees of surplus environment fund, then why doesn’t it extend a financial package to neighbouring states to help their farmers remove stubble instead of burning it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-slams-up-haryana-punjab-and-rajasthan-for-failing-to-control-stubble-burning-101631034475813.html
08-09-2021||Delhi||34% EWS seats in Delhi’s private schools still vacant||Despite numerous interventions, 34% of seats reserved for the economically weaker section (EWS) students in entry-level classes in private schools this year are still vacant. “Of the around 33,000 seats allotted to EWS children this year, around 21,850 (66%) have been filled. The remaining could not be filled because the pandemic affected the general category admissions this year,” said a senior directorate of education (DOE) official, asking not to be named.Private schools have been admitting one EWS student from the government’s list for every three admissions under the general category in entry-level classes (nursery, kindergarten, and class 1) every year. This is done to ensure that the minimum 25% reservation, guaranteed to EWS/disadvantaged group (DG) students in entry-level classes under the Right to Education Act, is maintained.Of the 33,000 seats, 29,900 are in DoE-affiliated schools and the remaining are in schools recognised by municipal corporations. The seats have remained vacant despite multiple interventions by the education department in EWS admissions this year. Acting on complaints by parents, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia announced in June that all EWS children allotted seats in private schools will be given admission, regardless of general category admissions. However, in a circular released in July, DOE allowed private schools to seek exemption from admitting all EWS students on the grounds of low general category admissions.“According to a Delhi high court order, EWS admissions and general category admissions have to be in the category of 1:3. So, the department allowed schools to file for exemption only if they had taken all necessary steps to fill general category seats. We received applications from several schools and those that did not show adequate efforts to fill their seats were not given the exemption. The department is still coordinating with all district education department officials to ensure that the remaining students are not left out of the loop,” DOE official said.On July 24, HT reported that an association of private schools in the capital said they will not be following the state education department’s orders on granting admission to all allotted EWS students as it violates the RTE Act and the 2013 Delhi high court order in a similar case.SK Bhattacharya, president of Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools, said if a school declares 140 seats and is able to admit only 100 students under the general category, the EWS admissions should be on the basis of those 100 seats where actual admissions took place and not as per the declared seats to ensure that the 75:25 ratio between general and EWS admissions is maintained. Experts pointed that the DOE order resulted in many schools filing for exemption and leaving EWS students at a disadvantage yet again. Ekramul Haque, who runs NGO Mission Taleem that works with underprivileged children, said, “Despite the deputy CM’s announcement, there are blatant violations taking place using the exemption. We have flagged multiple such cases to the education department from Bawana, Mehrauli, Yamuna Vihar, and several parts of Delhi but there has been no response. Parents are worried that if the child’s age crosses the age limit of seven years, they will not be eligible for entry-level classes next year.”Shakurpur resident Nasreen Begum, mother of a six-year-old girl who was allotted a seat in a private school in Pitampura, said, “I have been trying to get my daughter admitted for the past two years. Coincidentally, my child’s name was allotted to the same school in the past as well, but the school did not even meet me. I am worried that my child’s future is at stake.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/34-ews-seats-in-delhi-s-private-schools-still-vacant-schools-blame-low-general-category-admissions-101631034416079.html
08-09-2021||Pune||IMD’s ‘vulnerability atlas’ to map districts prone to extreme weather in Maha||PUNE The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Tuesday announced the development of a “vulnerability atlas”, to highlight areas prone to natural disasters and issue warnings for the same in a detailed manner. Pulak Guhathakurta, head, Climate Research Division, IMD Pune, said that the vulnerability atlas will cover 13 major disasters.“It is a district-level vulnerability initiative for extreme conditions like heat-wave, cold-wave, and thunderstorms. The atlas will inform national disaster management teams and risk assessment will be based on information collected for years, which will help authorities to assess extreme climate conditions,” said Guhathakurta.DS Pai, scientist and head of climate research and services at IMD Pune, said that the vulnerability atlas will focus on an impact-based forecast for each district. “With 13 weather hazards in the entire country, districts which are more vulnerable will be identified and an impact-based forecast will be issued. Climate information will be used to inform and alert citizens,” said Pai.K S Hosalikar, head of surface instrument division (SID) at the Climate Research and Services, added that along with the already functional radar in Mumbai work on another radar in Goregaon is 90 per cent complete. “In June, the Mumbai radar was defunct which affected the forecasts. However, IMD is now increasing the radar coverage thus improving the forecast,” said Hoslikar.“Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Calcutta, and Ahmedabad will soon have apps dedicated to the weather forecasting. IMD cannot develop such apps singlehandedly. We are trying to deliver such apps for mega cities in the country,” said Hoslikar.As per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), India has witnessed a temperature increase of 0.7 degree Celsius in the last decade. “With the increase in average day temperature, it means that there is more capacity in the air to hold water, which has increased extreme rainfall events. There is a chance of an increase in extreme rainfall events,” said Hoslikar.“Many studies are indicating extreme events are increasing. Total seasonal rainfall will increase and extreme rainfall will also increase,” said Pai.Monsoon, this seasonPai further added that this year the southwest monsoon trough did not move much.“The Arabian Sea side was close to normal, but the Bay of Bengal side was not good. Not many weather systems helped the monsoon this season resulting in low rainfall,” said Pai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/imds-vulnerability-atlas-to-map-districts-prone-to-extreme-weather-in-maha-101631034174443.html
08-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to showcase 100 best entrepreneurship projects at business carnival||Launching the Delhi government’s seed money scheme, wherein each student of class 11 and 12 will be given an amount of ₹2,000 for developing a business idea/project of theirs, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday said the top 100 projects under the scheme will be displayed at a “business carnival” and 10 students with the best projects will get direct admissions to state universities.Students will be receiving the seed money as a part of the government’s entrepreneurship mindset curriculum (EMC), launched in 2019 for students of classes 9 to 12. Explaining the “business blasters” component of EMC, Sisodia said, “The objective of this project is to prepare children to make investments, eliminate fears of starting a business from their minds and to teach them to earn profit. Most importantly, even if they do not make a profit, they should learn to face failure.”Sisodia also said a business carnival will be organised, where the 100 best projects, at zonal and district level, will be showcased. “These projects will be rated by renowned entrepreneurs and universities. And the children involved in the top 10 projects will be directly admitted to the BBA (Bachelors in Business Administration) course in NSUT (Netaji Subhas University of Technology) and DTU (Delhi Technological University),” he said.In January, the Delhi government distributed seed money of ₹1,000 each to 41 students of the School of Excellence in Khichripur as a pilot programme. After nine groups of students emerged successful in developing their business ideas and earning a small profit, the government decided to roll out the programme for class 11 and 12 students on Tuesday.Students whose projects will be approved by schools will receive the increased seed money of ₹2,000 which was announced in the budget earlier this year.The announcement was made at an event on Tuesday to roll out the business blasters component of the programme at Thyagraj Stadium. “The biggest drawback of the education system is that we are imparting knowledge to our children but we have not inculcated an entrepreneurial mindset in them. We are teaching them to work hard, making them talented but have failed to instil in them the courage to become an entrepreneur,” Sisodia said while explaining the need behind EMC.“Through these programmes, instead of an army of job seekers emerging from our schools and colleges, we will have entrepreneurs who give jobs to the youth of the country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-showcase-100-best-entrepreneurship-projects-at-business-carnivalsisodia-101631034056668.html

While preparations have already started, a rush is seen at city markets, mainly in Raviwar peth, Tulshibaug and Bohri Aali. Despite this, traders and shop owners claim that business this year is down by almost 50 per cent as compared to last year. Nitin Pandit, president of the Tulshibaug market shop owners association said, “People are happy to celebrate the Ganpati festival, but in a small way this year. Everyone is struggling financially and most of them have avoided spending for celebrations. This has impacted our business majorly. Business is down by around 50 per cent as compared to last year and I think it will take Diwali to gain the momentum back,”“Over the last 10 days people have started coming to purchase decorations and other household items for the Ganpati festival, but it is only on the weekend. Rest of the week the number is low. We are already suffering financially due to the lockdown and now there are fewer customers,” said Pankaj Kendre a shop owner in Raviwar peth. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has deployed squads to take action against violators not wearing face masks or at shops where social distancing is not followed.Since September 1 the PMC’s Bhavani peth ward office, under which several markets fall, has taken action against 800 violators and fined them. “Our vigilance and continuous action is taken at the market places, but as it is the festive time we also go slow on the action. People from all around the district and even outside Pune come to the city markets for Ganpati shopping,” said a PMC squad officer on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ganesh-festival-traders-claim-business-down-by-50-as-compared-to-last-year-101631033214437.html
08-09-2021||Pune||ED actions against Maha leaders bid to subdue state govt: Sharad Pawar||PUNE NCP chief Sharad Pawar, on Tuesday, claimed that the Enforcement Directorate’s actions against various Maharashtra leaders are an attempt to encroach on the state government’s rights and meant to discourage political opponents.The central agency is currently conducting a probe into separate money laundering cases against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh and NCP leader Eknath Khadse. The central agency last week also conducted searches at multiple premises in Maharashtra linked to Shiv Sena MP Bhavana Gawali, also in connection with a money laundering case.“Never heard of so many ED actions in Maharashtra in the past. One action is going on against Khadse, another against Anil Deshmukh, also against Bhavna Gawali. There is an attempt to encroach upon the state government’s rights and discourage opponents by using these agencies as tools,” said the NCP chief, who was an architect in forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra, stitching together an alliance between the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena.To a question on the ED’s raids at premises linked to Bhavana Gawali, Pawar said the issue is about educational institutions.“When there are allegations against these kind of institutions, the complaints can be lodged before the charity commissioner. If not the charity commissioner, then there are state government agencies, but here directly the ED was involved,” the former Union minister said.Pawar also opposed the Reserve Bank of India’s interference in the co-operative sector and the appointing of an independent representative to the co-operative sector. Pawar alleged that with the help of RBI, the union government is “planning to end the co-operative sector.”“RBI is planning to appoint an independent representative to co-operative banks and institutes though it has no power to do so. This is an indirect step to take control of co-operative institutes. RBI’s approach towards co-operative banks is not good,” said the NCP chief.While earlier there was greater autonomy to select a cooperative bank’s chairman, now these institutions will have to go to the RBI for the same.Pawar said, “In the co-operative sector, members have a right to choose directors for their banks or institutes. If they do not like any director, they defeat them in the next election. This RBI decision intends to hand over these sectors to a few people.”The former union minister said he will discuss this issue with the Prime Minister and home minister in Delhi.“I will be going to discuss this issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home and co-operative minister Amit Shah. Their approach towards co-operatives is better and I am hoping that they will be convinced.”Pawar to stay away from all major eventsOn the issue of crowds at programmes being attended by leaders, when there’s possibility of a third Covid-19 wave, Pawar said, “I have seen many events happening where the (Covid-19 prevention) protocols are not being followed.”Pawar said since Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has asked political parties to immediately stop agitations, meetings and other events to avoid crowds he himself will not attend any programmes involving large gatherings“I will only attend programmes organised indoors with a limited number of people,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ed-actions-against-maha-leaders-bid-to-subdue-state-govt-sharad-pawar-101631032323480.html
08-09-2021||Pune||Dabholkar murder case: Framing of charges deferred by special court in Pune||PUNE: A special court in Pune on Tuesday passed an order to frame charges against five accused of the murder of rationalist Dr Narendra Dabholkar. However the framing of charges was deferred to September 15 after one of the accused, Virendra Tawade, insisted on meeting his family and lawyer in person before charges could be framed. The order was passed by special judge S R Navander with special public prosecutor (SPP) Prakash Suryavanshi and defence lawyer, advocate Virendra Ichalkaranjikar.Tawade who is accused of plotting the murder said, “The contact with the outside world is completely broken due to the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown. I request the court to allow me to meet my family, whom I have not met for a very long time, and my lawyer, before charges are framed.”Judge Navander said that framing of charges is procedural and that the accused’s demands could be met even after the framing was completed. “On one hand you say that the trial has been long pending and on the other hand, you are asking for extension. Why not let the trial begin and then you can communicate with your family,” he said.However, Tawade did not budge from his stance and judge Navander asked advocate Ichalkaranjikar to file an application for the said demand while assuring his approval.SPP Suryavanshi said, “The court has taken up all the charges brought by us. We will communicate to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) about the charges against advocate Sanjeev Punalekar (another accused). The framing will be deferred to September 15. We are not going to challenge this order.”Only four out of the five accused were present for the hearing. Vikram Bhave was present in person; advocate Punalekar joined through video conference; Tawade joined through video conference from Yerawada central jail; and Sachin Andure, one of the two accused shooters, joined through video conference from Taloja jail. Sharad Kalaskar, accused of shooting Dr Dabholkar at around 7.30am on August 20, 2013 atop Omkareshwar bridge, was not present for the hearing. Arthur Road jail, where he is lodged, did not respond to calls for video conferencing with the court. Members of Dr Dabholkar’s organisation, Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti, were also present in court.Tawade, Kalaskar, Andure and Bhave are facing charges of murder, criminal conspiracy and terror while Punalekar is facing charges of destruction of evidence. Tawade was arrested in 2016; Kalaskar and Andure were arrested in August 2018; and Punalekar and Bhave were arrested in May 2019. Chargesheets have been filed against all five accused by the CBI at different times. While the accused will be allowed to meet their family members and lawyers as per protocol of their respective jail, the court is expecting to frame charges on September 15.Once charges are framed, Tawade, Kalaskar, Andure and Bhave will face charges under sections 302 with 120(b), 302 with 34, and 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC); along with sections 3(25), 27(1), and 27(3) of the Arms Act; and section 16 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.

08-09-2021||Pune||Gang-rape of minor: 6 more, including girl’s friend, held in Pune||PUNE Six more people were arrested by the Pune police on Monday night, in a case of kidnapping and gang-rape of a minor, registered at Wanowrie police station. Among the six is a male friend of the girl whom she had come to meet at the railway station, when she was kidnapped, according to police officials. Police officials refused to reveal names of the accused citing a pending identification parade. The other five arrested, as per officials, are friends of the main accused, Mashak Abdulmajid Kanyal, who kidnapped and assaulted the girl. The police had earlier arrested eight and the latest arrests have brought the tally of accused to 14. All men have been remanded to police custody till September 16 by a local court. While the friend was not among the men who kidnapped and raped her, he was found with her in Chandigarh and had made no effort to report the incident to the police. The girl’s parents are in an economically humble condition - a bed-ridden mother and labourer father. In a harrowing account, the girl has told the police that she was deprived of sleep, clothes, her phone, and even food while she was captive. She was only given clothes while travelling from one place to another. Kanyal (27), a resident of New Mhada Building in Vaiduwadi area of Hadapsar, was the first one to kidnap and assault the girl with his friend whom he invited, as he led the girl astray in his autorickshaw from the Pune railway station. “They kidnapped her on the night of August 31 and took her phone away. On September 2, they put her in a bus to Mumbai and told her to never return to Pune and gave her the phone. She called her friend to Mumbai and further went to Chandigarh from there with him where we found her,” said Namrata Patil, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 5 of Pune police. The girl was taken to six different locations in the city by the ones who assaulted her. The 13 men are suspected to have all assaulted her in one way or the other within the two days during which she was captive. “We have formed five teams in total to check physical evidence, technical analysis, forensic work. As of today (Tuesday), all the accused have been arrested and the girl is undergoing a thorough examination,” said Patil. Reacting to the incident, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that justice will be done ensuring the strictest punishment to the accused. “The kidnapping and rape of the minor girl is shameful and frustrating and most of the accused are in custody. The state government will ensure that the accused get the severest form of punishment for their crime. Acknowledging the involvement of some railway workers, the state minister of railways will also be asked to work on putting a stop to such a mentality,” read a statement issued by Pawar. A case has been registered under Sections 363 (kidnapping), 376(d)(a), 377 (unnatural sex), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code along with Sections 4(2), 5(g), 6, 8, and 12 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offence Act at Wanowrie police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/gangrape-of-minor-6-more-including-girl-s-friend-held-in-pune-101631031174284.html

This would be made possible as the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation (IRSDC) will construct a passenger deck connecting the suburban platforms towards Crawford Market and outstation train platforms of the terminus.Currently, passengers have to de-board at CSMT and walk to the market or get down at Masjid Bunder railway station and take a cab. The plan is a part of CSMT’s redevelopment project that is being undertaken by IRSDC. Minister of State for Railways Raosaheb Danve held a review meeting of officials from Central Railway (CR), IRSDC, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) and Mumbai Port Trust on Tuesday.“The meeting was positive and all the agencies involved have agreed to plan and work on the redevelopment of the terminus,” said Danve.Further, a multi-model hub for interchange at metro and harbour railway at P D’Mello entrance of the station and extension of the eastern freeway is also being planned.“An interchange hub of metro, harbour railway and eastern freeway is being planned and the discussions regarding the same took place with multiple agencies,” said Anil Kumar Lahori, general manager, CR. Danve has asked all the authorities to coordinate and arrive at a consensus in a month on the development work of the project. CSMT’s redevelopment will be undertaken through the public private partnership (PPP) model at a cost of ₹1,642 crore. It is likely to start from December and is expected to be completed by 2025.The redevelopment plan will involve construction of commercial spaces, including restaurants and cafes, along with vehicular parking for passengers, inside the terminus.Segregation of outstation and local train passenger movements with the help of interconnecting decks has also been planned. Shifting of harbour railway platforms to P D’Mello entrance of the terminus will be undertaken as part of the redevelopment.Meanwhile, Danve travelled by a local train on Tuesday between CSMT and Dadar and inspected passenger amenities at Dadar and Matunga railway stations.At Dadar railway station, Danve flagged off a Konkan bound train that was booked on Full Tariff Rate (FTR).Min on Pawar’s charges“During Lalu Prasad Yadav’s reign, we didn’t have a government. CBI had put him behind the bars. Suresh Kalmadi was also probed by CBI during the Congress regime. ED and CBI have been established by them. I feel if we haven’t done anything, then we don’t need to be scared, said Danve in response to Sharad Pawar’s charges that BJP was using central agencies to target Opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/railways-to-build-deck-connecting-csmt-to-crawford-market-in-mumbai-101631029075246.html
