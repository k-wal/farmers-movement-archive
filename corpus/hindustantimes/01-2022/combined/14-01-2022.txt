Sanghmitra also made an emotional post on Facebook, saying that her father was a hero to her.“The meaning of my Facebook post is simple. All that I have tried to convey through it is that to me the party and my father are two different things. While I remain a loyal worker of the BJP and he has joined the SP, it does not affect the father-daughter relationship in any manner,” Sanghmitra said.Sanghmitra said her father never consulted her before leaving the BJP, nor did she ask him to reconsider his decision of moving out of the BJP. “In our family, the younger (person) respects the elders’ decisions,” Sanghmitra said. She also said that her father never advised or pressured her to part ways with the BJP after he quit the party.

14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Mother or father’s right to the custody of their minor child no longer absolute: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has said the child’s welfare is decisive for the claim of custody, and court while taking the decision is expected to strike a “just and proper balance” between this requirement of welfare of the minor child and parents’ rights over the minor child.“The term custody should not be interpreted in its strict sense as physical custody. Custody means custody in the sense of supervision and control over the child. The mother’s or father’s right to the custody of their minor child is no longer absolute,” the bench of justice Sant Parkash said, dismissing plea from a mother, who had demanded custody of her five-year-old daughter.The plea was from a Fazilka woman who had told court that she got married in 2014 and a daughter was born in December 2015. Later matrimonial dispute arose, and in September 2020, after she and her daughter were “abused”, she called her parents. When she was about to leave with her daughter, her estranged husband and his family members “snatched” the girl and assaulted her kin. She then moved an application for custody before police and child development presiding Officer, but allegedly no action was taken. The petitioner being biological mother is entitled for her custody, it was argued. The state in its inquiry report had submitted that the minor was not snatched and that she was not living in a pathetic situation. She has deep-rooted love and affection for her father and grandparents, and was being looked after well, it was stated in the report. A lower court upon plea from the woman had ordered status quo on custody. The high court observed that the most important consideration that must always weigh with the court while deciding custody is welfare of the minor. “..what would be for the welfare of the minor must necessarily depend upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. Sentiments and welfare of the minor are supreme consideration which cannot be ignored,” it said dismissing the plea from the mother, on the basis of facts that had emerged in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mother-or-father-s-right-to-the-custody-of-their-minor-child-no-longer-absolute-hc-101642183991036.html

14-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: Azad Samaj Party joins hands with Samajwadi Party||Ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, Azad Samaj Party (ASP) led by Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad entered into an alliance with the Samajwadi Party (SP) on Friday after Chandrashekhar met SP chief Akhilesh Yadav at the SP state unit office here in the morning.The Azad Samaj Party enjoys influence over Dalit community voters in the districts of west UP. Chandrashekhar is likely to contest assembly election in alliance with the SP in his stronghold Saharanpur. After meeting Akhilesh, Chandrashekhar said, “Discussion was held on alliance and seat sharing. The ASP has decided to join hand with the Samajwadi Party to defeat the Bhartiya Janta Party in the coming assembly election. The SP alliance led by Akhilesh Yadav will form the next government in UP.” The Samajwadi Party allies for the upcoming UP polls include the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the Mahan Dal, the Apna Dal (Kamerawadi) , the Trinamool Congress and the Janvadi Party (Socialist). The SP and RLD alliance on Thursday released the list of the 29 candidates who will contest election on the SP and the RLD tickets on the assembly seats located in western UP.Launched in March 2020, the ASP had contested the Bihar assembly election held in October, 2020, in alliance with the Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) led by Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav. The ASP and the JAP had joined Progressive Democratic Alliance (PDA) of the smaller political parties. The ASP failed to open its account in Bihar despite month-long campaign by Chandrashekhar Azad. In the zila panchayat ward election held in May 2020 in UP, the Bhim Army made its presence felt with winning wards in Bijnor, Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur districts. To mobilise the party cadre for the UP assembly election, the ASP had launched a bicycle yatra on July 1, 2020 in all 403 assembly segments in Uttar Pradesh. “The ASP will raise the issue of increasing atrocities on Dalit community members in UP, appointment on vacant posts according to the reservation formula, implementation of SC/ST/OBC reservation policy in the appointments for government jobs and price rise in the election campaign,” Chandrashekhar said.Fearing that ASP might cut into the BSP Dalit vote base, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati had called upon the party workers not to be misguided by the parties launched by some leaders to serve their vested political interests. “The Dalit community should remain wary of the political gimmicks of those who are claiming to be Dalit leaders. The BSP is not only a political party but a movement to fulfil the dreams of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram,” she had said.
14-01-2022||Lucknow||Yogi has meal at Dalit BJP worker’s home in Gorakhpur, targets Samajwadi Party||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had a “khichdi” meal at the residence of a Dalit worker of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the occasion of Makar Sankranti in Gorakhpur on Friday and targeted the Samajwadi Party, saying that under its rule there was “social exploitation” and not “social justice”.In contrast, the BJP government was working for the development of every section of the society without any discrimination, Yogi Adityanath said after taking the meal at the residence of BJP worker Amritlal Bharti in the Jhungia locality of Gorakhpur.Yogi Adityanath’s visit came a little before Swami Prasad Maurya and Dharam Singh Saini, who resigned from the BJP government earlier in the week accusing it of being anti-Dalit, gathered at the Samajwadi Party office in Lucknow to take up its membership in the run-up to the assembly polls beginning February 10.A total of 11 BJP MLAs and one Apna Dal (Sonelal) legislator have quit their respective parties since January 8. Eight of them, including the two former ministers, joined the Samajwadi Party on Friday. Another minister Dara Singh Chauhan had also resigned but he was not seen at the SP office on the day.Apparently hitting out at the former ministers who joined the Samajwadi Party, he said those who promote dynasty and family in politics can never be supporters of social justice. They are not fighting for the equality or the welfare of the backward and Dalit community but wish to promote corruption in politics, Yogi Adityanath alleged. Yogi Adityanath also said to reporters, “Only 18,000 houses were given to people under PM Awas Yojna in the full five-year term of the Akhilesh Yadav government in UP, whereas the present BJP government has given 45 lakh houses to the poor and the deprived under the scheme.”“It was ‘samajik shoshan’ (social exploitation) and not ‘samajik nyay’ (social justice) during the SP rule in UP,” he said, taking a swipe at his predecessor and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav.Rather, the land and houses of the weaker sections were grabbed under the Samajwadi Party rule, Yogi alleged. If this is the SP leaders’ policy of social justice then BJP will oppose it, he said. Yogi Adityanath also said 2.61 crore households got toilets and 1.36 crore families benefitted from the Ujjwala Yojana under the “double engine” government, referring to the BJP rule at the Centre and in the state.“Those in the grip of dynastic politics cannot give justice to any section of the society,” Yogi added.“The SP government had committed dacoity on the rights of Dalits and the poor,” he further said.“There has been no discrimination under the BJP government, the poor people have benefitted from welfare schemes. The society based on equality, free of corruption, rule of law and good governance are the ideals of the BJP government,” he said. “Community meal is an important means of establishing social equality. The dream of Dalit icon Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar is being fulfilled with the mantra ‘sabka saath- sabka vikas’ under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The country, as well as Uttar Pradesh, is moving fast on the path of development, good governance and nationalism,” he said.Akhilesh Yadav was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh from 2012 to 2017.Maurya and Saini, as well as almost all rebel MLAs, had accused the state government of not caring for the welfare of Dalits and the backward classes and said this was the prime reason for leaving the BJP camp.

As Covid cases are increasing each passing day, lawyers feel that virtual hearing of cases could be extended for a prolonged period. In such a scenario, lawyers want a robust online system for it. The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court has introduced the WebEx system for virtual hearing of cases. The same software is being used in the Supreme Court and in several high courts across the country. “Covid-19 is here to stay for a prolonged period. Working of courts is among the worst affected due to the pandemic. The government will have to equip district courts also with the latest technique for virtual hearing of cases,” said Sunil Dwivedi, president, Central Bar Association, district court, Lucknow. “Like high court, district courts must also have WebEx system for virtual hearing of cases. To start with, the new system must be introduced in some courts. Thereafter, it must be introduced in all court rooms,” Dwivedi added.“As a pilot project, it must be introduced in some district courts starting with Lucknow and some other districts,” he said. The Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh has also suggested the state government to upgrade videoconferencing facility in all district courts. The Bar Council also wants segregation of virtual hearing of cases into lower courts, civil and criminal, so that all cases could be taken up and not only cases related with criminal matters. “Working of district courts is again disrupted. We need a robust system of videoconferencing in several court rooms in district courts so that judicial work does not come to a standstill,” said Prashant Singh, co-president, Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid-rise-in-up-dist-court-lawyers-too-demand-virtual-hearing-of-cases-101642183089631.html

14-01-2022||Lucknow||SGPGIMS restricts non-Covid admissions to 50%||After restricting the entry of OPD patients to the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), the PGI administration has decided to restrict the admission of non-Covid patients to 50% of the beds due to the surge in Coronavirus cases in the state capital.The PGI administration has directed to block admission on 50% beds through its MIS system from January 15.Professor Gaurav Agarwal, chief medical superintendent, PGI, said, “The rate at which Covid-19 is spreading will require manpower to be spared for Covid-19 care. Besides that a number of PGI staff, nurses are also getting infected. They too need a recovery period of at least a week according to ICMR guidelines. So, if we have to increase Covid-19 care then we will have to manage with our limited manpower. That’s why the PGI administration has decided to limit non-Covid-19 admissions to 50% of the bed strength. The manpower spared from non-Covid-19 care will be diverted to Covid-19 care if required.”However, there are some priority areas which will get immediate attention: cancer patients, those on dialysis, high-risk pregnancy patients, haemophilia patients and other blood disorders and cardiac patients. Currently, the PGI has around 950 beds and almost all of them are occupied.Meanwhile, the PGI administration has cancelled elective leaves of residents, officials, staff, nurses and doctors in the wake of the spurt in Coronavirus cases. The PGI administration has directed all heads of departments not to give leave to any staff, while all senior doctors who are on leave will be expected to join duties if they are required for duty.During the last one week around 35 PGI staff have tested positive, forcing the PGI administration to take steps to protect its staff from getting infected.Professor Gaurav Agarwal said, “Thankfully, fewer people are requiring admission in hospitals after getting infected this year but we are ready for an influx of patients. Currently, only 40 patients are admitted in Rajdhani Covid-19 hospital which has a capacity of around 300 beds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sgpgims-restricts-non-covid-admissions-to-50-101642181529410.html
14-01-2022||Pune||Covid cases touch second wave peak, O2 consumption drops by four times in Pune||A comparative analysis of the second and the third Covid wave shows the latter not as intense as the former one. During the peak of the second wave on April 7, 2021 when the district reported 9,621 new cases there were over 96,000 active cases. The district had 66% of active cases isolated at home and reported close to 150 deaths. However, in this wave, as of January 13, 2022, with over 9,600 new cases reported, the number of active cases has gone up to 42,000 of which more than 95% are isolated at home and the district has reported only three deaths due to the infection. As of April 7, 2021, which was the peak period for the second wave in the district, over 1,700 were on ventilator. As of January 13, 2022, when the district reported 9,645 new Covid cases on the day, 69 are on ventilator. While the previous wave was dominated by Delta variant and the sub-lineages of the variant which was the most fatal one, as of date, the third wave is most likely to be dominated by Omicron variant which experts have said would be mild in terms of symptoms, but highly transmissible. With more home test kits at hand, the central government has expressed concern that many cases might go unreported and that only 50% of the samples which have been genome sequenced reported Omicron variants, and the other half could be Delta variant or its sub-lineages. Experts have expressed the fact that many of the unreported Covid cases could be of the Delta variant and could add stress on the health infrastructure. The district administration said that though there is a rise in Covid cases, hospitalisations remain low with most patients reporting mild symptoms. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director of health services, Pune circle said, “It is true that as of now genome sequencing results have shown that half the Covid cases are Omicron while the other half could possibly be Delta. We are aware of the fatal characteristics of the variant of Delta and its sub-lineages. Those getting tested at home and not reporting to authorities could be infected with the Delta variant. In addition to genome sequencing, one thing that is assuring is that the cases which are being admitted do not have severe cases. During the peak of the second Covid wave the hospitalisation rate was about 30% which as of now is just 2.9%. Even though genome sequencing is showing that Omicron is still not dominant, given the severity of symptoms of patients being admitted, we can say that Omicron is dominating.” Dr Deshmukh said that the picture would be much clearer in the next 15 days and if the symptoms continue to remain less severe than it is not a matter of concern. He said, “Although there is a slight increase in oxygen consumption in the last 14 days, it is not noticeable and is only because of the overall increase in admissions.” The district administration along with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has asked the chemist association and the pharmacy owners to ensure that all those who buy the home test kits for Covid should upload results on the respective company sites. Also, pharmacy selling these kits has to note down details on the person, including the Aadhaar number.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-cases-touch-second-wave-peak-o2-consumption-drops-by-four-times-in-pune-101642181409366.html

14-01-2022||Ranchi||Dhanbad judge death: HC junks CBI’s mobile theft theory||The Jharkhand High Court on Friday rejected the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) theory that mobile theft could be a possible motive behind the alleged murder of Dhanbad additional judge Uttam Anand in July last year and directed the agency to submit the findings report of all technical investigation done by it to date in the case. Taking up the weekly investigation progress report in the case in a virtual hearing, the bench of chief justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and justice Sujeet Narayan Prasad dismissed the CBI theory that the two accused have confessed they were trying to snatch the mobile phone of the judge at the time of the fatal accident. The judge was mowed down by an auto-rickshaw while he was on a morning walk in Dhanbad on July 28, 2021. A CCTV footage of the incident showed the vehicle swerving towards the judge on an otherwise empty road and hitting him from behind. The vehicle, which was stolen from Dhanbad, was recovered from neighbouring Giridih district the same night. Two persons, auto driver Lakhan Verma, 22, and his associate Rahul Verma, 21, were arrested two days later.In its first charge sheet, CBI had claimed that the two were the only two occupants of the auto rickshaw that hit the judge, but is yet to establish the motive. “The court said could it be possible that the accused were trying to derail the murder investigation by making such claims,” a lawyer who attended the virtual hearing said. The court also asked for the reason behind CBI’s technical investigation like narco test and brain mapping twice. The probe agency told the court that it was done to establish different set of information they came across during the ongoing investigation. Fixing January 21 as the next date of bearing in the case, the court directed the CBI to submit all test reports by then. The Supreme Court and the Jharkhand high court had taken the suo motu cognisance of the hit-and-run incident.The CBI took over the probe on July 31 after the apex court said the incident had larger ramifications for the independence of the judiciary. The state government had also recommended an investigation by the central agency into the case.The central agency later filed the charge sheet against the duo under sections 302 (murder), 201 (destruction of evidence) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/dhanbad-judge-death-hc-junks-cbi-s-mobile-theft-theory-101642178052535.html

Patna also registered the state’s highest 32% (2,116 cases) of the total 6,541 new infections on Thursday, having the state’s highest positivity rate of 21.03% in the week ending January 13, said Pratyaya Amrit, Bihar’s additional chief secretary, health, during a virtual press conference on Friday. Saharsa had a test positivity rate of 4.80%, followed by Muzaffarpur 4.73% and Jehanabad 4.23%, he said. Muzaffarpur (427 cases) and Gaya (132) were among the other two leading urban districts in terms of the high number of active Covid-19 cases, followed by Saharsa and Munger, which were relatively less urban. “Urban centres like Patna are showing higher transmissibility of the virus than rural areas in Bihar, just like Mumbai in Maharashtra,” said Amrit. “The number of daily new infections has been going up and down in Patna. It reported 2,566 cases on January 10, 2,200 on January 11, 2,017 on January 12, 2,275 on January 13 and 2,116 cases on January 14. It is actually early to predict the trend of the virus. We are, however, keeping a close watch on the trend,” he said. “Only 1% of the active cases have required hospitalisation, while the remaining 99% are under home isolation. This is a pointer to the fact that the effect of the virus has been mild so far. While there is need to be extremely cautious and follow Covid appropriate behavior, there is nothing to fear at this stage,” said Amrit. He said the home isolation tracking (HIT) application for monitoring Covid-19 patients has been made functional again. Explaining the functioning of the HIT app, executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar (SHSB), Sanjay Kumar Singh, said: “The app, which has been installed on the tablets of auxiliary nursing midwives (ANM) and accredited social health activists (ASHA) who will visit people under home isolation, fetches data directly from the Covid-19 portal. The health worker concerned then visits the patient to check for temperature and oxygen saturation level, the readings of which are fed into the app. In case of deterioration in these parameters, an alarm is triggered and the patient is taken to hospital,” said Sanjay Kumar Talking about vaccination against Covid-19, Singh said 99% of the target population of 6.18 crore in the state had taken the first dose while 90% of those eligible for second dose had taken the shots.
14-01-2022||Lucknow||UP commercial tax dept gets high court rap again||LUCKNOW In a case pertaining to wrongful seizure of a trader’s consignment by commercial tax department, the Allahabad high court has passed severe strictures against authorities for harassing traders and also awarded a cost to be recovered from the official concerned, people in the know of things said. Pronouncing its order on January 6 on a writ petition, the court observed that the state government has tried to create an atmosphere for free flow of trade and commerce so that a good business environment could be developed in the state of Uttar Pradesh. “But the state authorities are bent upon harassing the trading community of the state,” Justice Piyush Agrawal said in the order. The court allowed the petition with a cost of Rs. 20,000 payable to the petitioner. “The cost shall be paid within a period of one month from today. The respondents are at liberty to recover the said cost from the erring officer,” the order said. “This is the second instance where the department has got a rap for harassing traders within a period of less than a month,” said a senior commercial tax official. Petitioner, Surya Traders, a registered dealer engaged in the business of selling Uncle (Sweet Supari) and Varanasi Ashik (Betel Nut Product) stated in the petition that in the normal course of business, 90 bags of betel nut product sold to two different registered dealers by issuing two tax invoices, were being transported along with tax invoice and e-way bill to its destination. The said goods were intercepted by commercial tax department officials on 9.10.2019 in Varanasi. On physical verification, three bags of betel nut product were found without tax invoice and a show-cause notice was issued to the petitioner. In reply to the show-cause notice, the petitioner submitted tax invoice issued in the name of M/s Lal Ji Pan Bhandar, Tikona Park, Nawabganj, Gonda. He further submitted that the said tax invoice was handed over to the transporter but he left it behind by mistake. The petitioner submitted that since the value of the goods was less than ₹50,000, the e-way bill was not generated. He argued that as far as the consignment of 87 bags sold to M/s Karuna Nidhan Agency was concerned, it had all requisite papers and the said goods should have not been seized, and if any discrepancy could be attributed it should be with regard to three bags only. Standing counsel Jagdish Prasad Mishra, who represented the department. sought to justify the impugned order with his arguments that the court refused by buy. The court ruled that the authorities were not justified in detaining/seizing goods and demanding security as documents accompanying the goods as well as submitted along with the reply fully covered the transaction in question and by no stretch of imagination it could be attributed any contravention of the provisions of UP GST Act or any other rule. “So far as the consignment of 87 bags are concerned, it was duly accompanied with all proper documents as prescribed under the Act/Rule and the authorities were not justified in seizing and demanding security for release of the same,” the court observed. Last month also the high court order pulled up the department for arbitrarily cancelling a trader’s application seeking registration for his firm. Passing an order in the writ petition Ranjana Singh vs commissioner state tax, the Allahabad high court questioned how the petitioner’s application for registration could be cancelled on the ground that he did not submit a legible copy of electricity bill of his business premise despite his attaching all other documents like copy of his Aadhaar card, PAN card etc. The court not only awarded cost against the official concerned but also directed the department to pass an appropriate order in the matter within a week of the court ruling.

Despite statewide awareness campaign and frequent raids and seizures, liquor flow in the state has continued to embarrass the Nitish Kumar government, most recently the scores of hooch deaths in at least four districts of north Bihar since Diwali last year. According to state police headquarter, 16 premises have been identified in the state where police pickets and police stations would be set up following recovery of liquor there. This includes one godown in Patna, 12 locations in Purnia and three places in Sheikhpura district.In Patna, a part of Bypass police station was recently shifted into a godown, where constables would stay and impounded vehicles would be parked. Earlier, the police station near NH-30, operational since 2007, had just two rooms.Patna’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) M S Dhillon told HT that on January 31, 2021, the state’s excise department recovered liquor worth ₹2 crore, besides seizing a truck and pickup van from the private godown hired on rent for stocking fodder. “The godown is situated barely 500 metres from the police station. Following the seizure, the then station house officer of Bypass police station was suspended for dereliction for duty,” the SSP said. The godown, built over an area of 5760 square feet on private land, was leased for commercial use without following norms. The land is the name of one Dinanath Mahto, whose son Awinash Mahto is accused in the liquor seizure case. The plot, which was confiscated, has a concrete godown and a periphery wall. “The state government ordered the shifting of Bypass police station in the premises following Patna district magistrate’s confiscation order and that has been done,” Dhillon said.On Tuesday, the Sheikhpura police decided to open police outposts in three houses which were earlier sealed by the excise department. Sheikhpura superintendent of police (SP) Kartikye Sharma a proposal has been sent to the government through excise department to hand over the three houses, situated at Budhauli Bazar under Sadar police station, Maldah and Maur villages under Barbigha police station limits, to open police pickets.In Purnia, the district administration has identified 12 locations to open police pickets after seizure of liquor from there. Purnia SP Dayashankar told HT that one of the locations, Lal Godown, falling under Sadar police station area, is already functional as a police picket, which was opened after nod from district administration. Rest are under process, he said.Sources in the police said most of the constables face shortage of space in police barracks and quarters and have to manage in overcrowded police lines, as adequate arrangements were not available for them. The latest action, they said, would help solve their space problems.The Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, the law brought in to ban liquor, empowers any excise official or police official, not below the rank of sub-inspector, to seal any premises on recovery of liquor and send a report to the district magistrate concerned to confiscate the property/building where the offence was committed.Additional director general of police (headquarters) Jitendra Singh Gangwar said setting up police stations at confiscated properties under the anti-liquor law is first of its kind in Bihar.However, Vinod Kanth, senior advocate at the Patna High Court, said the fairness demanded that the state government should have held its hands back since the matter is sub judice before the Supreme Court. “Such decisions will further complicate the issue and lead to more cases in the courts,” he said.Earlier this week, the apex court had lashed out at the Bihar government, saying its prohibition policy had “choked the courts” with cases. At a public function, chief justice of India N V Ramana had criticised the policy for its “lack of foresight”.

The amount has been approved by the board of directors of the PMPML. The ruling BJP’s senior members have raised the issue stating that this decision is not in the interest of PMPML. BJP leaders Ujwal Keskar and Suhas Joshi raised the doubts and it was expected that opposition parties would take up this issue and the target ruling BJP. All of a sudden, the opposition parties is mum on this issue. Nationalist Congress Party city unit president Prashant Jagtap said, “The proposal was pending with the board of director for almost a year. They keep silent on it and before elections, BJP approved it.” Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane said, “The agreements are old during the tenure of Congress and NCP. Though buses are not operational, as per agreements, we are forced to give compensations though the buses were not operational. We did negotiate while approving the funds.” Civic activist Vivek Velankar has criticised the BJP’s decision to pay compensation to the contractor. Velankar said, “The buses were shut but PMPML is paying for it. Same decision was taken at a central level. The toll operators got compensation though there was no traffic on highways. It shows who the government is giving tax payers ‘ money to.” Opposition party leaders decline making statements on the issue. A second rung of leaders, speaking anonymously, said, “Ideally, our leaders need to issue a press statement and oppose this proposal. We are doing agitations on small issues but why we kept mum on this is a question workers too are asking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmpmls-rs91-crore-question-finds-no-takers-amid-civic-opposition-101642177509348.html

However, the SSM — a political front formed by various Punjab farmer bodies that had taken part in the stir against the Centre’s now-repealed agricultural laws — has denied the allegation.Addressing a press conference in Amritsar, Hayer said: “The BJP has been considering AAP convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as the main opposition leader in the country. The BJP has put forth its all efforts to stop the AAP in Punjab. It is the saffron party’s policy not to make direct alliance, but divide votes of opposition parties by making indirect alliances. Hayer said even ahead of the Punjab polls, the BJP has made “indirect alliances” besides direct ones (such as the one with Capt Amarinder Singh-led Punjab Lok Congress)“Today those who are in indirect alliance with the BJP are approaching our honest and old workers to leave the AAP. Our workers are being offered money and tickets for fighting the assembly elections by the SSM,” he alleged.Hayer was accompanied by AAP state joint secretary Jaspreet Singha and others, who were allegedly approached by the Rajewal group.“We respected Rajewal due to his contribution in the farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws. But, now the SSM has started luring AAP volunteers. The SSM has been offering money and other support to leave the AAP and fight the election on SSM tickets. I was offered Amritsar South’s ticket,” alleged Jaspreet Singh.Hayer said the SSM should make it clear that who was providing the money being offered to AAP workers. “These conspiracies are being hatched to divide the votes of AAP, for all people in Punjab know that the SSM can’t win a single seat in the state,” he said.Allegations ‘100% wrong’: SSMReacting to the allegations, SSM screening committee member Kulwant Kanti termed them “100% wrong”. He said the SSM has no money and was strongly against those who spend money to buy support during elections. “We are fielding candidates with honest background. Our first condition is that our candidate must be the one who or his/her family members participated in the farmers’ agitation. We are against all political parties that are pro corporates. Our candidates will fight the elections with the money donated by people in the villages,” said Kanti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-ssm-poaching-aap-workers-at-bjp-s-behest-alleges-meet-hayer-101642174629216.html
14-01-2022||Pune||129 species of birds recorded during research at Mahatma tekdi in Kothrud||A research by avid bird enthusiasts, at the Mahatma tekdi, Kothrud, recorded 129 species of birds in seven years.These birds include black redstart, grey necked bunting, black-headed cuckoo shrike, red-necked, Eurasia collared dove falcon, short-toed snake eagle, Bonelli’s eagle, steppe eagle among others.The research was undertaken by three students from the city, Arnav Gandhe, BE Computer, Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), FY MSc Biodiversity, Garware College; Adwait Dindore, FYBA photography, MIT WPU and Atharva Bapat, SY MSc Biotechnology, MIT WPU.The research was published in Journal Newsletter for Birdwatchers in January 2022. “The study began in 2014 and continued till April 2021,” said Gandhe.“Mahatma Tekdi is an isolated hill in Kothrud, being a lesser-known hill in terms of biodiversity, it has a rich habitat with beautiful grasslands, scrubs vegetation, woodlands and water bodies,” he said.“We chose Mahatma tekdi, also known as Kothrud hill or Warje hill because it is rich in biodiversity and few people know about it. Thus, revealing its biological importance as a fine urban forest was necessary,” he added.Most of the initial fieldwork was carried out by the students between 6 am to 8 am, six to seven days a week for two hours.The tekdi has simple topography, it proved quite hard to spot its avian diversity as their population and frequency of sighting kept on changing. Many rare winter migrant species have been recorded by the students and felt that the birds preferred this tekdi as it was landlocked and isolated from any other larger hill complex. The tekdi also became an example of how such a restricted ecosystem can support a fine amount of biodiversity which still survives here, proving to be an efficient urban forest within itself.Bapat said, “The habitat degradation was our prime concern. Unfortunately, today not all the species are observed that regularly spotted, observed over the hill till 2017 and many species distribution patterns have changed over the hill.”But in the last couple of years, Mahatma tekdi and its avian diversity is facing a serious threat. “This is due to high anthropogenic stresses in form of daily dumping of debris and garbage and landfilling, increased human activity, and constructions. Thus, the study would help in highlighting and revealing the lesser-known hill of Pune and its biological importance. This would help to awaken and reduce the anthropogenic stress over the hill, finally resulting in conservation of the hill in future, said Dindore.“The collective efforts would help in conserving all the hills of Pune with the addition of one more hill to the list, conserving the last surviving urban forests, the last abode of the city’s rich wildlife,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/129-species-of-birds-recorded-during-research-at-mahatma-tekdi-in-kothrud-101642173968878.html
14-01-2022||Lucknow||Former ministers Swami Prasad Maurya, Saini, six MLAs join Samajwadi Party||Former ministers Swami Prasad Maurya and Dharam Singh Saini, five other BJP MLAs and one lawmaker of the ruling party’s ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) formally joined the Samajwadi Party (SP) in Lucknow on Friday after over three days of high-voltage political drama in the poll-bound Uttar Pradesh.All the eight led by Swami Prasad Maurya are OBC leaders. However, there was no “bombshell”, contrary to the indication given by Swami Prasad Maurya in the days leading up to the joining. Maurya had quit the Uttar Pradesh council of ministers on January 11 and Saini on January 13.Besides Swami Prasad Maurya and Saini, the others who joined the Samajwadi Party on Friday are BJP MLAs Roshan Lal Verma, Bhagwati Sagar, Brijesh Prajapati, Vinay Shakya, Mukesh Verma and BJP ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) MLA Chaudhary Amar Singh.At a virtual rally-cum-press conference, both Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Swami Prasad Maurya vowed to have the BJP voted out of power in the assembly election.Swami Prasad Maurya launched a scathing attack on the BJP while Akhilesh took swipes at chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his government.Swami Prasad Maurya also claimed that he was the chief minister candidate, along with the BJP’s OBC leader Keshav Prasad Maurya (currently deputy chief minister) in 2017.“So what was the speculation in 2017 when the BJP won? That Swami Prasad Maurya or Keshav Prasad Maurya will be the chief minister...but what happened eventually? A skylab from Gorakhpur (Yogi Adityanath) was dropped into the CM’s chair. Backwards were ignored even though BJP grabbed power riding on backwards and Dalits,” Swami Prasad Maurya said.He called the day a “confluence of Samajwaadis (socialists) and Ambedkarvaadis (Ambedkarites) and today we have scripted the beginning of the end of the BJP. “The BJP top leadership, who were sleeping like Kumbhakaran, are now sleepless because of what we did,” Swami Prasad Maurya said.Swami Prasad Maurya also said: “The top leadership of the BJP changed three chief ministers in the neighbouring Uttarakhand, but so much crime, atrocities and injustice happened in Uttar Pradesh, they did not do anything.”Describing himself as a power centre, he said: “I may not have had floated any party, but I am no less than a party. The one to whom I go forms the government. Till I was with Mayawati ji, she had been forming the government again and again, and now she is nowhere. And now the SP will form the government and Akhilesh ji will be the chief minister.”Swami Prasad Maurya charged the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) with digressing from the original Dalit and Bahujan Samaj agenda, the path of BSP founder Kanshiram, and joining hands with moneybags instead.About the BJP, he said that he thought that after returning to power in the state after 14 years, it may have mended its ways.“But now, to the BJP, Dalits and backwards are still untouchables, animals,” he remarked.“The storm, tsunami, that has risen will sink the BJP in the Indian Ocean,” Swami Prasad Maurya said.Invoking Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav, Swami Prasad Maurya said: “Now all of us will use charkha daon (a wrestling move) on BJP and no counter daon by BJP can prevent it from falling flat.”After Swami Prasad Maurya, Akhilesh spoke and referred to cricket to attack the BJP.“All those who had been watching the developments over the last few days saw how the BJP wickets were falling one after the other. Our baba mukhya mantri (Yogi Adityanath) doesn’t know cricket. And now he has dropped the catch...BJP is out hit-wicket...The BJP’s annihilation is final,” the SP chief said.Further attacking the CM, Akhilesh Yadav said: “While one of our leaders had booked an air ticket for baba mukhya mantri to Gorakhpur for March 11, he went to Gorakhpur today itself because of what is happening here.”Yogi Adityanath was in Gorakhpur on Friday on the occasion of Makar Sankranti and had “khichdi bhoj” at a Dalit party worker’s home there.Last Saturday (January 8), Samajwadi Party leader IP Singh had booked an air ticket for Yogi Adityanth to Gorakhpur from Lucknow for March 11, the day after the UP polls result on March 10.Akhilesh said he agreed with Swami Prasad Maurya’s statement whoever Maurya goes with, forms the government in UP.Both Swami Prasad Maurya and Akhilesh Yadav attacked chief minister Yogi Adityanath over his recent comment that “the fight will be 80% vs 20% in the UP elections”.Swami Prasad Maurya retorted: “Now, it will not be 80% vs 20%, but 85% vs 15%. Even in the 15%, we will have a share”.He is understood to have referred to 85% (backwards, Dalits, Muslims, and others) and 15% upper caste Hindus.When Yogi Adityanath had said at a TV conclave last Saturday that the fight in the UP elections will be “80% vs 20%”, the observers deduced that he had meant 80% Hindus (all castes) and 20% Muslims.He charged Yogi and BJP with “not considering Dalits and backwards as Hindus”.“The BJP projected itself as a great hamdard (syphathiser) of Hindus. Are backwards and Dalits not Hindus, Yogiji? Now, the BJP will be back to its 40-50 seats days. I vow that,” he said.For his part, Akhilesh Yadav said: “This baba mukhya mantri needs to hire a mathematics tutor. He doesn’t know mathematics as he talks about 80% vs 20% or three-fourths. When he says three-fourths, I say that it means only three or four seats (of the total 403 seats in UP assembly) that the BJP will get. Till now we had the support of 80% of the population. After what has happened in the last few days even that remaining 20% is now with us...Now, the bicycle’s handle (leadership) is fine and so are the two wheels. The bicycle will run to victory with Samajwadis and Ambedkarvaadis together”.Bicycle is the election symbol of the Samajwadi Party.Commenting on BJP and a few others asking why Swami Prasad Maurya did not quit in the last five years, the former minister said, “Arey bhai, the mandate was for five years, that’s why I quit now, after completing the term.”Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh minister and BJP leader Anil Rajbhar said the mass base of the leaders, who quit the BJP recently, had already dwindled.“ The leaders who have left the BJP recently had their own base dwindling, while the BJP’s mass base is steadily increasing due to the welfare works of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath. There was also resentment towards the leaders who quit due to their constant absence in their areas. The party had already made a strategy (to deal with the resentment due to these leaders). Even the leaders who quit, knew this,” Rajbhar said in a statement.On the other hand, fFormer minister Dara Singh Chauhan and two other BJP MLAs, Radha Krishna Sharma and Bala Prasad Awasthi (both Brahmins), who were among the 11 BJP lawmakers to have resigned since January 8, were conspicuous by their absence at Friday’s joining event at the Samajwadi Party (SP).Chauhan, Sharma and Awasthi did not reach the SP office on Friday.“They will join with more BJP deserters on January 16 (Sunday),” said a senior SP leader trying to defuse fresh speculation that those who did not join on Friday were rethinking their decision.Uttar Pradesh saw a total of 12 MLAs, including three Yogi ministers, quitting their parties since the announcement of the poll schedule on January 8. Eleven of them were from the BJP and one from the ally Apna Dal (S). One of these BJP MLAs Avtar Singh Bhadana has already joined the SP ally Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) on Wednesday. He has been fielded as the RLD’s Jewar candidate. Three other BJP MLAs (Rakesh Rathore, Digvijay Narayan Chaubey and Madhuri Verma) had quit before the announcement of the poll schedule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/former-ministers-swami-prasad-maurya-saini-six-mlas-join-samajwadi-party-101642173789097.html

14-01-2022||Lucknow||ECI to review Covid situation in UP for decision on rally ban||LUCKNOW The Election Commission of India (ECI) will review the Covid situation in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh on Saturday to take a decision over the ban imposed on physical rallies, road shows and padyatras in view of the surge in cases. The filing of nominations for the first phase of Assembly elections commenced in 11 districts of west UP on Friday amid strict Covid guidelines issued by the poll panel. Polling will be held on February 10 for 58 assembly constituencies in 11 districts including Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Hapur, Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida), Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Mathura and Agra.Data released by the UP health and family welfare department shows that a chunk of UP’s 16,016 fresh cases – 6,578 — were reported in these 11 districts going to polls in the first phase. These districts also account for nearly 50% of the active Covid cases (38,648), making the task of permitting political parties to hold rallies, roadshows and padyatras challenging for the poll panel. With the 16,016 fresh Covid-19 cases across the state in the last 24 hours, the tally of active cases has gone up to 84,440. The state is also witnessing increase in the death tally. Since January 1, the state reported 34 deaths, majority of which have been reported in west UP districts and state capital Lucknow. The recovery rate, which was 98% in December, declined to 94% on Friday. After the slowdown of the second Covid wave in June, the fatality count had also declined. No death was reported in December, said a health department officer. Acknowledging that the Covid situation in poll-bound states is dynamic and not static, poll preparations have been made to hold a Covid-safe election, said chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra while announcing the Assembly election poll schedule in New Delhi on January 8. Uttar Pradesh chief electoral officer Ajay Kumar Shukla said in view of the directions issued by ECI a ban has been imposed on physical rallies, road shows, padyatras, street corner meetings across UP till January 15. Political parties have been urged to hold virtual and digital campaigning on various social media platforms. The ECI’s guidelines have been sent to all the district magistrates and they have been asked to ensure that there is no violation of the poll panel order. DMs will be held responsible for the violation of Covid guidelines issued by the ECI, he added. Meanwhile, UP has ramped up Covid vaccination by administering 22.32 crore doses. While 13.54 crore eligible people above 18 years have received the first dose, 8.31 crore have been given the both doses. The 33.55 lakh teenagers in age group of 15-18 years have been given the first dose. Strict measures have implemented in districts having an active Covid tally of 1,000, he said. “People in cities like Meerut, Noida, Ghaziabad, Aligarh and Agra frequently move out to other places. Crowd movement has resulted in spurt of Covid cases. The administration in cities where Covid cases are rising should ensure all public activity including private gatherings are stopped immediately,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president, Indian Medical Association, Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/eci-to-review-covid-situation-in-up-for-decision-on-rally-ban-101642173189141.html
14-01-2022||Mumbai||B Tech course seat vacancy below 40% for first time in six years||MUMBAI With admissions to undergraduate (UG) professional courses including engineering (BE/B Tech) and pharmacy (B Pharm) having concluded recently, figures shared by the state common entrance test (CET) cell reveal that seat vacancy across both courses has dipped this year as compared to last year.For the first time in over six years, seat vacancy in B Tech institutes in Maharashtra has dropped almost 10% points to below 40%—while the seat vacancy stood at 45.6% and 48% in the academic years 2020-21 and 2019-20, respectively, this year, the seat vacancy for the course stands at 36.6%.The sudden surge in demand for engineering courses is due to the sudden demand for fresh information technology engineering graduates in the placement season this year, said experts. “IT related graduate programmes are in high demand and most engineering colleges in urban areas haven’t got a single vacant seat in these departments. In the last two years, there’s been a sudden demand for fresh IT graduates and this has attracted more students to the course this year,” said Gopakumaran Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra.He added that while courses such as mechanical and civil engineering are still facing seat vacancy, most other courses including computer science, IT, artificial intelligence (AI) and data science have attracted maximum applications this year.CET cell figures have also revealed how nearly 11.4% seats in B Pharm were vacant in the academic year 2020-21 while the seat vacancy stands at 8.8% this year. Experts have attributed this sudden surge in demand for undergraduate engineering and pharmacy courses to the delay in carrying out UG medical and dental admissions in the state this year.“Not only was the overall admissions’ process delayed but simple registrations for students and the announcement of the state merit list were delayed in Maharashtra by four months. In the meantime, several students opted for admissions in neighbouring states where the process began in November itself and several students with low scores in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) opted for admissions in other courses including engineering and pharmacy to avoid further delay,” said Sudha Shenoy, activist fighting for medical aspirants’ rights.Hindustan Times had recently reported how pre-admission registrations for undergraduate health science courses including MBBS and BDS witnessed a drop by a few thousand applications this year. Figures shared by the CET cell, the admission conducting authority, revealed that only 55,674 candidates completed the process by uploading the necessary documents and paying fees by January 5 which was the deadline. This is nearly 9,000 applications lower than the 64,645 registrations completed in the previous academic year.Looking at the dip in registrations, the state CET cell extended the deadline for completion of registration for health science courses and nearly 2,000 new candidates have registered since January 6 and this process will go on till January 17.
14-01-2022||Mumbai||3rd Covid wave has affected people in 21-40 years age group the most: Navi Mumbai civic body data||The third wave in Navi Mumbai has affected the crowd in the age group of 21-40 years the most since the end of December, as per the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) data.This is probably because of the year-end holiday season.The wave has also defied the prediction that the highest affected would be the children. When the pandemic started in March 2020, the maximum affected were in the age group of 45-65 years.NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, added that the number of infections in the age group above 50 years is not more than 30% while those below 18 makes 10% of the total active cases.Bangar said, “During the second wave, the most affected group was younger than the first wave. The age group of 35-45 years was the one affected during the second wave while during the third wave now; it is younger than the previous. Though paediatric cases are reported, it is not like what was feared.”This week reported the highest number of average Covid cases ever since the pandemic broke out with an average of 2,108 per day cases. Last week, the average cases were 443 per day. The average daily testing done was 12,780 last week while it is 11,991 this week and the doubling days have come down to 44. Meanwhile, the deaths reported in this period of the third wave were just five, which is 0.02% of the total cases.“The call centre is now divided into three categories. One part is dedicated to making calls to the positive patients for counselling them after their reports are out. Second one is dedicated to making calls to the active patients to know about their well-being. The third one is dedicated to making calls to the vaccination beneficiaries whose second dose is pending. A total of around 7,000 calls are made daily by the call centre,” Bangar added.Dr Farah Ingale, Director - Internal Medicine, Fortis Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi, said, “During the first wave, we saw that patients in the age group of 40-60 years were infected as they were at higher risk because of the existing comorbidities. Most of them were vaccinated by the second wave, so the middle-age group that was not vaccinated was infected. In the current situation, the younger population have taken to socialising, outings, etc. They work at places like hospitals, in the hospitality sector, transportation sector, where they are exposed. So, they catch infection and transmit it too. Again Covid-appropriate behaviour has gone for a toss and since their exposure to the virus exponentially increased outdoors, more cases of infection in this age group are being witnessed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3rd-covid-wave-has-affected-people-in-21-40-years-age-group-the-most-navi-mumbai-civic-body-data-101642171812400.html
14-01-2022||Lucknow||Prayagraj: Magh Mela begins in Covid shadow||The 47-day religious congregation Magh Mela-2022 began in the shadow of Covid-19 with the first official bathing of Makar Sankranti at the Sangam ghats in Prayagraj on Friday. Over 6.5 lakh pilgrims took the holy dip by 7pm, Mela officials said. The Magh Mela is an annual religious event unique to Prayagraj.Devotees, who had started arriving in large numbers from Thursday onwards, continued to come all through the day, defying the winter chill and overcoming the fear of Covid-19 on Friday also.Tight security measures were put in place to ensuring smooth conduct of the bathing. “The bathing took place smoothly with no untoward incident being reported during the day,” said Magh Mela adhikari (officer) Sheshmani Pandey.In view of the rush of devotees, traffic diversions were put in place at all the entry points of Prayagraj district.Despite efforts and repeated appeals to the pilgrims to observe social distancing and wear facemasks to prevent the spread of Covid-19, most visitors were seen violating the set norms. However, the less than expected rush of pilgrims this time around eased the situation somewhat as the usual scene of pilgrims taking the dip shoulder-to-shoulder at the bathing ghats was not commonly visible. All through the day, the ghats remained abuzz with pilgrims taking the dip and performing various rituals. On Makar Sankranti, the sun transits into Capricorn marking the beginning of its northward journey (uttarayan) ushering in the auspicious period for Hindus, according to the faithful. Makar Sankranti bathing is the second most important snan during Magh Mela after Mauni Amavasya which falls on February 1 this year. The Magh Mela will end with Maha Shivratri snan (bathing) on March 1.At the camps, the saints performed special rituals to celebrate Makar Sankranti. However, this time, announcements for following Covid-19 protocols dominated the sounds of bhajan and kirtans (religious songs). At the dozen entry points, pilgrims were allowed in only after thermal scanning. As many as 65,000 free facemasks were also distributed among the pilgrims.Prayagraj divisional commissioner Sanjay Goyal, district Magistrate Sanjay Kumar Khatri and senior superintendent of police Ajay Kumar were seen personally issuing appeals to pilgrims to vacate ghats immediately after taking the dip to prevent crowding and wear facemasks.As per the mela officials 1.5 lakh people had taken the dip till 10.30am. By 3pm, the count of pilgrims rose further, reaching around three lakh by 1pm. By 4.30pm, over 5.5 lakh pilgrims and by 7pm over 6.5 lakh had taken the holy dip, the Mela officials said.The auspicious timing (muhurat) for the bathing commenced on Friday evening though people started taking the dip from sunrise as traditionally Makar Sankranti is observed on January 14, according to astrologers. “The mahurat for the dip starts at 8.34pm on Friday. However, the best time for the dip and performing rituals would be from sunrise till 12.34pm on Saturday,” said Pt Diwakar Tripathi Purvanchali, director of Utthan Jyotish Sansthan, Prayagraj. Owing to this, the pilgrims are expected to take the dip till late in to the night and all through the first half of the day on Saturday, he added.Thousands of devotees and pilgrims braved the chill to take a holy dip in the Sangam even before daybreak. But with the sun rising, its warmth brought relief to pilgrims and the rush increased at the bathing ghats. Hundreds of pilgrims from Deoria, Ballia, Jaunpur, Sitapur, Ayodhya and other districts sang devotional songs to the accompaniment of musical instruments like harmonium, cymbals, chimtas in the camps after midnight.The first bathing of Magh Mela-2022 also marked commencement of the month-long Kalpwas in the mela area for Dandi Swamis and those coming from Mithila region as per tradition. Nearly 20,000 Kalpwasis began their month-long rigorous schedule of meditation and attending religious discourses. The remaining Kalpwasis will begin their kalpwas from Paush Purnima on January 19. Besides Uttar Pradesh, devotees from other states, including Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Chhattisgarh, are camping in the Magh Mela area for the month-long religious practice.

It may be because of the low testing. On Wednesday, the state has reported around 46,000 new COVID-19 cases. So, there is no indication of flattening of the curve in Maharashtra,” he said.Further, he also said that there was a vaccine shortage in the state due to the inoculation of precautionary third doses and the inclusion of those between 15 and 17 years of age in the vaccination drive. However, on Friday, the Union health ministry denied any crunch in the doses available with the state and said that the unutilised doses of Covishield would sustain for 30 more days and Covaxin for 10 days, considering the state’s daily average consumption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-in-mumbai-daily-tally-active-caseload-dip-for-3rd-straight-day-city-sees-11-317-new-cases-in-24-hrs-101642170066560.html

The complainant told the police that she had been approached by the accused who claimed to be a senior office bearer with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), on a matrimonial website.The accused allegedly took ₹14.36 lakh from her under various pretexts, promising to return it at the earliest. However, when he asked for a further ₹25 lakh, the complainant smelled a rat and registered an FIR.The Property Cell, while conducting parallel inquiries into the case, found that the accused went by many names including Aditya Mhatre, Navhush Mhatre and Tanmay Mhatre.“The accused was constantly changing his location and we used technical investigation methods to obtain leads about his whereabouts. We finally got a breakthrough when we learnt that the accused was going to be in Navi Mumbai to meet another girl that he had befriended through a matrimonial website,” Additional Commissioner of Police, Ashok Morale, Thane Crime Branch, said.A team of personnel with the Property Cell subsequently laid a trap and intercepted the accused, whose real name has been found to be Aditya Mhatre (29), on Thursday.“According to inquiries so far, the accused is married and has a son. He would regularly pose as a senior official with organisations like the ISRO or the USA-based National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and cheat women of their money. Till date, he has targetted at least 15 women in Maharashtra as well as in other states,” Morale said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/serial-fraudster-arrested-in-thane-for-cheating-women-through-matrimonial-websites-101642170249109.html

14-01-2022||Mumbai||CM Thackeray asks forest secretary to look into complaint against Kharghar mangrove destruction||Swiftly acting on green groups’ complaint against “massive” mangrove destruction and land grab in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has asked the forest secretary to look into the issue.NatConnect Foundation and Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan have complained to the CM about the destruction in progress along at least a 2km stretch of the creek in Kharghar. “We received a prompt response within 12 hours and it is not an automated or computer-generated one,” said NatConnect Foundation director, BN Kumar. The CMO marked it specifically to Forest Secretary, B Venugopal Reddy, Kumar said.The complaint said the landfill done on mangroves is being levelled with no checks whatsoever on the illegal shrimp farms springing up in some places, which interferes with the tidal flow.“Our concern is that the townships of Kharghar, Kalamboli and Kamote will be affected if the mangroves are allowed to be destroyed in this manner. We request the government to find out the number of fishing community people affected by the urban development and resettle them under Blue Economy and mangrove-based economy schemes,” Kumar said.Vast stretches are being landfilled and levelled with the help of JCB machines and this is impacting the biodiversity of the area, said Jyoti Nadkarni, another Kharghar activist.Denying any lethargy, CIDCO PRO, Priya Ratambe, said, “We have reiterated our commitment to preserving the environment through our actions of keeping 40% area for green cover. There is no question of any delay as CIDCO is the only government organisation and public sector undertaking to hand over 2,000 hectares of land to the forest department. We will hand over the remaining too as asked by the ministry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cm-thackeray-asks-forest-secretary-to-look-into-complaint-against-kharghar-mangrove-destruction-101642167968723.html
14-01-2022||Mumbai||Dog sterilisation programme in Thane at a standstill since Aug 2018||For nearly three-and-a-half years now, the stray dog sterilisation programme conducted by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has stopped.The last sterilisation was done in August 2018. Since then, animal lovers in the city have to bear the sterilisation cost of the dogs they take care of.However, dog lovers claim that getting the dogs sterilised at private centres was very costly with each sterilisation costing ₹6,000 to ₹7,000. Besides, they also have to bear the expense of vaccination, dog feeds and any injury or sickness, which is not affordable for any middle class dog lover.Experts claim that the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme has halted not only in Thane but also most of MMR as many corporations have stopped funding it. This has led to an increase in dog population, leading to cases of cruelty towards strays. The TMC officials claimed that the tenure of the NGO that did sterilisation till 2018 ended, after which it was not extended due to lack of funds and Covid. The work order will now be issued and the tenders will be finalised in the coming weeks.As per the TMC data, between March 2020 and November 2021, there have been 11,346 cases of dog bites reported. Recently, there was a case of one dog having bitten at least 34 people in the Wagle Estate area.Since the onset of the sterilisation programme in 2004, the corporation had sterilised 58,537 dogs, spending ₹8Cr.A COSTLY AFFAIRShubhra Rawlins, a dog lover from Ghodbunder, said, “The sterilisation programme of TMC stopped in 2018. We feeders get the dogs in our areas sterilised. However, it is very expensive as I spent ₹6,000 to ₹7,000 on each dog. Along with the operation, we also need to keep the dog in shelters for a week for it to heal. This also involves transporting the dogs to shelter homes. At times, the cost is as high as ₹10,000 per dog. Apart from this, we also get the dogs vaccinated and spend on dog food. The vaccination for each dog is ₹400. If we take care of 10 dogs in the area, it is not possible to spend so much money. There are feeders and dog lovers from slums and middle-class families for whom these expenses are not possible.”Rawlins added that the corporation had a well-set programme earlier that was better compared to other MMR cities. However, since its closure, the population of stray dogs has increased. “This has also given rise to cruelty in animals. The dog that I adopted had given birth to puppies just before she came to us. All the puppies were burnt. Such incidents could be avoided with effective birth control programmes,” she said.Priyanka Dabholkar, founder of Animal Welfare Foundation, added, “It is not just the birth control programmes. For almost a year, the animal hospital in Wagle Estate was shut and the vaccination programme too has stopped. We used to admit dogs there in case of maggots or sickness and injuries. Now, we have to take them to private hospitals and pay additional for the treatment too.”The NGO has written several letters to the TMC to restart the programme. However, there is no progress.ABC PROGRAMME ESSENTIALVidya Heble, another dog lover from Saket Complex, added, “The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) carries out a sterilisation programme in Mumbai. However, the TMC has stopped its own. So, we have to take dogs to Mulund or Deonar. This also involves transport and other logistics. The anti-rabies vaccine too has stopped, leading to an increase in rabies cases. This is another issue that needs to be addressed.”Dog lover Bharti Redkar added that the ABC programme is essential as puppies are left dying on the road, which is cruelty in itself.Shakuntala Majumdar, president of former Thane Society for Protection and Care of Animal, SPCA (soon to be renamed as Community for Protection and Care of Animal, CPCA), said, “Not only Thane, the sterilisation programmes was also suspended by many other corporations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region since the pandemic set in. The funds for ABC were transferred for Covid. Recently, when we had some hope of getting funding, the third wave set in.”This stalling of animal control has led to an exponential increase in stray population. “People have also started feeding stray dogs aggressively as most of them were home and had time on hand. This has led to massive proliferation of the dog population. The second issue is that there is no control or monitoring of the ABC programme by the State as there is no animal welfare board. The earlier board has dissolved. Due to zero monitoring, most NGOs have underpaid or not paid the basic charges for sterilisation.”Talking about the high cost of sterilisation at private centres, Majumdar added, “Apart from sterilisation, the dogs also need to be kept in the hospital for six to seven days for post-operative care, thus the high cost.” ₹1.40CR BUDGET ALLOCATEDDr. Kshama Shirodkar, veterinary officer, TMC, said, “It is true that the programme came to a halt in 2018. However, we are now issuing a work order for the same in the coming weeks. The tender will be finalised and the work will also begin as we have been allotted a budget of ₹1.40Cr.”A source from TMC claimed that the work was stalled due to lack of funding. He said, “We have still not cleared the bills of the NGO that helped with sterilisation and vaccination programmes. Thus, they are not ready to work with us. Moreover, the process was finalised in 2019. However, the then head of the department retired and since then there has been several changes in the health officer’s post. Once the pandemic set in, we were not given any funding for animal welfare. Last year, we got merely ₹20 lakh and thus had to close down even the treatment centre.”

Of the 64,938 students, 63,556 (98%) got their first jab from the NMMC-run vaccination camps and 1,373 (2%) got it from the private hospitals. The remaining nine have got from private centres.“The response that we are receiving for the vaccination among the 15-18 years age-group is very good. Within 10 days, we have vaccinated 90% of them. Since Covaxin is vaccinated to them, the second dose will start after 28 days. So, in the next 18 days, we would be starting with our preparation to jab them with the second dose,” Dr Sanjay Kakade, additional municipal commissioner, NMMC, said.Even with the schools being shut, the response received for the vaccine at schools is good. “Even with the increase in Covid cases, the fatality and severity of the cases are very low, which is proof that the vaccine has been effective. Hence, most of the parents opted to get their children jabbed without hesitation. The centres being the schools, it was most convenient to visit without any problem,” a NMMC health officer said.Meanwhile, 971 above the age of 60 years have taken their booster dose till now.

14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: SAD urges EC to review ban on public meetings||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday urged the Election Commission to reconsider the ban on street corner (nukkad) meetings to campaign for the February 14 Punjab assembly elections. Also read: Punjab elections: Former minister Joginder Singh Mann quits CongressSAD senior vice-president Daljit Singh Cheema said that political parties should be allowed to hold small gatherings and reach out to voters, while ensuring the Covid-19 protocol is followed. On January 8, while declaring the poll schedule in the five states, including Punjab, the EC banned rallies and public meetings till January 15 amid the rise in Covid-19 cases. The SAD and other political parties fear the ban may be extended. “This is causing inconvenience to candidates of all parties. It is not possible to cover all voters through the digital mode,” Cheema wrote to the EC, adding that there are backward areas in the state where internet connectivity is an issue. According to him, the marginalised section of society has limited access to technology and restricting the campaign to the digital mode was denying voters an equal opportunity. “This will also affect the poll percentage,” Cheema said. He, however, agreed that big rallies ought to be banned but smaller meetings should be allowed. He alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party, which is contesting the elections in Punjab and has a government in Delhi, was misusing funds to further its political interests. “They (AAP) are daily showing multiple development stories in the form of paid news on various TV channels of the state to influence voters. Since there is no code of conduct in Delhi, the AAP is exploiting the loophole and spending crores on paid news advertisements at the expense of the Delhi state exchequer, putting other parties at a disadvantage,” Cheema said. Meanwhile, in order to reach out to people, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal met all 93 candidates of the party nominated so far and asked them to reach out to voters by digital means. The party president has himself launched digital campaigns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-elections-sad-urges-ec-to-review-ban-on-public-meetings-101642162147890.html

14-01-2022||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Does life’s ‘best before’ option get any better?||Have you ever felt that you just don’t have enough time? Enough time to do the things you have to do on a day-to-day basis? Have you ever felt that life is just one long schedule that leaves you with very little space to stop and breathe once in a while? That it’s all just about to fall apart? Well, in case you have felt that way, this one is for you. Some time ago, I met this guy and he asked me: “Do you ever feel that you always need to depend on someone else?” Well, I just looked at him and waited. “Like you never have any answers and you always need to have a friend or family member or someone - anyone - around to help you through the day?” I continued to look at him. This was shaping up like one of those deep, really deep, moments when I was required to say something profound; but my mind was blank. “I feel like that very often,” he said finally with a long sigh. That kind of woke me up. Heck, I feel that all the time. So, I told him: “Actually, I have that kind of a day almost every day.” “Really? What do you do then?” “I am not too sure. I think I try to get by not thinking about it too much.” “How’s that possible? It affects my work, my interactions… everything.” “That’s why I try not to think about it.” “Does it get any better?” I thought about that one carefully. I know a lot of people who seem to breeze through life with very little tension or doubts. I am not one of those people. And whenever I feel that I am on top of things, and that life is smooth, something comes along and I am back to square one. “It does get better, but that’s because you remember that you have been through this before and that you came out of it.” “Like how? Will I always have to depend on others for answers?” “I don’t know.” I didn’t want to think this conversation through. I had too much work and I wasn’t sure how I was going to make it through the day. But that’s precisely what he was asking: Will it be better tomorrow? “I suppose it depends on why you are going to others in the first place.” “Meaning what?” “Meaning, if you are hoping others will make your decision for you then you will keep looking for answers from others. On the other hand, if you are looking only for a different perspective, then you will eventually stop depending on others in crisis situations.” “Hmmm.” That conversation ended on that note; but it continued in my head in a different vein. Frankly, I go through life in waves – there are these ups and then there are these downs. Most often, the downs are longer – very much against wave theory. Or so it seems to me. The pressure at work and on the personal front builds up and builds up and builds up till I start thinking about what I really wanted to do with my life, whether I really want to be in this place right now, whether late nights and early mornings are worth it and so on. Usually, such thoughts occur when the pressure is really high and you are stretched way beyond your limits. And that’s more or less the kind of work life most people I know have these days. The week is one long night and then there is the weekend when we want to party and unwind or sleep it off. And then it’s Monday again. This kind of a lifestyle does not give us much time to think about how to nurture relationships, how to find time for friends and family and for our personal needs. Everything but work goes on the back burner till things come to a head. And when things come to a head, work is still a pressure cooker, so that’s when you start thinking: Does this get any better? What am I doing here? Why can’t people understand the pressures I work under? When will I ever get to a stage when I can just do the things I want to? When will I get a job where I do what I love most? I remember a commercial on television for an SUV which was built around the same concept. I think the ad went something like: I always wanted to quit on Monday morning. I always wanted to swim with the whales. I always wanted to do something or the other…. and then it goes on to say: Reclaim your life. Now that ad touches a chord with me. It touches a chord because it reflects a reality of the urban lifestyle. The world that we live in is increasingly driven by schedules and deadlines. We are living in a service-oriented society, and that means service-on-demand 24/7. And this is a lifestyle that is here to stay for a long time to come. So, does it get better? Yep, it does. But I have to choose not to run the race, any race. I have to choose when to let work and personal life merge, and when to separate work life from personal life. One has to choose to make time for oneself and loved ones. And I have to stop being afraid that the world will pass me by while I am taking a day off or switching off early. Most importantly, it must be my choice, not pressure from family, work or society. I guess what I am saying is that sometimes we have to think about the big things our own selves. Else we may end having a virus do it for us.

14-01-2022||Dehradun||As Covid-19 cases surge, Ganga ghats wear deserted look on Makar Sankranti||Major ghats of the River Ganga in Haridwar and Rishikesh wore a deserted look on the occasion of Makar Sankranti on Friday with a ban on ritual bathing in the river owing to a surge in Covid-19 cases.Har ki Pairi Ghat in Haridwar and Triveni Ghat in Rishikesh, which generally receive lakhs of devotees from Uttarakhand and the neighbouring states on the auspicious occasion, were completely sealed even as police personnel stood guard to ensure that the ban was effective.  Patrolling and checking along Haridwar's borders were intensified so that people unaware of the ban did not enter the Har ki Pairi area for a bath, a police official in Haridwar said.People proceeding for a holy dip in the Ganga due to lack of information about the ban were convinced and made to return from the borders, he said. Haridwar District Magistrate Vinay Shankar Pandey and his Dehradun counterpart R Rajesh Kumar had announced a ban on ritual bathing in River Ganga on Makar Sankranti a few days ago to check the spread of the virus.Though some crowd was seen on Subhash Ghat, a short distance away from Har ki Pairi, Superintendent of Police (City) Swatantra Kumar said they had arrived for immersing ashes of their deceased kin as the ghat is reserved for the purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/as-covid-19-cases-surge-ganga-ghats-wear-deserted-look-on-makar-sankranti-101642159891439.html
14-01-2022||Mumbai||State Backward Class Commission aims to complete survey in April||Mumbai: In a move to restore political reservation for Other Backward Class (OBC) candidates in local body elections, the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (MSBCC) has launched the process to collect empirical data to map caste and socio-economic status of all residents of Maharashtra. It is expected to be completed by the end of April contingent on the Covid-19 pandemic.Members of the Commission met on Thursday, and finalized the questionnaire that would be used to collect relevant information. Though empirical data collection norms were drawn up last year, they were fine-tuned after consulting experts. The format of the survey will be decided after similar consultations, and the Commission is expected to issue the order to launch the exercise in the coming days.The last caste census was carried out in 1931 in British-ruled India. The survey, which will be called the Socio-Economic Caste and Political Research-2022 will aim to provide a scientific enumeration of castes, which may cause a quantum shift in Maharashtra’s politics driven largely by caste and community affiliations.On December 22, as part of the supplementary demands presented in its winter session, the state laid down a ₹435-crore outlay for the MSBCC to conduct the survey that has been mandated by the top court of the country. “We have finalized the draft questionnaire for the survey,” said Govind Kale, a member of the 10-member Commission. Kale said that the survey will include information on family members who have contested and won elections (local body included) to assess the political status and backwardness of the community. The castes and categories (like Open, OBC etc) will also be recorded, as will the educational and employment status.“We will map the proportion of OBCs in the population,” Kale said and added that empirical data collection and analysis is expected to be completed in four months if adequate resources were made available. In March 2021, the Supreme Court (SC) struck down the 27% political reservation available to OBC candidates in local body elections and said that the state should conduct a “rigorous empirical survey” to ascertain the exact nature of backwardness of the communities before according reservation. It also struck down the reservation on grounds that the state was exceeding the 50% ceiling on reservation when taken together with the constitutionally mandated reservation to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (SC and ST) candidates. In December, it struck down an Ordinance promulgated by the state that sought to amend existing laws to ensure up to 27% reservation to OBC candidates in local body elections.This had put the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) on a sticky wicket as OBC candidates sought to lose close to 57,000 seats cumulatively across various local bodies including zilla parishads, municipal corporations and panchayat samitis. Though Marathas dominate Maharashtra’s politics, OBC communities — across religion, classes and castes — are considered the largest social bloc at around 53% of the population, based on existing estimates. Though the MSBCC finalized the empirical data collection norms in July 2021 — four months after it was constituted — the exercise could not be launched due to lack of funds.The state government had also reportedly sought an interim report from the Commission as the OBC reservation issue is underway in the SC. However, MSBCC member B.L. Sagar Killarikar said that they would write to the government stating their inability to do so for the time being considering “the lack of records and information.”However, another member of the MSCBC pointed to how they had been severely hamstrung by lack of adequate manpower, research staff and office space.Dattarao Deshmukh, member secretary of the commission confirmed that the questionnaire had been finalized and added that further line of action would be finalized in the next meeting. The date of the next meeting is not confirmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-backward-class-commission-aims-to-complete-survey-in-april-101642160109229.html
14-01-2022||Chandigarh||5-kg IED, ₹1 lakh found in Ajnala on Pakistan border||A special task force (STF) of Punjab Police on Friday recovered a 5-kg improvised explosive device (IED) and ₹1 lakh from the outskirts of Dhanoa village in Ajnala sub division on the India-Pakistan border. Also read: Punjab elections: Former minister Joginder Singh Mann quits CongressThe seizure was made after the Amritsar STF team got a tip-off about the smuggling of arms, ammunition and drugs from across the border. STF assistant inspector general (AIG) Rashpal Singh said, “We received a specific secret information that a consignment of arms, ammunition and drugs has been delivered near the Attari border. Our team started searching the area, during which a suspected black packet was found near Dera Baba Gulab Shah on Bachiwind road.” At first, it appeared to be a consignment of drugs, but when monitored closely, the team suspected it to be an explosive and the services of a bomb disposal squad were requisitioned. The 5-kg IED along with ₹1 lakh was found in the packet. The AIG said police teams were working to identify those behind the smuggling of the explosive, which might have been smuggled from Pakistan. After the recovery, the area was thoroughly searched along with a team of the Border Security Force. There have been incidents of Pakistani drones dropping smuggled arms and drugs in the sensitive area. An STF official requesting anonymity said the explosive might have been used to disrupt peace in poll-bound Punjab. The seizure comes two weeks ahead of Republic Day. On Thursday, police recovered 2.5-kg RDX, a detonator, codex wire (hollow wire packed with explosives), five fuses of explosives, along with wires and 12 cartridges of the AK-47 assault rifle from Gurdaspur. A police team from Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar made the recoveries. The BSF also seized 5-kg heroin along the border in the Amritsar sector on Thursday. The contraband was smuggled from Pakistan by anti-national elements, taking advantage of the dense fog.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/5kg-ied-1-lakh-found-in-ajnala-on-pakistan-border-101642160107788.html

14-01-2022||Mumbai||Omicron: Not so mild for the vulnerable||Mumbai: In August, health workers from the civic body visited 58-year-old Brijesh Singh’s home in Malad to vaccinate him against Covid-19. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had launched a door-to-door vaccination drive for people who were bedridden and immobile, but Singh, whose right leg was amputated, refused to get jabbed. “He told the health workers that there was no point in taking the vaccine as he hardly stepped out of the house,” said Singh’s wife Saroj. Fourteen years ago, Singh’s leg was amputated because of sepsis. He was diabetic but had not taken medication for years. He had suffered from tuberculosis in the past. Once a taxi driver, he stopped leaving his home after the surgery. His unvaccinated status added to his vulnerability in the pandemic. On January 6, Singh’s family rushed him to the civic-run Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivli as he had stopped eating for two days. When they did a Covid-19 test on him, it was positive. The next day, Singh was shifted to the jumbo facility in NESCO, Goregaon, where he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). He died two days later. His death certificate stated that he died of Covid-19 pneumonia that led to respiratory failure. The third wave of the pandemic, predominantly driven by the Omicron variant, is being called “mild” as the symptoms seem to range from fever to sore throats and most persons affected seem to recover within five to seven days. However, the term is misleading, experts said. For the vulnerable population — like Singh and others with co-morbidities — Covid-19, whether it is a Delta variant or Omicron, can still be fatal. In the past 10 days alone, Mumbai’s oxygen bed occupancy has gone up from 11.5% to 23.6%; ICU bed occupancy has gone up from 19.6% to 29.3%: and the occupancy of ventilator beds has increased from 23.3% to 34.7%. As per the case curve in the earlier waves, oxygen, ICU and ventilator beds typically start filling up seven to 12-days from the onset of infection as the patient would start displaying serious symptoms — thus requiring ventilator or ICU support — only from the 7th day onwards. In other words, as cases rise, so will the need for critical care, irrespective of the variant as a section of the population will always remain vulnerable on account of weak immunity and/or co-morbidities. “(Singh’s) infection was widespread into the lungs, and the X-ray showed ground-glass opacities,” said Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of the NESCO facility where Singh was admitted. Ground glass opacities are hazy grey areas in the lungs suggesting pulmonary fibrosis. Singh was put on a range of medications including Remdesivir, but he did not respond to them. In Singh’s case, his treating doctors were unaware of the variant he was infected with. “Knowing the variant won’t change anything,” said Andrade, who has been closely monitoring the progress of ICU patients. “Omicron, despite being known to cause mild infection, can cause severe disease in patients like Singh who have co-morbidities and are unvaccinated,” she said. Being unvaccinated during a pandemic increases the chances of severe disease and mortality by multifold, experts said. “Besides co-morbidities, a lot of factors play a role in how a patient copes with the infection,” Andrade said. “Whether the patient has been on proper medications for his/her co-morbidities, are they following a healthy lifestyle, do they have good nutritional intake etc. matters immensely. We have seen patients with multiple co-morbidities turning around, and otherwise seemingly healthy patients failing to cope with the infection because of these factors,” she said. DON’T CALL IT A MILD WAVE Mumbai has recorded 969,989 cases and 16426 deaths due to Covid-19 since the pandemic began. At present, nearly 900 people are admitted in ICUs across the city — up from 507 on January 4. In the same time period, those hospitalized rose from 4,491 patients to 6,946, the number of cases rose from 816,965 to 969,989. The number of infections is so widespread that it has already overwhelmed the healthcare systems. On one hand, ICUs in the private sector are full up, and on the other hand, there is an acute staff crunch with many healthcare workers down with Covid-19. Vile Parle resident E Valsalam Yunus (63) was unable to find an ICU in the civic-run Seven Hills hospital and the private Nanavati Hospital, following which his family rushed him to the NESCO facility on January 3. Yunus remained in the ICU for five days and was discharged upon recovery. He had a history of heart disease, diabetes and hypertension, but and was unvaccinated. “He has a pacemaker and multiple stents and his heart is functioning sub-optimally with an ejection fraction (pumping ability of heart) of just 20%,” said Yunus’s daughter Angel (31). “I tried to convince him to take the vaccine multiple times, but he refused,” she said. At the start of the new year, Yunus, his wife and son developed symptoms like body ache, runny nose and cough. While his wife and son became better within two days, Yunus’s oxygen level dropped to 91. “Calling this a mild wave sends a very wrong signal,” said Dr Anita Mathew, an internal medicine specialist at the Fortis Hospital in Mumbai. “When we have infections in such a large number, a considerable section of the population is going to need critical care,” she said. “There is a lot of underlying Covid-19. Many patients coming with other ailments like heart attacks, accidents or any other interventions have active Covid infection. And this infection definitely plays role in the patients’ overall recovery,” she said adding that those landing up in the ICU are a mix of unvaccinated, partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated individuals. There are also some patients with re-infections requiring ICU admission, she said. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the Covid-19 task force said that they have defined three broad groups as high risk: people with co-morbidities who don’t have the ability to mount their immunity despite vaccination, senior citizens and those who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. “We have to focus on getting people vaccinated, and those who are vaccinated should get their boosters to mount the immunity. Other than that, following strict Covid behaviour is the best weapon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/omicron-not-so-mild-for-the-vulnerable-101642158907673.html

Several teams of personnel were immediately despatched but the crowd had dispersed by the time police reached the spot, officers said.“Based on preliminary inquiries, we have registered an FIR against 50 to 60 people that includes the organisers of the race as well as the people who had gathered to view it. We have booked them under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act as well as under the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Indian Penal Code for flouting restrictions relating to the on-going Covid pandemic,” police inspector Ajay Gavit said.The incident comes close on the heels of the Supreme Court permitting resumption of the 400-year-old tradition of bullock cart racing in Maharashtra. There are several petitions pending before the SC over bullock cart racing, and the apex court has allowed races to be held in the State till the matters are pending.“While the SC has allowed bullock cart races to be held, there are certain guidelines that need to be adhered to. The organisers of the race need to seek and obtain permission from the District Collector as well as inform the local police, which was not done in this case. Further, all restrictions related to the pandemic were violated by the large crowd that had gathered to witness the race,” Gavit said.The police are now working on identifying and apprehending the accused. Inquiries are under way and arrests are expected in the case soon, officers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/police-book-organisers-attendees-of-illegal-bullock-cart-race-in-ambernath-village-101642157528145.html

14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: Mansa Congress MLA opposed to Moosewala’s candidature||Raising the banner of revolt against the Congress leadership, Mansa MLA Nazar Singh Manshahia on Friday said he would oppose the candidature of controversial Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala from his constituency. Also read: Punjab elections: Former minister Joginder Singh Mann quits CongressManshahia said the state leadership has sent feelers that the singer may be the party’s nominee from the semi-urban segment. In 2017, Manshahia was elected on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ticket with over 20,000 votes. But in April 2019, he rebelled and joined the Congress under then chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. “My family is a traditional supporter of the Congress and I am a better claimant for the seat. I have a long association with the veteran Congress leader and cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa. In the last elections, I contested on the AAP ticket but I managed to win with a huge margin due to support of the Congress,” he claimed. The Congress list is expected later today and Moosewala’s name should be reconsidered, Manshahia said. “The Congress will lose Mansa if an ‘outsider’ and political novice like Moosewala is selected. I have conveyed my feelings to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi through an email,” he said. He said ever since Moosewala was inducted in the party about a month ago, the Congress workers are upset with him being projected as the projecting him as the candidate. “Moosewala belongs to Sardulgarh segment and the party should honour sentiments of a seasoned person like me. He is even ridiculing the party by stating that he will contest as an Independent if the Congress declines his candidature,” Manshahia added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-elections-mansa-congress-mla-opposed-to-moosewala-s-candidature-101642154887651.html
14-01-2022||Delhi||BJP doesn't want it, so got child rights panel to stop ‘Desh Ka Mentor’: Sisodia||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) does not want the Union territory government to continue with the ‘Desh Ka Mentor’ programme; hence they used the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) to stop the same. He added that a BJP worker from Chhattisgarh complained about the programme being a “threat” to a child's safety.“[The] BJP does not want (Aam Aadmi Party) AAP's 'Desh ka Mentor' programme to continue so they used NCPCR to stop [it] on a complaint by a BJP worker from Chhattisgarh, who said it is a ‘threat’ to a child's safety,” Sisodia was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The NCPCR has raised concerns against the mentor programme a couple of times, with the latest being on January 11 when it wrote to the Delhi government seeking suspension of the same. The child rights body alleged the programme exposes children to unknown persons and that it should be suspended till the loopholes are taken care of.In the January 11 letter, the NCPCR said that it wrote to the Delhi chief secretary last month following which a response arrived from the UT government's directorate of education (DoE) on January 3. However, the commission claimed the reply was “ineffectual”.Sisodia, however, brushed aside the claims of the child rights body, saying that all mentors involved in the programme are mandatorily needed to undertake psychometric evaluation before they are taken on board by the Delhi government.“We have taken extreme care on these subjects while deciding the structure of the programme. Under the programme, all female students are allotted female mentors while all male students are allotted male mentors. Parental consent has been made mandatory for students to seek allotment of a mentor under the programme,” he added.Notably, the ‘Desh Ka Mentor’ programme was launched by the Delhi government in October last year. Under it, students of classes 9 to 12 of Delhi government schools will be guided by mentors in exploring different types of career and life options. It involves “adopting” up to 10 government school students to be mentored by individuals, who are successful in their respective fields.Bollywood actor Sonu Sood is the brand ambassador of the programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjp-doesn-t-want-it-so-got-child-rights-panel-to-stop-desh-ka-mentor-sisodia-101642151875547.html

Speaking to a news agency, Jain said the number of new daily coronavirus cases in Delhi was expected to be less than 25,000 on Friday. “Delhi reported 28,867 cases yesterday. Today, we are expected to record less than 25,000 cases,” Jain told ANI. Over the last two days, Delhi recorded more than 25,000 daily Covid-19 infections. On Wednesday, the city reported 27,561 new cases, and on Thursday, the number of cases, according to daily health bulletins released by the Delhi government, was 28,867. On Wednesday, the health minister said the number of Covid-related hospitalisations in Delhi had stabilised, which indicated that the daily case count could also possibly drop over the coming days. Jain said if the cases started to come down, the Delhi government would consider easing some of the existing restrictions that have been put in place to control the spread of the coronavirus. Jain also said that while the death count in Delhi was seeing an uptick, it was important to note that 75% of the Covid-related fatalities reported over the last few days were of people who were not vaccinated against the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/capital-likely-to-record-less-than-25-000-new-covid-cases-today-health-minister-101642154107524.html
14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: Former minister Joginder Singh Mann quits Congress||Former Congress minister and Punjab Agro Industries Corporation chairman Joginder Singh Mann on Friday quit the party amid reports that he may join the Aam Aadmi Party in the run-up to the February 14 assembly elections. Also read: Covid norms go for toss as thousands gather for Maghi MelaSoon after Mann snapped his 50-year-old ties with the Congress and stepped down as the corporation chief, a cabinet rank post, sources said that he would be joining the AAP as negotiations were underway. When contacted over phone, Mann neither confirmed nor denied his plans of joining the AAP but said that he was yet to take a decision and would announce his decision in two days. He said he had lost eight family members to militancy yet he remained “a loyal soldier of the Congress for five decades. Apparently, now the party doesn’t need us that is why our loyalty is considered as our weakness. But it is not so as we are strong enough to safeguard the interests of residents of Phagwara in general and that of underprivileged sections in particular even without the Congress.” In a letter to Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, the three-time former Phagwara MLA said, “I had a dream that when I die, the Congress tri-colour will be wrapped around my body but my conscience does not allow me to stay here after seeing the Congress patronising those guilty of the post-matric scholarship scheme for Scheduled Caste students.” Mann had spoken up against Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu recently after he was ignored during a rally organised by local MLA Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal in Phagwara. “Maharajas, landlords, moneybags and opportunist leaders like Captain Amarinder Singh and Sidhu came to the party for their vested interests due to which the party drifted from its core values and the focus shifted merely to contest elections and grab power. For the past few months, I’ve been having sleepless nights because hundreds of SC students’ career has been ruined due to the usurping of money. Instead of punishing the guilty, the Congress sheltered them and the recent Cabinet decision was the final blow,” he said. Citing another reason for quitting, he said residents of Phagwara have to travel 40km to Kapurthala for getting their administrative works done at the district headquarters. He said had been repeatedly flagging the issue of according district status to Phagwara with the then CM Captain Amarinder Singh and later Charanjit Singh Channi. “Instead of paying heed, they ignored this long-pending demand of Phagwara residents,” he said. Mann also claimed that over the past few years, the Congress has been meting out a step-motherly treatment to the Valmiki or Mazhabi Sikhs, while using the community as a vote bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-elections-former-minister-joginder-singh-mann-quits-congress-101642153987391.html

Since early on Friday, people started arriving at Muktsar, 60km from Bathinda, for a ritual bath at the historic Tuti Gandi Sahib gurdwara. There is no restriction for those converging for the religious event. While political rallies have been banned due to the pandemic, religious processions or gatherings have not been barred. According to the information, Covid-19 guidelines were not followed during the mela. Social distancing norms were not enforced and devotees were seen without masks in and around the shrine. People took a dip in the holy sarovar in large numbers. Muktsar civil surgeon Dr Ranju Singla said the health department is keeping its fingers crossed as the town is seeing a rush of pilgrims since Thursday even as Covid cases are on the rise in Punjab. Special teams have been distributing masks to devotees but people in a festive mood have been ignoring appeals to maintain distancing, Dr Singla said. “Seven vaccination-cum-screening camps have been set up but there are hardly any takers. On Thursday, about 100 people took the vaccine but today nobody has turned up,” the civil surgeon said. In view of the rush at the mela, the Muktsar district administration declared a holiday in all public offices on Friday. All liquor vends and shops selling meat will remain closed in the Muktsar municipal limits till Friday midnight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-norms-go-for-toss-as-thousands-gather-for-maghi-mela-101642148887698.html

On the festive day, this year too, Delhi’s kite flying groups have plans to convene and mark the harvest festival, but only from their individual terraces. For a collective yet safe experience, and to exhibit their shared passion for kite flying, most of them will fly kites to stay upbeat during these tough times, but not in groups. Terraces allow social distancing“Many families around the Jama Masjid area, in Old Delhi, celebrate Makar Sankranti by taking to kite flying. For us kite groups, it’s a day of added joy as there are many more kites in the sky on this day,” says M Javed, president, Delhi Kite Flying Association, adding: “Since many homes and terraces are in close quarters in the Old Delhi area, people can see each other from the terraces and still remain socially distanced. We’re all planning to celebrate the day by flying kites on our terraces and not congregate in any one spot. It’s our duty to follow Covid rules, when we know the situation at hand.” Competing in the festive spiritKaphil Ahmed, a member of Venus Kite Club, says, “We’re organising a competition on our individual terraces on Makar Sankranti. It’s a big date for us, and we will ensure that it’s celebrated that way, but without flouting Covid rules. Had the cases not increased yet again, we all would have surely got together in open fields, to fly kites. Many of those fields are closed at the moment. So we will start flying kites from around noon and conclude the competition with a special festive spread on our terrace itself. Some of us have also made arrangements for barbecue on the terrace. As the sun sets, it feels amazing to cook and have warm food after a good session of kite flying.”Bonfire, music at dusk“There are many people in old Delhi who have their roots in Gujarat and Rajasthan, where Makar Sankranti is a super popular festival,” says Naeem Khan, founder of Paragon Kite Club, adding, “Among those families, and others too, will also get on the terraces where children will be taught how to fly kites, snacks shall be served, and come evening and loud music and bonfire will be set up, too. We, as a club, are also planning a kite-flying competition on our terrace. Earlier we used to send each other snacks and tea or coffee during this competition, but that might not happen this time, due to the Covid scare. But we’ll let our kites do the socialising without remaining distant!”Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/makar-sankranti-our-kites-will-do-the-socialising-say-kite-flying-groups-101642143667004.html
14-01-2022||Delhi||HCs shouldn’t throw spanner in works of recovery proceedings: SC||NEW DELHI: High courts should not throw a spanner in the works of the recovery proceedings initiated by financial institutions against the borrowers, who abuse the process of the courts by filing writ petitions, the Supreme Court has said.“Filing of the writ petitions by the borrowers before the high court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India (writ petition) is an abuse of process of the court,” said a bench of justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna, underscoring the significance of relevant laws under which recovery proceedings are initiated.The bench pointed out that there are specific laws such as the SARFAESI (Securitisation and Reconstruction for Enforcement of Security Interest) Act, which provide for debt recovery mechanisms involving banks and other financial institutions. The SARFAESI Act, said the top court, also laid down the process of challenging various notices issued to a borrower, and therefore, high courts should not entertain writ petitions against such orders or notices.“The secured creditor and/or its assignor have a right to recover the amount due and payable to it from the borrowers. The stay granted by the high court would have a serious adverse impact on the financial health of the secured creditor/assignor,” the top court in a judgment on Wednesday.Advocate Abhishek A Rastogi, a partner at Khaitan & Co, said a writ petition under Article 226 cannot be entertained when sufficient alternate and effective remedy is available. “The availability of alternate remedy will certainly depend on facts of each case but the findings of the Supreme Court are relevant in debt recovery cases and must be kept in mind by all judicial authorities.”Also Read | Haridwar hate speech: Supreme Court issues notice to Uttarakhand govtThe top court’s judgment came as it set aside a 2018 order of the Karnataka high court, directing a status quo with regard to possession of mortgaged properties subject to the borrowers making a payment of ₹1 crore with the assets reconstruction company (ARC) concerned.Phoenix ARC Private Limited challenged the high court order in favour of its borrowers, Vishwa Bharati Vidya Mandir and St Ann’s Education Society, which had defaulted in repayment of loans to the tune of ₹117 Crore. After the borrowers committed defaults repeatedly between 2013 and 2015 even after issuance of notices under the SARFAESI Act, Phoenix sent a communication to the borrowers intimating them about taking possession of the mortgaged properties.Against this letter, the borrowers moved the high court, which ordered a status quo with regard to possession of the mortgaged properties subject to the borrowers making a payment of ₹One crore Phoenix in August 2015. The high court extended this interim order on two other occasions in 2017 and 2018, prompting Phoenix to approach the Supreme Court.Allowing the appeal, the Supreme Court said that writ petitions against the private financial institution under Article 226 may not be maintainable when they seek to challenge SARFAESI proceedings, particularly because such institutions do not perform any public function by lending money.“The secured creditor and/or its assignor have a right to recover the amount due and payable to it from the borrowers. The High Court ought to have appreciated that by passing such an interim order, the rights of the secured creditor to recover the amount due and payable have been seriously prejudiced,” said the bench.It proceeded to dismiss the writ petitions before the high court, adding the borrowers to pay ₹One lakh each to Phoenix as the cost of litigation.

The scrolls, created by around 500 Indian artists during workshops as part of National Gallery of Modern Art’s (NGMA) recent Kala Kumbhs in the cities of Chandigarh and Bhubaneshwar (Odisha). Depicting the unsung heroes of India’s freedom movement, these scrolls will add an artistic touch to the R-Day fervour. Adwaita Gadanayak, director general, NGMA informs, “These scrolls celebrating the unsung heroes of India. Indigenous, traditional and contemporary artists have worked in the same emotion to make them... We will begin installing these scrolls about 10 days before the parade day, and these will be visible at an open gallery at the Rajpath on January 26. This will help connect India’s artists with the public.” And, “It’s for the first time something like this would be exhibited at Republic Day,” says Ruchi Singh Baoni, curator at NGMA.The making of the scroll, which began on December 11 in Odisha, also draws from the creative illustrations in the Constitution of India and elements painted by late artist Nandalal Bose and his team. It’s also a part of the ongoing Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, which celebrates 75 years of India.The artists from Bhubaneswar have weaved tales of heroism and tales of independence struggle from Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Bengal, and even Northeast India such as Andhra Pradesh. Art forms such as Pattachitra, Talapatra Chitra, Manjusa, Madhubani and Jadu Patua have thus found space on these scrolls. In Chandigarh, the artists painted tales of valour of unsung heroes from Ladakh, Jammu, Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Rajasthan, using art forms such as Phad, Pichwai, Miniature, Kalamkari, Mandana, Thangka and Warli.Shyam Sunder Sharma, an artist from Rajasthan’s Nathdwara says, “We are traditional Pichwai artists, and my family has been doing this art since almost five generations. I, too, have learnt this beautiful Rajasthani art form from my forefathers. It’s great to know that the 400-year-old Pichwai art, which is now getting lost, will be shown at a national level like this. My team of artists, which also comprises my son Jatin Sharma, has used Pichwai motifs to represent Maharana Pratap and the queen of Jhansi, Rani Lakshmibai.”Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/republic-day-2022-celebrations-at-rajpath-to-get-an-artistic-touch-101642141749730.html

For hospital admissions, RT-PCR test is mandatory, so many critically ill patients came with other serious diseases and were found positive upon admission,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said.

14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: Congress in a fix as 35 hopefuls line up for Kharar ticket||As many as 35 people have applied for a Congress ticket from the Kharar Assembly constituency, leaving the party in a fix. With Kharar being the hometown of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, stakes are high in the semi-urban constituency, located on National Highway-21.Part of SAS Nagar district, Kharar was declared an assembly constituency in 2012. Among the front-runners for the Congress ticket are former cabinet minister Jagmohan Singh Kang, Mohali District Planning Board chairman Vijay Sharma Tinku, senior advocate Natrajan Kaushal and Youth Congress senior vice-president Jaswinder Singh Jassi.Former deputy speaker Bir Devinder Singh, who had resigned from SAD (Sanyukt) last month, is also likely to join the Congress and will be a contender for the ticket. A senior Congress leader said the party leadership was in a dilemma over picking its candidate from Kharar, but a name will be finalised soon.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has already fielded Punjabi singer Anmol Gagan Mann, 31. In the 2017 Assembly elections, party’s Kanwar Sandhu had won from the seat by a margin of nearly 2,000 votes, defeating Congress’ Jagmohan Singh Kang. But in November 2018, Sandhu, a journalist-turned-politician, along with Bholath MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira, was suspended from the party for “anti-party activities”. Though Khaira later resigned from the AAP and the Assembly, Sandhu is still with the party, but has not been active in the constituency.During the Kharar municipal elections in February last year, AAP won only one of the 27 seats. The Congress won 10, the SAD eight and independent candidates also grabbed eight seats.The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has picked realtor Ranjit Singh Gill, 57, as its candidate. He had finished third in 2017.From the Bharatiya Janata Party, three names – Sukhwinder Singh Goldy, Khuswant Rai Giga and Vineet Joshi – are doing the rounds.

On the occasion, local Congress MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu said the opposition leaders were joining the Congress due to its people-friendly policies and agendas. “Baidwan switching over to the Congress is one such example. Only the Congress has a long history of serving the nation and its people. The record developments carried out by the Congress in Mohali can be seen everywhere in the district. The agenda-less oppositions are in a fix over countering Congress’ popularity,” said the MLA.He added that the people of Mohali were fully aware of the opposition’s dire attempts to divert their attention with fake and issue-less agendas. “The public has already made up its mind to ensure Congress victory in the upcoming Punjab polls and the opposition, aware of this truth, is in a state of shock,” Sidhu claimed. Lashing out against the AAP, Sidhu said it was a party of opportunists, money and power mongers, who were backstabbers by nature and showed it with perfection whenever elections approached. Senior Congress leader joins SAD After serving the Congress for five decades, senior leader Jaspal Singh on Thursday joined the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in the presence of party president Sukhbir Singh Badal and Dera Bassi MLA NK Sharma. Jaspal said he, his father and grandfather held the post of Zirakpur sarpanch for several decades and remained Congress loyalists. He himself was a councillor, Block Congress president and state secretary from Zirakpur, but he did not get respect in the party in the past few years.

On a door-to-door visit to interact with residents of Bakarpur village, Mohali, Kulwant said even after so many decades, there had been no improvement in health and education in Punjab. “If the health facilities were good, our health minister would not have got treatment in private hospitals, and if education was satisfactory, our ministers and bureaucrats would have sent their children to government schools instead of private schools,” he said. The former mayor said the AAP will be forming the next government in Punjab and Mohali Assembly constituency will definitely contribute to it. Reacting on rebel workers leaving the party, Kulwant said switching the party will not change anything in a society where the whole system needed a change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-will-improve-health-education-in-punjab-kulwant-singh-101642110907384.html

14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Covid cases hit new high in Chandigarh, but no new curbs||Even as Chandigarh’s daily Covid-19 cases mounted to a new high of 1,338 on Thursday, the UT administration decided against imposing fresh restrictions, such as weekend curfew, and instead allowed relaxations for restaurants.In the Covid review meeting, chaired by UT administrator Banwari Lal Purohit, all restriction options were discussed, but the administration decided against imposing any more.On the other hand, it was decided that the hotels, restaurants, cafés, coffee shops and other eating places will be allowed to function up to 10pm, and their kitchens can remain open up to 11pm. But no home delivery will be allowed after midnight.UT adviser Dharam Pal said, “We are monitoring the situation very carefully. In the meeting, there was a consensus that additional restrictions are not required at this moment of time. The high number of cases is also due to increase in testing. The positivity rate marginally dipped from yesterday and we have adequate health infrastructure in place for hospitalisations. We are already stepping up our preparations if these parameters show an increase.”Disabled, pregnant employees can work from homeThe administration exempted persons with disabilities and pregnant women employed in government offices from attending office, but will be required to work from home.Operators of buses, taxis and auto-rickshaws have been directed to only allow passengers as per seating capacity, else they will face strict action.Testing rate increasedAppreciating UT administration’s effort to arrest the spread of Covid by increasing testing three-fold, Purohit hoped that the early detection followed by quick isolation will be helpful in checking increase in cases.Currently, over 5,000 people are being tested a day, compared to 1,200 to 1,500 earlier.Ordering strict enforcement of Covid guidelines and restrictions, Purohit said intensive containment and active surveillance should continue, unabated.Thrust on vaccinationExpressing satisfaction over UT’s vaccination coverage, the administrator directed 100% vaccination of all eligible beneficiaries at the earliest.He said at a review meeting with states and union territories, Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared that Chandigarh had achieved 125% first-dose and 97% second-dose coverage.Besides, in the 15-18 years category, 50.38% population had been jabbed.‘Public must not lower guard’Purohit said currently common public perception was that Covid infection in the ongoing wave was mild. “But lessons learnt from the past experiences were that the pandemic scenario was dynamic and residents should not lower their guard,” he added.Stating that it had been brought to his notice that Covid protocols were being violated in markets and apni mandis, he directed the DGP to intensify challaning.He cautioned that negligence in enforcement will not be tolerated and directed all concerned to strictly check overcrowding and mask violations.To tackle the issue of incorrect contact details provided by people during testing, leading to cumbersome contact-tracing process, the administrator directed the health secretary to resolve the matter by issuing strict instructions to the testing centres.Cases dip slightly in Mohali, PanchkulaWhile Covid cases hit a new record in Chandigarh; Mohali and Panchkula saw their daily tally decreasing slightly.Compared to its all-time high of 734 cases on Wednesday, Panchkula logged 701 cases on Thursday.

14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn open to proposals on technology to be used for upgrade of waste processing plant||The UT administration is open to proposals regarding the technology to be used for the upgrade of the solid waste processing plant in Sector 25, near Dadumajra. A different location may also be considered, if the upgraded plant requires changed land configurations.Notably, the municipal corporation general House had last year voted for the “waste to energy” technology option to run the plant, through which power can be produced from dry garbage.UT adviser Dharam Pal after a meeting with Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar, (IIT Ropar) representatives on Thursday regarding the preparation of the request for proposal (RFP) for the project, said, “We are focusing on the end-result, which is minimal dumping of waste at the landfill site after its processed. Also, the plant must meet emission standards. So, we want to keep it open for bidders to propose any technology for the plant, but it should satisfy us on these key and other parameters.” Pal added that the location of the plant can also be changed if there is requirement for additional land. MC commissioner Anindita Mitra was also present at the meeting, where IIT-Ropar gave a presentation on the RFP and DPR. IIT-Ropar was asked to revise the RFP and include suggestions made by the administration. A fresh report will be submitted within a week. After the report gets the nod of the administration, a tender will be floated to set up the new plant.The city produces 550 to 600 metric tonnes (MT) of garbage per day, but the dysfunctional solid waste management plant in Sector 25 is currently processing only 20-40 MT. All the unprocessed garbage is being dumped at the Dadumajra landfill site.MC signed an agreement with a private firm in 2005 to set up the plant, but took over in 2020 citing poor performance and violation of norms. The move to upgrade the current plant came up after a IIT Roorkee report recommended either upgrading the existing plant or setting up of a new plant to meet the city’s solid waste management needs.The report, at the time of study, stated that the existing plant can at best handle 60 to 65 metric tonne waste per day. Thereafter, the MC appointed IIT Ropar to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) and RFP for plant upgrade.The MC councillors had also visited several processing plants across the region, including Delhi, to finalise the technology and various firms had also made detailed presentations on different technology options before the councillors.

14-01-2022||Noida||Daily spike in Covid-19 cases falls by 600, but positivity rate still high||The daily spike in Covid-19 cases declined marginally in Gautam Budh Nagar on Thursday, with the district reporting 1,763 fresh Covid-19 cases, 503 less than the tally of 2,266 confirmed cases on Wednesday, the data from the district health department showed. With this, the number of infections reported in the month of January is now at 11,058. Currently, there are 10,718 active cases, which is the highest in the state, as per state records.Although the total daily count is less than that on Wednesday, the positivity rate continued to remain high, according to the district health department figures. The overall positivity rate -- the ratio of samples that return positive from among the total tested -- on Thursday was 27.8%, up from the 26.07% recorded a day ago. The overall RT-PCR positivity rate also increased from 36.3% on Tuesday to 41.1% on Wednesday. Tests conducted using the RT-PCR method is believed to give out more accurate results as compared to rapid antigen tests. Officials, however, claimed that the higher positivity rate is indicative of better testing and tracking. “In this wave, the number of positive cases has been high as compared to the previous wave. Obviously, the transmissibility of the infection is more. However, the number of serious cases and the need for hospitalisation is low so far, which is a positive sign. The higher positivity rate indicates that the surveillance mechanism has been efficient in testing and tracking patients, and is therefore helping reduce transmission,” said district magistrate Suhas LY. Health officials said depending on the need, focused testing has been consistently increased over the past one month. A comparison of testing and positivity rate data over the past 15 days shows how rapidly the positivity rate in Noida increased from 0.2% on December 25 to 26% on January 11. During the same period, the number of tests also increased from 3,358 on December 25 to 8,693 on January 11. The overall positivity rate crossed 1% on December 29 and crossed 10% on January 5. Following this, the daily spike surged as positivity rate doubled to 20.3% within the next two days on January 7. The overall RT-PCR positivity rate is 41.1%, as on January 12 -- it was a mere 0.4% on December 25, as per the health department figures. Between January 3 and 6, it went up from 7.3% to 25.2%. Officials said the test positivity over the next few days will determine whether cases have already peaked in Gautam Budh Nagar or whether more is yet to come. “It is good that fewer cases have been reported (on Thursday). It is still early to determine the trend in cases but cases recorded over the next week will determine whether they have started declining,” said Suhas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/daily-spike-in-covid-19-cases-falls-by-600-but-positivity-rate-still-high-101642107002197.html
14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Lohri a sombre affair in Chandigarh; traders record dismal sales||Lohri remained a sombre affair in the city and markets wore a deserted look as residents chose to stay indoors amid the record surge in Covid cases. Traders dealing in items like dry fruit and jaggery said this resulted in sales taking a massive hit. Even vendors who had started setting up stalls outside markets from Tuesday, said they barely made any sales. Arif, who had set up a stall to sell wood in front of the Sector 46 market, said, “I come here every year, but this time, my sales have been almost negligible. The footfall in the markets has also been less.” Opposite the Sector 29 Mandi ground, Ayub who had set up a stall to sell gachak and rewari added, “I had opened up on Tuesday itself, but the response was poor.”Wholesalers of dry fruits in the city were also affected adversely. Many of them are based in the grain market in Sector 26, where entry of the general public has been banned by the administration . President of the Sector 26 Grain Market Association, Ram Karan Gupta, said, “Wholesalers have recorded zero sale of dry fruits this year. We understand that restrictions are needed to keep Covid in check, but the grain market shouldn’t be clubbed with the Sector 26 mandi, where a large number of vendors continue to flout social distancing and mask rules.”The situation was dire in other major markets as well. Neeraj Bajaj, president of the Business Promotion Council in Sector 17 and proprietor of Sindhi Sweets, said, “There is hardly any festive spirit left in the air in Sector 17 and the whole situation seemed so different just a few days back on Christmas,” he said. Proprietor of Uttam Sweets in Sector 46, Balwinder Singh, added that even though some people purchased items like gachak and rewaris from them, sales were disappointing. “People used to gift sweets to their friends and relatives on Lohri , but this year, people are not moving out and only made small purchases for personal consumption,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lohri-a-sombre-affair-in-chandigarh-traders-record-dismal-sales-101642106885468.html

14-01-2022||Noida||Ghaziabad: Present wave largely affects 21-50 age group, infects 369 minors too||The present wave of the Covid-19 pandemic largely affected Ghaziabad residents in the 21-50 age group, who comprised about 66.96% of the total number of cases between December 2021, and January this year, according to district officials.Officials did say that the positivity rate declined during the past two days with an increase in testing, but attributed it more to the pendency of reports which were yet to arrive from several labs.Positivity rate refers to the percentage of people who test positive for the virus compared to all those who have been tested for it.Health department records indicate that the district recorded about 10,118 cases from December 2021, to January 13 this year. Of these cases, there were 6,775 patients in the 21-50 age group, comprising 66.96% of the total.Meanwhile, officials said children in the 0-10 age group were also affected during the ongoing wave, and 369 of them tested positive, comprising 3.65% of the cases between December 2021, and January this year. Likewise, 702 senior citizens were also infected this time, comprising 6.94% of the total cases since December 2021.“A majority of positive cases were reported by the 21-50 age group as it is the set of people who regularly move out for work and other jobs. The trend is continuing. During the initial days, people who travelled to different states or returned from foreign countries were testing positive, but this trend is not observed nowadays as the infection has now spread,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer.Within the 21-50 age group, the segment of people in the 31-40 age group has the highest share in present cases. According to data from the district health department, of the 10,118 cases, this age group accounts for 2,623 cases with a share of 25.92%, while the second-highest affected age group is 21-30 as 2,379 of them have been infected so far (a share of 23.51%).Of the 10,118 patients, 6,053 were men and 4,065 were women.“Despite the infection spreading fast, the severity is very low. This is due to the high rate of seroprevalence and vaccination. So, it is vital that people get vaccinated. Those who have not taken any of the doses are at risk,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of the Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter).Officials said that of the infected patients, they estimate that about 99% have taken either one or two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine.“This has prevented deterioration of their health to a large extent. Our focus is on increasing vaccination for children and also for other age groups. We estimate that the rate of infection has not come down as indicated by lower positivity in the past two days. We are waiting for test reports from different labs and this may increase the number of cases when uploaded. We will observe the declining trend for about a fortnight before we can safely say that cases are on the decline,” the CMO added.The Ghaziabad district on Thursday recorded 1,680 cases out of the 11,022 samples tested--with a positivity rate of 15.24%. This is the highest daily testing figure in December 2021, or January so far.The positivity rate of the cases showed a decline on Wednesday too when the district reported 1,581 cases out of 9,335 samples tested. The positivity rate was 16.94%--lower than the highest positivity of 18.72% recorded on January 11.Starting January 5, the district is conducting more than the daily target of 7,400 tests, with the daily testing peaked to 11,022 tests on Thursday.According to official records, the district reported 65,403 cases overall since the start of pandemic and has 9,036 active cases at present.

14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Vaishno Devi tragedy: Stampede survivors demand findings of L-G Manoj Sinha’s probe panel||While the status of a probe marked by lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha to a three-member panel headed by home secretary Shaleen Kabra remained unclear, the survivors of a stampede at Shri Mata Vaishno Devi shrine said they reserved the right to know who was responsible for the criminal negligence that led to the killing of 12 pilgrims and injuries to 15 others. Following the stampede at 2.15 am at the shrine on January 1, Sinha had marked the probe to a panel headed by Kabra. It has additional director general of police Mukesh Singh and Jammu divisional commissioner Raghav Langer as its members. The panel had to submit its report within a week’s time to the LG. Survivors from Mumbai, Pathankot and Prayagraj, who spoke to HT over the phone, recalled the nightmarish experience. “We reserve the right to know, whose fault it was that took away 12 precious lives and injured scores. We had gone there to seek blessings of the deity for a prosperous New Year and not to get trampled,” says Sumit Kumar, 32, of Pathankot, a first-timer to the shrine. “I am still recovering from a fracture and trauma. We were coming out of the shrine after paying obeisance. What we saw was a huge rush of pilgrims and none to manage them,” he adds. “Though the authorities announced compensation for the dead and injured, money can never compensate a human life. Those who died there had also gone to pay obeisance and seek blessing for a prosperous New Year for themselves and their families. They didn’t return but their bodies,” he recalls. “It is my second birth. I am still in a state of shock. I have a two-year-old son. My parents and my wife are now reluctant to send me again to the shrine,” he says. “Amid the stampede, I fell with my chest facing the ground. Six to seven people were on my back and I was gasping for breath. Even now I get goose-bumps while recalling the horrifying incident,” he says. Sumit said, “It is my right to know that who was behind this criminal negligence. I even called shrine board numbers in Katra, but didn’t get any satisfactory reply from them.” Sumit felt that the delay in making public the report could be a cover up to shield guilty. Ashish Kumar Jaiswal, 25, from Prayagraj, said, “I am still having a bandage on my arm. I am recovering from a fracture and the deep scars the stampede left on my body and my psyche”. Jaiswal claimed he didn’t get a single penny as compensation from the authorities. “I have been visiting the shrine for the past seven years on the eve of New Year but I had never had seen such an incident before,” he says. He also demanded that the inquiry report be made public, the guilty held accountable and tried under the law of the land. Vikas Tiwari, 35, from Mumbai said, “Me and my brother Rishikesh were injured in the stampede. We had visited the shrine umpteen times but what unfolded on the fateful night was very frightening”. “It was sheer negligence by the government. The findings of the probe must be made public,” he says. Reasi district SSP Shailendra Singh said, “Since a high-level probe has been ordered, all the information has to be shared by the committee. We are authorised to speak only after the report is submitted”. He also refused to divulge FIR numbers, Sections and the accused. SHO, Katra, Sunil Sharma also refused to share any information. Repeated calls and messages to home secretary Shaleen Kabra went unanswered. The LG’s probe panel was constituted to examine in detail causes/reasons behind the incident, point out lapses, fix the responsibility, and suggest appropriate standard operating procedures (SOPs) and measures for preventing the recurrence of such incidents in the future.

Recurring such open seditious and genocidal calls in the country are deeply disturbing,” Abdullah said in a statement released in Srinagar.He said the criminal hush in government circles raises a question mark that begs to be answered. “India being a signatory to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) under Article 3 C which clearly criminalises ‘Direct and public incitement to commit genocide’ - should act firmly against such groups and individuals that call for genocide of country’s Muslims,” he further said in the statement, adding that these hate speech conclaves also fit a variety of crimes under Indian laws and are antagonistic to national integrity and peace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farooq-abdullah-demands-stern-action-against-hate-speech-at-conclaves-101642106047647.html

All the injured were immediately shifted to the hospital for treatment. Police personnel Rohit Chib succumbed to his injuries. The condition of other injured, including two civilians, who had sustained minor injuries, is stated to be stable,” the spokesman said.The militant killed in the encounter was identified by the police as a top Pakistani JeM militant Babar Bhai. “As per police records, the Pakistani militant was active since 2018 in Shopian, Kulgam and its adjoining areas. He was wanted in several terror crime cases,” the spokesman said, adding that one AK-47 rifle, one pistol and two grenades were also recovered from the site of encounter.IGP, Kashmir, Vijay Kumar visited the encounter site and SOG camp Nillow Kulgam, where besides interacting with the JKP, Army and CRPF personnel, he also reviewed the security grid and operational aspects.He told mediapersons that the owner and his family members, where the killed militant was hiding, deliberately misled the search team by saying that no one was hiding in their house which led to collateral damage. “The action under terror law will be taken against them.”He further said that so far 14 militants have been neutralised during the current year out of which seven are foreign terrorists, including one killed at the LoC in Kupwara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jem-terrorist-killed-in-kulgam-encounter-identified-as-pakistani-national-101642105988518.html

14-01-2022||Noida||With campaigns going virtual, GB Nagar admin to step up digital monitoring||With just a month to go for voting day in Gautam Budh Nagar and the district still reporting the highest daily surge in Covid-19 cases in all of Uttar Pradesh, political parties are heavily relying on social media to reach out to the masses with their digital campaigns. In light of the rising Covid-19 cases, the Election Commission has banned all kinds of physical meetings till January 15.Political parties are, therefore, strengthening their IT infrastructure to hold virtual rallies as well as digital public meetings on social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube and Facebook.“We are utilising each and every digital tool available to talk about development issues and connect with voters. Moreover, since the pandemic, social media has played a pivotal role in helping candidates connect with their voters and we have created a deep social media strategy that reaches down to the booth level and have volunteers specialising in IT and social media,” said BJP Noida spokesperson Tanmay Shankar, adding that the IT cell of the BJP in Noida comprises over 40 volunteers.Party representatives said there is a high percentage of young voters in Noida, which means that they are more active on social media. A Congress spokesperson said party workers in the constituency are connected to voters through WhatsApp groups.“Through these groups, we help out voters in distress and also establish close contact with them. Since the pandemic, residents rely heavily on social media to make their issues heard and we lend them a ear,” said Pawan Sharma, Noida Congress spokesperson. He added that the Congress does not have a local IT Cell at the district level as of now.Raghvendra Dubey, a party worker from Samajwadi Party, said, “We had not anticipated that Covid cases will see a sharp increase right before the elections and, hence, a number of our strategies that included physical public meetings had to be cancelled. However, we have been carrying out digital campaigns through social media and public meetings are being organised virtually.”Meanwhile, in order to keep track of political activity on the internet, the district election officer and Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said his team has strengthened their media certification and monitoring committee (MCMC) with a separate team for social media tracking.“This time, elections are very different because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Parties are routing their campaigns through digital means and hence we are also strengthening our teams to monitor the digital space. While the MCMC already has separate teams to monitor electronic, print and new media, this time we may increase the number of persons on the social media team as digital campaigns are set to increase in the coming days,” said Suhas.He further said, “On the social media team, we have carefully selected officials who are tech-savvy.”Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty, Noida authority, who is the head of the Gautam Buddh Nagar district level MCMC committee, said currently the social media monitoring team has five government employees on deputation.“Once all candidate names are declared, we will be on our toes to track their social media activity. We will also keep an eye on their social media tags as it is possible that the candidate does not violate the model code of conduct but a worker might, by tagging the candidate. In case of a violation, we will inform the DEO who will then inform the state election commission to take action. Scrutiny will also be on WhatsApp groups and forwarded messages,” he said.He added that monitoring expenditure done by parties on social media will be hard to quantify.“While it is easy to spot paid articles or news pieces in print and on electronic media, it will be hard to quantify how much political parties are spending on social media management firms or graphic designers to carry out their digital campaigns. However, we will investigate if we get any tip-off about violations,” said Tripathi, adding that soon a helpline number will be made available to the public where any poll violation on social media or other media channels can be reported.

He has in fact mocked Modi over the issue at times.A group of protesters had blocked Modi’s route in Ferozepur in what the Union home ministry had described a serious lapse in security as the Prime Minister remained stranded on the road for 15-20 minutes. Modi had to cancel his rally and returned to Bathinda airport from where he flew back to the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pm-security-breach-punjab-cm-channi-recites-verse-to-wish-modi-long-life-101642105862519.html
14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh discontinues Covid kits for patients in home isolation||The UT administration has decided to discontinue distribution of Covid-19 relief kits to infected patients under home isolation. UT officials said the decision has been taken as per the Centre’s guidelines.The administration had started distributing the relief kits to home isolated Covid patients during the second wave of the pandemic, so that they can regularly self-monitor various health indicators. The kits included an oximeter, digital thermometer, face masks, sanitizers, kaadha (medicinal drinks) and necessary medication, besides educational material and instructions on use of medicines.“The distribution of kits was discontinued as per guidelines of the Union government. The medicines, which were included in the relief kits, have not been included in the treatment protocol this time. As per medical experts, it was learnt that people were consuming medicines even when there was no requirement. Also, drinking kaadha in excess was also proving to be bad for health. Thus, there is no point in distributing kits without the essential medicines,” said UT health secretary Yashpal Garg.As the Mohali and Panchkula health departments are still providing the relief kits, residents in Chandigarh have expressed disappointment and demanded distribution of at least essential medicines.Manveer Singh, a local resident, said that the health department must provide basic medicines so that people can use them in case of emergency. “My mother, 56, and I tested positive for Covid-19 last Saturday. The health department contacted us initially when our conditions were stable. After two days, my mother developed a cough and high fever. We tried calling helpline numbers, but it remained busy of the time. Since we could not step out of the house and there was no one to help us, I had to contact my relatives in Mohali to provide us medicines,” he said.Ram Bahadur, a resident of Kishangarh, said, “I work as a security guard in Sector 41. I tested positive on Monday and since I didn’t know what medicines to take for fever, I self-medicated. Then, my colleagues helped me with essential medicines.”Ankita Passi, a social worker, who runs a helpline to provide food and medicines to Covid patients in the tricity, said, “We often get calls from home isolated patients who require food. But, many times, people demand basic medicines from us, mostly for fever and cough. We try to provide them when required, but the health department must distribute medicines to people, especially those who are financially-challenged or living in colonies.”“We have not got any guidelines on replacing the medicines with other drugs. Also, distribution of kits at patients’ doorsteps requires huge manpower. However, even though we are not distributing kits, we are keeping a close watch on the home isolated patients. Our rapid response teams contact each patient and check on their health. Since most of the patients are asymptomatic, teams of doctors visit their houses only when they ask for it and provide medicines as per their requirements Also, helpline numbers are provided to patients so that they can contact us in case of any emergency or for advice,” Garg added.------Though Mohali and Panchkula health department are providing relief kits to home isolated patients, UT administration say that the distribution of kits is not included in Centre’s treatment protocol||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-discontinues-covid-kits-for-patients-in-home-isolation-101642105744440.html
14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: In the virtual world, propaganda politics takes the poll position||As political parties in Punjab are gearing up for a virtual mode of campaigning, propaganda Facebook (FB) pages in the garb of comedy/satire are already on the job. At least six such pages with substantial visibility are posting content aimed at tarnishing the image of one or the other political party. Virtual profiles of five such pages declare that they run paid political content in the form of videos, images, and graphics. The content on these pages is mainly in Punjabi and the number of their followers, along with ‘likes’, ‘shares’ and ‘views’ of the posts, vary. Started on November 8, 2021, ‘Beakli Dal’ page targets the Akali leadership. On Wednesday, it had 16,000 followers and a video posted on Thursday garnered 80,000 views. Its transparency details say the page has eight India-based administrators. ‘Dhongiaap’ page’s Punjabi content targets Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and it was created on November 9 last year. With 9,500 followers, the page posted 11 videos on Wednesday and the views ranged between 6,000 and 39,000. It, too, has eight India-based administrators. Another Facebook page with the same name — Dhongi AAP — started in October 2016 has 16 administrators, of which four are based in Canada and 12 in India. Six videos posted on it on Thursday had up to 3,400 views. ‘Gapptaan Pro’, an anti-Congress page, was floated in March last year and the page has a following of 38,000 accounts. A 1.43-minute video posted here eight weeks ago logged 47,000 views. Created on October 23, 2021, ‘PunjabBolda’ FB page has over 16,000 followers. Its content is mainly against the AAP, Congress, and BJP. All the 15 administrators of the page are based in India. Started on December 8 last year, ‘KhakiKachhianWale’ page that targets the BJP and its political allies, already has over 7,500 followers. A video posted last week attracted 26,000 views. Except ‘Gapptaan Pro’ and ‘Dhongi AAP’, the rest of the pages run the political advertisements, say the ‘transparency’ profile of the respective FB accounts. Dean of mass communication at a private university in Punjab and a media analyst, Ashutosh Mishra, says the political memes are aimed at influencing mainly the young voters. “Earlier such pages were found camouflaged as ‘news’ websites or channels but now they are appearing in the guise of satire. Digital media literacy is the key to redress the issue,” he says. Leaders of the political parties say their IT teams are identifying the offensive content and complaints are being lodged with the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the Facebook. “Digital propaganda in the guise of humour is aimed at to escape from the objective discussions on electoral issues. This is a cause of concern as the virtual platforms are being used to build a narrative against the opponents,” said Rubal Kanozia, an assistant professor and expert in political communication at Bathinda-based Central University of Punjab (CUP). Spokesperson of AAP’s state unit Neel Garg said the IT team has been sounded to get the biased content removed. Akali Dal’s IT cell chief Nachhatar Gill said the party has already taken up the matter with the Facebook authorities against 4-5 propaganda pages. BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma said the party’s legal cell is preparing a list of FB pages propagating slanderous content and a complaint will be lodged with the ECI in the near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-in-the-virtual-world-propaganda-politics-takes-the-poll-position-101642105564234.html

Bhadana is a native of Faridabad, which was once represented by him. He also became an MP from Meerut and won the assembly seat of Meerapur before joining the Rashtriya Lok Dal.“I want to fight from Jewar because I wish to work for all communities. Farmers and many other people from other communities have not been given their due respect. I will fight for their rights,” said Bhadana after he was named as the RJD candidate from Jewar. Currently, Thakur Dhirendra Singh is the incumbent MLA from Jewar, who won the state assembly elections for the first time in 2017 on a BJP ticket. The Bahujan Samaj Party has already named Narendra Dedha (50), an ex-journalist from Jewar while Congress has fielded Manoj Chaudhary (50) for this seat.“Avtar Singh Bhadana has joined our party because he has realized that Lokdal, along with Samajwadi Party, is going to form the government in UP in 2022. We will win Jewar seat because the farmers want a change this time,” said Trilok Tyagi, national general secretary of Rashtriya Lok Dal.Jewar has become a focal point of politics this time because it has attracted international investors as many projects, such as the Noida airport, Film City, medical device park and other mega projects have been proposed in the region. Dhirendra Singh however is quite confident that he will easily win because he and his party have worked a lot in this constituency. “We have made the airport a reality in this area. Apart from this, we have built two government colleges, skills institutions, film city and apparel park, creating jobs for the youth and boosting growth in the region. We have worked for the farmers, whose blessings I am sure we’ll get in the elections,” said Singh.

14-01-2022||Noida||Congress banks on party workers, offers them three seats in Ghaziabad||The Congress party on Thursday released its first list of 125 candidates for the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, including three candidates each from Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar districts. Two of three candidates from Ghaziabad are office-bearers of the party’s district unit while the third is the son of a former Congress MP. The list was released by party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who is leading the campaign in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, where elections will be held in seven phases, starting February 10. The districts of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad will vote under the first phase, as per the schedule announced by the Election Commission of India.“Out of the total 125 candidates, 40 per cent are women and 40 per cent are youth. With this historic initiative, we hope to bring in a new kind of politics in the state,” Vadra said in a virtual meeting, after releasing the list.The Congress has announced three candidates from Ghaziabad, which has five assembly segments and a part of Dhaulana segment (Hapur district). They are Bijender Yadav , the party’s district president, for the Muradnagar seat; Yameen Malik, the party’s district president (minority cell) for the Loni seat; and Sushant Goyal ,the son of former Congress MP late Surendra Prakash Goyal, for the Ghaziabad seat. “The party has released a list of 125 candidates, with three each from Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar. The list includes 50 women candidates. In Ghaziabad, two more candidates are yet to be declared for the Modinagar and Sahibabad assembly seats. They will be declared soon,” said Dolly Sharma, member of All India Congress Committee and spokesperson of UP Congress Committee. Presently, all five assembly seats in Ghaziabad are held by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Sushant Goyal, the Congress candidate from Ghaziabad seat, is a contractor who says he is now into full time politics. His father, the late Surendra Prakash Goyal was a Congress MP from Ghaziabad in 2004 and also contested on a Congress ticket (Congress-Samajwdi Party alliance candidate) in the 2017 assembly elections from Muradnagar seat, but lost to BJP candidate Ajit Pal Tyagi by a margin of 90,770 votes.“I am now into full time politics and will work closely with the people. I will carry forward the works done by my father who was loved by all due to his down-to-earth approach. I will try to implement whatever I learnt while working with him. It would not be right to say that the party has given tickets to its confidants this time. As far as I know, the party conducted at least 10 internal surveys and the last one was carried out about two days ago. It is only after assessing the ground level situation that the party offered me a ticket,” Goyal said. Bijender Yadav, the Congress district president, said the party has recognised the hard work he has put in over the past 32 years. “It is indeed a moment of pride for me as I have been offered a ticket to contest. It shows that the party cares for its workers and this will infuse a lot of energy among them. We will contest the upcoming elections with full strength,” Yadav added. Yameen Malik, the Congress candidate from Loni, said he has been attached to the party for past seven years. “I have been raising issues relevant to the people and fighting to get them justice at the grassroots level. This ground work has been recognised by the party and I will work for the development in Loni. I will work to establish two hospitals in Loni and also a girls’ college, besides ensuring a proper drainage system,” Malik said. The sources in the Congress said of the two tickets pending for Sahibabad and Modinagar seats, one is likely to be offered to a woman candidate. The list also includes names of Pankhuri Pathak from the Noida seat, Deepak Bhati from Dadri and Manoj Chaudhary from Jewar assembly constituencies in Gautam Budh Nagar. In all, there are 403 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh and major political parties are in hectic brainstorming sessions to release their respective lists of candidates for the first phase, which will primarily cover districts in western Uttar Pradesh. Like the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has also declared a list of three candidates for the Ghaziabad district -- Sachin Sharma from Loni, Dr Chavi Yadav from Sahibabad and Mahesh Tyagi from Muradnagar. BSP and SP ANNOUNCE CANDIDATESThe Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) also released its first list of candidates on Thursday evening, including those for two Ghaziabad assembly segments -- Dr Poonam Garg from Modinagar and Haji Aquil from Loni. Aquil was recently involved in alleged violation of model code of conduct in Loni and booked by the Loni police. “The two candidates from Loni and Modinagar have been declared by the party while candidates for the remaining three seats will be declared soon,” said Virendra Jatav, BSP district president. On the other hand, the Samajwadi Party-Rashtriya Lok Dal combine also announced three candidates in Ghaziabad. The SP fielded Amarpal Sharma from the Sahibabad assembly seat. Sharma is a former MLA from Sahibabad; he had won in 2012 on a BSP ticket. The RLD announced candidates from Modinagar and Loni on Thursday evening. “Along with Sharma, the SP-RLD alliance has declared Madan Bhaiya from Loni and Sudesh Sharma from Modinagar. The rest of the candidates will be declared in the coming days,” said Rashid Malik, district president of the Samajwadi Party.

Chaduni’s made known his displeasure days after talks between his outfit SSP and Rajewal-led SSM for a pre-poll alliance. The SSM had also formed a committee for finalizing the seat-sharing arrangement with the SSP. Polling for Punjab’s 117 assembly seats will be held on February 14 and votes will be counted on March 10. In a video message, Chaduni said he had demanded 25 seats for his party but Rajewal’s SSM offered only nine seats. Chaduni said he will be forced to field candidates on his own if the SSM did not give adequate seats. On January 9, Chaduni had held talks with the SSM for the poll pact and after that, he stopped the scheduled announcement of his party’s 10 candidates. “In the January 9 meeting (with the SSM), we requested them not to fight separately. You are ignoring us. We should fight jointly. We also stopped our press conference (for the announcement of candidates),” said Chaduni. Various Punjab farmer bodies which had taken part in the stir against the Centre’s now-repealed farm laws had launched their political front — Sanyukt Samaj Morcha — last month and announced to contest the assembly polls. The SSM, which had ruled out any alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party, announced its first list of 10 candidates on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-chaduni-upset-as-rajewal-s-sanyukt-samaj-morcha-offers-his-outfit-only-a-few-seats-101642104422527.html
14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Reunited after 74 yrs, brothers Siqa and Saddique seek visas to spend more time together||Two real brothers, who grew up in India and Pakistan sides of Punjab, and got to see each other after 74 years at Kartarpur recently are now pleading for visas so that they can spend more time together at the fag end of their lives. Siqa Khan, now 76, and Saddique Khan (80) got separated during the Partition in 1947. Saddique, his father and sister crossed over and settled in Faislabad of Pakistan, while Siqa, who was named ‘Habib’ at birth, and his mother got stuck in India. Behind the emotional reunion was the efforts of a Pakistan-based journalist Nasir Dhillon and medical practitioner Jagsir Singh from Phulewala village of Bathinda district, where Siqa grew up. “My native village was Jagroan De Kothe, falling under today’s Jagraon town in Ludhiana district. I was at my maternal uncle’s village Phulewala with my mother when the Partition violence erupted. My brother, along with my father and sister, migrated to Pakistan, but I and my mother got stuck at Phulewala,” says Siqa. The tragedy of separation didn’t end there for Siqa. “My mother could not bear the shock of separation from family members. She was mentally upset and committed suicide by jumping into a canal, leaving me orphaned. My maternal uncles and villagers looked after me,” he adds. The villagers said Siqa did not marry and worked as a labourer for a living. Currently, he lives with the children and grandchildren of his maternal uncles. Saddique lives at Bogran village in Faislabad district of Pakistan. Making of the reunion Jagsir, who played a key role in facilitating the reunion, said, “Siqa comes from the Gujjar community and he was told by his maternal uncles that his brother and other relatives migrated to Pakistan. He asked us to trace his brother, but nobody has a clue how to do that. He also showed us photos of his family members, including that of his brother. In the meantime, my sister-in-law’s husband, whose family also has a link with a village now in Pakistan, shared a video with me in which Dhillon was interviewing an elderly man who was naming our village and narrating how his brother got separated from the family during the Partition.” “When I watched the video, I found a facial resemblance between Siqa and the elderly man in the video. I called up Dhillon and told him about Siqa. He facilitated a video call between both the brothers in April 2019. Since then he was in touch with his brother and nephews. After that, we started efforts to arrange a meeting but the Covid-19 restrictions came as a hurdle. Finally, it happened at Kartarpur.” Dhillon, along with a fellow journalist Lovely Singh, did that interview of Saddique. They run a web channel focusing on memories of the Partition. “We got emotional during the interview as he she expressed deep longing to see his brother. And, God listened to him,” says Dhillon. 
14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Terror job: IYSF lures Hindu boys with money, foreign dreams||Luring youths of lower strata of society, irrespective of their religion, with foreign dreams and easy money is the latest modus operandi of the banned terror outfit International Youth Sikh Federation (IYSF) to further its cause, investigations suggest. Of the six IYSF operatives arrested by the Punjab Police for last year’s November 21 grenade attack at an army camp in Pathankot, three are Hindus and all of them come from a poor family background. The IYSF is a banned outfit being run by wanted terrorist Lakhbir Singh Rode, who reportedly operates in Pakistan. The six accused were identified as prime accused Amandeep alias Mantri of Lakhanpal village, Parminder Kumar, alias Rohit, alias Rohta, of Kharal village, Raman Kumar of Ghazikot village, Gurwinder Singh of Kharal village, Rajinder Singh of Gunnupur village and Harpreet Singh of Gotpokhar village in Gurdaspur district. Officials familiar with the matter, who didn’t wish to be named, said the accused were neither radicalised nor driven by pro-Khalistan ideology. Their job was to create panic through grenade attacks as briefed by their handler, Sukhpreet Singh alias Sukh of Kharal village, who is currently in Greece, and reportedly an aide of Rode. The accused trained themselves in handling grenades from videos available on YouTube, the officials said. Officials said Amandeep Kumar came from poor family background and earned hand to mouth. His father was a truck driver, who is bedridden since he met a road accident. Amandeep is also said to be a drug addict and has an attempt-to-murder conviction behind him. “He was known to Sukhpreet and was the one who received the consignments of arms and ammunition to execute the blasts. Amandeep was offered paltry sum of up to ₹20,000 per terror activity,” added the officials. Another accused, 19-year-old Raman Kumar is too a drug addict, officials said, and his late father had served in the army. His mother runs the household on her husband’s pension, while Raman’s sister is married. He was lured with foreign dreams by Sukhpreet through another accused, Harpreet Singh. Parminder Kumar, 23, worked as a carpenter and was lured by another accused Gurwinder Singh with money to execute the terror activities. “They were active for the last four to six months. Probe suggests that one of the accused was not even paid any money. In its attempt for survival, the IYSF is targeting needy youths belonging to the lower strata of society in lieu of paltry sums and foreign dreams,” the officials said. Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar senior superintendent of police, Kanwardeep Kaur, declined to comment on the matter. 
14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Verdict in nun rape case involving former Jalandhar bishop today||Thiruvananthapuram: A special court in Kottayam will deliver its verdict in the 2018 rape case against former Bishop of Jalandhar Franco Mulakkal on Friday. In June 2018, a nun had accused Mulakkal of sexually abusing her several times between 2014 and 2016. The case attracted national attention after five fellow nuns had staged a two-week sit-in protest in Kochi seeking action against the bishop. Though the victim filed a complaint on June 29, 2018, it took three months for the police to arrest Mulakkal on Sept 19, 2018. The victim, also a mother superior, is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation based in Punjab, which also runs three convents in Kerala. But Mulakkal denied the rape charges saying he was framed after he took action against the nun for financial irregularities in the convent. Later, he was charged under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code including 376 (2) (indulging in sex by exhorting authority), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 506 (criminal intimidation). During the course of the trial, he had approached the high court and Supreme Court with discharge petitions, but both were turned down. Later he was removed from the post of bishop. The case was also marred after many witnesses turned hostile. A key witness, Father Kattuthara, was found dead near Jalandhar in 2019. Cardinal Mar George Alancherry, the senior-most priest of the Catholics in the state, 24 nuns, 11 priests were among 83 witnesses deposed in the case. Church watchers said this is the first time a senior Catholic religious leader is facing rape charges. “I hope the victim will get justice,” said Sister Lucy Kalapura, who was thrown out of the congregation and religious duty after she openly supported the victim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/verdict-in-nun-rape-case-involving-former-jalandhar-bishop-today-101642103404596.html

The move comes after the formation of the cells, departments and committees led to rumblings and dissent in the Bengal BJP as several veterans were replaced while many who came from the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in recent years were accommodated in the new committees. On December 22, the party announced names of 11 new vice-presidents, five general secretaries and 12 secretaries alongside seven new morcha (front) presidents and heads of departments such as media, information technology and social media. New spokespersons and television show panellists were also appointed.Although there has been infighting in several district units in recent years because of the importance given to ex-TMC leaders and workers, BJP veterans such as Pratap Banerjee, Biswapriyo Roy Chowdhury, Union minister of state Dr Subhas Sarkar, Raj Kamal Pathak, Debasish Mitra, Ritesh Tiwari, Raju Banerjee and Jay Prakash Majumdar were dropped from the panel of vice-presidents. Only Majumdar was made a spokesperson. Pathak was among the most vocal critics of the party’s policies while Roy Chowdhury was a known hardliner. Another hardliner, general secretary Sayantan Basu, was dropped as well.Ali Hossain, who was the state minority morcha president, was replaced by Charles Nandi, a former journalist and member of the Christian community who used to handle the social media page of former state president Dilip Ghosh.Legislator Joyel Murmu was made the ST morcha president while Sudip Das was appointed head of the SC morcha.Some of those dropped from the state committees left the WhatsApp groups of the Bengal BJP. “….all departments and cells stand dissolved till the time they are reconstituted and new appointments made,” said Thursday’s notice issued by the BJP under instructions from Majumdar who was admitted to a Kolkata hospital two days ago after testing positive for the coronavirus infection.The December reshuffle took place a day after the BJP was trounced in the Kolkata municipal polls and six months after the saffron camp secured only 77 of the state’s 294 assembly seats against the TMC’s 213. When the new cells and committees were formed, there was no visible effort to project people who have worked with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as was the practice in the past, said a senior BJP leader. The new selections were made after discussions with BJP national president JP Nadda and other central leaders. “Though the talks were carried out by Majumdar and general secretary (organisation) Amitava Chakravorty, some other leaders had a say in the decision-making process. The end result led to dissent in the rank and file,” a state BJP leader said on condition of anonymity. The reshuffle had many surprising elements, according to BJP leaders.Saumita Khan, a two-time Lok Sabha member from Bankura district who left the TMC and became the yuva morcha (youth front) president, was replaced by Indranil Khan, a Kolkata-based oncologist who unsuccessfully contested the assembly polls. However, Saumitra Khan, whose sharp differences with Dilip Ghosh have never been a closely-guarded secret, was made a state vice-president.Tanuja Chakraborty replaced fashion designer-turned politician Agnimitra Paul as the mahila morcha (women’s front) president. Paul, who won the Asansol South assembly seat in the March-April polls, was made a general secretary along with Lok Sabha member Locket Chatterjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/rumblings-force-bengal-bjp-chief-to-dissolve-new-party-cells-announced-in-dec-101642103224159.html

14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: AAP accuses election commission of tweaking registration process||Chandigarh : The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday accused the Election Commission of making changes in the registration process of political parties under pressure from the BJP to facilitate the registration of a new “morcha” in Punjab. AAP’s Punjab affair co-incharge Raghav Chadha claimed that the changes were being made to prevent the formation of his party’s government in the state. “The EC is reducing the 30-day objection period to seven days to make special changes for the registration of a special political party. Despite the imposition of the code of conduct, the EC is going to register this political party just 25 days before the election,” he said at a press conference in an apparent reference to the Samyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM) set up by the farmers’ organisations. The AAP leader, however, did not specifically take the name of any party. Both the AAP and the SSM were in talks for an electoral, but to agree on seat sharing and have been targeting each other since. AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday conceded that his party could lose some votes due to the decision of the SSM to contest the state elections. Questioning the need to change the laws overnight and the motive behind these changes, Chadha said the political party that will be registered should make its relations with the BJP and Amit Shah clear in front of the people of the country. “At first, the BJP thought they can stop the AAP using the Shiromani Akali Dal, Congress and Amarinder Singh. When they failed, a party is being registered,” he said. He also asked the EC and the BJP as to which existing political party stands to lose the most once this new and special political party is established and which one stands to gain the most.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-aap-accuses-election-commission-of-tweaking-registration-process-101642103042008.html

Sidhu, who has been making a case for naming the party’s CM face and pitching himself for the post, tweeted that the fight is to change this system which has eroded Punjab like termites and is being run in connivance of mischievous politicians. This system cries for a change and reforms as the glory of Punjab has been annihilated by the nexus of few political leaders and mafia, he posted on Twitter. In another tweet, Sidhu said the system which could not give justice to Guru (reference to sacrilege cases) and punish the big fish involve in drug trade needs to be demolished. “I categorically state that I’m not running for any post and it’s either this system will stay or Navjot Singh Sidhu,” he said, upping the ante just minutes before the Congress Central Election Committee was scheduled in Delhi to discuss the names of the party candidates. The PPCC chief’s tweets are being seen in the Congress circles as part of his efforts to get himself declared as the CM face of the party. Like Sidhu, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi has also started pressing for naming the CM face and pitching himself. A senior party leader questioned the approach the two leaders, particularly Channi, despite the high command’s decision to fight the elections under collective leadership. “It is odd that Channi should question the wisdom of the high command.

More than 400 police personnel will be deployed at such sites to track down any violations, officials said.“We have directed the police to keep strict vigil and to penalise people if found violating rules,” a senior official from the district administration said, adding that some members of the Gurugram Imam Sanghathan met the deputy commissioner on Thursday and assured him that protocols will be followed during the Friday prayers. According to officials, the Gurugram police commissioner has directed all police stations to deploy a team each to ensure that people follow guidelines in areas such as Udyog Vihar, sectors 37, 44, 10, 57, 22 and 29, and Palam Vihar that are prone to crowding on Fridays.Meanwhile, members of Gurugram Imam Sanghathan and Muslim Rashtriya Manch held a meeting on Thursday afternoon and asked people to not gather for namaz in large numbers in the open and advised them also not to assemble in mosques on account of the fresh wave of infections.The members met the deputy commissioner and handed over a letter to him stating that they would not violate any Covid-19 protocol and will also reduce the number of people offering namaz in the open.Currently, a maximum of 50 people are allowed for any function/religious programme in open spaces.Khurshid Rajaka, coordinator of the sanghathan, who is also the national convener of Muslim Rashtriya Manch, said there were complaints last week that more than 80 people had offered prayers in the open at one particular spot. “We do not want to violate any guidelines or orders of the state and the district administration, and we have asked all our brothers to follow the protocol for the benefit of everyone. We have planned to reduce the strength to just about 10 people per spot,” he said.“We have appealed to all mosques in Gurugram and Nuh not to allow large gatherings for namaz. The imams of mosques will offer namaz in the presence of limited people, and in shifts. We have to work together to fight the Covid-19,” Rajaka said.Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Sadar), said police teams will visit the areas where footfall to offer prayers is high. “If anyone is found violating Covid-19 norms such as the mask rule and social distancing, then they will be fined,” he said.Last Friday, Muslims offered namaz at 10 locations in the city, with no disruption reported from anywhere under police protection. At the Sector 29 site on last Friday, leaders of the Muslim community had announced that prayers would not be offered in the open spaces from next Friday in view of the rising Covid cases in the district. Gurugram has been witnessing protests over offering of namaz in the open from members of some right-wing outfits since 2018.It is worth mentioning here that currently, there are no designated sites (open public spaces) for offering namaz in Gurugram. The Gurugram administration last year had brought down the number of designated sites from 37 to 20 across the district. However, after the Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced on December 10 that performing namaz cannot be tolerated in open spaces, all sites were cancelled. The administration is yet to earmark new places for prayers.

The committee, which held a two-hour long virtual meeting, finalised the names of candidates for seats mostly held by the party at present. The Congress was expected to release its first list of candidates for 65 to 70 seats after the meeting but held it back due to lack of consensus on a few seats, party leaders familiar with the deliberations said. Punjab has 117 assembly constituencies. The Congress president and former president Rahul Gandhi are likely to have more consultations on the assembly seats on which some leaders had different views before deciding the candidates. “The first list should be out either tomorrow or the day after,” one of the leaders said. Besides Sonia Gandhi, the CEC includes Rahul Gandhi, KC Venugopal, AK Antony, Dr Girija Vyas, Janardan Dwivedi, Ambika Soni, Mukul Wasnik and M Veerappa Moily. Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, campaign committee chairman Sunil Jakhar and Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary also joined the meeting. The screening committee headed by All India Congress Committee general secretary Ajay Maken had recommended the names of candidates for these seats after a series of meeting over two weeks. The Congress is expected to clear the names of Channi, Sidhu, Randhawa, Soni and most of the other ministers in the first list. There are indications that the party may deny ticket to about a dozen out of 80 sitting MLAs owing to strong anti-incumbency against, but most of these seats will be taken up in subsequent meetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-cong-finalises-first-list-likely-to-be-out-today-101642102563968.html
14-01-2022||Other||In 2 years, Gurugram lost highest forest cover in Haryana: Report||In Haryana, the loss of forest cover has been the highest in Gurugram district since 2019, according to the State of Forest Report 2021 released by the Forest Survey of India on Thursday. In the past two years, Gurugram has lost 2.47 square kilometers of forest cover and has 113.71 sq km of green cover at present, which is 9.04% of the total geographical area of the district, the report said. Overall, the state of Haryana has 1603.48 sq km as forest area, which is 3.63% of its total geographical area. In terms of area, the state has gained only 1.04 sq km of forest cover in the past two years. Forest department officials said that the loss of forest cover in Gurugram can primarily be attributed to the different development projects that have been undertaken impacting the forest areas. VS Tanwar, principal chief conservator of forest for Haryana, said, “We are finding out the possible reasons for loss in forest in Gurugram, and I conducted a meeting with senior officials regarding this today (Thursday). Mainly, we have lost maximum forest cover due to road widening, recarpeting of roads and different developmental works. We have also noticed that we are not able to implement our programme of agro-forestry properly, which can also be one of the reasons. We are studying the report in detail and will analyse the reasons further.” According to the report, neighbouring Faridabad district has lost 0.71 sq km of forest cover since 2019 and has 79.23 sq km under forest cover at present, which is 10.69% of the district’s total geographical area. In Gurugram and Faridabad districts, Aravallis are the primary forest cover, which lacks the tag of deemed forest or legal protection and is marred by anthropogenic pressures like roads cutting, construction of farm houses, luxury hotels, among others. Chetan Agarwal, a city-based environment analyst, said, “Virtually all of the forest cover of Gurugram is concentrated in the Aravallis. The forest cover in the district is already so less with just 9% of the total area and with that also if 247 hectares is lost in two years, then it raises questions on extent of legal protection and practical enforcement. Protecting Aravallis by giving them legal status of forests and keeping them under natural conservation zone is the only way to save the remaining forest cover.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-2-years-gurugram-lost-highest-forest-cover-in-haryana-report-101642102502175.html

A programme was organized by Khalsa Inter College on the Naka Gurudwara premises on Thursday to mark the occasion. President of Lucknow Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee and manager of Khalsa Inter College, Rajendra Singh Bagga, highlighted the social importance of Lohri, the festival that marks the harvesting season of crops. “Lohri is a social, not a religious festival. The Punjabi community celebrates it on the eve of Makar Sankranti. People offered puffed rice, munchies and popcorn to the fire god (bonfire),” he said.“The festival of Lohri was earlier called Tilodi. The word is derived from the words Til (sesame seeds) and rhodi (jaggery). On this occasion, people circle around the fire, wishing to spend their life in happiness and peace. After Lohri, the nights become shorter and the days become bigger,” added Bagga.“Due to Covid protocols, Lohri celebrations have been restricted within families and large gatherings were avoided,” said Nirmal Singh, a resident of Alambagh.Gagan Bagga, a resident of Krishnna Nagar said, “Our families celebrated Lohri with a bonfire.

14-01-2022||Other||Bring interrogation rooms under CCTV coverage: HC to Punjab, Haryana & UT||Chandigarh In what could go a long way in curbing human rights violations, the Punjab and Haryana high court has ordered that CCTV cameras have to be installed in all interrogation centres in police stations in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. “...it is not an excuse for us, in India, to take a plea that many other countries are far more advanced than us and, therefore, there can be no comparison with the methods adopted there, in interrogating the accused here. We are the 5th or 6th largest economy in the world and therefore any such plea taken would only seem to be taken as an excuse to not actually adopt contemporary methods of investigation, including interrogation, rather than taking short-cuts by using third degrees methods etc,” the bench of justice Amol Rattan Singh said, issuing directions. The order came on the plea of gangster Kaushal Chaudhary who had alleged that human rights violations are being committed against him in jail. His name had cropped up in the day-light gruesome murder of Youth Akali Dal leader Vicky Middukhera in Mohali. The court also ordered that medical record of every accused and other provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), with regard to rights of an arrested and the one to be taken into custody are met and same be made part of challans to be presented in a particular case. If the same is not complied with, it would be considered as contempt of court, it said. “No court is oblivious to the fact that the police faces a very uphill task in dealing with criminals, especially hardened criminals, and the work done by the police force and any investigating agency is to be highly appreciated, in trying to apprehend criminals and actually apprehending them and bringing them to justice; yet, as per the constitutional scheme and the statutory provisions framed in India, not even the worst criminal can be denied a fair procedure in terms of the (CrPC),” the court said, adding that violation of such procedure, especially leading to the violation of human rights even in the case of the worst criminal, cannot be ignored by any court. WHAT STATES HAVE SAID On the previous hearing, the court had asked the DGPs, whether Supreme Court (SC) directions with regard to CCTV coverage at police stations and jails have been complied with. Haryana had submitted that there is no such provision in the CrPC and Punjab DGP’s response was “conspicuously silent” on that aspect. However, they had submitted that entry and exit points in police stations are under CCTV coverage. The court, however, referred to the SC order passed in Paramvir Singh Saini vs Baljit Singh, and said that any order of the apex court is enforceable throughout the country and is binding on all courts. The court observed that the SC directions also included that cameras be installed at not just entry and exit points and main gates of police stations, but also in all lock-ups, corridors, lobby and reception areas, verandas, out houses, rooms of officials, outside the lock-up rooms, station hall and in front of the police station compound, as also outside washrooms and toilets, the obvious implication is that no part of the police stations would be left uncovered by CCTV surveillance. Now, court has directed DGPs of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh to file affidavits as to whether the directions of the SC have been complied with or not. It reiterated that the HC is duty-bound to ensure enforcement of SC orders and if not implemented, it would amount to contempt of court.

14-01-2022||Other||Gurugram: BSF officer among four held for duping contractors of ₹150 cr||The Gurugram Police on arrested four persons, including a deputy commandant of Border Security Force (BSF), over the last two days for allegedly duping owners of four city-based construction firms of over ₹150 crore. Police said the deputy commandant, Praveen Yadav, was the kingpin of the gang, posed an IPS officer on deputation as a NSG group commander at the Manesar campus, and promised the victims to provide construction contracts for various work on the campus. The NSG is part of the Indian special forces under the ministry of home affairs. Praveen allegedly provided the four owners of construction firms with letters of intent and copies of fake tender contracts and, according to the police, also made them deposit money in an account with a private bank, in the name of “Office of GC (Garrison), Station HQ, NSG, Manesar”, on the pretext that it was earnest money for tender allocation. Police identified the other suspects as Praveen’s wife Mamta Yadav, sister Ritu Raj Yadav and his friend Dinesh Kumar. Police said the contractors have complained against eight people, and they are still verifying facts based on which others will be arrested. Police said they recovered ₹13.81 crore in cash from Praveen, and six high-end cars from the four suspects. KK Rao, Gurugram Police commissioner, said on January 8, they received an online complaint from one Monesh Israni, who alleged that he had been duped by an officer posted at NSG Manesar campus, and who was taking care of construction contracts. Three more contractors later lodged police complaints, claiming that they too were duped of money by a man posing as an officer of the elite counter-terrorism force.“We conducted a preliminary investigation and registered a case. We formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) comprising the crime team of Manesar police station and the economic offence wing, under assistant commissioner of police (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan, and arrested Praveen, the kingpin, from Zirakpur in Punjab on Wednesday night, where he was living in a rented accommodation, and recovered cash from that house. He was posted on deputation as deputy commandant at NSG, Manesar campus, until May 2021,” he said.Police confirmed that Praveen is a deputy commandant of BSF who was on deputation at NSG, Manesar, and misused his ID card to gain access to the campus after his tenure was over.Rao said during questioning, the names of his wife, sister and a middleman were revealed, following which they were also arrested from Manesar on Thursday. ACP Sangwan said Praveen was posted to NSG on deputation for three years till May 2021. “He had lost over ₹60 lakh in share trading and was in heavy debt. He planned to dupe people taking advantage of his access to the NSG campus in Manesar. He had applied for premature retirement but the approval was pending from headquarters,” he said. Sangwan said Praveen was in charge of fencing, solar plants and other construction-related work while he was posted to NSG. “He was introduced to Dinesh Kumar, and later joined hands with him and started offering people fake tenders for construction work at NSG,” he said. Police said Praveen opened a fake private company and made his wife Mamta and sister Ritu Raj Yadav the directors. Police said Ritu works with a private bank in Sector 83 in Manesar and lives on the NSG campus with her husband who is an assistant deputy commandant. The police said they have not given NSG official a clean chit, and that they will also check if he had any involvement in the scam. Ritu helped her brother open the bank accounts, said police. Sangwan said Praveen met contractors, offered them tenders and gave them forged letters of intent and pay orders to start the work. “He duped four contractors of ₹37 crore, ₹65 crore, ₹18 crore and ₹20 crore respectively. All the victims had pay orders, work allotment letters and work permits with NSG letterheads,” he said. The victims became suspicious after he allegedly asked them for more money to offer them construction work at a training centre allegedly located near Hyderabad in Telangana. Police said when they investigated they found that there was no civil work in the pipeline and that Praveen was planning to flee the country. Police said it all started in May last year when Praveen asked the contractors to apply for a tender to construct a chain-link fence. Praveen returned the amount the contractors paid as security deposit, allegedly to gain their trust, and later asked them to pay 60% of the tender amount. “The contractors were asked to bid for the installation of electric poles, PPGI-coated seats and pipes, GST certificate, cancelled cheques--an amount totalling over ₹150 crore,” said Sangwan. Sangwan said Yadav would show his identity card, photograph, designation and visit the campus on multiple occasions with the contractors to win their trust. “He would present his NSG identity card with his photograph and designation as group commander. The contractors believed him as it is not possible to enter the NSG campus without being posted there, and all the security officials knew him,” said Sangwan, adding that he forged NSG seals to issue the allotment letters. All the suspects were produced before a duty magistrate on Thursday. Praveen was remanded to six days in police custody, and the others were remanded to four days in police custody. NSG and BSF could not be reached for comments despite multiple attempts.

14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | SAD failed to act as bridge between Centre and farmers, says Gurdeep Gosha||Two days after joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), former district president of Youth Akali Dal (YAD) Gurdeep Gosha accused Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) of failing to work as a bridge between farmers and union government during the farm agitation against the three agricultural laws.Addressing a press conference, along with BJP district president Pushpinder Singal, at the party’s district headquarters near Clock Tower on Thursday, Gosha said the SAD has only been working to save its skin and has nothing to do with the welfare of the state. When he was with the SAD, Gosha used to slam the BJP-led Union government for the demise of around 700 farmers who were part of the agitation, but on Thursday, he said the farmer unions were responsible for the deaths as “they failed to make proper arrangements for the agitators” on the Delhi borders. Accusing the Congress of trying to divide Sikhs and Hindus in Punjab, Gosha said the leaders of the grand old party and a few farm leaders, who have now jumped into politics, misled the farmers for their vested interests during the agitation. Responding to the allegations of SAD leaders that Gosha left the party with an eye on a BJP ticket from Ludhiana South, Gosha said he “joined the saffron party for development of the state” and tickets will be decided by the party high command.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-sad-failed-to-act-as-bridge-between-centre-and-farmers-says-gurdeep-gosha-101642101721836.html

He calls himself a fakir, an ascetic.Although the fakir may believe himself to be all alone, he confesses he does have a family - or had one, to be precise. “My mother and father are dead… my wife, too, is dead... but my brother is of this world, so too his wife, and their children.”Wearing a lungi and a green jacket pulled upon a green kurta, the turbaned Mr Rajit isn’t certain of his age, but believes himself to be in the late 40s or early 50s.An Odisha native, he grew up in Cuttack, near a Sufi shrine, he recalls. “I was attached to Sufis. I wanted to leave the worldly life, so I became a fakir.” Delhi was a logical destination because “it is the land of Sufis and fakirs”.How different is a fakir’s daily life from that of other people?What is the source of livelihood?What are the anxieties that bother a fakir?Mr Rajit looks thoughtful. He slows down his walk, moves from a shaded part of the lane to a sunnier spot. Looking directly towards the shining sun streaming unevenly across his face through the foliage of a tree, he stays silent as if framing his thoughts. A mild breeze kisses his brows. He opens his mouth, but appears hesitant and shuts it back. After about a minute’s pause, he says: “I do not know.”He then directs the attention towards his shoulder bag. “It has a blanket, a sheet, some clothes and a set of spare chappals.”A man passes by. He seems to be familiar with Mr Rajit. He quietly hands him a hundred rupee note, bows in reverence, and briskly walks away. Gazing down at his feet (he is wearing grey chappals), Mr Rajit says, “I haven’t been to Cuttack since the [first] lockdown began… haven’t met my brother for years.” He never felt the need to connect with his relatives. He has no mobile phone.Mr Rajit now discloses that “I have a daughter”. He lowers his already low voice. “She lives with her naani.”Does he miss the child?“The only person I know is uparwala… my dost.”He walks on. To where? He mumbles: “ To no place… I’m just walking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-journey-is-his-address-101642101143143.html

The HC said the legislature intent of the law demonstrates that the adjudicating officer has to deal with issues of adjudging compensation and award of interest thereupon.The HC was dealing with the petitions in which the developers had raised issues with regard to the adjudicating authority in case of complaints of delay, penalty and deciding on compensation, etc against the developers and powers of the RERA authority and adjudicating officer, established under the RERA law.The second issue was whether the HC can intervene to waive off pre-deposit condition for an appeal before tribunal against the RERA orders, by a developer.The RERA tribunal hears the appeal of a builder against RERA decision only if interest amount decided is deposited with the tribunal by the developer in question.The HC said the compensatory relief under the law has been kept separate and distinct and accrues in the event of occurrence of certain prerequisites. The determination in that case has to be done by the adjudicating officer, under the RERA law. The RERA authority would have the jurisdiction to entertain a complaint seeking refund of the amount and interest on the refund amount as well as for payment of interest on delayed delivery of possession and/or penalty and interest. The jurisdiction in such matters would not be with the adjudicating officer,it said. As of power of the HC to intervene in the cases of pre-deposits, the court said a statutory provision or enactment cannot oust the jurisdiction conferred upon the HC by the Constitution of India. However, as a part of the fulfilment of the statutory object, it is only desirable that the high court exercises judicial restraint while invoking its powers.“The legislature has consciously provided for a mandatory pre-deposit without exceptions in order to ensure due completion of projects to avoid undue appeals,” it said, adding that a developer seeking indulgence of the HC to seek exemption from statutory mandate must establish that the discharge of statutory obligation would be ‘onerous’ and that the court must come to the rescue out of statutory mandate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/refund-penalty-powers-lie-with-rera-not-adjudicating-officer-101642101662096.html

14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Govt school teachers struggle to juggle election duties with online classes||With election duties taking up much of their time and final exams also nearing, teachers in Ludhiana government schools are caught in a race against time for syllabus completion. Of around 11,200 teaching and non-teaching staff in Ludhiana government schools, over 5,000 are deputed on duty for the Punjab assembly elections slated for February 14.According to education department officials, mostly male staff has been deputed on election duties. Their responsibilities include registration of new voters through door-to-door surveys, preparation of electoral rolls among others. Many have been appointed as supervisors and booth-level officers (BLO).A language teacher, who has been appointed a BLO, said, “I remain busy with voter registrations through the day so I hardly get any time to take online classes. Students need us more at this time as their final exams are just about a month-and-a-half away, but it becomes physically and mentally taxing for teachers to juggle the two.”He added that he tries to manage by requesting his students to call him at a particular time during the day. A principal of a government senior secondary school said, “The problem is more this time around due to the suspension of physical classes. Earlier when we had physical classes, we could easily get a substitute teacher. The substitute teacher would merge her classes with that of the teacher on election duty and take a combined class. With online classes, that is difficult as most teachers are struggling to adapt to the new way of teaching, and giving them the additional responsibility of another class will add to their burden.” Meanwhile, a senior official in the education department said that mostly computer teachers along with non-teaching staff have been deputed on election duties. “Teachers are trying their level best to manage both. Mostly, non-teaching staff has been deputed, but computer teachers have been appointed for feeding data of the voters online,” said official.

Rohtak has given jabs to 24,279 children (39%) of the eligible population of 61,726. The state government had directed the health officials to inoculate all kids by January 10 but failed to achieve the target.Karnal civil surgeon Dr Yogesh Sharma said they had carried out vaccination drives by targeting all schools and called only 250 children per school where vaccination was carried out.“Block education officers, SDMs and health workers carried out joint efforts to achieve this target. NGOs and other groups helped in the inoculation process in urban areas. We had sought a list from schools of children who missed the vaccination process. We are hoping to give the first dose to all children in the 15-18 age bracket group in the next ten days,” the Karnal CMO added.Nuh district immunisation officer (DIO) Dr Basant Dubey said there is a vaccine hesitancy among a sizeable section of Mewat residents and another reason is closure of schools.“Earlier, children were not turning up for vaccination. Our asha workers, ANMs, and trained staff have been going to villages to persuade people and doing on the spot online vaccine registration. We have also taken locals in confidence. They have appealed to people to inoculate their children,” he added.“Less number of students’ are coming for vaccination even after their teachers’ appeal but now the situation is changing. Illiteracy and hesitancy among parents is another reason. We want to achieve the maximum target in the 15-18 age group. Had the schools opened, we would have achieved more targets,” he said.“Moreover, we are unable to fill our registration on the COWIN portal for the last three days due to poor internet connectivity in villages,” Dubey added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-achieves-48-5-target-of-vaccination-in-15-18-age-group-101642101001806.html

14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Haryana pvt job quota law takes effect from tomorrow||The Haryana government’s controversial private sector quota law which comes to force from Saturday (January 15) requires domiciled persons to have the family identity card, Parivar Pehchan Patra, for being eligible to register for employment under the law. Requirement of the Parivar Pehchan Patra for domicile persons has been spelled out in the rules framed by the state government under the quota law.The controversial piece of legislation – the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill – passed by the assembly on November 5, 2020 and assented to by the governor on March 2, 2021, provides for 75% reservation in private sector jobs to those having a resident certificate (domicile). The law will be applicable for a period of 10 years.The state government has also relaxed the residency (domicile) requirement from 15 to five years for a person to get a bona fide resident certificate in the state to provide flexibility to the private companies in hiring.The law modelled the lines of a law enacted by the YS Jaganmohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh has been termed ‘regressive’ by the industry. The Andhra law has also been challenged on the question of constitutional validity in the high court.As per the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Rules notified on January 10, local candidates seeking employment under the Act will have to register on a designated portal https://local.hrylabour.gov.in/.“Private sector hiring comes to a halt from January 15, the date of commencement of the Act. Now, every employer in the state will first have to register employees receiving gross monthly salary or wages not more than ₹30,000 on the designated portal within three months of coming into force of the Act. No person will be employed or engaged by any employer till the registration of all such employees is completed on the designated portal,” said an official quoting the law.Exemptions for the industry, corporatesDeputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala had said start-ups and new information technology (IT) companies will be exempted from the provisions of the Act for two years. Officials said this primarily meant that start-ups, companies, firms and establishments which come into being or are set up after January 15 will be exempted for two years from hiring 75% local candidates by the state government.Also, any internal hiring (from within a company or an establishment) is likely to be exempted from the law.In a measure to placate the industry, the state government had reduced the upper limit of gross monthly salary for jobs which will come under the ambit of private sector job quota law. Now, jobs having a gross monthly salary of not more than ₹30,000 will be up for hiring from among local candidates.The Bill passed by the assembly last year had capped the gross monthly wages for jobs available for hiring at ₹50,000. However, after getting feedback from industrial houses and entrepreneurs, the state government decided to reduce the salary cap.The law said employers can seek exemption from hiring local candidates on the grounds that adequate number of local candidates of the desired skill, qualification or proficiency are not available. Any exemption granted under the rules will, however, be valid for maximum one-year period from the date of grant of the exemption.A vacancy unfilled after granting the exemption beyond the period of one year will be treated as new or fresh vacancy unless the exemption is granted subject to training of local candidates to achieve the desired skill, qualification or proficiency.Employers will have to furnish a quarterly report pertaining to local candidates employed and appointed during the previous quarter. Local candidate aggrieved by the action of any employer in violation of any provision of the law can file a complaint through electronic mode on the designated portal.The law also provides for imposition of penalty on the employer ranging from ₹10,000 to ₹two lakh, coupled with a per day penalty in the range of ₹100 to ₹1,000 per day for violations.‘Law may not pass legal scrutiny’Legal experts said the new law is in contravention of the Constitution and will not withstand judicial scrutiny. Former Haryana advocate general Ashok Aggarwal had said domicile can never form the basis of employment.Aggarwal said if public employment cannot be given on the basis of domicile how can private jobs be. The government is not the employer in private sector jobs, he said. He added that only a small percentage of low-end jobs can be reserved and that too for special reasons.While tabling the Bill in assembly, the government had modified its Section 23 to provide the law an overriding effect on any other state law.The same provision provided an overriding effect to the law over any other law when an ordinance was approved by the cabinet. Since the provision had the potential to be repugnant to an Act of the Parliament its wording was changed in the Bill.However, issues raised by the law and legislative secretary during vetting of the proposed law still holds good, legal experts said. The clause providing for preference in jobs to the local candidates domiciled in Haryana, experts said, was in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution pertaining to equality before the law and Article 19 (1)(g) which provides for protection of certain rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.

Along with Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health department, it has set up a team of ticket checkers and other staff at the station premises to carry out rapid test, thermal screening and check double dose certification of passengers. Outgoing and incoming train operations had increased since last two months with rush of passengers seen at the Pune railway station. For better movement of passengers, entry to station premises is made from the front side of the railway station while exit for incoming passengers is from the Raja Bahadur Mill road side exit gate through the newly build foot overbridge (FOB), where PMC health department staff is checking passengers. Pune district administration officials are checking vaccination certificate and giving out universal passes if required. “Passengers coming from outside the state are undergoing thermal checking, their vaccination certificates are checked and PMC officials are doing rapid antigen tests. Also, action is taken against violators of face mask and social distancing norms,” said Suresh Jain, Pune railway station director. However, the five-six PMC health staff deployed are not enough to check the rush of passengers coming from trains arriving from outside the state. Vikrant Shah, a passenger coming from Gujarat, said, “The checking system of passenger coming from outside the state is important to stop the spread of virus.

Unnao rape victim’s mother Asha Singh (from Unnao), Shahjahanpur Aasha worker Poonam Pandey(from Shahjahanpur), who was badly beaten up by the police and Lakhimpur Kheri’s Ritu Singh (from Mohammadi) who was disrobed in the recently concluded panchayat elections in Lakhimpur Kheri are some of the names in the list that Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra released at a video conferencing with media persons on Thursday. Priyanka called the list a “historic initiative” for taking the party’s announcement of giving 40 percent tickets to women to the ground and said her party was in favour of going for a positive campaign only. “Efforts have been made to field candidates who have been struggling and fighting for a cause and who can work to bring about a new way of politics. We will not go for any negative campaign. We will go for positive campaigns only,” she said. Lucknow’s Sadaf Jafar, who was kicked in the stomach during the anti-CAA protests in the state capital and Adivasi (tribal) activist from Umbha Ram Raj Gond (from Obra), who fought for the cause of victims of the massacre claiming 13 lives in Sonebhadra are also among the Congress candidates, besides journalist Nida Ahmad (from Sambhal) and Tamil cinema actress Archana Gautam from (Hastinapur SC). Jafar has been fielded from Lucknow central seat. Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Aradhana Mishra ‘Mona’ (from Rampur Khas, Pratapgarh), former union minister Salman Khurshid’s wife and former MLA Louise Khursheed (from Farrukhabad), former CLP leader Pradeep Mathur (from Mathura), former Bareilly mayor Supriya Aron (from Bareilly, who was in news for her comments of stampede in Bareilly marathon are also there in the list. Other women given Congress ticket include Urmila Sonkar Khabri, a retired PCS officer who has been fielded from Orai, Pratima Pal an NSUI leader who will contest from Sirsaganj, Firozabad, Santosh Bharati a Valmiki given ticket from general seat, Pankhuri Pathak, a vocal social media activist who has been given a ticket from NOIDA and Vinita Shakya, who defeated the SP candidate for district panchayat member’s post in Mainpuri. A documentary depicting the fight of victims in Unnao rape case and other major incidents was played on the occasion to describe how the Congress candidates had been fighting for justice and why they had been picked as candidates. “We have a mixed list. We are hopeful of bringing about a new way of politics now,” Priyanka said. “The Congress list is giving a message of giving the victims power to fight. They should come forward and take power in their hands,” she said. Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu (from Tamkuhi Raj), Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh (Rudrapur Deoria) and former MP PL Punia’s son Tanuj Punia (from Zaidpur SC) seat of Barabanki also find a place in the first list of candidates. Asked whether winnability was a criterion for tickets, Priyanka said, “We have seen the ability of winning and fighting.” She said those who fought and served the society and who fought the election in the past had also been made party candidates. She said the Congress had brought the issue of women empowerment to the fore ahead of the 2022 polls. “We have worked very hard and brought our party to centre-stage. We will fight with all our might. The UP government is dictatorial today. We want to bring about a new way of politics.” About the ‘aya ram gaya ram’ phenomenon with leaders of different political parties switching over loyalties ahead of the polls, she said “We feel bad when our colleagues go.” On whether or not finding women candidates was difficult, Priyanka said “We received a lot of applications. We had a lot of women who were doing good work and have never been given opportunity. We are doing something new.” On the Congress campaigns she said “We will be embarking on door to door campaigns. We will be doing Facebook live, hold competitions online and do Google hangouts etc.” Asked if the Congress was working with an objective that no government would be formed without the party in 2022 polls she said “Yes, we have this objective. Our objective is also to strengthen the Congress.” “Why are they not talking about unemployed youth? Why the victimized women are not an issue? We will continue with other issues and bring them to centre-stage. These include development and social empowerment as well,” she said. On whether or not she would contest 2022 assembly elections she parried a direct reply and said, “I will continue my efforts in Uttar Pradesh. I will continue to work after this election. If the Congress wants me to go elsewhere, I will do that too in between as I have done in the past.” 
14-01-2022||Pune||Report if found Covid positive after self-kit test: PMC||Pune: As Covid cases are on the rise and many citizens are using rapid antigen test (RAT) kits at home, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health department plans to collect Covid positive data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant chief, PMC health department, said the department urges residents to contact their nearest ward offices if they test positive. “Residents using these kits should contact their nearest ward offices if they test positive. FDA will also provide us with the details of citizens who have bought these test kits. It is crucial that the virus infected approach us so that proper care and treatment is provided to them to manage Covid situation,” said Dr Wavare. As per PMC health department, 19,868 samples were collected by private, PMC-run Covid case centres for RTPCR and RAT test on Thursday. State additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas has written to divisional commissioners and collectors on Wednesday to ensure labs update positive results via RAT on the district portal. “Citizens testing themselves using home kits have also been asked to declare and upload positive results to ensure adequate monitoring by local authorities during the home isolation period,” said Dr Vyas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/report-if-found-covid-positive-after-self-kit-test-pmc-101642099741664.html

The meeting, held via video conferencing and attended by local MLA Sunil Tingre, PMC authorities and Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary Action Committee members also discussed various initiatives to restore the park along with protecting the natural area where birds lay their eggs by putting nets along it. According to Tingre, the meeting focused on the illegal dumping of debris at the sanctuary which is a hindrance to its beauty as well as to the survival of the bird species. “The debris will be removed by the end of this month. Fence will also be put around to restrict human entry,” said Tingre, adding that patrolling will be carried out in the area of eight hectares to curb illegal activities. “People play cards, discard plastic bottles and cut trees without the permission of authorities,” Tingre said. The members of action committee and locals have demanded that it is crucial to safeguard the sanctuary for its beauty and the natural habitat of rare species. “The municipal commissioner has offered PMC’s services to clean the debris, restore the flow of nallah,” said Thackeray. On the issue of illegal entry, the minister has ordered fencing and installing CCTVs. “I’ve requested him to ring fence it and have CCTVs’ put to ensure there’s no further encroachment,” said Thackeray. Once popular among birdwatchers within and outside Pune as the ‘Yerawada Birding Point,’ the spot, in its heydays, used to feature different species of birds including ruddy shelduck, red wattled lapwings and black headed ibis. However, due to massive garbage dumping and polluted river water, it is no longer frequented in large numbers by birds or bird watchers. “Numerous complaints were filed for the debris dumped and illegal activities prevailing in the sanctuary. After years of complaints, finally, minister Aaditya Thackeray along with MLA Sunil Tingre have taken action for the same,” said Meghna Baphna, a volunteer at Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary Action Committee, who was part of the meeting with Thackeray. Sameer Nikam, environmentalist and a volunteer at Salim Ali Pakshi Bachao Samiti said, “In reality, the dumping is more than 30-35 ft high. We have lodged complaints several times, either individually or through our organisation but no action has been taken. This is the first time there has been a meeting of this sort when our team reached out to Aditya Thackeray.” There has been various litigation on the three plots that exist and a status quo order has been issued by the high court for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/remove-illegally-dumped-debris-in-salim-ali-bird-sanctuary-by-jan-31-aaditya-thackeray-tells-pmc-101642099380655.html
14-01-2022||Mumbai||Poisar River rejuvenation plan finally set to see the light of day||Mumbai After a long hiatus, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is once again taking steps to start the rejuvenation of the Poisar River.The civic body has finalised the Poisar River rejuvenation plan and will table the proposal for approval in the civic standing committee scheduled to be held on Friday. Once approved, the BMC will issue work orders on an immediate basis.The need for rejuvenation of the Poisar River, which is one of the four rivers in Mumbai city, was first floated after the 2005 floods. Despite several discussions, the project never really took off.The move comes after the civic body last year initiated the Mithi River and Dahisar River rejuvenation project in November.P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), said that the primary objective behind this project is to control and minimise untreated waste discarded into the river. “We will be creating a dedicated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) on the river bank. These bridge-like structures will have membrane-based reactors which are more efficient than usual STPs,” said Velrasu.The Poisar River is 11.15 kilometres long and around 10 metres wide. The river, which originates from Sanjay Gandhi National Park, flows into the Arabian Sea via the Marve Creek in the western suburbs. Over the years, the Poisar River turned into an urban stream with toxic and contaminated water due to waste from nullahs, drains, buffalo stables and residential sewage being discharged into the water body.According to Velrasu, Poisar River water can be improved to bathing quality by controlling the disposal of pollutants.He said that a service road will be constructed on the river bank to provide access for regular maintenance. “In addition to installing STPs on the river, we will also ensure that the river water is cleaned regularly. Besides, solid waste accumulated on the surface of the water will also be removed manually,” he said.Velrasu further said that the Poisar project is more challenging in comparison with the ongoing Dahisar and Mithi River rejuvenation. “There are many encroachments on the banks of this river. These people may resist the project and BMC may have to give them rehabilitation which is a challenge,” he added.The BMC had in 2020 floated tender for the project and the cost was pegged at ₹752 crore. However, due to the pandemic, the prebid meeting was postponed 13 times and after two years, the cost for this project has nearly doubled to ₹1,482 crore.However, Velrasu said that cost for construction is around ₹1,000 crore, excluding taxes.In its proposal, the BMC said that the contractor will be given the responsibility for the maintenance of the river for seven years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/poisar-river-rejuvenation-plan-finally-set-to-see-the-light-of-day-101642099321397.html
14-01-2022||Mumbai||Shiv Sena plans to contest UP polls, seeks Tikait’s support||Mumbai Shiv Sena on Thursday reached out to prominent farmers’ leader Rakesh Tikait to test the pulse of the ryots as it plans to contest upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray spoke to Tikait as Sena leader Sanjay Raut met the farmers’ leader at Muzaffarnagar to seek the “blessings” of the farmers in its fight in the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls.The Shiv Sena, which is planning to field candidates on around 50 to 100 seats in Uttar Pradesh, is banking on farmers’ support. Raut, who is on a tour of New Delhi and UP to mobilise the party workers and chalk out its plan, said that it will contest elections at Mathura, Varanasi and against UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath in Ayodhya. Despite its thin presence in UP, Raut said that the Sena will win seats in the upcoming election, as a “change of power” is expected in the largest state in the country.Calling the meeting “apolitical”, Raut said that they discussed the farmers’ issues. Thackeray in his phone conversation with Tikait spoke about the Maharashtra government’s policies to support the farmers. Thackeray also invited Tikait to visit Maharashtra, Raut said.“Both Uddhav ji and Rakesh Tikait had a long conversation and both the leaders discussed farmers’ issues. We will never ask Tikait ji to enter electoral politics. But this country’s politics cannot function without the support of the farmers. Farmers decide who sit on the throne, and history has shown that once people come to power, they forget the farmers, but two months after coming to power, Uddhav Ji wiped out the loans of the farmers,” Raut said in a press conference along with Tikait.Meanwhile, the farmers’ leaders said that he would visit Maharashtra soon. “He invited me to Maharashtra and said that we will discuss Maharashtra’s policies for agriculture and farmers. We will see their policy and spread it elsewhere in the country. We are not connected to politics. It is a political party’s job to contest an election. Maharashtra government has always supported the farmers’ movement in Delhi. Whenever there was a bandh announced, it was followed in Maharashtra,” said Tikait.Sena’s Rajya Sabha MP added that the party will not enter into an alliance with any political party in UP. The Sena leader said that it will win seats in UP in the upcoming election, “We are confident that we will have a representation in the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly.” At the legislative assembly level in Uttar Pradesh, apart from getting one MLA elected in 1991, all of Sena’s previous attempts have drawn a blank.The party will field a candidate in Ayodhya opposite CM Adityanath. “We are not here to contest against any one person alone. We are here to do our brand of politics and contest elections. Does it say in the Constitution that we cannot contest against some particular person? Yes, we will contest election in Ayodhya,” said Raut when asked if Sena will field a candidate against the UP CM Yogi Adityanath, who could contest from Ayodhya instead of Gorakhpur seat. The Shiv Sena is also expected to take up the Hindutva agenda in its campaign in Uttar Pradesh. Raut said that the Ram temple in Ayodhya is built after the court’s verdict and no political party can take its credit. “If they take the credit, Shiv Sena has a major role in it... We have never abandoned Hindutva. Now even Rahul Gandhi speaks of Hindus and Hindutvawadis,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-plans-to-contest-up-polls-seeks-tikait-s-support-101642099201304.html
14-01-2022||Pune||Online video proctoring to be used for first time in SPPU semester exam||Pune: The Savitribai Phule Pune University’s (SPPU) examination and evaluation department has started preparations to hold first semester exams scheduled next month. Post Covid outbreak, SPPU has been holding semester exams online since March 2020. After addressing the issues faced in the online format, the varsity has decided to raise the ‘difficulty level’ of questions for students taking part in the forthcoming semester. “We are planning to make the proctored method of monitoring students’ movement while appearing for online exams stricter, as video proctoring will be used in this semester. But it requires huge space for storing the recorded video data and if all things go well, then it will be used for first time in this semester exams,” said Mahesh Kakade, head, SPPU examination and evaluation department. “As we chose the online format for exams after the pandemic struck, there was less time to prepare question sets and we kept it relatively easy to crack. Now, with two years of conducting online exams with multiple-choice questions (MCQ) method, we will increase the difficulty level of paper sets for the forthcoming exams,” said Kakade. “There are faculty, deans, paper setters, moderators and other people involved in this process. This time it would be the same MCQ method examinations with 50 marks and a total of 60 questions. The timing would be of one hour and for disabled students it would be 20 minutes extra. The questions will be more difficult for this semester’s exam and students should be prepared for it,” he said. Around 6.15 lakh students from various streams will appear for the exams from more than 350 affiliated colleges to SPPU from Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar district. With 284 courses in post-graduate and undergraduate, there are 6,862 subjects. For 1,600 subjects there are two mediums of appearing for the exams with English and Marathi. The university examination department had used proctored method to conduct exams online. Through this proctored method students can appear for exams using smartphones, tablet, laptop or desktop computers and even from internet cyber cafes. In this method when a student login to give the exam through a smartphone, laptop or tablet, all the minute movements of students are captured and monitored by the system. Student found cheating would be given three warnings, and would be disqualified for committing the error again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/online-video-proctoring-to-be-used-for-first-time-in-sppu-semester-exam-101642099081556.html
14-01-2022||Mumbai||Maharashtra seeks 9 million jabs, urges Centre to make vaccination mandatory||Mumbai: Maharashtra on Thursday urged the Centre to allot additional stock of 9 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to end the shortage of jabs. The state government also demanded that inoculation be made mandatory for all to boost the vaccination rate.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray did not attend the meeting due to health issues. State Health Minister Rajesh Tope submitted the list of demands to the central government during the Covid-19 review meeting held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with chief ministers of 30 states on Thursday.Modi chaired the Covid-19 review meeting in the wake of the massive uptick in cases across the country.“We have demanded an additional supply of 4 million Covaxin shots and 5 million doses of Covishield. Maharashtra is facing a shortage of jabs since vaccination drive for the 15-18 age group and booster doses for eligible categories began recently,” Tope said after the meeting.The state health minister further said that the government has urged the Centre to make vaccination mandatory for all. “There is vaccine hesitancy among the people either due to misconceptions or resistance to the jab causing a drop in the rate of vaccination. We have requested the Centre to make the vaccination mandatory,” Tope added.Further, Maharashtra also asked the Centre to bring in a mechanism to keep a tab on the rapid antigen tests done at homes by making it mandatory for pharmacies to keep a record of sales. “Due to the absence of any record of at-home Covid-19 tests, the actual number of cases go unaccounted,” Tope said, adding that the Centre should intervene to ensure strict monitoring of the infected people.“In Maharashtra, we have started monitoring self-tests done at home by directing health officers to be in touch with pharmacies,” he added.Tope further said that of the 4,000 samples sent for the genome sequencing, 2,700 or 70 percent tested positive for the Delta variant, while the remaining were of Omicron.He said that the Centre has been informed about the large scale prevalence of the Delta variant among the 2,50,000 active cases in the state.

A spot visit found no checking mechanism in place for visitors despite the official order amidst rising number of Covid cases in the city. Citizens are found not wearing mask, maintaining social distancing or carrying fully vaccinated certificate and allowed entry by guards. Additional commissioner Ravindra Binawade said that the circular has been issued to prevent overcrowding of the civic main building, ward and zonal offices. “We had asked all departments to initiate correspondence via email with citizens to avoid coming into direct contact with the people due to the rising Covid infections. The heads of departments have been instructed to issue entry passes to only the most important visitors to the main building,” he said. According to the senior administrative officials posted at the building, the PMC office sees an average of 200 to 300 citizens on a daily basis. Social activist Rohit Pagare said, “PMC staff are frontline workers and there must be necessary precautionary measures in place to prevent the spread of Covid amongst the civic employees and public,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/visitors-flout-covid-curbs-at-pmc-main-building-101642098781297.html
14-01-2022||Delhi||28,867 Covid-19 cases: Delhi sees highest ever single-day tally||Delhi registered 28,867 cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, the city’s biggest ever single-day tally, as the third national wave of the pandemic -- the fifth wave in Delhi -- eclipsed a record set 269 days ago, even while a relatively small number of patients continue to occupy hospital beds.Before this, the Capital’s highest one-day case spike was on April 20 last year, when the city registered 28,395 infections -- the peak of the devastating fourth wave.The data showed that Thursday’s case rise came on the back of nearly 99,000 tests, of which 29.21% returned positive results, an increase from 26.2% positive samples a day earlier. This number, known as test positivity rate, is at its highest since May 3 last year, when it touched 29.5%.The city also added 31 deaths of the infection, showed Thursday’s state government numbers, fewer than the 40 fatalities recorded the previous day, and still far lower than the numbers recorded during the heights of the fourth surge of infections between April and May last year.For instance, on April 20 last year, as the fourth wave hit its crescendo, the infection claimed 277 lives. In fact, the daily death toll, even at its highest during the fifth wave so far (40 on Wednesday), has been lower than that during the peak of infections during the third wave of infections in November 2020. On November 11 that year, Delhi added 8,593 Covid-19 cases, which was the highest daily count at that point, but logged 85 deaths.This is largely because the Omicron variant of the coronavirus (that is responsible for a majority of the infections during Delhi’s ongoing wave), is far less virulent than previous iterations of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. Most patients infected by the Omicron variant develop milder symptoms, which do not necessitate hospitalisation or medical oxygen support. As a result, Delhi’s hospital admission numbers have remained comparatively low during the ongoing wave of the infection, with just over 2,400 patients occupying beds in the city’s facilities, leaving over 13,000 vacant.In all, over 94,000 people in the city are currently battling Covid-19.Health department data showed that 2,424 Covid-19 patients in Delhi were hospitalised as on Thursday, up marginally from 2,363 the previous day, and 2,209 on Tuesday.Further, of those hospitalised with Covid-19 in Delhi currently, 768 patients were on oxygen support, 628 were in intensive care, and 98 were on ventilators.A recent analyses by the Delhi government has also shown that a majority of those who have died of the infection over the past or so have been unvaccinated, or had other serious illnesses.Only eight of the 97 Covid-29 patients who died in Delhi’s hospitals between January 9 and 12 were fully vaccinated, and only 19 had got one jab of the vaccine, according to the latest analysis. It mirrored similar findings from earlier in the month – of the 46 who died between January 5 and 9, 76% were unvaccinated.Dr KK Talwar, former head of the Medical Council of India, who was also heading the Punjab government’s expert group on Covid-19 during the second wave, said, “The next two weeks will be crucial. If you follow the trends of South Africa, it seems like after cases and hospitalisations stabilise, the infections should also start falling. But we will have to see how trends behave in our cities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/28867-covid-19-cases-delhi-sees-highest-ever-single-day-tally-101642098613783.html
14-01-2022||Mumbai||Mumbai reports 13,702 fresh cases, test positivity rate dips marginally||MUMBAI Mumbai’s Test Positivity Rate (TPR) dipped further on Thursday as the city recorded 13,702 fresh infections in the past 24 hours taking the total case tally to 969,989 and six deaths taking the total death toll to 16,426.The BMC conducted 63,031 tests on Wednesday and the TPR stood at 21.73%. Earlier this week, the TPR was around 24.3% on January 12 (Wednesday); 18.75% on January 11 (Tuesday); and 23% on January 10 (Monday). Besides this, the bed occupancy also recorded a marginal fall on Thursday with 17.3% out of the total 36,979 beds staying occupied in Mumbai. Experts however maintained that it’s too early to conclude whether the ongoing third wave has started to ebb in Mumbai.Dr Rahul Pandit from the national and state Covid-19 task force said that even if the daily case figures are lower than what they were last week, it is too early to make any concrete conclusion on the overall trend. “If we see the numbers closely, one can say that the figures are not yet consistent and they are fluctuating. If today, less number of cases are reported then there are chances that tomorrow, the tally may increase slightly and the day after, it may again fall. We have already seen this trend before. We need to wait for a few more weeks and then compare the weekly trends in order to understand the overall picture and arrive at a conclusion,” said Dr Pandit.Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state Covid-19 task force, however said that there are still thousands of unreported cases in the city which is a matter of concern. “Like we know now that people have started taking tests on their own and we will not be able to know the bigger picture unless we get clarity on the number of self-tests that the citizens are taking daily in the city. Even if the cases are going down, we need to keep this factor in mind that we must stay prepared at least for the next one month. At present, the focus should be on systemic treatment of symptomatic cases over case numbers because the delta variant is still here and many of the severe symptoms are being caused because of it,” said Dr Joshi.Dr Vasant Nagvekar from Global Hospital, who is also a member of the state taskforce, said that it could be possible that by the middle of February, the number of cases may start receding. “We have now started to see fewer patients seeking treatment at the family physician level which is a good signal and it is possible that the TPR may start declining from the end of this month,” said Dr Nagvekar.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner and in-charge of public health, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said that the civic body collected approximate data of self-testing kits sold in the last 24 hours and analysed the reports. “Many buyers were tracked by the BMC war rooms and it was revealed that nearly one lakh kits were sold in the past 24 hours out of which only 1 or 2% of patients were positive,” said Kakani. Earlier on Wednesday, Kakani had said that the civic body will be writing to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asking them to urge all chemist shops to provide data of patients who buy Covid-19 self-testing kits from them. “We are working towards getting the day-to-day data of all the patients who are taking Covid-19 self-tests in every 24 hours. We will be adding these figures in the daily case report, which will also give us clarity about the ongoing situation,” said Kakani. He said that so far the situation in Mumbai is much better than the BMC had predicted it to be last week. “Considering the figures that we saw at the end of last week, we are in a much better position and the bed occupancy level also hasn’t risen very much. Still, less than 20% of the beds are occupied and many of the occupants are also high-risk contacts and mildly symptomatic patients. At the same time, testing is happening at maximum capacity and the civic body is also monitoring all pathological laboratories to submit reports within 24 hours,” said Kakani.Out of the total patients that were reported on Thursday, 84% are asymptomatic and at present, there are 95,123 active cases in the city and the recovery rate of Mumbai is 88%.Maharashtra continued to record a high number of Covid-19 cases at 46,406 infections on Thursday.The state logged in a positivity rate of 21.38 per cent as 46,406 citizens tested positive of the total 2,16,970 tests conducted. On Wednesday, the state had recorded 46,723 cases.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said that the situation seems to be stabilising. “Contrary to the initial expectations of exponential growth in the transmission numbers, we are seeing that we are inching towards a peak. We expect the virus to peak in a week or two and even the decline will be equally sharp,” said Dr Awate.No Omicron cases were reported in the state||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-reports-13-702-fresh-cases-test-positivity-rate-dips-marginally-101642098612375.html
14-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi: In 25 days, containment zones in city rose from 205 to 24,000||The number of Covid-19 red zones sealed by the city’s district administrations has jumped from just over 200 on December 20 to nearly 24,000 in fewer than 25 days, showed data from the state government, as authorities work to cut off channels of spread between infected and uninfected residents in Delhi.The spurt in the number of such sealed areas, known as containment zones, has come amid a spiralling fifth wave of infections for the city, which has seen the daily case load hit record levels in Delhi, pushed by the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus.On December 20, Delhi reported a test positivity rate of 0.20%, with 531 active cases in the city. On Thursday, over 29% of all collected samples returned positive results, with 94,160 patients battling Covid-19.
14-01-2022||Other||GMDA draws up plan to improve living standards in Gurugram||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has issued a list of 42 key performance indicators under 11 themes, keeping which as base, the authority will work on how better services can be provided to the residents of the city, said officials on Thursday. Sudhir Rajpal, chief executive officer of GMDA, said, “The main idea is to improve the services and facilities provided by the authority and live up to the expectations of the citizens of Gurugram. We have formed these indices after consultations and interactions with the residents as to what all changes are most critical for them. For every parameter, we will conduct a baseline survey to understand where we stand and then work towards achieving the desired level.” The GMDA chief said that by the end of this month, an agency will be hired to conduct the baseline survey, but no timeline has been set by when the survey will be completed. The 11 different themes include mobility, water supply and sewage, drainage, power and clean energy, urban environment, waste management, affordable housing, affordable health, educational and skill development, safety and emergency services, and government responsiveness. An official document released by the authority in this regard states, “In order to develop common framework for Gurugram Metropolitan Area to assess existing status and their pathway towards providing a better quality of life to the citizen, GMDA has developed the standards of livability through a consultative mechanism for Gurugram Metropolitan Area (GMA) that can form the basis for development of the plans and resource allocations.” Under the parameter of mobility, for example, authorities will ensure that 38% of the vehicles on the road are public transport to give more people access to transport facilities. Under the parameter of water, the authority will track key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the city’s liveability like percentage of households that receive up to 135 litres of clean water per person, percentage of sewerage treated to levels set by the Central Pollution Control Board, percentage of properties connected to sewerage, and percentage utilization of tertiary treated wastewater. Under the parameter of ‘urban environment’, the KPIs include percentage of sectors covered by functioning air quality monitors reporting PM2.5 and PM10 air quality publicly, number of annual days of ‘good’ air quality, per capita availability of green spaces within the city, among others. For affordable health, the authority will focus on number of hospital beds available per 10,000 residents and percentage of affordable hospital beds in the city. The authority is aiming to ensure availability of 25 beds per 10,000 population. “With these parameters, the authority has set a living standard for people of Gurugram, the basic necessities that must be available in the metropolitan area. Based on these parameters, plans for different departments will be published and that will be used as a framework for future development work. The plans will be followed in a phase-wise manner and the departments will have their own timelines for achieving the targets,” said Bhuvnesh Kumar, chief town planner, GMDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gmda-draws-up-plan-to-improve-living-standards-in-gurugram-101642098601230.html
14-01-2022||Delhi||Home isolation for at-risk groups only after checks: Delhi govt||With senior citizens and people with co-morbidities constituting most of the Covid-19 deaths in the past few days, the Delhi health department has directed all district officials to ensure home isolation for vulnerable patients is allowed only after a thorough medical examination. On Thursday, HT reported that there were 97 Covid deaths reported in the national capital between January 9 and January 12, out of which 71 were found to be above 40 years of age and had some kind of co-morbidities. A senior health department official said that looking at the fatalities over the last few days, district officials have been asked to ensure that the vulnerable sections that test positive for Covid-19 are put in the government’s “priority list” and home isolation for these patients is allowed only after a complete medical examination. “We have been stressing that senior citizens, co-morbid patients, pregnant women and unvaccinated people, are at risk and while the Omicron symptoms are usually mild and do not require hospitalisation in a healthy, below 60-year-old adult, these sections are at risk. We have asked our teams at the district level to be extra vigilant of cases in this category,” said the official. A district official said that once a patient tests positive and the information is received by their office, a team visits the patient to assess their health status. Their vitals, existing medical conditions and medication history are assessed and accordingly, the patient is given a go-ahead to continue home isolation or advised to be shifted to a hospital or a Covid care centre. During the home isolation period, officials said government teams routinely monitor the health of the patient and, if needed, they are also provided with phone consultations with doctors. Data shared earlier by the government also showed this segment being at risk. The Delhi government said that of the 46 patients who died due to Covid-19 in the city between January 5 and 9, 21 were admitted for other reasons before they were detected as infected with coronavirus. In all, 34 patients had comorbid conditions known to raise the risk of severe Covid-19, and 23 (50%) of the deaths were recorded within a day of the patients being admitted, suggesting their condition was already critical when they received medical attention.The health department had also issued a special advisory on Tuesday, directing all government and private Covid hospitals to ensure that all patients with co-morbidities are duly attended to by specialists and they are treated with extra care. 
14-01-2022||Delhi||‘Fully vaccinated’ label brings respite for under-fire Sarojini Nagar market||New Delhi: The New Delhi district administration issued a fully vaccinated market certificate to all four market associations in Sarojini Nagar on Thursday, officials said. The document certifies that all the eligible traders and helpers in the commercial area have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19. The sub-divisional magistrate of Vasant Vihar, Ankur Prakash, handed over the certificates on behalf of the New Delhi district administration on Thursday.The popular South Delhi market was recently embroiled in a controversy when pictures of crowds violating social distancing norms at the market went viral on social media.Ashok Randhawa, who heads the Mini Market Traders’ Association (one of the four constituent market associations), said that all shopkeepers submitted vaccination proof of their workers and traders over the last week. “We submitted the list of workers and proofs to the district administration over the last week. Now, only the approved, vaccinated staff will be allowed to work in shops and checking will be carried out at entry points,” Randhawa said.The Sarojini Nagar market comprises the main market (200 shops), Babu Market (120 shops), Sarojini Nagar Mini Market (32 shops), Thareja street vendors (104 outlets) and other professionals. Randhawa added that the four shops in the main market and one shop in Babu Market, which were sealed on Tuesday due to violation of Covid norms and social distancing were reopened on Thursday.Ashok Kalra, general secretary of the Main Sarojini Nagar Market Association, confirmed that all staff members in the 200 shops of the main market were doubly vaccinated. “We submitted the undertaking regarding vaccination status to the district administration, and held a special camp last week for people who had still not received their second shot. We believe the move will help make the market safer for customers,” Kalra said. The market associations have also asked the respective shops to display the fully vaccinated certification. Kalra added that while the bigger shops in the main market have five workers besides the traders, smaller shops have two helpers each. “We will deploy some staff members to ensure everyone wears masks,” Randhawa added.Last month, Delhi high court had come down heavily on the authorities for allowing crowding at the popular South Delhi market. The state of affairs, be it Covid or non-Covid, is “frightening” as people are “flowing like a river” which could lead to stampede and the deaths of hundreds, the Delhi high court had said on December 24,2021, while taking note of overcrowding in Sarojini Nagar market. It also asked the Delhi Police and Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to work out a movement plan for the public and asked the NDMC and other authorities to ensure there is no overcrowding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fully-vaccinated-label-brings-respite-for-under-fire-sarojini-nagar-market-101642097941521.html
14-01-2022||Delhi||Water supply to be normal as Yamuna ammonia levels drop||The levels of industrial pollutants and ammonia have started receding in the Yamuna river after reaching five times the maximum treatable limit during the day, Delhi Jal Board (DJB) said Thursday.Till late Thursday evening, the ammonia level recorded at Wazirabad pond was one part per million (ppm), affecting 10% of operations of the water treatment plant.“The situation is getting better. The ammonia level was 5ppm and we have been observing a reverse trend, leading to the recovery of operations at Wazirabad, Chandrawal, and Okhla water treatment plants. The plants are operating at 90% level and if the same trend continues, the water supply will be restored to normal by Friday morning,” the DJB spokesperson said.Throughout Thursday, 50% of operations of the water treatment plants were observed, he said.In an advisory issued Wednesday evening, DJB had said that due to continuous discharge of a high level of pollutants from Haryana, the ammonia level in the Yamuna river at the Wazirabad barrage had increased and water production had been curtailed.On Thursday, water supply was impacted in several areas including Civil Lines, Kamla Nagar, Karol Bagh, Kalkaji, Model Town, and several south Delhi localities.Chetan Sharma, a resident of GK1 in south Delhi, said that the area witnessed disruption in the water supply on Thursday. “The water supply was very erratic. We have been hearing about the rising ammonia levels affecting the water supply for so many years. This issue is not heard of in other major cities. It is high time we expedite the technological upgrade of the water treatment plants,” he added.DJB currently has the capacity to treat ammonia levels up to 0.9ppm, but a further rise leads to the generation of toxic Chloramine compounds, DJB officials said.Manmohan Jha, a resident of the Shakkarpur area, said that the water supply in their locality was curtailed on both Wednesday and Thursday. “We did not get any water supply on two consecutive days and no prior warning was issued. How do we manage water in such a situation?” Jha asked.Residents of Uttam Nagar, Kalkaji, Matiala, and Paharganj made similar complaints.Out of the total 935 MGD [million gallons per day] of Delhi’s daily water supply-- over 230MGD is supplied by Chandrawal and Wazirabad plants--both of which draw water from the Wazirabad pond, which is fed by the Yamuna river.While DJB has announced that it will install advanced ozonation plants at the water treatment facilities to increase the ammonia treatment capacity up to 4ppm, the project is still a work in progress.An interstate dispute, the rise in ammonia and industrial pollutant levels in Yamuna water coming from Haryana has been a persistent problem in the Capital, with the matter being taken to the apex court annually. While DJB has alleged that the source of pollution lies upstream in Panipat industrial area, Haryana has denied these allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ammonia-levels-start-receding-in-yamuna-after-affecting-water-supply-in-parts-of-delhi-101642097705208.html
14-01-2022||Delhi||Dense fog disrupts 100 flights, Delhi shivers as minimum temperature drops||Around 100 flights were delayed as dense fog engulfed the runways at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport, dropping visibility to around 50-100 metres between 4.30am and 9.30am on Thursday. Officials, however, said no flights were cancelled or diverted during the day.On Thursday, the minimum temperature in the Capital also dropped to 5.8 degrees Celsius (°C) – two degrees below normal -- from 8.2°C on Wednesday. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast the minimum temperature to hover around 6°C for the next two days, amid a likelihood of moderate to dense fog.The IMD classifies fog as ‘shallow’ when visibility is between 500 and 1000 metres, ‘moderate’ when it is between 200 and 500 metres and ‘dense’ when it drops below 200 metres.IMD scientist RK Jenamani said this was the first dense fog spell of the season witnessed at Safdarjung, with visibility remaining below 200 metres between 7am and 9.30am. At Palam, the impact lasted for around five hours, he said. “CAT-III procedures (precision steps to help flights land) were initiated at the Delhi airport as visibility ranged between 50 and 100 metres since 4.30am. There was a slight improvement only after 9.30am,” he said, adding that low wind speed and sufficient moisture in the air were aiding fog formation.“There is a good chance we see dense fog over the next two days too. This is the first such spell where we are regularly seeing moderate to dense fog,” he said.An airport official said that despite low visibility, flight operations remained smooth. “Like Tuesday’s spell, low visibility procedures were in place, but no diversions or cancellations were reported on account of the adverse weather. Slight delays were recorded till the afternoon,” the official said.Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality has deteriorated in the last 24 hours, touching the ‘very poor’ category on Thursday. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily 4pm bulletin, Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) was 321, up from Wednesday’s 191 (moderate).The Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar) has predicted further deterioration in air quality, owing to low temperatures and high moisture, in the next three days.“Wind speed has dropped and there is enough moisture in the air to trap pollutants. Low temperatures are also making it difficult for pollutants to disperse...The air quality will deteriorate further in the next few days, but is expected to remain within the ‘very poor’ range,” said Gufran Beig, founder project director, Safar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dense-fog-disrupts-100-flights-delhi-shivers-as-minimum-temperature-drops-101642097521119.html
14-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi’s green cover up over 5%, but forest area dips marginally||The Capital recorded an increase in its green cover by 17.6sqkm--with 342sqkm (23.06%) of Delhi’s total geographical area of 1,483sqkm now under green cover--according to India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2021.The report, released on Thursday by Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav, showed while Delhi recorded a slight decrease of 0.44sqkm in its forest cover, it recorded an increase of 18sqkm in total tree cover – a result the forest department said is due to large-scale plantation drives.A senior official of the forest department said despite a drop in the total amount of forest cover, Delhi still had “quality” forest cover. “We have actually seen an increase in moderately dense forests, which are denser than open forests. There has been a slight reduction only in open forests. But this means the quality of our denser forests has increased,” said the forest official, attributing annual tree plantation drives to an increase in Delhi’s overall tree cover.
14-01-2022||Delhi||Residents say new liquor vends in Delhi ‘hard to find’||Delhi has opened swanky liquor shops under its new excise policy, but several residents who were finding it difficult to locate these vends have suggested to the Delhi government that it should consider creating a “store locator” feature on the excise department’s website or launch a mobile application.For Sumanth Kumar, a resident of Ashok Vihar, the go-to place to procure alcohol was a store located at the corner of the community centre in their block. But under the new regime, all old private liquor shops were shut from October 1 last year and new ones, mostly coming up at different locations, opened from November 16. Since then he has been unable to locate a liquor store, not just in his locality, but in the entire district. After feedback from people, the state excise department on Thursday uploaded the updated list of the new liquor vends in Delhi on its website along with their addresses. The list can be viewed on www.excise.delhi.gov.in by clicking the “liquor vends” option. This will prompt the user to a new window where one should click on “license” and choose “private vend” in the drop down list. The list of all private vends will then appear, a senior excise official explained.However, several users who tried to locate the stores on the website did not find it useful. “It is a very shoddily curated list. All the vends are not tagged with the districts in which they are located. Also, one has to keep clicking page after page. It is ancient. Nowadays, there are more user friendly ways such as geotagging the stores or creating a simple store locator. The Delhi government can surely make it happen. It is basic IT skill,” said Pritam Goswami, a resident of Mayur Vihar. HT also used the portal and found that of the 11 districts in Delhi, the portal did not show any results for stores located in Southeast and Shahdara districts. The south-east district covers localities such as Jor Bagh, Lodhi Road, Khan Market, Sunder Nagar, Nizamuddin, Defence Colony, Lajpat Nagar, New Friends Colony, Nehru Place, Kalkaji, Chittaranjan Park, Govindpuri, Greater Kailash, Alaknanda to Jamia Nagar, Okhla, Sarita Vihar, Jaitpur and Badarpur. Shahdara is a relatively smaller district covering areas such as Dilshad Garden, Tahirpur, Yamuna Vihar and others. According to government records seen by HT, until Thursday, a total of 543 liquor shops out of a target of around 850 had begun retail sale of alcohol in Delhi. The new retail stores in Delhi no longer have the iron grilles, which earlier was a trademark of all government-run liquor vends in the Capital. The new stores allow buyers to browse and purchase the brands of their choice. According to the benchmark laid by the new policy, shops are supposed to be spacious, well lit and air-conditioned to allow customers a walk-in experience under camera surveillance.The new excise policy is aimed at revolutionising the consumer experience as stylish liquor stores will replace the government-run shops. Under the policy, new liquor vends will be set up in 32 zones across the city. Some liquor outlets will also have tasting facilities to enhance users’ experience.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/residents-say-new-liquor-vends-in-delhi-hard-to-find-101642096981420.html
14-01-2022||Delhi||Over 1 million in Delhi missed window for second Covid vaccine dose||Over a million people who got their first doses of a coronavirus vaccine in Delhi have missed the window to take their second shots, according to data compiled by district authorities in the Capital, who have now launched a massive reminder campaign through direct phone calls.A full vaccination course is crucial for adequate protection from Covid-19, according to experts and real-world evidence from many countries. According to the data, 1.15 million have missed their window for the second doses, and another roughly 678,000 are at present due for their second shots.Districts are now reaching out to these people, with some making up to 13,000 people a day, asking them to take their doses as soon as possible.Viswendra, the district magistrate of South East district, said 40 teams have been set up in the district, working from a call centre in the DM’s office complex. “We have a master list of people whose second dose is overdue and due. The teams working in the call centre call up nearly 5,000 people from the list every day. All those contacted are clustered on the basis of their location and mapped with the nearby Covid vaccination centres operating in the district and they are convinced to get the second dose immediately,” he said.“We have achieved 71.1% coverage for second dose vaccination. Every day up to 8,000 calls are made to those whose second dose is overdue or due. We are trying to cover all the overdue and due cases as soon as possible in a campaign mode. We have found that many people got first dose in North West district and the second dose outside the district and in many cases outside Delhi. It also ends up increasing the number of overall second dose pendency,” said the official not willing to be identified. The highest number of people with overdue doses are in North West district – 164,518 -- and lowest in North East district – 61,228. With 138,583 overdue cases, West district has second-largest number, followed by South West with 122,589 people. East district DM Sonika Singh said a call centre running from her office complex has 150 people calling between 12,000-13,000 people every day. “We have achieved 81% second vaccination target in the district and only 19% are left. The teams are closing the overdue cases very fast by ensuring that they get second dose. It is our priority to ensure that 100% of all eligible for second dose get the second dose at the earliest,” said Singh. According to documents, seen by HT, first dose vaccination coverage against target in North West district is 119% (as on January 12) which means that many people who are not resident of the district also got the jab in the centres running in the district. This is one of several why many doses were pending – many said they got their second doses in other districts and towns (their cases are closed after they give the reference number verifying they indeed got their second doses), while some said they were ill when they were due for their shots. Viswendra, who goes by a single name, added that additionally the list of those contacted is shared with officials engaged in ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign to ensure vaccination at doorstep (both first and second dose). “Under the campaign, lanes and streets with high number of overdue cases are identified. Civil defence volunteers visit these places and carry out awareness, inform people that a vaccination camp in the lane is going to be set up and urge them to get vaccinated the camp,” he said. Vaccinators from nearby Covid vaccination centres visit the area and set up a camp where many whose second dose is overdue get jabbed. “On Thursday, 14 such camps were organised in South East district,” said Viswendra, adding that nearly 2,000 names were struck off from the overdue list after that.A Delhi government official, who did not want to be identified, said people give various reasons for not taking the second dose on time. “People blame lack of time due to various reasons like family issues, work overload, absence of SMS intimating about the second dose due date, or because they shifted out of Delhi for time being or forgot the due date,” said this person. Another district official said other technical reasons too were involved. “Some people used a different phone number for first dose and a different number for second dose. In all such cases, the second dose is shown as pending. When we reach out to them, we learn that they are already vaccinated with second dose. In such cases we close the pendency of that particular case,” this person said. The call centres are pulling out a very extensive exercise. A call centre in-charge, who is not authorised to talk, said around 20-25% people turn out to be unreachable. “We segregate such names and put them in a repeat call list. We keep trying to get to them,” said the call centre in-charge. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said: “Complete two doses of Covid-19 vaccination have improved chance of lesser mortality and severity as compared to single dose or no vaccination. All those whose second dose is overdue or due should complete the due dose as soon as possible. Those who missed the second dose due to any reason still they can get and it will prevent them from severity. If everyone in the country is vaccinated with all the due doses, then the next Covid-19 waves may not be severe and may not create havoc.” Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in ICMR, said the first doses create only some amount of antibodies, which can be short-lived. “The second dose greatly increases the number of immune cells and their ability to make antibodies against the virus. The vaccines reach their full effectiveness about two to three weeks after the second shot,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-1-million-in-delhi-missed-window-for-second-covid-vaccine-dose-101642096801105.html
14-01-2022||Delhi||Child rights body, Delhi govt tussle on ‘Desh ke Mentors’ programme||The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has written to the Delhi government seeking suspension of its ongoing ‘Desh Ka Mentors’ programme for school students, citing concerns over children being exposed to unknown persons even as the Aam Aadmi Party hit back at the central child rights body saying it was just another attempt by the BJP to “hinder another path-breaking programme”.In a letter dated January 11, the commission alleged that the programme, under which school students are provided career guidance by eminent citizens, “exposes them to certain dangers”, and asked Delhi government to suspend the programme till the loopholes are “overhauled”.The ‘Desh Ke Mentors’ programme was launched in October 2021, and is meant to connect 900,000 students of classes 9 to 12 in Delhi government schools with noteworthy citizens who will offer them career and general guidance. The mentors will engage with students over the phone for 10-15 minutes daily to guide them on various aspects of life, the government said while launching the programme.The commission said that it also wrote to the Delhi chief secretary last month, raising the matter and recieved a response from Delhi government’s directorate of education (DoE) on January 3. The commission alleged that the response was “ineffectual”.“It has been stated in the response that ‘to protect against violation, mentees are assigned mentors who are from the same gender’, it is imperative to place here that abuse or assault, sexual or otherwise, is not gender biased. Same gender does not necessarily assure safety of any child in any terms,” it said.Atishi, AAP MLA and chairperson of standing committee on education (Delhi Vidhan Sabha) said the letter yet again betrays the “shallowness” of the BJP and its government machinery. “Putting hindrances in the implementation of a path-breaking scheme like ‘Desh Ke Mentor’ shows the shallowness of the BJP and its government machinery. The BJP has left government schools all over the country to rot. Under the BJP rule in UP the percentage of students aged 11-14 decreased from 56% to 39% in 2019. In Gujarat, there is a shortage of more than 18,000 classrooms and 1700+ government schools have shut down. On the other enrolments are at an all time in Delhi government schools. The students score better than those from private schools.”The programme could be yet another potential sticking point between the AAP government in Delhi and the BJP-led central government. The two governments are already engaged in a legal tussle over the former’s doorstep delivery of ration scheme.The commission said the fact that the interactions are done over the phone does not guarantee any protection from crime. “It may be noted that child related crime can be initiated through phone calls as well. For instance, children are susceptible to probable child trafficking through phone calls. Is there any mechanism to prevent origin of cybercrimes and child trafficking?,” the commission said.The commission also alleged that the personnel involved with the programme “does not seem to be gender sensitised”. “They also seem to lack knowledge about the nuances of child sexual abuse nor are they aware about the laws related to children, including Pocso Act, 2012 and the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015,” it said.The commission recommendation that the scheme should be suspended immediately till the time “when all the loopholes pertaining to the safety of children are overhauled”, and provide a complaince report with the commission within seven days.Atishi said that due to the background of Delhi government school students, they lack the support of mentors who could help them take decisions in their life. “This is where the programme comes in and plugs the gap. Educated youth from good colleges, successful entrepreneurs and professionals come together to mentor underprivileged students. Does the BJP not want these students to get guidance? BJP’s biggest fear is to see the poor get empowered and educated and that’s why they’re placing roadblocks in their progress,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/child-rights-body-delhi-govt-tussle-on-desh-ke-mentors-programme-101642096501017.html
14-01-2022||Delhi||Civic polls: Delhi EC to release list of reserved wards before R-Day||The State Election Commission (SEC) of Delhi will release the list of wards reserved for women and candidates from the Scheduled Castes (SC) in the upcoming municipal polls before Republic Day this year, a senior commission official said on Thursday.A meeting between the poll panel and leaders of different political parties held on Wednesday discussed issues related to delimitation and reservation criteria, said the official quoted above who asked not to be named.Elections to the three municipal corporations in Delhi are due to be held in April. Delhi has a total of 272 wards, and the BJP rules all three civic bodies with the Aam Aadmi Party being the principal opposition.A second SEC official said representatives of the three major political parties -- Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress -- participated in the meeting. “The panel apprised them of the preparations made for the upcoming civic polls. They were also told about the possibilities of delimitation and changing the reservation criteria for women and SC for different wards. All the political parties have been asked to give their suggestions in writing by Monday (January 16). The panel will release the list of reserved wards in all three municipal bodies by January 26,” he said asking not to be named.The official added that the SEC has already released the revised electoral rolls on January 5. “During the period of Special Summary Revision-2022, a total 103,610 electors -- 50,562 male, 52,964 female and 84 third gender -- have been added. The total electors in final electoral roll published stand at 14,899,159, comprising of 8,138,593 male, 6,759,534 female and 1,032 third gender electors... Also, the number of polling stations have been increased from 13,789 to 13,820, and the number of polling locations (a polling location can have multiple polling stations) has decreased marginally from 2,690 to 2,684, as compared to previous electoral roll,” he said.AAP MLA Atishi, who attended the meeting with her party colleague Adil Ahmed Khan, said that they asked the SEC to take decisions in a phased and systematic manner. “The reservation quota must be rational and proportional, unlike the old formula in which some assembly constituencies saw all reserved seats. We also requested them to quickly deal with any issues that crop up so as not to create confusion among the aspirants and voters,” she said.Echoing similar views, senior BJP leader Harsh Malhotra, who represented his party with Subhas Sachdeva at the meeting, said that they requested the poll panel to fix the quota for women and SC on the basis of population. “We have requested them to reconsider the quota in some assembly constituencies like Sultanpuri and Gokulpuri. Both these seats have four wards each and all of them are reserved for SC. Such disparities should be corrected before the polls,” he said.Congress leader Murari Lal Jatav said that his party also asked the poll panel to ensure compliance of Covid-19 protocol during polls. “We have requested the SEC not to allow any party workers, other than the polling agents, at the polling booths. If the poll panel is able to distribute polling chits door-to-door for every voter, what is the need to allow the supporters of different political parties? They can cause chaos and ignite the Covid-19 infection,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/civic-polls-delhi-ec-to-release-list-of-reserved-wards-before-rday-101642096261180.html
14-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi: Saket mall shop owners write to LG over DDA nod for extra floor||A group of shop owners of a south Delhi mall have written to Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal requesting cancellation of the permission given by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to the builder to construct additional floors. They allege that DDA has given the permission to the builder who is no longer the owner of the property, as it was sold on a freehold basis to 117 shop owners in 2007.Last year, DDA granted permission to the builder (Fargo Estates Pvt Ltd) of Square One mall in Saket to construct additional floors as per the amendment in the Master Plan of Delhi-2021 in 2018 which increased the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) for properties in district centres developed by the land-owning agency.The mall, which mostly has offices, was constructed in 2006 and the builder got DDA to convert the property from leasehold to freehold in 2007. The shops and offices were subsequently sold to people/entities on a freehold basis. In February last year, the builder received permission from DDA to construct additional floors as per the new policy. The Square One Mall Owners and Occupiers Association (association of office space owners) claim that they are the owners now as the shops/office spaces were sold to them on a freehold basis.Pushpendra Singh, spokesperson of the association, said, “The company (Fargo) has misrepresented and concealed the status of their ownership while obtaining the permission to construct additional floors from DDA. When Fargo sold and transferred all their rights, title, and interests in respect of the entire FAR sanctioned to them in favour of shop/office space owners, then how can they be considered owners of the property? If this entire property was sold to another builder, then the new builder would have got the benefit of the DDA’s policy for additional FAR. In this case, we (association) are the new owners.”Refuting the ownership claim of the shop owners’ association, Sunil Kunj, manager of Fargo Estates Pvt Ltd, said, “We have not concealed any facts from DDA while obtaining the permission. As per DDA’s policy for giving additional FAR, only individual lessee/ auction purchaser, that is, we, can avail the additional FAR. In this case, our company is the original allottee as auction purchaser.”He added, “These people have been sold only the inside space of the units in the building and all the common areas have been given to them for the right of ingress and egress only without any ownership right, which continues to be vested in us. All our sale deeds very clearly mention that in future if DDA allows us to do further construction, their proportionate land apportioned to them in the building will get reduced proportionately. This clause is there in every sale deed.”HT has seen the copy of the sale deed agreement. Refuting the claim, Singh said, “How can the builder reduce the proportionate ground area and the super area already sold?”Singh said, “The builders have sold and transferred super area including covered area and common area absolutely and forever. The Association members are accordingly paying municipal taxes and maintenance charges on the super area and not just on covered area. The common area is vested in them only for the purpose of maintenance….The builders mischievously added some contradictory conditions in the sale agreements to profit even after selling the entire property. If the builders build additional floors then the common area of all the existing owners gets reduced. Can the builders reduce the common area after charging for it completely and acknowledging the same? It’s legally untenable.” He added, “Further the clause in the agreement reads that in case of construction by them in future only the ground area will get reduced proportionately. Nowhere it says that common area will get reduced. Further where is the parking provision for additional construction. Why they have lied in the new sanctioned plan that automated deck car parking exists. The shop in the agreement has been defined as covered area plus proportionate common area.” A senior DDA official, aware of the development, said, “As per the current policy, DDA recognises only the builder/ original owner, who got the plot in the auction. Therefore, the benefit of the additional FAR is given to the original allottee. If the property is further sold to other people, then the division of additional FAR is a matter between the original allottee and others. DDA has no role to play in this.”The association members allege that the builder is carrying out construction on the property in a bid to legalise illegal construction. Singh said, “The builder is now constructing shops on the fourth floor, which till recently was an open terrace. We have written to Delhi Lieutenant governor in this regard and requested him to cancel the permission granted to the company and take appropriate action against people.”Singh further said that the DDA sanctioned the plan without approval from the Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC). “The building plan was sanctioned in February but till then they didn’t have permission from DUAC…The existing parking space in the upper and lower basement is barely sufficient to park 40-45 cars as against 117 sanctioned shops. What is the provision for additional parking kept by the builders to meet the additional demand on account of additional sanctioned FAR? This was clearly pointed out by DUAC in their observations. DDA has sidelined this observation of DUAC and has sanctioned additional FAR without the approval of DUAC,” said Singh.DUAC didn’t comment on the matter. Kunj said, “There is some construction happening at the site, which is essentially strengthening the foundation and similar works, which has been paused for some time for some strategic reasons. The plan has been sanctioned by DDA and an inspection was conducted recently, which has found everything to be in order.”DDA carried out an inspection of the site last week and the matter regarding the building plan being sanctioned is being examined. The senior DDA official said, “There was no problem found at the site. But we are examining the matter.”In a letter to Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on January 4, 2022, the association requested him to intervene in the matter and cancel the sanctioned plan. “In the plan for addition approved by DDA, M/S Fargo Estates Pvt Ltd are now showing shops constructed on the back terrace on the 4th floor. A blatant lie again, as this was an open area till now as per the sanctioned plan of 2004….This is an attempt by the builders to illegally construct additional shops based on falsified plan submitted to DDA,” read the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-saket-mall-shop-owners-write-to-lg-over-dda-nod-for-extra-floor-101642095961104.html

14-01-2022||Mumbai||Bed occupancy at ICU goes up by 10 percentage points||Mumbai: Since January 4, the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed occupancy has gone up nearly 10 percentage points and ventilator bed utilisation has increased by nearly 11 percentage points in Mumbai. The oxygen bed occupancy in the city has doubled in the same 10-day duration. However, the oxygen usage in the past week, senior civic official say, has only increased by an estimated 5% indicating that patients on oxygen beds seem to be recovering with mild oxygen therapy. Data collated by the civic body shows that on January 4, there were 11,998 oxygen beds, 2,577 ICU beds and 1,368 ventilator beds. On that day, 1,374 oxygen beds, 507 ICU beds and 320 ventilator beds were occupied — 11.5%, 19.67% and 23.39%, respectively. On January 13, the city’s oxygen bed strength was 11,854, ICU beds were 3,053 and ventilator bed strength was 1,547, of which 2,806 (23.67%), 897 (29.38%) and 538 (34.77%) were occupied, respectively. What this indicates is that while there is still a large share of such beds available in the city, Covid-19 cases requiring critical care are on the rise. To be sure, based on case curves seen in the earlier waves, oxygen, ICU and ventilator beds typically start filling up seven to 12 days from the onset of infection as an infected person would only start to display serious symptoms — which require critical care — only from the seventh day onwards. What’s more, civic authorities said that city’s oxygen usage has not increased drastically despite an increase in the number of patients requiring oxygen therapy and intensive care. “Currently, the city is using about 40-45 Metric Tonnes (MT) of oxygen every day,” additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu, who oversees Mumbai’s oxygen supply and distribution, said. “This is only 25% of what we required during the peak of the second wave. Even if the oxygen bed occupancy has doubled over the past few days, oxygen usage is likely to have increased by a marginal 5%. It would have been around 42 to 43 MT last week,” he said. This includes oxygen usage in Covid ICU beds as well as for non-Covid related treatments. According to Velrasu, this is also an indication of how the disease is being manifested in the third wave of the Covid pandemic, where more patients seem to be improving with mild oxygen therapy compared to the previous wave. Mumbai’s total oxygen capacity is 900MT with more than 40 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants with a capacity of 300 MT and Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) storages tanks with varying capacities in hospital premises. “We have not yet started using the PSA plants, because the LMO capacity is sufficient at the moment,” said Velrasu. “Medical experts have predicted that we are already in the peak. So, it unlikely that our oxygen usage will go up further,” he added. Dr V Ravishankhar, chief executive officer of the Lilavati Hospital in Bandra said that none of the 100 Covid-19 patients admitted in their wards is on oxygen support. “But we have 38 patients in our ICU, including four on ventilator support, who are requiring some amounts of oxygen,” he said. According to Ravishankar, all patients in ICU and on oxygen support are with co-morbid conditions or are senior citizens with existing ailments. “We have a mix of people, some are breakthrough infections, some are partially vaccinated and some are unvaccinated,” he said adding that 90% of their ICU beds were full on Thursday. The ongoing third wave has been driven by the Omicron variant, which is known to impact the upper respiratory area, thus causing symptoms like runny nose, scratchy throat and cough. But the Delta variant, that drove the second wave, is still in circulation in the city. Delta, doctors said, was a much deadly variant impacting lower respiratory areas, causing lung damage and serious disease. But not all samples are sent to genome sequencing to confirm the variant of the virus. “We are seeing a faster turnaround from the ICU, with many patients coming out of the ICU within five days,” said Ravishankar. Physician Dr Pratit Samdani, who consults at Breach Candy Hospital said doctors can only assume that a particular patient has the Omicron variant going by the clinical symptoms. “When the number of infections is this high, there will be some percentage of patients who will land up getting serious disease. Most of my admissions have been in the wards, but there are some patients with co-morbid conditions and age-related risk factors who are in the ICU and on oxygen support.” Dr Prince Surana, chief executive of Mumbai’s Surana Group of Hospitals said that ward admissions were higher during the first week of January. “But now, we are seeing an uptick in the ICU admissions. A majority of these patients are in advanced age and have serious comorbid conditions,” he said. Of the 15-bed ICU facility in the Chembur branch of Surana Hospital, 14 were full on Thursday. Their eight-bed ICU facility in Navi Mumbai was full. Thane has also seen an uptick in serious patients. On January 4, the oxygen bed occupancy was 1.4%, ICU occupancy was 5.2% and ventilator bed occupancy was 6%. On January 12, the oxygen bed occupancy had jumped to 6.3%, ICU bed occupancy had gone up to 15.9% and ventilator beds occupancy had increased to 12.8%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bed-occupancy-at-icu-goes-up-by-10-percentage-points-101642159687920.html
14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s green cover crosses 50%||The green cover of Chandigarh has increased from 46.25% in 2019 to 50.05% in 2021, according to the recent India State of Forest Report (ISFR).The Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, brings out the biennial report on the forest cover map of the entire country using remote sensing data and ground truthing on field. As per the report released by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change, there is an 85 hectares jump in the green cover of Chandigarh since 2019. The open forest area has also increased by 158 hectares, signifying more non-forest area has been brought under green cover. To increase the city’s green cover, a Greening Chandigarh Action Plan (GCAP) is prepared every year by various agencies, including the forest department, and horticulture wings of UT engineering department and municipal corporation, for maintenance of the city’s green cover and setting an annual target of plantation. Chief conservator of forests (CCF) Debendra Dalai said the credit went to city residents, who had been working with the administration and helping with greening initiatives. He said the UT forest department had also been making sustained efforts in improving the quality of forests by planting indigenous species, such as shisham, shahtoot, khair and babul, adding that no exotic species had been planted over the last couple of years. Free saplings are also distributed among residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-green-cover-crosses-50-101642107966168.html

Earlier, the Council of Engineers (CoE) had approached NGT for execution of its order dated March 10, 2021 wherein the MC, LIT and GLADA were directed to remove concrete and interlocking tiles installed around trees. The case was transferred to the civil judge by the tribunal.CoE president Kapil Arora stated the trees absorb water, oxygen and other nutrients essential for growth through the roots, and when restricted by concrete and tiles, the trees begin to get weak. “Such obstructions around trees can be witnessed in different parts of the city, due to which we have been forced to approach the tribunal for execution of its earlier orders.”In the order dated January 12, the court of civil judge said that no official of the MC, LIT and GLADA appeared before the court as directed earlier. In view of the directions of NGT, it is evident that the respondents are blatantly violating the directions of the tribunal.Further, it has ordered that in order to ensure meticulous compliance of the orders, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal, LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam and GLADA chief administrator Sandeep Kumar are to appear in person on February 1, failing which the court shall be constrained to adopt coercive methods to ensure their presence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/concrete-around-trees-chiefs-of-ludhiana-mc-lit-glada-told-to-appear-before-court-on-feb-1-101642104902064.html
14-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | After MC action against a shop of his supporter, AAP’s Gurpreet Gogi cries foul||Two days after joining the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Gurpreet Gogi, a sitting councillor and former district president of Congress, said a certain cabinet minister was “victimising” one of his supporters by getting the shutters of his under-construction shop demolished through the municipal corporation (MC).Gogi said the shop is located near Saggu Chowk and there are many others shops in the area, but action has been taken only against his supporter’s shop. The AAP leader said the MC has demolished the shutter of the said shop under pressure from the cabinet minister. Gogi further said the action has come as he has been blowing the lid off the corrupt acts of the cabinet minister. Shop owner Mangat Ram said no notice was served by the MC before the action was taken. “The MC team came and demolished the shutters without prior notice. I have been targeted for supporting Gogi,” said Ram.Assistant town planner (ATP), Zone D, MS Bedi said there is no political pressure on MC officials and the shop was being constructed illegally. The shutters have been removed following a complaint by area residents. Two more illegal buildings were demolished by the MC at Char Khamba road in Model Town and BRS Nagar. These shops were being constructed in violation of building bylaws. Former chairman of Punjab Small Industries and Exports Corporation (PSIEC), Gogi joined AAP in presence of its state president Bhagwant Mann in Chandigarh on Tuesday. He had accused a minister of large-scale corruption. Gogi has been aspiring for a party ticket from Ludhiana west constituency, which is represented by cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-after-mc-action-against-a-shop-of-his-supporter-aap-s-gurpreet-gogi-cries-foul-101642101541680.html
14-01-2022||World||Rishi Sunak: British Prime Minister in waiting?||As Boris Johnson’s “partygate” troubles mount and members of his own Conservative Party demand he step down as the British Prime Minister, one name is doing the rounds as a frontrunner to take charge – his Indian-origin Chancellor and Downing Street neighbour Rishi Sunak.The UK-born son of a pharmacist mother and a National Health Service (NHS) general practitioner (GP) father is an Oxford University and Stanford graduate. He is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy, and the couple has two young daughters Krishna and Anoushka.The MP for Richmond in Yorkshire first entered the UK Parliament in 2015 and has quickly risen up the Tory party ranks as a staunch Brexiteer, who had backed Johnson’s strategy to leave the European Union (EU).From working in my mum’s tiny chemist shop to my experience building large businesses, I have seen how we should support free enterprise and innovation to ensure Britain has a stronger future,” Sunak had said during the Brexit referendum.He co-founded a 1-billion-pound global investment firm and specialised in investing in small British businesses before his entry into politics.As the first Chancellor of the Exchequer of Indian heritage, Sunak made history in February 2020 when he was appointed to the most important UK Cabinet post.If the Tory party murmurings and bookie betting odds are anything to go by, then the 41-year-old may well be in line to make history as Britain’s first Indian-origin Prime Minister."No, definitely not. Seeing what the Prime Minister has to deal with, this is a job hard enough for me to do," Sunak said back in October 2020, when asked if he had prime ministerial ambitions.But a lot has happened since, with Sunak leading the charge for the country’s economic fightback against the Covid-19 pandemic.Many of the schemes he put in place as finance minister, including the furlough-based Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and COVID support grants for struggling businesses over the course of several lockdowns have proved largely popular.However, proposed tax hikes coming up from this April and consistently rising energy and cost of living costs have proved less popular within the Conservative Party base.The famously low-tax favouring Tories may find his high tax plans to recoup some of the lost economic ground during the pandemic hard to digest when things really come to a leadership scrum.In fact, there is already talk within the party ranks of him having overplayed his hand by not speaking out more firmly in support of 57-year-old Johnson, following his Parliament apology earlier this week over a Downing Street garden party in apparent breach of lockdown rules.Sunak, who was miles away on a business visit, tweeted much later in the evening to say that “the PM was right to apologise and I support his request for patience while Sue Gray carries out her enquiry”.This was seen as a half-hearted show of support and viewed as reflective of his own leadership ambitions.The wealth associated with Sunak and his wife Akshata has also often hit the spotlight for the wrong reasons, with the Chancellor’s 95-pound pair of slippers spotted in official photographs released pre-Budget last October the latest luxury item to hit the headlines.This followed being pictured with a 180- pound so-called “smart mug”, which was reportedly a gift from his wife.However, his image as a family man who wears bracelets made by his daughters ahead of important speeches is the narrative that the British Indian community would like to highlight.He has also often spoken about himself as a “proud Hindu”, most recently when he unveiled a new 5-pound commemorative coin celebrating the life of Mahatma Gandhi for Diwali last November.“As a practicing Hindu, I am proud to unveil this coin during Diwali. Mahatma Gandhi was instrumental in the movement for Indian independence and it is fantastic to have a UK coin commemorating his remarkable life for the first time,” he said at the time.Ever since he took charge as Chancellor, there has been speculation within the UK media about Sunak eyeing the top job to move next door from his current No. 11 Downing Street office.A Prime Minister and Chancellor at odds with each other has been a historic dynamic within British politics and much of the speculation was attributed to that political power play.However, with Johnson becoming increasingly embattled within his own party ranks, that Downing Street neighbourly dynamic may just go on to create new British Indian history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-british-prime-minister-in-waiting-101642176061120.html
14-01-2022||World||Sino-India trade at record $125bn for 2021 amid border tension; deficit widens||Trade between India and China reached a record $125 billion in 2021 despite the worst chill in bilateral ties in decades, Chinese customs data showed on Friday.Two way trade between India and China in 2021 stood at $125.66 billion, up 43.3% from 2020 when bilateral trade was worth $87.6 billion.In 2021, China’s exports to India were $97.52 billion, up 46.2%, while China imported $28.14 billion worth of goods from India, up 34.2%, according to statistics released by the General Administration of Customs (GAC) and quoted by the tabloid, Global Times, on Friday.Trade deficit between the two countries remained much in favour of China – at $69 billion.The deficit in trade has been a constant source of friction between New Delhi and Beijing, with India complaining that China, despite promises, hasn’t given Indian companies access to sectors like pharmaceuticals.India was China’s 15th largest trade partner in 2021, according to GAC. “Analysts attributed the surge in trade to the complementary aspects of the industrial chains of the two countries. For example, about 50-60 percent of chemicals and other materials used by the Indian pharmaceutical industry, which is a pillar industry, are imported from China,” the Global Times report said.India-China trade in 2020 declined by 5.6% to $87.6 billion, the lowest since 2017. But China still overtook the US to become India’s largest trading partner last year.Chinese companies saw an increase in demand from India for medical equipment in the first half of the year following a devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.The widening trade deficit with China, according to an explanatory note published online by the Indian embassy, can be attributed to two factors: narrow basket of commodities, mostly primary, for exporting to China and the lack of market access for most India’s agricultural products and the sectors where India is competitive in, such as pharmaceuticals, and IT.The Chinese report said amid bilateral tensions, the trade data “is just another piece of proof that New Delhi is unable to reduce its dependence on the Chinese market”.Indian and Chinese border troops have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border.Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.Separately, GAC data showed on Friday that trade between China and the US soared by 28.7% and amounted to $755.6 billion in 2021 - maintaining a strong growth momentum and contributing 12% to China’s record $6 trillion foreign trade for the year.China’s exports to the US increased by 27.5% in 2021, while imports grew by 32.7%, reaching $179.53 billion.“The US maintained its place as China’s third-largest trade partner following Asean and the European Union. China-US trade was twice China’s trade with its fourth-largest trade partner Japan - which was 2.4 trillion yuan,” the Global Times reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinoindia-trade-at-record-125bn-for-2021-amid-border-tension-deficit-widens-101642166288374.html
14-01-2022||World||Covid-19: Canada yet to approve Covaxin for emergency use||While it has been over six months since Bharat Biotech’s North American partner submitted Covaxin for emergency use approval from Health Canada, that agency has said that the review is still “ongoing” and is unable to predict when a decision in this regard will be taken.Covaxin’s submission in Canada was on June 30, 2021 by Vaccigen, the Canadian subsidiary of Bharat Biotech’s partner, the American company Ocugen.However, there is no clarity on when, and if, regulators will clear the Covid-19 vaccine for use in Canada. In a tweet on Thursday, the agency said, “A decision will be made once all of the required information has been thoroughly evaluated by Health Canada. As the review is still ongoing, it is not possible to predict when a regulatory decision will be made.”Health Canada said it reviews vaccine applications through an independent process and authorises products based on “scientific rigour and medical evidence”.“Timing for the completion of Health Canada’s review depends on many factors, including but not limited to, the need for additional data, discussions with the sponsor, and requirements for updates to safety information,” it added.Covaxin was approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization (WHO) in November 2021. It is recognised in Canada for travel purposes, as on November 30 the country started accepting those with two doses of Covaxin as fully vaccinated.At this time, only two vaccines, those manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna are available for administration in Canada, and these two have accounted for the vast majority of jabs given so far, including boosters, accounting for nearly 66 million out of the total 72 million inoculations given so far. There has been limited use of other approved vaccines, including that from AstraZeneca and its version Covishield manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, and the vaccine from Johnson & Johnson.Meanwhile, Health Canada also said it was reviewing “on a priority basis” a submission from Pfizer on a Covid-19 antiviral treatment, the submission for which was received last month. The news agency Canadian Press cited Health Canada’s chief medical adviser Dr Supriya Sharma as saying that the authorisation decision for the drug will be taken within ten days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-yet-to-approve-covaxin-for-emergency-use-101642150567230.html
14-01-2022||World||PM Imran Khan launches Pakistan's first-ever National Security Policy||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday launched the country’s first-ever National Security Policy, which articulates a citizen-centric framework, placing economic security at its core unlike the previous one-dimensional security policy where the focus was on the military.Unveiling the public version of the policy, which was separately endorsed by the National Security Committee and the Cabinet last month, Prime Minister Khan said that the previous governments had failed to strengthen Pakistan’s economy.The national security has been clearly explained in the new original 100-page document, he said, adding that the policy articulates a citizen-centric framework, placing economic security at its core and seeking a secure and economically resilient Pakistan.Khan said that Pakistan, since its evolution, has had a one-dimensional security policy where the focus was on the military. "For the first time, the National Security Division has developed a consensus document which defines national security in a proper way," he added.The powerful army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy.The five-year-policy document covering a period between 2022-26, is being propped up by the Khan government as the country’s first-ever strategy paper of its kind that spells out the national security vision and guidelines for the attainment of those goals."We need to realise that our biggest security is when the people become stakeholders and stand up for the country. And this can be achieved through inclusive growth. We need to develop as a nation, not in sections,” Khan said.The original version of the policy will remain classified.The main themes of the National Security Policy are national cohesion, securing an economic future, defence and territorial integrity, internal security, foreign policy in a changing world and human security.Earlier, National Security Advisor Moeed Yusuf said that Pakistan, under the new policy, will be shifting to a Comprehensive National Security Framework with the aim of ensuring the safety, security, and dignity of the citizens of Pakistan."The policy puts economic security at the core. A stronger economy would create additional resources which would then be distributed to further bolster military and human security,” he said.On the foreign front, the new policy highlights disinformation, Hindutva, and the use of aggression for domestic political gains as key threats from India, the Express Tribune newspaper reported.The report, quoting Yusuf, said the policy places the Jammu and Kashmir issue as the core of the bilateral relationship.When asked about the message it sends to India, Yusuf said: “it tells India to do the right thing and jump on the bandwagon to benefit from regional connectivity to uplift our peoples. It also tells India, if you don't want to do the right thing, it will be a loss to the entire region, but most of all India.”Earlier this week, an official said that Pakistan is willing to make peace with immediate neighbours, including India, under the new security policy which leaves doors open for trade with New Delhi even without the settlement of the Kashmir issue provided there is headway in bilateral talks.Peace with immediate neighbours and economic diplomacy will be the central theme of Pakistan’s foreign policy in the new National Security Policy, the newspaper reported on Tuesday."We are not seeking hostility with India for the next 100 years. The new policy seeks peace with immediate neighbours,” the official said on condition of anonymity.If there is a dialogue and progress, there would be a possibility of normalising trade and commercial ties with India as it had happened in the past, the official added.India has told Pakistan that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Islamabad in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-imran-khan-launches-pakistan-s-first-ever-national-security-policy-101642147546470.html

Authorities didn’t immediately comment on the source of the outage, which comes amid surging tensions with Russia due to its buildup of thousands of troops near the border.A spokesman for Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry said on Twitter that the websites were down following a massive hack and that authorities were working to restore services. He didn’t identify who might be behind the attack, which hit the site of his agency as well as those of the Agriculture and Education Ministries and the government staff. All those sites were down, some with their content replaced for a time by messages in Russian, Polish and Ukrainian. “Ukrainian! All your personal data has been uploaded to the public network,” the message said. “All data on your computer is being erased and won’t be recoverable. All information about you has become public, fear and expect the worst. This is being done to you for the your past, present and future,” it said, with a reference to “historic lands.”Ukraine has previously accused Russia of mounting major cyber attacks against it as relations between the two neighbors have worsened since a 2014 conflict. In recent months, Ukraine and its allies in the U.S. and Europe have warned that Russia could be preparing to invade as it massed about 100,000 troops near the border. Moscow denies any such plans.A Kremlin spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the cyber attack.The U.S. and its allies have warned that Russia might use hacking or other actions short of a military operation to put pressure on Ukraine. Russia denies it uses cyber weapons offensively but President Vladimir Putin has said what he called “patriotic hackers” may take it upon themselves to stand up for the country’s interests online.As tensions have mounted in recent months, the U.S. and its allies have been working to ready a package of sanctions to respond to a potential invasion or further acts of Russian aggression, though it’s not clear whether a cyber attack, if shown to be linked to Moscow, would trigger major retaliation. Trading in the Ukrainian currency and government bonds opens after 10 a.m. in Kyiv. As of 9:59 a.m. in Moscow, the ruble was trading 0.4% stronger against the dollar. The currency posted its sharpest daily drop since October 2020 on Thursday after a senior Russian diplomat said Moscow’s demands for security guarantees from the U.S. and its allies had hit “a dead end.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/massive-cyberattack-on-ukraine-govt-sites-amid-russia-tensions-101642145460817.html

Primary schools and kindergartens have also shuttered.The government is expected to announce later on Friday that the restrictions will be extended through the Lunar New Year holiday at the start of February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-suspends-transit-flights-from-most-of-the-world-due-to-covid19-101642143503427.html
14-01-2022||World||Who is Christine Lee, woman at the centre of UK spy service MI5 warning?||Britain’s domestic spy service MI5 on Thursday sent out an alert to lawmakers about a woman named Christine Lee alleging she was "involved in political interference activities" in the UK Parliament on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. Speaker of the British House of Commons Lindsay Hoyle informed the lawmakers about the alert, saying the spy agency has found that Lee "has facilitated financial donations to serving and aspiring parliamentarians on behalf of foreign nationals based in Hong Kong and China".The allegations were swiftly rejected by the Chinese embassy in London, claiming that China does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries."We have no need and never seek to 'buy influence' in any foreign parliament," it said.

14-01-2022||World||Covid-19: 55% Canadians expect to contract Omicron, finds poll||Covid fatigue appears to have given way to Covid fatalism in Canada, as with the advent of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, a majority of those sampled in a survey were resigned to being infected by the virus.New data released by the public polling agency Angus Reid Institute (ARI) pointed to this trend, as the agency said that “nationally a slim majority resigned to the inevitability of being infected with this latest strain of the coronavirus”. More than half of Canadians (55%) say regardless of the precautions they take, they expect to contract Omicron. Notably, this sentiment rises to at least three-in-five among parents who have children in grade school.”Those sentiments come as the fifth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Canada, driven by the Omicron variant continues, though numbers of fresh daily cases have been declining, even as public health authorities have noted that could be a factor of fewer tests being administered and being limited to those considered symptomatic.Interestingly, those who believe they will get infected regardless of their actions, are almost equally divided between those who think public health restrictions should be lifted, at 48%, and those who disagree with such action, also 48%.Most appear to believe that they will live with Covid-19 for some time yet with less than a quarter of respondents, 23%, believe that 2022 will be the last year for the pandemic. The most likely group to expect the pandemic to be nearing its end is that of those unvaccinated, with nearly a third of that subset, 32%, thinking along those lines.There were 31,248 new cases reported in Canada on Thursday, taking the total since the pandemic began to 2,688,631.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-55-canadians-expect-to-contract-omicron-finds-poll-101642139946809.html
14-01-2022||World||Blow for Biden: US Supreme Court blocks federal vaccine mandate for large firms||WASHINGTON: Even as US President Joe Biden termed the current surge in Covid-19 cases as a “pandemic of the unvaccinated”, drawing a distinction between how it has affected those who have taken the jab and those who haven’t, the Supreme Court blocked the administration from enforcing a vaccine-or-testing mandate for large employers in the country. If allowed, the move would have applied to all companies with more than 100 employees. “This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Right now, both vaccinated and unvaccinated people are testing positive, but what happens after that could not be more different. If vaccinated people test positive, they overwhelmingly have either no symptoms at all or they have mild symptoms. And if they are unvaccinated... if they test positive, you are 17 times more likely to get hospitalised… And yes, the unvaccinated are dying from Covid-19,” said Biden on Thursday morning. On Wednesday, the US reported 781,203 Covid-19 cases; 145,005 individuals were hospitalised; and 1,827 people died. Biden emphasised that vaccination against Covid-19 had made a difference between the surge last winter and this one. “Because we’ve fully vaccinated nearly 210 million Americans, the majority of the country is safe from severe Covid-19 consequences. That’s why, even as the number of cases among the vaccinated Americans go up, deaths are down dramatically from last winter.” The US president cited the example of United Airlines to buttress his point, claiming that, on an average, one employee was dying a week before it implemented a vaccination requirement. Since enforcing it, 99% of its employees have got vaccinated, and while 3,600 have tested positive, there hasn’t been a single case of hospitalisation or death in the last eight weeks. “But as long as we have tens of millions of people who will not get vaccinated, we’re going to have full hospitals and needless deaths,” he said.Just hours after Biden’s remarks, the Supreme Court — while allowing a requirement for health workers at facilities receiving federal money to get vaccinated — disallowed the administration from enforcing vaccine mandates for large employers. This would have required workers to get vaccinated, or wear masks and get tested weekly. The court’s six conservative judges outnumbered the three liberal justices — and ruled against federal vaccine mandates, primarily on the ground that the federal executive branch did not have the authority to impose such a sweeping requirement. Also Read: WHO recommends two new Covid-19 treatments amid rise in hospital admissionsBiden said he was disappointed with the court’s decision to block “common-sense life-saving requirements for employees at large businesses that were grounded squarely in both science and the law”. “The court has ruled that my administration cannot use the authority granted to it by Congress to require this measure, but that does not stop me from using my voice as president to advocate for employers to do the right thing to protect Americans’ health and economy. I call on business leaders to immediately join those who have already stepped up – including one third of Fortune 100 companies – and institute vaccination requirements to protect their workers, customers, and communities.”

14-01-2022||World||North Korea vows ‘stronger’ action to US sanctions over hypersonic missile tests||North Korea hit back at U.S. sanctions in response to recent hypersonic missile tests that raised new security concerns, vowing a “stronger and certain reaction” to Washington’s attempt to halt its weapons programs.The pursuit of the advanced hypersonic missiles system, which are designed to evade existing defenses, is North Korea’s “legitimate right,” the country’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Washington’s move to slap sanctions on North Koreans who advanced its nuclear and ballistic weapons programs was a dangerous escalation, the ministry added in a statement released Friday through the state’s official Korean Central News Agency.A dispatch from the Foreign Ministry is usually reserved for North Korea’s most important messages to the outside world. The statement ratchets up tensions as the Biden administration is pushing Kim Jong Un to return to nuclear disarmament talks stalled for nearly three years. Kim’s regime has shunned overtures for talks, stepped up its production of fissile material for nuclear bombs and tested new systems to deliver atomic warheads.“The U.S. is intentionally escalating the situation even with the activation of independent sanctions, not content with referring the DPRK’s just activity to the UN Security Council,” the ministry said, referring to the country’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.“If the U.S. adopts such a confrontational stance, the DPRK will be forced to take stronger and certain reaction to it,” it added.The heightened tensions between the U.S. and North Korea come after Pyongyang tested two missiles in less than a week designed to deploy a hypersonic glide vehicle that can maneuver at high speeds during an unpowered flight to strike a target. For the first time in nearly two years, Kim oversaw a weapons test when he watched the Tuesday launch of a hypersonic system that North Korea claimed performed “corkscrew” maneuvers and hit a target 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) away. On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department designated five North Koreans living overseas -- one in Russia, and four in China -- for aiding the country’s weapons programs. The U.S. point man for North Korea, Sung Kim, held separate talks with his counterparts from Japan and South Korea after the latest tests, emphasizing that Washington condemned the moves for violating United Nations Security Council resolutions banning Pyongyang from ballistic missile testing. He also called on North Korea to halt “destabilizing activities” and get back to the bargaining table, the State Department said Thursday.Kim’s regime was hit with tightened UN sanctions to punish it for nuclear and missiles tests in 2017 that have been a major factor in making North Korea’s economy even smaller now than when Kim took power a decade ago. The Biden administration has indicated it could provide economic rewards for steps to wind down the nuclear arms program.“These designations convey our serious and ongoing concern about the DPRK’s continued proliferation activities and those who support it,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement this week. “We remain committed to seeking dialogue and diplomacy with the DPRK and call on the DPRK to engage in negotiations.”The North Korean Foreign Ministry statement accused the U.S. of using “gangster-like” logic with sanctions, which it said demonstrated that Washington wasn’t interested in talks.“This shows that though the present U.S. administration is trumpeting about diplomacy and dialogue, it is still engrossed in its policy for isolating and stifling the DPRK,” the foreign ministry said. “The DPRK will not abandon its just right.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-vows-stronger-action-to-us-sanctions-over-hypersonic-missile-tests-101642124530714.html
14-01-2022||World||US expresses concern over reports of China's actions against Tibetan Buddhists||The US state department on Thursday expressed concern over reports of China’s actions against Tibetan Buddhists, including the destruction of Buddha statues as a part of its campaign to obliterate the traditions of the ethnic minority. The state department’s Office of International Religious Freedom, which promotes universal respect for freedom of religion or belief for all as a core objective of US foreign policy, urged the Chinese authorities to respect the right of Tibetans to practice their belief freely.“We are very troubled by reports of escalating PRC actions against Tibetan Buddhists, including authorities destroying Buddha statues, removing prayer wheels, and burning prayer flags. We urge PRC authorities to respect the right of Tibetans to practice their beliefs freely,” the US Office of International Religious Freedom wrote on Twitter.The statement comes days after reports of China destroying a second Buddhist statue revered by Tibetans in western China's Sichuan province emerged. The destruction of a three-storey statue of Maitreya Buddha at Gaden Namyal Ling monastery in Drago county in the Kardze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture was confirmed through commercial satellite imagery, reported Radio Free Asia.Also Read: Renaming places in Arunachal is part of Chinese psy-opsChinese officials claimed that the statue was razed due to safety reasons, according to the report. They said that there was no fire escape in the temple housing the three-story high statue of Maitreya Buddha, reported RFA quoting people familiar with the matter.Beijing has been long accused of cracking down on ethnic minorities in an apparent attempt to strip off their identity. China has been reportedly imposing restrictions on religious and “Arabic” architecture in Hui-dominated areas. Huis are the Chinese speaking community that follows Islam, and are considered to be the largest Muslim minority group there with over 20 million population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-expresses-concern-over-reports-of-china-s-actions-against-tibetan-buddhists-101642121243444.html
14-01-2022||World||UK security services warn of Chinese spy ‘knowingly interfering’ in parliament||British security services have warned MPs that a suspected Chinese agent "knowingly engaged in political interference activities" inside parliament, authorities said Thursday.The office of House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle confirmed that it had emailed MPs to tell them of the incident, in consultation with the security services."The Speaker takes the security of members and the democratic process very seriously, which is why he issued this notice in consultation with the security services," a spokeswoman for Hoyle said.The Chinese embassy in London denied the accusations, saying "we have no need and never seek to 'buy influence' in any foreign parliament."We firmly opposes the trick of smearing and intimidation against the Chinese community in the UK," it added.The security notice named the suspect as Christine Lee, saying she had "knowingly engaged in political interference activities on behalf of the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party".The London-based solicitor reportedly donated £200,000 ($275,000, 239,000 euros) to former Labour shadow cabinet member Barry Gardiner and hundreds of thousands of pounds to his party.Former prime minister Theresa May -- whose Conservatives have been accused of benefiting from millions in Russian money -- presented Lee with an award in 2019 to recognise her contribution to Sino-UK ties.Lee was also photographed with May's predecessor David Cameron at an event in 2015, and separately with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.Lee "facilitated financial donations to serving and aspiring parliamentarians on behalf of foreign nationals based in Hong Kong and China", said the Speaker's note, according to British media."This facilitation was done covertly to mask the origins of the payments. This is clearly unacceptable behaviour and steps are being taken to ensure it ceases," it added.Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative leader and vocal critic of Beijing, demanded strong action after Britain's MI5 intelligence agency warned of Lee's activities."I say, as a member of parliament who has been sanctioned by the Chinese government, that this is a matter of grave concern," he said.China last year imposed sanctions on 10 UK organisations and individuals, including Duncan Smith, over what it called the spreading of "lies and disinformation" about human rights abuses in Xinjiang.Lee has not been arrested or deported, merely barred from entering parliament, he complained.Conservative former defence minister Tobias Ellwood told the Commons that "this is the sort grey-zone interference we now anticipate and expect from China"."But the fact that it's happened to this parliament, there must be a sense of urgency from this government."There was no immediate comment from the Chinese embassy in London or from the UK government.Gardiner said Christine Lee's son had been employed as his diary manager but had resigned on Thursday.In a statement, he said all of her donations were properly reported and any suggestion of shady money was not linked to his office, but that he had been "liaising with our security services" for many years about her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-security-services-warn-of-chinese-spy-knowingly-interfering-in-parliament-101642119556586.html
14-01-2022||World||WHO recommends two new Covid-19 treatments amid rise in hospital admissions||The World Health Organization approved two new treatments for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as Omicron cases put a strain on the healthcare system around the world. The WHO experts recommended arthritis drug baricitinib and synthetic antibody treatment Sotrovimab to stave off serious illness and death from Covid-19.The experts strongly recommended the use of Baricitinib as an alternative to interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor blockers, in combination with corticosteroids, to treat severe or critical Covid patients. They suggested that the use of baricitinib with corticosteroids in severe Covid patients led to better survival rates and reduced need for ventilators.“The strong recommendation for baricitinib in those with severe or critical illness reflects moderate certainty evidence for benefits on mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital length of stay (high certainty) with no observed increase in adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation,” the updated WHO guidelines say.The experts suggested that baricitinib and IL-6 receptor blockers like tocilizumab and sarilumab have similar effects and the decision should be based on issues including cost and clinician experience.They also recommended Sotrovimab for people with non-serious Covid who are at the highest risk of hospitalisation, such as the elderly and people with chronic diseases.The use of Sotrovimab in patients with non-severe illness led to a substantial reduction in the risk of hospitalisation and trivial benefits in those at lower risk. However, the drug probably has little or no impact on mortality and on mechanical ventilation, according to the guidelines.“There were insufficient data to recommend one monoclonal antibody treatment over another, and evidence on their efficacy for emerging variants is likely to influence future recommendations,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-recommends-two-new-covid-19-treatments-amid-rise-in-hospital-admissions-101642119075998.html
14-01-2022||World||Russia gives out mixed signal on talks with US||Talks this week on Moscow’s demands for security guarantees from the US and its allies are at “a dead end,” a senior Russian diplomat said, stepping up the pressure on the West even as he and other officials held out the prospect of more diplomacy to ease tensions.“The US and its allies in effect are telling us ‘no’” on Russia’s key proposals, offering further discussions only on “secondary” matters, deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told RTVi television. “That’s the dead end or difference in approaches.”The comments by Ryabkov, who led the talks with the US in Geneva on Monday, seemed to reflect a slight hardening of Russia’s position as he said he didn’t see reason to resume discussions in the near future. But shortly after he spoke, his boss, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, seemed more upbeat, telling state television he expects the US and its allies to respond to Russia’s proposals as soon as next week.The mixed messages suggested the Kremlin is keeping up the pressure on the US and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) allies that started with a buildup of tens of thousands of troops on the border near Ukraine. Moscow has so far rejected western calls to pull those forces back, saying it has no plans to invade.Cuba, Venezuela warningBut the stakes in Russia’s dispute with the West were raised when Ryabkov refused to rule out a Russian military deployment to Cuba and Venezuela if tensions with the US mount.Ryabkov said in televised remarks that he would “neither confirm nor exclude” the possibility that Russia could send military assets to Cuba and Venezuela if the talks fail and US pressure on Russia mounts.Speaking in an interview with Russian RTVI TV, Ryabkov noted that “it all depends on the action by our US counterparts,” pointing to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s warning that Moscow could take military-technical measures if the US provokes the Kremlin and turns up military pressure on it.Ryabkov’s statement followed his comments last month in which he compared the current tensions over Ukraine with the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.Kazakh pullback beginsTroops of a Russia-led security alliance were preparing to pull out of Kazakhstan on Thursday, the Russian defence ministry said. The withdrawal comes only a week after they were deployed to the ex-Soviet nation on the request of its president, who was seeking to quell extremely violent mass protests. The demonstrations started on January 2 in western Kazakhstan, with local residents outraged by a sharp rise in fuel prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-gives-out-mixed-signal-on-talks-with-us-101642114426036.html
14-01-2022||World||China races to stamp out Covid outbreak||China’s northern port city of Tianjin reported an increase in Covid-19 infections on Thursday as it stepped up efforts to rein in an outbreak that has spread the highly transmissible Omicron variant to another city.Omicron has brought new challenges for China’s strategy to quickly stamp out outbreaks, which has taken on urgency ahead of the Winter Olympics set to start from February 4, while the busy Lunar New Year travel season begins this month.Volkswagen Group’s China unit said it had shut a vehicle plant run jointly with FAW Group in Tianjin, as well as a component factory since Monday due to the outbreak.Tianjin, located about 100km from the capital Beijing, reported 41 domestically transmitted infections with confirmed symptoms on Wednesday, up from 33 a day earlier, National Health Commission data showed.Dalian in the northeast also reported an individual arriving from Tianjin had tested positive for Omicron, city officials said. It said the virus situation was “largely controllable”.Anyang in the central province of Henan reported 43 local symptomatic cases on Wednesday, after two Omicron infections on Monday. It traced the flare-up to a student from Tianjin.Zhang Wenhong, director of a Covid-19 treatment team in Shanghai, said on Thursday the public health clinic in the commercial hub faced a record number of infections arriving from overseas.On Thursday, authorities in the ancient town of Xian, ordered two hospitals to suspend operations for three months for failures in providing medical care during the outbreak. One of the hospitals apologised for rigid virus controls that delayed treatment for a patient who suffered a heart attack and died.AZ booster dose helps against Omicron: DataAstraZeneca said on Thursday preliminary data from a trial it conducted on its Covid-19 shot, Vaxzevria, showed it generated a higher antibody response against the Omicron variant and others, including Beta, Delta, Alpha and Gamma, when given as a third booster dose.The increased response was seen in people who were previously vaccinated with either Vaxzevria or an mRNA vaccine, the drugmaker said, adding that it would submit this data to regulators worldwide given the urgent need for boosters.Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden said his administration will double its order of rapid Covid tests to send to Americans, while also distributing “high quality” masks to help fight a surge of cases of the omicron variant.France will let in travelers from Britain who are vaccinated against Covid-19 without having to self-isolate or to offer a valid reason for the trip, the French Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Thursday||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-races-to-stamp-out-covid-outbreak-101642114036596.html
14-01-2022||World||Pakistan Taliban confirm ex-spokesman's death in Afghanistan||The Pakistani Taliban on Thursday confirmed the killing over the weekend in neighbouring Afghanistan of the group's former spokesman and vowed to avenge the slaying.The outlawed Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, which is also known as TTP, announced on Twitter the death of the man known as Mohammad Khurasani, which is an alias. His real name was Khalid Balti.The confirmation comes days after Pakistani security officials said the former spokesman of the TTP had been shot and killed in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province, the headquarters of the extremist Islamic State group's regional affiliate. The TTP did not confirm the claim until Thursday.The current TTP spokesman, who also goes by the name Mohammad Khurasani, said on Twitter that Balti was killed on Sunday while travelling. He said Balti's death was a great loss and would soon be avenged.Balti was commander of the TTP and served as the group's spokesman from 2011 to 2015, when he was arrested in Afghanistan. He was freed after the Taliban seized power in mid-August.Their capture of Afghanistan has emboldened the TTP.Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan is an umbrella group and is a separate organisation from the Afghan Taliban.In November, Pakistan announced a month-long cease-fire with the TTP. The group has been behind numerous attacks on security forces and civilians over the last 14 years.The cease-fire ended on December 9 and since then, the group has resumed attacks. The Taliban, who brokered the monthlong truce, have assured Islamabad that they will not allow TTP to use Afghan soil for violence in Pakistan.Pakistani authorities say the talks with the TTP failed because they presented demands that were non-negotiable. The demands have not been publicly disclosed.According to two Pakistani security officials, Balti was also a resident of Pakistan's northern Gilgit Baltistan region.He was planning terrorist attacks in Pakistan and was killed by unidentified assailants in Afghanistan, the officials said.The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak to the media.No one has claimed responsibility for Balti's killing.TTP's chief Noor Wali and his fighters are believed to be hiding in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-taliban-confirm-ex-spokesman-s-death-in-afghanistan-101642113349489.html
14-01-2022||World||Britain's MI5 spy service warns lawmakers over Chinese agent of influence||Britain's domestic spy service MI5 has warned lawmakers that the Chinese Communist Party has been employing a woman to exert improper influence over members of parliament.MI5 sent out an alert and picture of the woman named Christine Lee on Thursday alleging she was "involved in political interference activities" in the United Kingdom on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party.Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, who circulated MI5's alert to lawmakers, said MI5 had found that Lee "has facilitated financial donations to serving and aspiring parliamentarians on behalf of foreign nationals based in Hong Kong and China".Hoyle said Lee had been involved with the now disbanded all-party parliamentary group, Chinese in Britain.Britain’s interior minister Priti Patel told reporters that Lee’s behaviour was currently below the criminal threshold to prosecute her, but she said that by putting the alert out the government was able to warn lawmakers about Lee's attempts to improperly influence them.Patel said it was "deeply concerning" that an individual working on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party had targeted lawmakers.Lee is the founder of a law firm, which has offices in London and Birmingham, according to a government official. A woman who answered the phone at the Birmingham office said: "we are not taking any calls now". A request for comment left at the London office went unanswered.The law firm lists on its website one of its roles as legal adviser to the Chinese embassy in Britain.The Chinese embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment.POLITICAL DONATIONSBarry Gardiner, a lawmaker for the opposition Labour Party, said he had received donations from Lee and said he has been liaising with intelligence services "for a number of years" about her."They have always known, and been made fully aware by me, of her engagement with my office and the donations she made to fund researchers in my office in the past," Gardiner said.Gardiner employed Lee's son as a diary manager but he resigned on Thursday.Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of Britain's governing Conservative Party who has been sanctioned by China for highlighting alleged human right abuses in Xinjiang, called for an urgent update from the government on the issue.He questioned why the woman had not been deported and called for a tightening of the accreditation process for people gaining access to parliament, which he said was too lenient.The government would not confirm Lee's nationality and it was not clear whether she would be deported or if she had already left the country.Former defence minister Tobias Ellwood told parliament: "This is the sort grey-zone interference we now anticipate and expect from China."Britain's relations with China have deteriorated in recent years over issues including Hong Kong and Xinjiang.Last year MI5 urged British citizens to treat the threat of spying from Russia, China and Iran with as much vigilance as terrorism.British spies say China and Russia have each sought to steal commercially sensitive data and intellectual property as well as to interfere in domestic politics and sow misinformation.The Chinese ambassador to Britain was banned from attending an event in the British parliament last year because Beijing imposed sanctions on lawmakers who highlighted alleged human right abuses in Xinjiang.China placed the sanctions on nine British politicians, in March last year for spreading what it said were "lies and disinformation" over the treatment of Uighur Muslims in the country's far west.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britains-mi5-spy-service-warns-lawmakers-over-chinese-agent-of-influence-101642111922885.html

"We're ready to make progress at the negotiating table... and we're ready to take the necessary and proper steps to defend our allies, support our partners and respond robustly to any naked aggression that might occur."Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the border with Ukraine as it demands guarantees that NATO will not expand the alliance eastward."The intelligence community has not made an assessment that the Russians have definitively decided to take a military course of action in Ukraine," Sullivan said."So as things stand right now, Russia has the opportunity to come to the table."Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led talks in Geneva with US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, in an interview Thursday did not rule out Moscow sending forces to allies Venezuela or Cuba if diplomacy failed."I don't want to confirm that... nor exclude it," he said.Sullivan called the remarks "bluster" and said Russia did not raise the idea in discussions."If Russia were to move in that direction, we would deal with it decisively," Sullivan said.The United States and the then-Soviet Union are considered to have come closest to nuclear war in 1962 when Moscow deployed ballistic missiles to Cuba, setting off crisis diplomacy.sms-sct/to||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ready-for-russia-diplomacy-and-to-defend-allies-sullivan-101642111601867.html
14-01-2022||World||In blow to Biden, Supreme Court blocks vaccine mandate for businesses||The US Supreme Court delivered a blow to President Joe Biden on Thursday, blocking his Covid vaccination-or-testing mandate for employees of large businesses.At the same time, the nation's highest court allowed a vaccination mandate for health care workers at facilities receiving federal funding.Biden said he was "disappointed" in the court's decision striking down his mandate for businesses with 100 employees or more to vaccinate or test their workers for Covid-19."I am disappointed that the Supreme Court has chosen to block common-sense life-saving requirements for employees at large businesses that were grounded squarely in both science and the law," Biden said in a statement.The president welcomed the requirement that health care workers be vaccinated, saying it would affect some 10 million people working at facilities receiving federal funds and will "save lives."After months of public appeals to Americans to get vaccinated against Covid, which has killed more than 845,000 people in the United States, Biden announced in September that he was making vaccinations compulsory at large private companies.Unvaccinated employees would have to present weekly negative tests and wear face masks at work.The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), a federal agency, gave businesses until February 9 to be in compliance with the rules or face the possibility of fines.But the Supreme Court's six conservative justices ruled the mandate would represent a "significant encroachment into the lives -- and health -- of a vast number of employees.""Although Congress has indisputably given OSHA the power to regulate occupational dangers, it has not given that agency the power to regulate public health more broadly," they said."Requiring the vaccination of 84 million Americans, selected simply because they work for employers with more than 100 employees, certainly falls in the latter category," they added.The three liberal justices dissented, saying the ruling "stymies the federal government's ability to counter the unparalleled threat that Covid-19 poses to our nation's workers."'Do no harm'The vaccination mandate for health care workers at facilities receiving federal funding was approved in a 5-4 vote, with two conservatives -- Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh -- joining the liberals."Ensuring that providers take steps to avoid transmitting a dangerous virus to their patients is consistent with the fundamental principle of the medical profession: first, do no harm," they said in the majority opinion.Vaccination has become a politically polarizing issue in the United States, where approximately 63 percent of the population is fully vaccinated.A coalition of 26 business associations had filed suit against the OSHA regulations and several Republican-led states had challenged the mandate for health care workers.Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida said the court's ruling "sends a clear message: Biden is not a king & his gross overreaches of federal power will not be tolerated.""I had COVID & got the vaccine, but I will NEVER support a vaccine mandate that bullies hardworking Americans & kills jobs," Scott said.And former president Donald Trump welcomed the ruling on businesses."The Supreme Court has spoken, confirming what we all knew: Biden's disastrous mandates are unconstitutional," Trump said in a statement. "We are proud of the Supreme Court for not backing down. No mandates!"In his statement, Biden said it is now up to states and individual employers to determine whether they should be requiring employees "to take the simple and effective step of getting vaccinated."He said the Supreme Court ruling "does not stop me from using my voice as president to advocate for employers to do the right thing to protect Americans' health and economy.""We have to keep working together if we want to save lives, keep people working, and put this pandemic behind us," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-blow-to-biden-supreme-court-blocks-vaccine-mandate-for-businesses-101642110963509.html
14-01-2022||World||US indicts founder of far-right Oath Keepers for sedition in Capitol attack||The founder of the far-right group Oath Keepers and 10 others were indicted for seditious conspiracy in the January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol, the Justice Department announced Thursday.It was the first use of the potent sedition charge in the sprawling investigation of the Capitol attack by supporters of then-president Donald Trump.Stewart Rhodes, 56, who founded and led the right-wing militia group, and another associate of the organization, Ed Vallejo, were arrested early Thursday.Nine men with ties to the Oath Keepers who had been previously arrested on lesser charges in the violent attack, which temporarily shut down the US Congress, were also named as part of the alleged seditious conspiracy."Following the Nov. 3, 2020, presidential election, Rhodes conspired with his co-defendants and others to oppose by force the execution of the laws governing the transfer of presidential power by Jan. 20, 2021," the Justice Department said in a statement.It said that beginning in December 2020, they secretly made plans to travel to Washington, to prevent certification of Joe Biden's victory over Trump in the presidential election.They brought weapons to Washington as part of their plans for "breaching and attempting to take control of the Capitol grounds and building," it said."While certain Oath Keepers members and affiliates breached the Capitol grounds and building, others remained stationed just outside of the city in quick reaction force (QRF) teams... prepared to rapidly transport firearms and other weapons into Washington" to halt the certification, the department said.If found guilty, they face up to 20 years in prison on the conspiracy to sedition charge alone. Most also face other charges such as assault on law enforcement and disrupting Congress.Conspiracy theoriesThe indictment did not link Rhodes or others to Trump or members of his circle now under investigation by a Congressional committee over their role in the January 6 attack.Rhodes has openly led the Oath Keepers since he founded the group in 2009. He is a former Army paratrooper and graduate of Yale Law School, and was on the staff of former congressman Ron Paul, a prominent libertarian.The group is only loosely organized around the belief that the federal government is growing too powerful and can be removed by force under certain conditions, according to a recent report on them published by the Combating Terrorism Center (CTC) of the US Army's West Point military academy."Conspiracy theories have always been a feature" of their ideology, the report said, and they have regularly shown up in combat gear and heavily armed at politically charged protests, in shows of force that critics label as intimidation.The group has targeted for recruitment primarily current and former military, police and first responders. A recently leaked database had 38,000 names of people who had registered with the Oath Keepers at one point or another.'Civil war'The indictment detailed the group's planning from text messages and chats between members beginning from the election in November 2020 through the day of January 6.Two days after Trump's defeat, Rhodes convened Oath Keepers leaders in an encrypted chat and told them, "We aren't getting through this without civil war."He issued a call to action, and on December 11 told the group that if Biden became president, "it will be a bloody and desperate fight... That can't be avoided."In the following weeks, they discussed tactics for January 6 and the likelihood of violence.Rhodes spent $18,000 ahead of the day on firearms, ammunition and other equipment including gunsights and night-vision gear for his group, the indictment said.The indictment focuses on the way they formed two "stacks," combat-like formations, to force their way past police and into the Capitol on January 6.They also designed routes for their multiple armed "QRFs" to come to their aid from the Washington suburbs if fighting broke out.The indictments on sedition charges took the January 6 investigation to a new level. Some 725 people have been charged overall, mostly for lesser charges such as illegally entering the Capitol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-indicts-founder-of-far-right-oath-keepers-for-sedition-in-capitol-attack-101642110558946.html
14-01-2022||World||US approves new antibody treatment -- for arthritic cats||Good news for senior felines hoping to get a spring back in their step.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday approved its first treatment to control pain associated with osteoarthritis in cats, which is also the first monoclonal antibody drug approved for any animal species.These lab-grown proteins have grabbed headlines during the pandemic for preventing high-risk people with Covid from getting severely ill.Not all monoclonal antibodies target pathogens however. Some that are approved in humans with cancer perform other functions, like tagging cancer cells so the immune system can recognize them better and fight them.Solensia, the new drug approved for cats, works by attaching itself to a protein called nerve growth factor (NGF) that is involved in the regulation of pain.When frunevetmab, the active ingredient in Solensia, binds to NGF, it prevents the pain signal from reaching the brain."Advancements in modern veterinary medicine have been instrumental in extending the lives of many animals, including cats," said Steven Solomon, director of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, in a statement."But with longer lives come chronic diseases, such as osteoarthritis," he added.Osteoarthritis occurs when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of bones wears thin. Eventually the bones in a joint rub against each other, causing pain and lessening joint movement, and at times leading to bone spurs.Because cats are not good at describing their symptoms, researchers asked their owners about their level of impairment doing activities like jumping onto furniture, using their litter box, or grooming, and compared their abilities to before they developed osteoarthritis.The owners were then asked to assess their cats' response after receiving treatment.Overall, the cats in the treatment group had better assessment scores than those who received placebos during randomized clinical trials.Side-effects of the drug, which is injected under the skin by a veterinarian, included vomiting, diarrhea, injection site pain, scabbing on the head and neck, dermatitis and pruritus (itchy skin). The effects were mild and didn't require the treatment to stop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-approves-new-antibody-treatment-for-arthritic-cats-101642110261251.html

14-01-2022||India||Bomb found in abandoned bag at Delhi flower market||An improvised explosive device (IED) was found in an unclaimed bag at one of the entrances of the largest flower market in Delhi on Friday and was neutralised before its timer could trigger a detonation, sending a Capital-wide security alert days before Republic Day celebrations.The IED weighed roughly 3kg and likely consisted of powerful chemicals like RDX or ammonium nitrate, officials aware of the preliminary finding said, while adding that shrapnel were seen in the device, which could have led to significant harm if detonated.One of the people aware of the matter said they are not ruling out a terror motive and a connection to the explosion that took place in Ludhiana last month, even as the police began a search to identify who placed the bag the spot.The market, the largest for flowers in the city, is usually bustling in the morning hours.Additional deputy police commissioner (east) Vinit Kumar said that at 10.16am, their control room received a call regarding an unattended bag outside gate number 1. A police team immediately reached the spot, cordoned off the area, and alerted other agencies about it, he said.NSG director general MA Ganapathy told HT that “prima facie analysis of samples taken from the bomb site (at Ghazipur Flower Market) suggests RDX and ammonium nitrate was used”. He added that primary findings have been shared with the Delhi Police.A police officer, who did not want to be named, added that the bag was spotted on a pavement by the owner of a scooter, who had come from the market and was about to leave the area.The man first informed the security guard, who called the police. By noon, the bomb squad, sniffer dogs, firemen and fire tenders, special cell sleuths, and experts from the National Security Guard (NSG) arrived, and the market was evacuated.“The bomb experts of the NSG first tried to defuse the IED. But since it had a timer device and may have exploded, the officials decided to destroy it through the controlled explosion. Nobody was hurt in that operation,” added the officer.The controlled explosion was carried out in an eight-foot pit hurriedly dug with the help of an earthmover 100m from the spot where the bag was found.Bomb detection and disposal experts of the NSG collected traces of the explosive materials from the site where it was placed, and from the area where it was destroyed, for further examination.According to some police officers who were at the incident site, the IED contained nearly 3kg of explosive substance and some shrapnel. A timer device was also seen, they said.The NSG has a national bomb data centre which collects, analyses and evaluates all terrorist bombing activities in India and foreign countries. RDX is a military grade explosive which is not sold in the open market and in most of the instances when it has been used in India, its origin has been traced to Pakistan, according to an intelligence official, who asked not to be named.The presence of RDX, if confirmed, could be a significant clue as to the motives or suspects. Punjab’s police chief said late on Friday that a cache of RDX was recovered from close to the border with Pakistan. “IED consignment weighing 5kg approximately which includes 2.7kg RDX recovered by STF from Gharinda area in Amritsar just 2.5km from the international border,” said a tweet from the official account of the Punjab’s director general of police, Viresh Kumar Bhawra.A case under the relevant sections of the Explosive Act was registered by the Delhi Police’s anti-terror squad, the Special Cell.Several police teams have been formed to identify the suspect who planted the IED. The police are scanning CCTV cameras installed in the vicinity of the market for clues.Police presence has been intensified across the city and checking of vehicles at border points around the Ghazipur market were intensified after the recovery of the IED. The Ghazipur vegetable market adjacent to the flower market was open throughout the day.
14-01-2022||India||Unexpected change in weather behind CDS chopper crash: IAF||The December 8 Mi-17V5 crash in which India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat was killed along with 13 others took place due to spatial disorientation of the pilot in bad weather, the Indian Air Force (IAF) said on Friday in its first official statement on the accident.The probe ruled out negligence, mechanical failure, or sabotage as possible causes of the accident, the air force added.“The accident was a result of [the chopper’s] entry into clouds due to unexpected change in weather conditions in the valley. This led to spatial disorientation of the pilot resulting in controlled flight into terrain (CFIT),” the statement said, referring to the preliminary findings of a tri-services probe.HT reported on January 5 that the crash was most likely a CFIT accident with cloudy weather a contributory factor.In aviation parlance, CFIT refers to the accidental collision with terrain of an airworthy aircraft under the flight crew’s full control. In such accidents, the pilot or crew is unaware of the looming danger until it is too late. Loss of situational awareness is a major factor leading to CFIT accidents, as previously reported.“The inquiry team analysed the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder besides questioning all available witnesses to determine the most probable cause of the accident,” the statement added. The recommendations made by the court of inquiry to prevent such accidents are being reviewed.On January 5, IAF made a detailed presentation to defence minister Rajnath Singh on the inquiry report into the Mi-17V5 accident.The Russian-origin helicopter, considered extremely safe and reliable, was fully serviceable when it crashed near Coonoor. The low-flying helicopter flew into cloud cover seconds before it went down in a fireball, barely seven minutes before it was scheduled to land in Wellington.The helicopter took off from the Sulur air base at 11.48am and was scheduled to land at the helipad at the Wellington golf course at 12.15pm. The air traffic control at Sulur, however, lost contact with the helicopter at 12.08pm, 20 minutes after it took off.IAF is expected to review protocols governing flights ferrying important people. Rawat was on a visit to the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington to deliver a talk when the Mi-17V5 crashed.Those killed in the crash included the CDS’s wife Madhulika Raje Singh Rawat, his defence assistant Brigadier LS Lidder, Lieutenant Colonel Harjinder Singh, Wing Commander Prithvi Singh Chauhan, the pilot of the Mi-17V5, Squadron Leader Kuldeep Singh, the co-pilot, Junior Warrant Officer Rana Pratap Das, Junior Warrant Officer Arakkal Pradeep, Havildar Satpal Rai, Naik Gursewak Singh, Naik Jitendra Kumar, Lance Naik Vivek Kumar and Lance Naik B Sai Teja.The sole survivor of the crash, Group Captain Varun Singh, breathed his last on December 15 after a week-long fight against death.Developed by Russian Helicopters, the Mi-17V5 is designed to carry personnel, cargo and equipment. The Mi-17V5 can carry a load of around four tonnes in a full cargo role. It can also insert assault forces behind the enemy lines, a role frequently demonstrated by the IAF during military exercises.The helicopter is equipped with modern avionics, a self-defence system and other advanced features that enhance its survivability. The Mi-17V5, which has an armoured cockpit, can be fitted with rockets, cannons and small arms for carrying out offensive roles. It has a service ceiling of 6,000 metres, top speed of 250 kmph and a maximum range of around 1,180 km with additional fuel tanks.The bottomline is that mountains and clouds are a terrible combination, said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “We have had such losses in the North-east before. IAF will take measures after studying the findings of the inquiry into the December 8 crash,” he added.
14-01-2022||India||Why lockdowns won’t work in the current wave||The seven-day rolling average of cases in India has been rising every day since December 27 or for 18 days. From 6,780 on December 27 (the lowest this number has dropped since May 2020), it went to 193,418 on January 13. While average deaths were not rising initially, they have started inching upwards since January 4 in states excluding Kerala (more on this later). Does this mean we are headed for a crisis like the one seen during the second wave caused by the Delta variant? Should lockdowns be imposed to reduce deaths? An HT analysis suggests that such measures may not be necessary and can actually hurt. Here are four charts that show why.Deaths set to be much lower than 2nd wave despite Omicron’s rapid rise in casesThe seven-day average of deaths at the national-level does not seem to be increasing consistently despite the average for cases increasing every day since December 27. This is simply because Kerala, which has accounted for over half the daily deaths in this period, has been reconciling its figures for past deaths (that happened pre-Omicron) on a daily basis. It therefore makes sense to look at numbers excluding Kerala.Taking a daily increase in average cases for 14 days as the marker for a wave’s beginning, the second wave can be said to have begun outside of Kerala on February 12 last year and the current wave on December 22. On the 23rd day of the wave, the seven-day average of the case fatality rate (CFR), or deaths as a proportion of cases, was 0.64% during the Delta wave last year and is nearly a tenth of that (0.07%) in the Omicron wave.
14-01-2022||India||What dip in Delhi, Mumbai daily Covid cases may indicate: 5 points||The daily Covid-19 infections reported from Mumbai have settled after breaching the 20,000-mark. Delhi too on Friday reported a decline as its 24-hour tally fell below 25,000. Earlier in the day, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had said that the Covid-19 situation seems to be stabilising in the national Capital. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also said that there is no reason to worry, as hospitalisation and death rates remain low. "If corona cases begin to decline, we will relax the restrictions," Kejriwal said.Here are 5 points to know about the present trend in Delhi and Mumbai1. Satyendar Jain said the positivity rate keeps on changing, but the main factor is hospitalisation, which is low in the Capital. Delhi's case positivity rate on Friday rose above 30%. The dip in the 24-hour tally came a day after Delhi reported the highest-ever spike with 28,867 cases.2. An official told PTI that in the last 24 hours, the number of testing has also dropped, which can be attributed to the change in testing guidelines. In an advisory issued earlier this week, the (central) government had said that asymptomatic patients undergoing surgical/non-surgical invasive procedures should not be tested unless warranted or symptoms develop.3. Maharashtra on Friday reported 43,211 fresh infections out of which 11,317 infections were from Mumbai. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday said that the fluctuation in the number of daily infections was because of the change in testing protocols.4. Experts are divided on whether hospitalisation or case positivity rate is the right indicator of a peak. "The number of daily cases and the positivity rate should be used to determine the peak. Hospitalisation depends on the criteria adopted for admission (in a particular region). Of course, hospitalisation is an important parameter for public health planning purposes, but not for describing a peak," Dr Chandrakant Lahariya said.Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, vice chairman of the research cell of Kerala's unit of Indian Medical Association, said test positivity rate can not be relied upon as the sole parameter as it depends on the willingness of people to come forward and get tested.5. Experts earlier said that the wave driven by Omicron will peak very soon and will decline very soon. The World Health Organization on Friday said Africa's 4th pandemic wave has started flattening after a six-week surge. The Omicron surge in India started with metro cities but the dip might be because of the fluctuation in testing numbers and not a statement on the wave yet, experts believe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-dip-in-delhi-mumbai-daily-covid-cases-may-indicate-5-points-101642181233542.html
14-01-2022||India||Mistakes of 2021 being repeated; unnecessary medication, tests should be avoided: Doctors write to govt||As many as 32 prominent doctors from India and abroad have written a letter to the Union as well as state governments and warned about "inappropriate" diagnostic methods and medications being used to deal with the current wave of the coronavirus pandemic. "Wanton use of drugs" can be harmful, as seen during the earlier two waves of the pandemic, they warned in the open letter. “Despite the weight of available evidence and the crushing death toll of the delta wave, we find the mistakes of the 2021 response being repeated in 2022 during the clinical management of Covid-19. We urge you to intervene to stop the use of medications and diagnostics that are inappropriate for clinical management of Covid-19,” the letter said. The "vast majority of patients" who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms will require little or no medication, it said. "Most prescriptions we have reviewed in the past two weeks include several Covid-19 “kits” and cocktails. The prescribing of vitamin combinations, azithromycin, doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir and ivermectin for treating Covid-19 is irrational practice,” said the doctors. Outbreaks of fungal infections like mucormycosis in India and aspergillosis in Brazil were attributed to the widespread abuse of inappropriate medications, the letter pointed out. It also said that most Covid-19 patients will need no additional tests after the initial positive rapid antigen or PCR test, except, in some cases, home monitoring of oxygen levels. The Omicron variant can infect even those who had contracted the infection earlier or who are vaccinated, but the "mortality" will be lower among these patients, it said. “However, CT scans and a battery of laboratory tests like d-dimer and IL-6 are routinely being prescribed by practitioners across the country in asymptomatic and mild cases, placing undue financial burden on families,” the letter said. Patients are being admitted to hospitals "without clinical justification," which adds to such burden and also leads to non-Covid patients not getting hospital bed in emergency, it warned. The government as well as medical associations must put an end to such practises, the letter said. The signatories to the letter included Dr Sanjay Nagral of Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai; Dr Cyriac Abby Phillips, the Liver Institute, Rajagiri Hospital, Kerala; Dr Rajani Bhat, Bengaluru; Dr Bharat Gopal, Delhi and Dr Richa Gupta, Christian Medical College, Vellore. The group also included some Indian-origin doctors living in the US and Canada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mistakes-of-2021-being-repeated-unnecessary-medication-tests-should-be-avoided-doctors-write-to-govt-101642180519822.html
14-01-2022||India||Sino-India trade at record $125 billion amid border tension; deficit widens||BEIJING: Trade between India and China reached a record $125 billion in 2021 despite the worst chill in bilateral ties in decades, Chinese customs data showed on Friday. Two-way trade between India and China in 2021 stood at $125.66 billion, up 43.3 percent from 2020 when bilateral trade was worth $87.6 billion. In 2021, China’s exports to India were $97.52 billion, up 46.2 percent, while China imported $28.14 billion worth of goods from India, up 34.2 percent, according to statistics released by the General Administration of Customs (GAC) and quoted by the tabloid, Global Times, on Friday. Trade deficit between the two countries remained much in favour of China – at $69 billion. The deficit in trade has been a constant source of friction between New Delhi and Beijing with India complaining that China, despite promises, hasn’t given Indian companies access to sectors like pharmaceuticals. India was China’s 15th largest trade partner in 2021, according to GAC. “Analysts attributed the surge in trade to the complementary aspects of the industrial chains of the two countries. For example, about 50-60 percent of chemicals and other materials used by the Indian pharmaceutical industry, which is a pillar industry, are imported from China,” the Global Times report said. India-China trade in 2020 declined by 5.6 percent to $87.6 billion, the lowest since 2017. But China still overtook the US to become India’s largest trading partner last year. Chinese companies saw an increase in demand from India for medical equipment in the first half of the year following a devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. The widening trade deficit with China, according to an explanatory note published online by the Indian embassy, can be attributed to two factors: narrow basket of commodities, mostly primary, for exporting to China and the lack of market access for most India’s agricultural products and the sectors where India is competitive in, such as pharmaceuticals and IT. The Chinese report said amid bilateral tensions, the trade data “..is just another piece of proof that New Delhi is unable to reduce its dependence on the Chinese market”. Indian and Chinese border troops have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May, 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both the sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border. Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now. Separately, GAC data showed Friday that trade between China and the US soared by 28.7 percent and amounted to $755.6 billion in 2021 - maintaining a strong growth momentum and contributing 12 percent to China’s record $6 trillion foreign trade for the year. China’s exports to the US increased by 27.5 percent in 2021, while imports grew by 32.7 percent, reaching $179.53 billion. “The US maintained its place as China’s third-largest trade partner following ASEAN and the European Union. China-US trade was twice China’s trade with its fourth-largest trade partner Japan - which was 2.4 trillion yuan,” the Global Times reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sinoindia-trade-at-record-125-billion-amid-border-tension-deficit-widens-101642180809440.html
14-01-2022||India||Agra man buys nomination papers for his 94th election as contestant||A 75-year-old ex-revenue staff is all set to contest his 94th election, as he bought nomination papers on Friday for the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls.Hasnuram Ambedkari, a former revenue department clerk, has already contested and lost 93 elections since 1985, the year he first entered the electoral fray.Ambedkari told PTI that in 1985 he quit his job as an ‘Amin’ in the district administration after he was promised a ticket from Fatehpur Sikri seat.But when the time came, the party refused to honour its end of the bargain and instead made fun of him, he said.“As I left my job, the party refused to give me the ticket and mocked me saying I would not be able to get a single vote in the election."After that I determined to contest the election independently to send them a message. I contested my first election from Fatehpur Sikri for the state assembly in the year 1985,” he said, adding with pride that he came “third”."And since then I have been contesting every election despite knowing that I would lose. I have contested and lost 93 elections."Asked about his name, he said he is a follower of BR Ambedkar, India’s first law minister and a Dalit icon.He said he was actively associated with the Backward and Minority Communities Employees' Federation (BAMCEF) from 1977 to 1985.Ambedkari said he has contested elections for gram pradhan, state assembly, gram panchayat, MLC, and Lok Sabha, and once went to the extent of applying for the post of President of India, but was rejected.His determination to win despite losing 100 per cent of the times got him the moniker ‘Dhartipakad’ in the area, which locals use to describe one’s adamancy."This year, I bought nomination papers for the Agra Rural and Kheragarh constituencies.

Recently, the American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention warned that people should watch out for pale, grey or blue-coloured skin, lips and nails.Omicron has recorded a departure from the traditional Covid symptoms as loss of smell and taste and breathing troubles are rarely present in Omicron cases. Scratchy throat and some other common cold and flu-like symptoms have been associated with Omicron. The absence of respiratory problems has made Omicron appear less severe but as experts warn against taking Omicron lightly, doctors treating Omicron also said many patients may report high fever in the first few days.Here is all we know about Covid symptoms since the beginning1. Cough, cold and fever are common symptoms of Covid, be it Omicron or Delta.2. Sore throat is a very common symptom of Omicron, not so much of Delta, but it may happen sometimes.3. Headache, tiredness, body pain are apparently more prominent symptoms of Omicron than Delta.4. Breathing problem is a very rare symptom of Omicron, very common of Delta,5. Covid-19 clinical researcher Dr Swapneil Parikh said upper respiratory symptoms (cold, cough, sore throat) plus prominent GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) plus fever plus pain in the lower back and lower limbs are common symptoms of Omicron. "Starting to see a clinical picture of a self-limiting viral myositis (muscle pain, weakness) in many patients," Dr Parikh recently tweeted.6. Dr Lancelot Pinto pointed out four prominent symptoms of Omicron: Fever for a couple of days, a lot of body ache, sore throat, occasionally loose motion.According to experts, the symptoms have evolved because of the mutation that the virus has undergone. Also, the symptoms vary from person to person, depending on their immunity, vaccination status. Symptoms only offer clues and are not sure-shot ways to know about the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-alpha-delta-to-omicron-how-covid-19-symptoms-changed-101642177573708.html

Two persons were on the run while one surrendered for previous cases in Rampur court, Uttar Pradesh, to evade arrest. “We had formed 10 teams of police to nab the culprits involved in the cow slaughtering case that took place on Monday in Rudrapur. It had caused communal tension but was pacified by the police with immediate action. A person was arrested on Friday from Mahtosh Mod,” said DS Kunwar, senior superintendent of police (SSP), US Nagar on Friday. He said body parts of a cow and a calf were found in the morning on Monday at an empty plot in front of a banquet hall on Shayam Talkies road in Rudrapur. Communal tension was erupted in Rudrapur and besides police, Seema Sashastra Bal personnel were to be deployed to calm down the tension.

14-01-2022||India||Philippines confirms move to acquire BrahMos cruise missiles in $375 mn deal||NEW DELHI: The Philippines confirmed on Friday it will acquire three batteries of the BrahMos cruise missile jointly developed by India and Russia in a deal worth almost $375 million, a development expected to boost India’s efforts to become a major exporter of defence hardware. The defence deal is unlikely to go down well with China, whose aggressive behaviour in the disputed South China Sea has taken relations with the Philippines to a fresh low. The Philippine Marines intend to use the BrahMos as a shore-based anti-ship missile. Philippine defence secretary Delfin Lorenzana said he had recently signed the “notice of award” – or the acceptance of India’s proposal for supplying the missile – for the Philippine Navy’s shore-based anti-ship missile acquisition project. “Negotiated with the Government of India, it includes the delivery of three batteries, training for operators and maintainers as well as the necessary Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) package,” Lorenzana said in a brief post on his Facebook page. The deal for the BrahMos was conceptualised as early as 2017, and the office of the Philippines president “approved its inclusion in the Horizon 2 Priority Projects in 2020”, he added. Hindustan Times had first reported in December 2019 that the Philippines was set to become the first country to buy the BrahMos missile system. Both sides were keen on signing the deal during a proposed visit by President Rodrigo Duterte early in 2021, but the plan fell through because of widespread disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The notice of award signed by Lorenzana on December 31 put the value of the BrahMos deal at $374.962 million. Last month, the Philippines government allocated 2.8 billion pesos ($55.5 million) for initial funding for the weapon system. A team from the Philippine Navy visited the production unit of BrahMos Aerospace in Hyderabad in December as part of the acquisition process. “The Coastal Defense Regiment of the Philippine Marines will be the primary employer of this modern strategic defense capability of the Armed Forces of the Philippines,” Lorenzana said. There was no official word from the Indian side, though Sudhir Mishra, who was till recently the CEO of BrahMos Aerospace, said in a tweet: “As then CEO and MD, worked on the Philippines contract for the past five years very hard connecting people, dots, procedures & unseen forces. BrahMos has shown the way for high value defence exports.” According to the government, policy changes have resulted in defence exports increasing by more than 325% over the last five years. India has set an ambitious target of achieving defence exports of $5 billion by 2024. The country exported defence gear worth ₹8,434.84 crore during 2020-21. However, the BrahMos deal is being seen as a game changer as India’s defence exports so far have been items such as avionics, coastal surveillance systems, spares for radars, personal protective items, and offshore patrol vessels. The deal with the Philippines could open the door for further sales of the BrahMos – which has a range of 290 km and can carry a 200-kg warhead – to other Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia, which have been engaged in negotiations for the weapon system for several years. One of the potential areas for use of the BrahMos by the Philippines is the South China Sea. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled that a specific portion of the South China Sea claimed by both China and the Philippines belonged to the Philippines alone. China rejected the ruling and has continued to send its vessels into the disputed waters. The Philippines military is currently implementing a revised modernisation programme and signed a contract for two corvettes with South Korea’s Hyundai Heavy Industries on December 28. The Philippines also plans to sign contracts for 36 Black Hawk helicopters and six offshore patrol vessels in 2022. Former Indian Navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash said about the BrahMos deal in a tweet: “This is a long-delayed decision, which could alter the India-China strategic equation. By arming its Indo-Pacific friends, India not only helps bolster their security, but also gives China a dose of its own medicine! Vietnam & Indonesia, too, are waiting.”

Karnataka health minister shows data as Bengaluru reports over 20,000 infections||Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar who is a physician on Friday claimed that the ongoing third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is much faster than the first two waves. According to Karnataka's pandemic figures, a comparison of which was published by the health ministry, in the first wave the doubling rate of the Covid-19 cases started with 2 days and then reached 33 days. In the second wave, the rate declined from 10 days to 8 days, but in the ongoing third wave which, according to the state figures, started from December 27, the doubling rate remained between 3-5 days. 3rd wave is much faster than the first two waves. How fast is it actually? Here's a look at the doubling rates of all three waves.#COVID19 #Omicron #ThirdWave #doublingrate pic.twitter.com/GmmViAn2aHWhat is the doubling rate? The number of days in which the cases become double in numbers denote the doubling rate of Covid. If the doubling rate is low, it means the virus is spreading faster. In Karnataka, the doubling rate between December 27, 2021, and January 9, 2022, remained 3 days. And the rate is only going down with the fast spread of Omicron, which is driving the present surge. While on January 9, Karnataka reported 12,000 infections, on Friday, Bengaluru alone reported over 20,000 infections. Karnataka accounted for 28,723 cases with a positivity rate of 12.98%.Hospitalisation is much lower during the ongoing wave, the health minister said showing data. But he asserted that this is not a reason for complacency. In the 2nd week of May 2021, there were over 3 lakh active cases in Karnataka and the hospitalisation rate was 22%. In the first 11 days of January, the active cases reached over 62,000 with only 6% hospitalisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-fast-is-covid-s-3rd-wave-karnataka-health-minister-shows-data-as-bengaluru-reports-over-20-000-infections-101642172689877.html
14-01-2022||India||Activist Prashant Rahi acquitted in 2007 Maoist case||RUDRAPUR: The Uddam Singh Nagar district session court has acquitted activist Prashant Rahi and three others who were accused on the charges of sedition and waging war against the State. “Four persons including a resident of Maharashtra and a woman have been acquitted by the session court of US Nagar from the sedition and waging a war against the State charges. We are moving to the high court for appeal against the verdict,” said Laxmi Narayan Patwa, additional district government counsel (ADGC)-crime, US Nagar on Friday. According to the police, an FIR was lodged on December 20, 2007 by the then local intelligence unit (LIU) inspector BL Madhwal in Nanakmatta police station of US Nagar against Prashant Rahi of Nasik in Maharashtra, Gopal Datt Bhatt, Khim Singh Bora (both from Haldwani) and Devendra Chamyal of Almora. They were booked under sections of waging war against the State, sedition, provocation for causing riots and conspiracy. Rahi was arrested from Hanspur Khatta forest of Nanakmatta on December 22, 2007. Later, Deepak Chandra Pandey alias Chetan of Kashipur and Chandrakala of Haldwani were also named in the FIR and arrested in 2008 and 2009 respectively. All four had been on bail from the court since 2011. But Rahi was arrested by Maharashtra police in 2013 under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and is still in jail in Maharashtra after conviction for a Gadchiroli case. Police recovered a laptop, pen drive and CDs from Rahi and sent those to the Computer Forensic Science Division in Hyderabad for examinations. Their report verified that whatever data was found in the laptop and CD was related with Naxalites activities, said ADGC Laxmi Narayan Patwa. On January 7, Rahi, Chetan, Bhatt and Chandrakala were acquitted by the court of session judge Prem Singh Khimal from all charges giving them benefit of doubt. Prosecution failed to produce concrete evidence to prove the charges, a government official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activist-prashant-rahi-acquitted-in-2007-maoist-case-101642172228912.html
14-01-2022||India||Pilot’s disorientation in bad weather led to CDS Bipin Rawat chopper crash: IAF||NEW DELHI: The December 8 Mi-17V5 crash in which India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat was killed along with 13 others took place due to spatial disorientation of the pilot in bad weather, the Indian Air Force (IAF) said on Friday in its first official statement on the accident. “The accident was a result of (the chopper’s) entry into clouds due to unexpected change in weather conditions in the valley. This led to spatial disorientation of the pilot resulting in controlled flight into terrain (CFIT),” the statement said, referring to the preliminary findings of a tri-services probe. Hindustan Times reported on January 5 that the crash was most likely a CFIT accident with cloudy weather a contributory factor.In aviation parlance, CFIT refers to the accidental collision with terrain of an airworthy aircraft under the flight crew’s full control. In such accidents, the pilot or crew is unaware of the looming danger until it is too late. Loss of situational awareness is a major factor leading to CFIT accidents, as previously reported. The probe ruled out negligence.The court of inquiry has ruled out mechanical failure, sabotage or negligence as a cause of the accident, the air force said. “The inquiry team analysed the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder besides questioning all available witnesses to determine the most probable cause of the accident,” the statement added. The recommendations made by the court of inquiry to prevent such accidents are being reviewed. IAF on January 5 made a detailed presentation to defence minister Rajnath Singh on the inquiry report into the Mi-17V5 accident. The Russian-origin helicopter, considered extremely safe and reliable, was fully serviceable when it crashed near Coonoor. The low-flying helicopter flew into a cloud cover seconds before it went down in a fireball, barely seven minutes before it was scheduled to land in Wellington.The helicopter took off from the Sulur air base at 11.48am and was scheduled to land at the helipad at the Wellington golf course at 12.15pm. The air traffic control at Sulur, however, lost contact with the helicopter at 12.08pm, 20 minutes after it took off. IAF is expected to review protocols governing flights ferrying important people. Rawat was on a visit to the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington to deliver a talk when the Mi-17V5 crashed. Those killed in the crash included the CDS’s wife Madhulika Raje Singh Rawat, his defence assistant Brigadier LS Lidder, Lieutenant Colonel Harjinder Singh, Wing Commander Prithvi Singh Chauhan, the pilot of the Mi-17V5, Squadron Leader Kuldeep Singh, the co-pilot, Junior Warrant Officer Rana Pratap Das, Junior Warrant Officer Arakkal Pradeep, Havildar Satpal Rai, Naik Gursewak Singh, Naik Jitendra Kumar, Lance Naik Vivek Kumar and Lance Naik B Sai Teja. The sole survivor of the crash, Group Captain Varun Singh, breathed his last on December 15 after putting up a week-long fight against death. Developed by Russian Helicopters, the Mi-17V5 is designed to carry personnel, cargo and equipment. The Mi-17V5 can carry a load of around four tonnes in a full cargo role. It can also insert assault forces behind the enemy lines, a role frequently demonstrated by the IAF during military exercises. The helicopter is equipped with modern avionics, a self-defence system and other advanced features that enhance its survivability. The Mi-17V5, which has an armoured cockpit, can be fitted with rockets, cannons and small arms for carrying out offensive roles. It has a service ceiling of 6,000 metre, top speed of 250 kmph and a maximum range of around 1,180 km with additional fuel tanks.
14-01-2022||India||Delhi, Colombo should build on Trincomalee deal with broader strategy’: Lankan envoy||NEW DELHI: India and Sri Lanka should forge a larger strategic framework that builds on the Indian presence in key projects such as the Trincomalee oil tank farm and Colombo port and benefits both countries, Sri Lankan high commissioner Milinda Moragoda has said.Moragoda sought to play down Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s recent remarks that no “third party” should interfere in China-Sri Lanka ties by citing the comments of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, who said that China is a very close friend of Sri Lanka while India “is our brother and sister”.Sri Lanka inked a deal with a subsidiary of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) last week for the long-gestating project to refurbish and develop the British-era Trincomalee oil farm, an 850-acre storage facility with a capacity of almost one million tonnes.State-owned Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Adani Group finalised a deal last year to develop the west container terminal at Colombo port. Dredging work at the terminal is expected to start later this month. In an “integrated country strategy” document that Moragoda prepared before assuming office in India last year, he suggested that the two sides should evolve from a transactional stage to a strategic, and then a special relationship. He said in an interview on Thursday the time has come for both sides to move on from the transactional phase and look at the bigger picture, including integrating Sri Lanka into India’s overall energy security policy.“The west terminal [at Colombo port] and the tank farm are two very important transactions, As I see it, the two sides should move seamlessly into the strategic area,” he said, adding he perceived the Trincomalee deal as “integrating Sri Lanka with India in the petroleum, oil and gas sector”.The two sides should jointly develop a business plan for the Trincomalee tank farm that accounts for projections that India’s energy needs will grow by 50% by 2030 and the need for refining capacity will go up 30%. The two sides can look into joint oil and gas exploration in the Cauvery basin and developing a refining facility at Trincomalee, Moragoda said.“For us, Trincomalee could potentially be a petroleum hub for India, both for storage and refining. Trincomalee can only service India, it is too far away from sea lanes...We need to think strategically and that’s going to be the next step. Looking at this narrowly as a tank farm transaction would be wrong,” he said.Oil storage and refining facilities at Trincomalee will also boost Sri Lanka’s energy security. “As India is the world’s third-largest energy consumer, it can get much better deals for petroleum than Sri Lanka. We can work with India on our requirements and it will give us energy security,” he said.Asked about Chinese foreign minister Wang’s remarks, during a recent visit to Colombo, that no “third party” should interfere in China-Sri Lanka relations, Moragoda said: “For us, the relationship with India is the relationship with India. Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa always has a very pithy way of putting things and when he was asked about this, he always said China is a very close friend, but India is our brother and sister.”He added, “So it’s a different relationship. For us to interpret that comment doesn’t make sense, given the relationship with India.”Wang’s remarks were widely perceived in New Delhi as a reference to India, especially against the backdrop of India’s opposition to projects under the Belt and Road Initiative in the neighbourhood.Cooperation on the Trincomalee tank farm, held up since 1987, has been followed by Indian assistance for Sri Lanka to overcome a severe economic crisis, including depleting foreign currency reserves that experts believe can lead to a default on external debt. Following a meeting with Indian envoy Gopal Baglay in Colombo on Thursday, Sri Lanka’s Central Bank governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal tweeted India will provide a Saarc currency swap and other forms of cooperation.The Saarc currency swap will be for $400 million and India has deferred $500 million due to the Asian Clearing Union for two months. Moragoda said more developments are expected in this regard in the coming weeks.Sri Lanka expects to get a revolving credit line of $500 million from India’s Exim Bank for buying petrol and diesel and another package for emergency purchases of food and medicines. Steps are being taken to operationalise a line of credit offered by India for counter-terrorism efforts and a grant for a naval floating dock, Moragoda said.“Sri Lanka is the largest recipient of Indian defence scholarships, and at any time 600 to 700 of our personnel are training in India. We want to increase this and expand it to the police,” he said.“We’re planning to use the Aadhar card as a template for Sri Lanka’s ID card. Our president is very, very enthusiastic about it. He’s also the minister in-charge of the science and technology sector. Those discussions are ongoing,” he added.

In the 6th year of the government’s flagship initiative Startup India, startups from different sectors, including agriculture, health, enterprise systems, space, industry 4.0, security, fintech, and environment, will meet and interact with the Prime Minister. “More than 150 startups have been divided into six working groups based on themes including Growing from Roots; Nudging the DNA; From Local to Global; Technology of Future; Building Champions in Manufacturing; and Sustainable Development,” announced the Prime Minister’s Office. Each group will then make a presentation to PM Modi. The interaction between the PM and the startups aims to understand how startups can successfully contribute to the nation’s needs. The PM’s Office added that PM Modi has been a firm believer in the potential that startups hold in contributing to the growth and development of the nation. Reminiscing success of the past years, the PMO added, “This has had a tremendous impact on the startup ecosystem in the country, and has led to a staggering growth of unicorns in the country.” In June 2021, the government announced that under the Startup India flagship, over 50,000 startups have been recognised since the initiative’s creation in 2016, and since then 5.5 lakh jobs have been created. Startup India initiative was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 16, 2016 with an intention to catalyse startup culture and build a strong and inclusive ecosystem for innovation and entrepreneurship in India. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry acts as the nodal department for the initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-interact-with-over-150-startups-on-january-15-101642167728564.html
14-01-2022||India||CDS chopper crash: Bipin Rawat's copter entered into clouds because of sudden weather change, says preliminary report||The preliminary finding of the tri-service investigation into the fatal crash of the Mi-17V5, which led to the death of all 14 who were on board, including Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, has ruled out mechanical failure, sabotage or negligence as the cause of the accident. The inquiry team said the accident was a result of the helicopter entering into the clouds due to an unexpected change in the weather conditions in the valley in Tamil Nadu, where it crashed. The change of weather led to spatial disorientation of the pilot resulting in a controlled flight into terrain, a statement issued by the defence ministry said. This is the official finding of the tri-service investigation team headed by Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari and Air Marshal Manvendra Singh. On January 5, they apprised defence minister Rajnath Singh on the findings of the probe.CDS Rawat chopper crash a CFIT accident, say officialsIt was reported that the crash in Coonor was a controlled flight into terrain accident which refers to the accidental collision with terrain of an airworthy aircraft under the flight crew’s full control. In such accidents, the pilot or the crew are unaware of the danger until it is too late, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration.Such CFIT may take place because of human error or a navigation problem as well which, however, have been ruled out in this particular case, in the official findings.On December 8, CDS Rawat, his wife Madhulika Rawat and 12 other Army personnel boarded the copter from Sulur airbase to Wellington airbase. Minutes before the copter was scheduled to reach its destination, the Sulur airbase control room lost contact with the chopper.Visuals of the helicopter captured by locals before the crash had shown that the chopper was flying at a low altitude and it was cloudy.Bipin Rawat's defence advisor Brigadier LS Lidder, staff officer to the Chief of Defence Staff, Lt Col Harjinder Singh and decorated pilot Group Captain Varun Singh were among 13 others killed in the crash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cds-chopper-crash-primary-report-rules-out-mechanical-failure-negligence-101642166924147.html
14-01-2022||India||Kerala nun rape: unusual case that witnessed many twists and turns||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala nun rape case, in which a court in Kottayam on Friday acquitted bishop Franco Mullakal of all charges, was the first case in the country in which a bishop was the accused and the complainant was a nun who once worked under him. Earlier many priests have faced sexual harassment and assault charges from believers, but this is the first time one from the ordained flock turned against the powerful diocese head attracting widespread attention. The unusual case witnessed many twists and turns in three years including some medical tests on the victim (there is a bar on reporting court proceedings) and some witnesses have turned hostile. Though many activists and a miniscule section of the clergy rallied behind agitating nuns the powerful church stood with the Bishop. And some churches in Kottayam held special prayers each time he appeared in the court. And once acquitted, Franco Mullakal did his routine, attending a holy mass in a church in Kallathipadi in Kottayam on Friday. Interestingly, Mullakal was the first to approach the police. In a complaint to Kottayam SP S Harishankar in the first week of May 2018, he said a nun and her relatives were planning to hoist a sexual harassment case on him for removing her from the post of the Mother Superior. Later the police registered a case based on his complaint. At that time the nun was reportedly running around church heads with her alleged rape compliant including Cardinal Mar George Alancherry, the senior-most Catholic priest of the country. She also appealed to the Vatican envoy, her fellow nuns later said, adding she turned to police as a last resort. Almost a month later, she filed a complaint with Kuruvilanghad police station in June 2018 in which she said she was sexually assaulted by the bishop several times between 2014 and 2018. She said he also subjected her to unnatural sex and criminal intimidation and she was scared to open up. In the FIR she said the first assault took place on April 24, 2014 at room no. 20 of the church guest house at Kuruvilanghad, Kottayam. The case attracted national attention after five fellow nuns, who came in support of the victim, started a sit-in protest on September 8 in Kochi seeking the arrest of Mullakal. Their protests continued till his arrest on September 21, 2018. Mullakkal spent 25 days in jail, and later he got the bail. The special investigation team filed the charge-sheet on April 9, 2010 and the trial began in September 2020. Some of the witnesses were high-profile ones. Besides Cardinal Allancherry and Bishops of Bhagalpur and Ujjain, 25 nuns and 11 priests were there among the 83 witnesses. Fourteen witnesses turned hostile. There were many attempts to delay the trial and Mullakal’s discharge pleas were rejected by the Kerala high court and the Supreme Court.The trial was further delayed due to Covid-19 pandemic. During the trial in July 2020, Mullakkal reportedly abstained from hearing saying that his area was declared as a containment zone but later prosecution submitted a list of the containment zones in Jalandhar in which the Bishop’s house was not there.

It also plans to include genetic tests when it screens patients for potential Covid-19 infections as soon as the end of June.The research from the Medical University of Bialystok estimates that the gene could be present in about 14% of the Polish population, compared with around 9% in Europe and 27% in India. It’s the fourth most important factor determining the severity of the illness after age, weight and gender, it said.  A genetic test “may help to better identify people who, in the event of an infection, may be at risk of an acute disease, even before the infection develops,” said Marcin Moniuszko, a professor in charge of the study, which was carried out with the participation of almost 1,500 Poles. The ministry didn’t say if the research had been peer-reviewed.The discovery may explain one of the reasons -- other than vaccination hesitancy -- behind the country’s high Covid-19 death toll. The average excess mortality during the pandemic is above 20%, one of the worst results in the European Union, Eurostat data show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/polish-scientists-discover-gene-that-increases-risk-of-dying-from-covid19-101642164100690.html

An additional 6.35 lakh doses have been received today. As per their weekly consumption data available on Co-WIN, the average consumption by Maharashtra for Covaxin to cover the eligible beneficiaries for 15-17 years and for precaution dose is almost 2.94 lakh doses per day. Therefore, the State has adequate vaccine doses for about 10 days to cover the eligible beneficiaries with Covaxin,” the ministry said in its clarification.Also read | Maharashtra seeks 9 million jabs, urges Centre to make vaccination mandatory“Furthermore, for Covishield, the state has 1.24 crore unutilized and balance doses available as on date. With an average consumption of 3.57 lakhs per day, this will sustain for more than 30 days for the beneficiaries to be vaccinated using the vaccine,” it added, saying that the media reports were not “factually correct” and “does not represent the correct picture” regarding the vaccine availability in Maharashtra.The ministry’s statement came a day after state health minister Rajesh Tope, on Thursday, demanded additional vaccine shots from the Centre, saying that there was a shortage due to the administration of precautionary third doses and the inclusion of beneficiaries in the 15 to 17 age group.“Vaccination drive for teenagers and precaution doses are being given to senior citizens, frontline and healthcare workers. Due to this, we are facing the shortage of Covaxin and Covishield. We have demanded additional 50 lakh Covishield doses and 40 lakh Covaxin doses from the Central government,” news agency ANI quoted Tope as saying.As many as 142,460,889 doses of the vaccine have been administered in Maharashtra so far, including 262,409 precautionary doses. Also, 2,427,711 doses have been administered to those in the 15 to 17 group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ill-informed-incorrect-centre-on-vaccine-shortage-in-maharashtra-says-adequate-doses-remain-with-state-101642164564435.html

The case was lodged by a woman against her husband and in-laws for subjecting her to cruelty.The apex court's observations came while hearing an appeal against an order passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana dismissing a plea by a man seeking permission to return to the US, where he is employed.The high court had rejected the man's prayer to leave the country as he was arrayed as an accused along with his elder brother and parents under sections Sections 323 (voluntary causing hurt), 34 (common intention), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) 498A and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.“Taking custody of jewellery for safety cannot constitute cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A of the IPC.“Failure to control an adult brother, living independently, or giving advice to the complainant to adjust to avoid vindictive retaliation cannot constitute cruelty on the part of the Appellant within the meaning of Section 498A of the IPC,” the apex court bench said in a recent order.It said the complainant (daughter-in-law) has not given any particulars of the jewellery that had allegedly been taken by her mother-in-law and brother-in- law.There is not a whisper of whether any jewellery is lying with the petitioner, it said.“There is only a general omnibus allegation that all the accused ruined the life of the complainant by misrepresentation, concealment, etc…“The Appellant is not liable for the acts of cruelty, or any other wrongful and/or criminal acts on the part of his parents or brother,” the apex court said.The top court said considering the nature of the allegations, it is not understood how and why the petitioner should have been detained in India.  “In our considered opinion, the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kurukshetra, erred in directing the appellant not to leave the country without prior permission of the Court.It said the allegations in the complaint against the petitioner prima facie do not disclose any offence under Section 498A of the IPC, which contemplates cruelty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taking-custody-of-bride-s-jewellery-for-safety-not-cruelty-under-section-498a-of-ipc-says-sc-101642161670995.html

Mishra, who was going from Kanpur to Guwahati in the S6 coach, said: “The train crossed the Jalpaiguri Road station running at full speed. Just half an hour later, I felt sudden jerk and most of the passengers tumbled down from the upper berths. Moments later came a second jerk and by that time all passengers were on the floor. Immediately after came the third jerk and by that time everything was finished.” Twelve coaches of the train got derailed in the accident. Mishra’s description matched exactly with the version of the driver Pradip Kumar, who escaped unscathed and later spoke to media persons. “All the signals including the home signal, starter and advanced were showing green. The train was given a go ahead by the station master of the approaching station and we were moving ahead. But as we approached the advanced signal, I felt a sudden jerk. It was a massive jerk and the engine started swaying,” said Kumar. Out of instinct he applied the emergency brakes and the train came to a grinding halt. As he peeped out of the window he saw a cloud of dust. “I immediately climbed down and went to the rear end. I didn’t have to go too far. There the compartments were lying derailed and crumbled on top of another like some matchboxes,” he added. Another passenger Siddharth from Kerala who was travelling from New Jalpaiguri to Guwahati in coach number S3 said: “All coaches after the one in which I was travelling derailed at around 5 pm and I saw many dying in front of my eyes.” He boarded the special train arranged by the railways and reached Guwahati on Friday morning. Rukia Khatun was travelling from Jaipur to Guwahati with her seven-year-old daughter Sahita. As everything turned haywire, Sahita went missing and Rukia was crying and praying for her daughter’s safety till late Thursday night. Krishna Das a resident of Uttar Maumamari under Mynaguri police station, Jalpaiguri district, where the accident happened had gone to buy potatoes when he heard a big bang. Das said: “I saw the train coaches derailing and the coach S5 riding on S6. I rushed to the accident site and rescued four people. One of them died while I was still holding him.” Gautam Barman a resident of Cooch Behar who was brought with minor injury on his left hand said: “I was to get down at New Cooch Behar station and I was preparing for the same.” Travelling in S6 coach, he was near the bathroom where there was no crowd. “When the first jerk came at 5 pm, passengers started falling over each other. I would have died or injured seriously had I not gone near the bathroom,” he told reporters at Jalpaiguri district hospital where he was admitted and released on Friday morning.

Hundreds of lives were saved after the take-off was immediately rejected, news agency ANI reported."EK-524 from Dubai-Hyderabad was accelerating for take-off from runway 30R, when the crew saw an aircraft coming in the same direction at high speed. Take-off was immediately instructed by ATC to be rejected. The aircraft slowed down safely and cleared the runway via taxiway N4, which crossed the runway. Another emirates flight EK-568, from Dubai to Bangalore, was rolling for departure was to take-off from same runway 30R," a person aware of the incident told ANI.The Bengaluru-bound flight took off and the Hyderabad-bound flight went back to the taxi bay to wait.

14-01-2022||India||Why children are getting more infected by Covid during 3rd wave: Experts answer||In the first two waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, children were the least affected population, but now they are increasingly getting infected in the third wave, driven by the Omicron variant. Experts said more data is required from India to find out whether there is an increase in the rate of infection in India. In a seminar organised by AIIMS on managing children with Covid-19, Dr Rakesh Lodha, Head, Professor, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, AIIMS, Delhi, said there are many likely reasons why children are getting frequently affected -- more contagious Omicron being the primary reason.Apart from that, lowering of the guard, complete state of unlocking, mass gatherings, lack of adherence to distancing and mask etc have contributed to the vulnerability.There has been no dramatic increase in the number of children getting infected, Dr Lodha said, adding that the absolute numbers have increased proportionately to the increase in the number of cases.Children were so far somewhat protected from Covid as fewer children have comorbidities. Also, children respond to the virus in a better way. Omicron, however, has become like measles with an R-value of around 10 (global). "The Omicron is clearly more contagious and against the values of R nought, which kind of gives an idea about how contagious it is, how easily it can spread. Various groups have estimated it to be much higher than what was there for delta and for the original virus. It's believed to be more than seven, some groups have estimated even to be close to 10 or more than 10. And in that scenario, it comes close to measles which is a highly contagious disease that we see children," Dr Lodha said."There is also been a lot of concern about the severity of illness in children in this current wave with some reports from hospitals in the US claiming that they are seeing an increased number of children being admitted," AIIMS, New Delhi, Director Dr Randeep Guleria said.Symptoms of Covid-19 in children and treatment according to guidelinesMild symptoms: Fever, sore throat, rhinorrhea, cough.Treatment: Home isolation, paracetamol 10-15mg/kg/dose, may repeat every 4-6 hours. Warm saline gargles in older children, adequate nutrition and hydration.Cough suppressants, antibiotics, steroids, molnupiravir, fluvoxamine, sortrovimab etc., are not indicatedDanger signs: Difficulty in breathing, blue ips or face, chest pain, new confusion, inability to drink or keep down any liquids, not interacting when awakeModerate symptoms: Fast breathing, Oxygen level between 90 to 94%.Treatment: Admit in a dedicated Covid facility.Severe: ARDS, Sepsis, septic shock, MODS, Oxygen level below 90%Treatment: Admit in hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-children-are-getting-infected-by-covid-during-3rd-wave-experts-answer-101642155168321.html

The revelation comes in the backdrop of an intensifying global fight against the ongoing climate crisis.The mean air temperature in 2021 was 0.44 degrees Celsius above normal, says the IMD report. In 2016, the mean air temperature was 0.71°C higher than normal; 0.55°C in 2009; 0.54°C in 2017 and 0.53°C in 2010. In the 121 years between 1901 and last year, the mean temperature rose by 0.63°C above normal.IMD scientists said a particularly warm winter and the post-monsoon season in 2021 led to the increase in mean temperature last year.In the winter months of January and February last year, the seasonal mean temperature was 0.78°C above normal and during the post monsoon season, between October and December, the mean temperature was 0.42°C higher than normal.Also Read: John Kerry to visit India soon to take climate dialogue forwardAlso, the country last year witnessed a rise in the annual rainfall, which was 105% of its long-period average (LPA). Rainfall during the southwest monsoon season, from June to September, was normal at 99% of the LPA. Notably, the northeast monsoon period saw rainfall at 171% of the LPA - record highest since 1901.Heavy rainfall and flood-related incidents claimed over 750 lives last year, while thunderstorms and lightning killed at least 780 people in different parts of the country, the IMD data shows.There were five cyclonic storms in 2021 - Tauktae over the Arabian Sea (May 14-19); Yaas over the Bay of Bengal (May 23-28); Shaheen over the Arabian Sea (September 29-October 4); Gulab over the Bay of Bengal (September 24-28) and most recently, Jawad over the Bay of Bengal (December 2-6). The most devastating of them was Tauktae, which slammed the Saurashtra coastline on May 17, eventually claiming at least 144 lives.On Thursday, Nasa and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released analyses of global weather station and ocean measurements that showed the last eight years were the hottest in global records that date to 1880, with 2021 ranking as the sixth-hottest year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2021-was-the-fifth-warmest-year-for-india-since-1901-reveals-imd-data-101642152067268.html

We will bring an act in Madhya Pradesh to regulate online gaming. The draft is almost ready for it. We will soon give it a concrete shape,” the state home minister said. According to the police, Suryansh Ojha allegedly committed suicide, while playing Free Fire game with his cousin in a room on the terrace of their house in Bhopal’s Shankracharya Nagar. When his cousin stepped out, Suryansh allegedly hanged himself using a rope used for setting up a punching bag in the room. The boy's family immediately rushed him to a hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival, it was stated. The post-mortem report has confirmed that the boy had died of hanging, an official said on Friday. Prima facie, it appears that the boy took the extreme step because he was too involved in online games, he said. The boy was hyperactive and addicted to online gaming, additional deputy commissioner of police Ankit Jaiswal said. Suryansh had even stolen money from his home to pay for a gaming application and his parents scolded him for that, the official said. “The cause behind the extreme step is being ascertained. However, it looks like it just happened while playing the online game or practising some acts shown in it,” Jaiswal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-govt-to-bring-in-law-to-regulate-online-gaming-minister-101642151420140.html

14-01-2022||India||First arrest made in the hate speech case||The Uttarakhand Police on Thursday arrested Jitendra Narayan Tyagi, the former Uttar Pradesh Shia Waqf Board chairman who until last month went by the name Waseem Rizvi, in connection with hate speeches made at a three-day-long Dharam Sansad held in Haridwar on December 17-19.This is the first arrest in the case registered on December 23 after public uproar as videos of the event were widely circulated on social media and comes a day after the Supreme Court sought a response from the state government on what it had done about the alleged hate speeches made at the Dharam Sansad (religious parliament).Station house officer of the Haridwar police station, Rakendra Kathait, said Tyagi was arrested from the Narsain area on the border of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. Both states go to the polls next month, and identity is expected to be a key issue in the two elections.“Tyagi was booked under IPC Section 153 A at Haridwar police station last month on the complaint of a Jwalapur resident on charges of promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion during the Dharam Sansad,” he said, adding that three cases have been filed against Tyagi.“He has been making repeated offences so police arrested him. Other accused have been served notices. Requisite legal process is on in the ongoing probe,” said senior superintendent of Haridwar, Yogendra Singh Rawat.IPC Section 153A deals with Promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony.Yati Narsinghanand, the organiser of the event, who was with Tyagi at the time of his arrest, condemned the action by the police, and said it would made seers realise a larger “hidden agenda” to weaken the Sanatan Dharma (ancient Hindu faith).Narsinghanand is the Mahamandaleshwar (sect chief) of the influential Juna Akhada, and one of the five accused named in the FIR. He also said that he will sit on a fast at Haridraw’s iconic Har Ki Pauri, from January 14 to protest against Tyagi’s arrest.“Wasim Rizvi converted to Hinduism despite knowing well the consequences from Muslim clerics and fundamentalists. So, it is now our responsibility to save and protect him,” Narsinghanand said.Soon after the event which ended on December 19, videos of objectionable speeches made had gone viral on social media. Participants called for violence against religious minorities whole one of the speakers said he wished to shoot former prime minister Manmohan Singh.On Wednesday, a special investigation team (SIT) formed by the Uttarakhand Police to probe the Dharam Sansad hate speech case recorded the statements of two of the five named accused, including Tyagi, and at least 12 “witnesses”. This development came hours after the Supreme Court issued a notice to the state government seeking an answer on the action taken by it while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) that contended not enough was being done to bring the accused to book.“The SIT in its ongoing investigation of the case has so far questioned two of the five named accused -- Jitendra Narayan Tyagi, formerly Waseem Rizvi and Annapurna Maa,” one of the officers in the SIT said on condition of anonymity. “Their statements were recorded on Wednesday. Apart from this, SIT also recorded the statements of 12 more people as witness in the case including the complainants of the case. Police will soon question the other three remaining accused.”Superintendent of police, Dehradun (rural), Kamlesh Upadhyay, who is heading the SIT, said: “Police are taking all necessary actions in its probe as per law. Under that, it has recorded statements of two named accused and some witnesses.”The first information report, filed by the police on December 23, initially listed only one accused, Tyagi.On December 25, names of Pooja Shakun Pandey alias Annapurna Maa, and Dharamdas Maharaj, a general secretary of the Hindu Mahasabha, were added. On January 1, police added the names of event organiser Narsinghanand and Sagar Sindhu Maharaj. Another case was registered on the following day against Tyagi over the same incident.A second case was also lodged against Narsinghanand at a Haridwar police station on charges of insulting religious beliefs, and making derogatory remarks about women. The complaint was filed by a third-year law student Ruchika (who goes by her first name), police said.“The case against Swami Yati Narsinghanand has been registered under Section 295 (a) (insulting a religion with deliberate and malicious acts) and 509 (intending to insult the modesty of a woman). We are probing the matter and checking the video footage which the complainant has related to,” said the station house office of the city police station, Rakendra Kathait.Narsinghanand, who is based at Dasna Temple in Ghaziabad, said that he did not say anything that offended or insulted women. “I have no clue to which statement the said complainant has referred to. I don’t say anything derogatory to women, I will check it as I return to Haridwar. I have always been vocal about Sanatan Dharma and making India a Vedic nation,” he said.

As a result, they are facing challenges and thus affects their morale and also creates frustration among them,” Sarkar said in the letter. Tripura has 12 battalions of TSR; the first battalion was formed in 1984.Besides duties in poll-bound states, the trooper companies are deployed in Delhi on internal security duties and in Chhatisgarh, for security in mining operations of a company under Coal India Limited.The chief minister’s office hasn’t reacted on Manik Sarkar’s letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bring-back-state-troopers-deployed-in-other-states-manik-sarkar-to-biplab-k-deb-101642105323975.html
14-01-2022||India||Congress suspends Mekedatu Padayatra amid Covid surge in Bengaluru||The Karnataka Congress on Thursday temporarily called off its Mekedatu march, terming it a “sacrifice” in the interest of the state and its people, a day after the state government prohibited inter-district and intra-district (within Ramanagara) movement of vehicles and persons for participating in the padyatra.“Today, we are sacrificing this protest,” DK Shivakumar, president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC), said on Thursday in Ramanagara, about 50 km from Bengaluru.Shivakumar said this was just a temporary break, emphasising the ‘Nama Neeru Namma Hakku’ padayatra will resume soon, without specifying the date.“We are ending the #MekedatuPadayatre as of now due to increasing #Covid19 cases in Bengaluru. Our main priority is the well-being of our people. We will restart the Padayatre as soon as the #Covid19 cases are reduced & restrictions are removed,” senior Congress leader and the leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah said in a Twitter post.The Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government on Wednesday evening banned participation in the padayatra in the backdrop of a steep rise in Covid-19 cases across the state. The government’s decision came hours after the Karnataka high court came down on the government for its inaction and the Congress for its defiance of restrictions.Senior Congress leaders held a meeting in Ramanagara district on Thursday after the government’s order, in which several leaders expressed their concerns over continuing the padayatra.The several hundreds who had gathered in Ramanagara remained in the district for a few hours before Congress leaders addressed them and asked them to return to their districts.The suspension of the march, meanwhile, triggered a war of words between the Congress and the ruling BJP with both accusing each other of aiding the spread of Covid-19 cases.“@BJP4Karnataka govt was always interested in covering up their failure in #Covid19 mgmt by pointing fingers at the opposition. It has failed both politically & administratively to ensure justice to the victims of #Covid19,” Siddaramaiah said.Several BJP leaders had been holding events with large gatherings up until the first week of January.“The government constantly tried to persuade Congress to stop (the) padayatra. The government handled this situation in a very mature manner without use of force like lathicharge or arrest. Padayatra has indeed led to (a) surge in cases and Congress is responsible for this,” Dr K Sudhakar, state’s health minister said on Thursday.The Congress’ 10-day long padayatra demanding implementation of the Mekedatu project, to which neighbouring Tamil Nadu is opposed, continued for the fourth day on Wednesday for a distance of about 15 km from Chikkenahalli to Ramanagara, with participation of hundreds of party workers and supporters. The padayatra that began on 9 January, spanning a distance of nearly 139 km, was scheduled to conclude at Basavanagudi in Bengaluru on January 19. Police have already filed three FIRs against Congress leaders, including Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah, for taking out the march defying Covid-19 curbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-suspends-mekedatu-padayatra-amid-covid-surge-in-bengaluru-101642104242618.html
14-01-2022||India||West Bengal’s daily Covid-19 cases cross second wave peak as surge continues||West Bengal became the first region in the country where the Covid-19 wave, or average daily cases, has surpassed the peak of the brutal second wave, data shows, as nearly 265,000 new cases were detected in India on Thursday, the most in a day across the country since May 19, 2021.With 23,467 new cases reported across West Bengal on Thursday, the seven-day average of daily infections – a number that is commonly referred to as the case curve of a region – in the state has now touched 21,044. This means that it has become the first state in the country where the recent Omicron surge has sent numbers past last year’s surge when the average daily cases peaked at 20,085. A second region, Chandigarh, is perilously close to surpassing its second wave peak, data shows.
14-01-2022||India||Madras HC awards ₹10 lakh compensation||ChennaiThe aimless shooting by a Narikurava, engaged by a local panchayat in Perambalur district to eliminate stray dogs, has cost the State exchequer and the local body, ₹5 lakh each.A direction to this effect was given by Justice S M Subramaniam of the Madras High Court, while allowing a writ petition from one G Babu, recently.The case of the petitioner was that the local panchayat had engaged the services of Vijayakumar, a Narikurava (member belonging to an indigenous community), to shoot down the stray dogs in the village. The indiscriminate and aimless shooting by Vijayakumar had resulted in one bullet hitting leg of Vijaya, petitioner’s mother, in February, 2015. She was admitted to the government hospital, but died later. He moved the High Court for a direction to the authorities concerned to compensate him for causing the death of his mother due to the “negligent, lethargic and irresponsible act” of the Eraiyur panchayat office-bearers and to take action against them.Allowing the petition, the judge observed that the petitioner could establish a prima facie case and the death of his mother occurred due to the illegal operation conducted by the panchayat people. Shooting the stray dogs itself was an illegal act. The Panchayat office-bearers thereby, committed the act of illegality and an offence. The prosecution has been initiated and it was for them to defend their case before the competent Court of law. However, the petitioner was entitled for compensation as the 5th respondent is the president and the remaining two were the Councilors. It is an unusual incident where the responsible Panchayat president and Councilors had engaged Vijayakumar for shooting the stray dogs in the Village. The very operation itself was illegal and further the bullet removed from the mother of the petitioner during post-mortem confirms that the death occurred due to the bullet injuries.“Under these circumstances, this Court is inclined to consider the case of the petitioner for grant of compensation. Unfortunately, the official respondents 1 to 4 -- Collector and police higher ups in the district -- have not shown any sensitiveness in this matter nor initiated appropriate immediate action, contrarily they had slowed down the actions and thereby colluded in a passive manner.” “ Even the passive collusion of the public authorities can never be tolerated. The illegal operations made by the respondents 5 to 8 were not seriously taken nor immediate actions were initiated,” the judge said.This being the factum established, the panchayat people are directed to jointly pay ₹5 lakh to the petitioner towards compensation. Further, the Collector shall pay ₹5 lakh to the petitioner. Thus, the petitioner is entitled for a total compensation of ₹10 lakh and the four respondents shall settle their respective portion of the compensation in favour of the petitioner within eight weeks, the judge said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-awards-10-lakh-compensation-101642102862028.html
14-01-2022||India||Senior CPI(M) leader’s ‘China praise’ courts row||Communist Party of India (Marxist) politburo member S Ramachandran Pillai courted a controversy on Thursday after he said the Indian’s government’s anti-China policy is aimed at destabilising Communist movement in the country.Addressing the inaugural session of the party district committee meeting in Kottayam, the senior leader said the government was provoking the public over China to attack the Communist movement, especially the CPI(M). “We will have to face this deliberate attempt from our political rivals,” he said showering enough praises on the neighbouring country.“China’s growth shows power of socialism. They played a key role in eliminating poverty in the world. But there is a conspiracy against it to undermine its progress and socialism. America is teaming up with other countries against China. We have also surrendered our foreign policy to the United States of America,” he said. Congress general secretary K C Venugopal has slammed the senior leader, saying his utterances were against the country. “They expose ideological bankruptcy of the party. Many Communists still believe China is their mother country. China is arming some of our neighbours to act against India and make armed incursions frequently in northern borders. How can the party justify such a country? His utterances are anti-national,” he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-cpi-m-leader-s-china-praise-courts-row-101642102741876.html

I don’t know why Sree Narayana Guru’s tableau was rejected. We have no idea why the Centre is against the social reformer and we want to know the state BJP also sharing this bias. The float was avoided at the eleventh hour and concerned people owe an explanation to the state,” said state education minister V Sivankutty.He said initially selection board members lauded the idea but later dropped it reasons best known to them. He said the state’s tableaus were rejected twice earlier in 2019 and 2020 and the Centre is taking on the state for opposing some of its anti-people policies.CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan also criticised the Centre’s decision. He said the centre’s move was an insult to the social reformer. When asked about this a senior leader of the BJP said he was not aware of the issue and will respond after checking facts. When the state’s tableau was rejected in 2020 then culture minister A K Balan said “it was a politically motivated move and the centre can’t dictate terms to the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-ministry-rejects-kerala-s-republic-day-tableau-again-101642102562061.html
14-01-2022||India||TN govt-governor relationship comes under strain||Chennai: The growing frustration of the ruling DMK government against Governor R N Ravi is reaching a crescendo with the party’s parliamentary leader in Delhi demanding his resignation, the education minister informing the assembly that the state is considering taking over his powers to appoint university vice chancellors. Chief minister M K Stalin has though taken a milder stand urging Ravi to forward the NEET exemption Bill to the President which he hasn’t for more than three months now. The developments come amidst criticism that the DMK has softened its stance with respect to the office of the governor since it came to power in May as the party when in opposition had admonished the previous AIADMK regime of being acquiescent over burning issues of the state. Most governments in Tamil Nadu have had an uneasy relationship with governors especially when the parties leading in the union and the state governments are not in a coalition and are at loggerheads over legislation. “We wanted a Governor who will work for the welfare of the people and not someone who will create a stalemate,” says senior advocate and DMK MP P Wilson. “This is not good for the functioning of the state,” he said in context of the issue of NEET.After Tamil Nadu passed the Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill, 2021 in September seeking exemption from NEET and restoring the state’s process of medical admissions by considering only Class 12 marks, the DMK government has been sending reminders to the governor to forward it to the President. Last week, DMK parliamentary leader T R Baalu in less than tactful language said the governor can leave Tamil Nadu. “What happens if he sits on every piece of legislation like this?” asks Wilson. “This Bill is a reflection of the will of the people. He shouldn’t be reeling under pressure, if there is any. Under article 200 the Governor has to act as soon as possible.” Wilson adds that the urgency in the matter is due to the end of the academic year approaching and medical aspirants are unclear. “Every day is important for students, teachers and parents and the state.”Another issue brewing is that the state is planning to clip the powers of the governor to appoint vice chancellors to universities by bringing in a resolution. “During the assembly session for presenting the Budget in March, we will certainly adopt a resolution unanimously,” said CM Stalin in the House last Thursday. Stalin’s statement came following higher education minister K Ponmudi’s response in the assembly during the question hour. Ponmudi had said that the chief minister is consulting legal experts to bring an amendment on this. “In many places, state governments hold the power to appoint vice-chancellors,” Ponmudi had said, citing examples from other Indian states. He pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he was Gujarat chief minister also held the powers to appoint the vice chancellors. A government official said steps are being taken on the matter though this amendment too would be sent to the governor. “The state is within its powers to bring in this amendment and steps are being taken towards that,” the official said not wishing to be quoted. During the previous regime led by NDA ally the AIADMK, political observers say that the BJP used the prerogatives of governor as chancellor to choose vice chancellors in at least five state universities including the prestigious University of Madras and the Anna University (for Engineering and Technical Education). The row over Anna University’s ex-vice chancellor M K Surappa is pending in the Madras high court. The previous AIADMK regime initiated an inquiry into corruption allegations against Surappa–the only time it went against its ally the BJP as the national party backed him. During a hearing last year, the court was informed that the then Governor Banwarilal Purohit was “deeply anguished” and didn’t agree with the state on questioning Surappa. A day ago, the court refused to accept the state government’s argument that it is up to the Governor to decide on taking action against Surappa based on the inquiry report. The current procedure followed in Tamil Nadu is that the Governor as the Chancellor of state universities appoints vice-chancellors from a shortlist of three names submitted by a committee.Following Purohit’s transfer to Punjab, former Nagaland interlocutor Ravi was appointed to Tamil Nadu in September. Experts say the BJP-led Centre wanted a “tactician” such as R N Ravi as Governor for Tamil Nadu as a political attache to control the state like they did in the neighbouring UT of Puducherry. They say that from the time late chief minister J Jayalalithaa was hospitalised and died in office, the governors of Tamil Nadu have interfered in the state’s political affairs. “The AIADMK seemed like an extended office of the Governor for years,” says political commentator Ramu Manivannan. “The DMK is taking a strong exception to the new Governor. Ravi looks different from his predecessors because he’s a bureaucrat so he will do things like a civil servant. But he will follow the dictum of the BJP and the central leadership.”HT reached out to the office of the Governor for a comment but they did not respond.

More than 5,000 menstrual cups have been distributed among girls and women and they have been given training by volunteers for three months about their use and advantages, said organisers of a campaign, “Avalkayi” (for her). “Beautiful village Kumbalangi will be a role model for others. Schemes like this will empower women. If villages prosper, our country will prosper,” said the governor in his inaugural address.Ernakulam MP Hibi Eden initiated the “Avalkayi” campaign under the Pradan Mantri Sansad Adarsh Gram Yogana.“We have been working on it for many months. The Indian Oil Corporation and Hindustan Lifecare Limited Management Academy are partners in it,” said the MP. He said the campaign aims at making women aware of advantages of menstrual cups and dispelling their fears. Eden said the latest initiative will help reduce pollution caused by synthetic napkins and ensure personal hygiene to working women and students. He said many people, including actor Parvathi, have helped him to carry out the project. “We have installed napkin-vending machines in many schools but often they created problems. Then this idea came up and we studied it in detail and sought expert advice. Experts said cup can be re-used for many years and it is more hygienic,” said the young parliamentarian.Experts said menstrual cups are a safe option compared with other forms of menstrual hygiene. They said a cup, made of medical grade silicon and latex, can last up to 10 years and it is cost-effective and environment-friendly compared to different menstrual products. “We have to change with the times. After Kumbalangi, we will distribute them in coastal areas of Kochi and give training,” said the MP. Kumbalangi, an island village on the outskirts of Kochi surrounded by backwaters, is the first eco-tourism village of the country and known for its traditional Chinese nets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hamlet-in-kerala-becomes-country-s-first-napkin-free-village-101642102261894.html
14-01-2022||India||Ex-minister Rajenthra Balaji’s saga of controversy, corruption charges, police chase and brief relief by SC||Chennai: Former AIADMK minister K T Rajenthra Balaji, who turned a fugitive, is briefly free after six police teams chased him for over a fortnight in connection with two cases related to a job scam, raided his lawyer and finally arrested him in Karnataka and brought him back to Tamil Nadu to send him to jail.But the Supreme Court on Wednesday questioned the Tamil Nadu police for arresting him during the pendency of his bail plea and granted Balaji interim bail for four weeks. After the Madras high court on December 17 last year had dismissed his anticipatory bail application, Balaji went into hiding and police have been on the hunt since. He challenged the dismissals with two special leave petitions in the top court. The charge against Balaji is that during his tenure as dairy minister, he promised some youngsters government jobs at the state-owned dairy organisation, Aavin, after collecting ₹ 3 crore. Though the ruling DMK has been closing the walls on former AIADMK ministers on corruption charges with raids undertaken by the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC), Balaji, unlike his peers, doesn’t enjoy the support of the AIADMK high command.In public, the AIADMK called the police action against Balaji a political vengeance – a standard cry that the main opposition has adopted after the DMK formed the government in May. “Senthil Balaji faced a similar case, will the DMK government arrest him too?” asked an AIADMK leader not wishing to be identified. Senthil Balaji moved from the AIADMK to the breakaway faction of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhgam led by TTV Dhinakaran and finally joined the DMK in 2018 and was rewarded the portfolio of minister for the electricity and excise duty which he currently occupies. He faced a case of promising jobs and swindling money during his tenure as AIADMK’s transport minister (2011-2015). However, the top AIADMK leadership has not spoken in support of Rajenthra Balaji during the search for him, his arrest and not after the top court granted him bail.Balaji, who was inducted into the cabinet by late J Jayalalithaa, is known to embarrass the AIADMK with his actions. In the run-up to the 2019 parliamentary elections, Balaji called Prime Minister Narendra Modi their daddy. “Modi is our (AIADMK’s) daddy. India’s daddy,” he had said, which subjected the then ruling AIADMK to much ridicule amidst growing discontent that the state government was being subservient to the BJP-led union government. His pro-Hindutva leanings are not secret either. Balaji called for cutting off actor-politician Kamal Haasan’s tongue after the latter described Nathuram Godse as India’s first Hindu extremist. In August last year, amidst reports that Balaji would join the BJP in Delhi, former chief minister and joint coordinator of the AIADMK had to clarify publicly that the information is “100% fake.”Amidst this background, questions have been raised if the BJP was helping Balaji stay out of the radar. BJP’s Tamil Nadu president K Annamalai dismissed this, saying the BJP has no necessity to do this. “The basics of criminal jurisprudence is that everyone is innocent until proven guilty by the court. That is our standard and we are not defending any individual,” Annamalai had told reporters earlier this month. The saga around Balaji has however put the state police in an embarrassing situation – first for not being able to find him and now a rap from the Supreme Court. Police arrested Balaji on January 5 from Hassan in Karnataka just a day before the appeal was listed in the Supreme Court. Balaji’s counsel Dushyant Dave submitted that the events surrounding the petitioner’s arrest were extremely suspicious. The counsel also submitted that, after his arrest, the petitioner was taken 300 kms away to a jail in Trichy district from the jurisdiction of the place from where he was arrested. “Learned senior counsel further submitted that no summon was ever served on the petitioner to join the investigation and even the premises of the petitioner’s local advocate were raided by the police,” the Supreme Court bench comprising Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli said in their orders. Based on this, the bench granted him bail with four conditions including that he cooperates with the investigation. The matter has been posted after three weeks. “The manner in which the police handled this case smacks of vendetta,” says political commentator Maalan Narayanan. “But Balaji is a patriarch of a small area and isn’t in the inner circle of Palaniswami so he may not get much support from them and he has been inclined towards the BJP. The AIADMK used Balaji in the south region to thwart Dhinakaran’s influence. If he is absolved of charges, I won’t be surprised if the BJP takes him in to build their base in the south.”
14-01-2022||India||Why Michael Lobo’s switch is a shot in the arm for Goa Congress||PANAJI: When Goa Minister Michael Lobo finally announced that he was quitting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and joining the Congress, the ruling party attempted to project that his departure will not have a bearing on the party’s prospects for the upcoming polls and if anything, Lobo was digging his own grave with his political move. The Congress, on the other hand, welcomed Lobo with open arms not only with jubilation but also relief -- relief that the aggressive Trinamool Congress wasn’t able to steal him from their grasp.Lobo, along with his wife Delilah, joined the Congress on Tuesday evening promising to help the party win a majority in the state.In many ways, Lobo’s departure from the BJP and into the Congress is against the tide in Goa’s choppy pre-election waters. Over the last few weeks, the BJP has brought over four sitting MLAs -- Rohan Khaunte (independent), Jayesh Salgaocar (Goa Forward), Ravi Naik (Congress) and Govind Gaude (independent), and also lost four -- Alina Saldanha (AAP), Pravin Zantye (Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party), Carlos Almeida (Congress) and now Michael Lobo (Congress).“Those who are leaving know that they are not going to be given the BJP ticket and are aware of the party’s internal survey which indicated that they are facing anti-incumbency. Those who are joining us, they know that the party is going to win the elections and we have the information that with our party’s strength combined with their popularity they will get elected so we take them in,” BJP in-charge Devendra Fadnavis said at a Press conference in Goa on Wednesday.That may be true for all who left the BJP, except for one - Michael Lobo. Of all the MLAs who have left, the BJP has reacted sharply only to Lobo’s exit.“Michael Lobo took full advantage of the party for as long as he could. Now he wanted a ticket for his wife as well, which he couldn’t get in the BJP while the Congress will give a ticket to his wife also so he has gone to the Congress,” Fadnavis said.A winnable candidate who has decided that his interests would be best served if he joined the Congress - a party that until a few months ago was being written off and taunted for the stunning decline in its seats in the Goa Legislative Assembly from 17 to just 2.“Lobo was facing pressure from his constituents over continuing in the BJP - pressure over the party’s lackadaisical performance on various fronts including the economy, the state leadership and he felt his chances would be better in the Congress. He gauged the sentiments of the people and made his move,” lawyer Jatin Naik, a political observer, said.“Lobo also sensed that he would be given a larger role in the Congress and will now promptly occupy a significant role as an important second-rung leader (after Digambar Kamat) in the Congress and could even become the deputy chief minister if the Congress comes to power,” Naik said.Others suggest that it is Lobo’s desire to one day become the chief minister of Goa -- something that may not be possible in the BJP -- as evidenced by the fact that the Goa BJP’s earliest Christian face Francisco D’Souza who was Manohar Parrikar’s deputy when he was asked take charge as the country’s defence minister, was overlooked for the post in favour of Laxmikant Parsekar owing to Parsekar’s RSS roots. Something similar happened in 2019 after Parrikar’s death when several senior BJP leaders were overlooked in favour of Pramod Sawant, an RSS-honed leader largely.“Seeing what was done to Francisco D’Souza, Lobo saw the possibility of becoming chief minister one day only in the Congress,” Clive de Souza, a political commentator said.In remarks to the media after joining Congress, Lobo hinted that there were “some leaders within the BJP who didn’t want to see him grow” as one of the reasons why he felt “unwanted” in the BJP that led him to switch sides.The move has come as a shot in the arm for the ‘principal’ opposition party, who needed Lobo more than Lobo needed them.Having lost nearly all of its second-rung leadership to the BJP with the departure of 10 of its 15 remaining MLAs back in 2015, the Congress was staring at a void that was further accentuated by the departure of leaders like former chief minister Luizinho Faleiro and Reginaldo Lourenço to Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress. Lobo will promptly occupy that space and bring with him leaders with considerable heft.Lobo could be overestimating his popularity and political heft, but he brings with him candidates who have a fighting chance of winning four of the seven seats in Bardez, a coastal taluka in North Goa. Lobo plans to field his wife Delilah in neighbouring Siolim constituency as well as his aides Kedar Naik and Sudhir Kandolkar in Saligao and Mapusa constituencies respectively where he claims he has influence. Without Lobo, the Congress would be significantly weaker in the taluka that is the second-largest chunk of seats in the 40-member Goa legislative assembly.To be sure, Lobo was being wooed by the Trinamool Congress as well but he rejected their overtures, pointing that they were a party from Bengal and wouldn’t find acceptability in Goa.His entry into the Congress has prompted some Congress leaders to put in their papers and they are expected to join the Trinamool Congress while the BJP has brought in Gurudas Shirodkar, an old-timer in an effort to fill the void left behind by Lobo’s exit.But it won’t be smooth sailing for Lobo in the Congress.“His decision to try and expand his influence beyond the taluka he represents and his unabashed ambition will not be well received by all and Lobo may yet realise he may have bitten off more than he can chew,” a journalist with a local newspaper who declined to be named, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-assembly-elections-why-michael-lobo-s-switch-is-a-shot-in-the-arm-for-goa-congress-101642102143896.html

The incident came to light after videos of the chase went viral on the social media on Friday.The videos show assistant reserve sub-inspector Varun Alva, jumping out of his car after seeing a commotion at a distance and running towards a man escaping from the scene. The chase through small alleys ends in the police officer arresting a man in a blue shirt.The man was later identified as 32-year-old Harish Poojary, who along with his accomplices, was accused of stealing the mobile phone of a migrant worker from Bihar. The man whose phone was stolen reportedly worked at a granite factory and he was sleeping at Nehru Grounds when the incident occurred.Police commissioner N Shashi Kumar told reporters that even he was at the junction when the incident took place. He saw a man chasing another man, whom the police officer tracked down. The man identified as 20-year-old Samanth confessed to stealing mobiles and said that his associates had the other phones.The police asked Shamanth to call his accomplices and tell them to come to Mangaluru Central Railway Station. As police were following Shamanth near Hampankatte, Poojari ran to escape police and ASI Alva chased down the suspect.“He tried to enter an auto rickshaw but they gave chase to the auto rickshaw and pulled Poojari out. The suspect got of the vehicle only to flee from the spot. Varun chased and pinned him down,” said a senior official.Mangaluru South Police have registered a case of robbery and are on the lookout for another accused, Rajesh, a resident of Ullal, who is said to be part of the gang.Complimenting police personnel led by Varun, commissioner Shashi Kumar announced a cash reward of ₹10,000 for them on Thursday.

14-01-2022||India||Covid impact: Karnataka’s Renuka temple records dip in revenue||Amid the surge in Covid cases, the Renuka temple at Savadatti taluk of Belagavi district, about 500km from Bengaluru, in Karnataka, which has been shut again, is witnessing a sharp decline in revenue.“We were expecting a revenue of around ₹5-6 crore in January and February as two major fairs occur during this time. But unfortunately, we had to shut down the temple due to the pandemic again,” said temple administrator Ravi Kotargasti.The temple dedicated to deity Renuka Yallamma is among the top ten highest revenue earning temples in Karnataka.The temple was constructed in 16th century following the Chalukyan and Rashtrakuta styles of architecture by renowned sculptor Jakanacharya.The temple had generated a revenue of around ₹2 crore in the 20 days it remained open after the first Covid wave, from February 1 to 20, 2021. According to temple management authorities, the revenue generated from September 28, 2021, to January 6, 2022, was almost ₹4 crore.The annual revenue of the last four years before the pandemic was around ₹16-17 crore.Owing to frequent restrictions due to the pandemic, several religious establishments have seen a dip in revenue in the last two years. Belagavi was among the most impacted regions of the state in the second Covid wave.During the first Covid-19 wave, the temple was closed on March 18, 2020. It was again opened for devotees on February 1, 2021. However, owing to the second wave, the temple doors were shut again till September 28, 2021. It was again closed from January 6 this year, due to the onset of the third wave of infections. “Renuka Yallamma temple is probably one of the most impacted temples and has been shut for the longest durations compared to others across the country,” claimed temple administrator Kotargasti.According to the state government, maximum pandemic cases in bordering Maharashtra state is also one of the reasons behind the closing the temple. Around 50% of devotees visiting the temple are from Maharashtra while 40% are from the North Karnataka district. The remaining 10% come from other parts of Karnataka and neighbouring states. “Closure of the temple was necessary because majority of the devotees are from rural areas; many among them are uneducated and not aware. Apprising them of the government’s guidelines regarding Covid is not easy. So, it was better to shut the temple instead of taking any risk,” said Kotargasti. “This is not like other pilgrimages. The culture and way of worshipping the deity is unique. Devotees who come from long distances stay in surrounding areas for a day or two. They prepare five different dishes to offer to the Jogappas community. They bring along the wooden logs, utensils and ingredients required to prepare the food. This religious service is called Padalige Seve,” he said.Earlier, the temple witnessed huge rush every Tuesday and Friday but in recent years, Sundays have also become a favourite among the visitors. Over 15 lakh devotees visit the temple during three major occasions: Hostila Hunnime in December, Banada Hunnima in January, and Bharat Hunnime in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-impact-karnataka-s-renuka-temple-records-dip-in-revenue-101642101483725.html
14-01-2022||India||Karnataka seeks Centre’s help to fight Covid surge||The state government on Thursday sought the assistance of the central government to increase number of hospital beds and oxygen plants to treat critical patients after a rapid surge of Covid-19 cases in the state.“I sought the central assistance to raise the oxygenated beds and oxygen plants,” chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said after a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday.In a statement, the chief minister’s office (CMO) on Thursday said that the prime minister had instructed the state governments to make preparations based on the experience of the first and second wave and deploy them in the ongoing third wave of infections that is expected to peak in February.The statements come even as the number of Covid-19 infections in Karnataka sees a rapid surge and record daily cases, adding to apprehensions that the situation was rapidly spiralling out of control in the state.“After second wave, at a total cost of ₹243 crore, we have established an additional 6,386 oxygen beds and 2,928 ICU beds in 147 taluk hospitals. 665 oxygen beds and 263 ICU beds have been added in 19 district hospitals at a cost of ₹25 crores. 217 out of 266 PSA oxygen plants allotted to Karnataka are operational. 3,460 ventilators and 8,100 oxygen concentrators are available,” Dr K Sudhakar, minister for health, family welfare and medical education said on Thursday.Karnataka is witnessing an exponential increase in new infections.Karnataka recorded 25,005 new infections in a 24-hour-period, taking the active caseload to 115733, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department on Thursday. Positivity rate was at 12.39% and eight more people succumbed to the virus, taking the toll to 38397, data shows. Bengaluru, which accounts for over 75% of all active cases in the state, recorded 18374 in a 24-hour period, taking the active case count to 90893, data shows.“On December 28, there were 356 cases in the state including 269 in Bengaluru. On January 5 we had 3,605 cases in Bengaluru and 641 in the rest of the state. On January 11, we had 10,800 cases in Bengaluru alone and 3,673 in rest of the state. So between December 28 and January 11, in 15 days, the cases have increased by 32.64% in Bengaluru Urban district, 32.65% in BBMP and 36.44% in the state,” Sudhakar said.He said the doubling rate in the ongoing third wave is 2-2.5 days against 8 days in the second wave and 10-12 days in the first wave.“It is therefore important for everyone to get both the doses of vaccine. Between January 1-11, there were 62, 641 active cases and about 6% of them were in hospital, 1% in Covid care centres and the rest 93% were in home isolation,” the minister added. The state government has set an ambitious target to test around 2 lakh people per day in the state and at least 1.25 in Bengaluru. “30% of the beds in district and talk hospitals have been reserved for treatment of children. Indira Gandhi Children’s Hospital has been notified as a designated hospital for paediatric care. Tests are being conducted in schools once every 15 days,” he added.Around 4.89 crore people in the state have received the first dose and 3.98 crore people have received the second dose, which is about 81.5% who are fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-seeks-centre-s-help-to-fight-covid-surge-101642101481750.html
14-01-2022||India||Bengaluru: Apartments with over three cases to be declared as containment zones||Administrative body Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on Thursday announced that an entire apartment complex will be declared a containment zone if more than three Covid-19 cases are detected for at least seven days. “If more than three cases are reported within the apartment complex, or around 100m-perimeter or the floor above and below or the complete block or in case of smaller apartments, the entire complex will be declared as a containment zone for a minimum of seven days,” read an advisory issued by the BBMP. According to the advisory, within the apartments, individual houses on a floor will be considered a containment zone if one case is reported from each floor, the complete floor will be considered a containment zone if three cases were reported across the floor and a complete block or a tower will be marked as a containment zone if it has 10 Covid cases, either across floors or in a single floor. It further added that the entire apartment complex will also be declared a containment zone if 50 cases are reported in apartments with 50 to 100 households or if 100 cases are reported in those with more than 100 houses. “Testing of all population within the containment zone is advisable, mandatory if symptomatic,” the BBMP said. “Testing of all primary and secondary contacts is advisable and mandatory if symptomatic. All contacts will remain under quarantine till test results are declared. All contacts within the containment zone willl remain quarantined for the period of the notification,” it added. Meanwhile, BBMP commissioner Gaurav Gupta said, despite the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s new advisory, testing patterns in the city won’t change. ICMR on Monday had stated that the contacts of Covid-19 patients do not need to be tested unless identified as high-risk, based on age or comorbidities. The government will continue with the current testing patterns, he said. “We will continue to test contacts of Covid-19 patients and other categories we have been testing so far,” he said. Further, the civic body said that the resident welfare associations or the housing societies should ensure that those advised home quarantine should adhere to it. The administrative bodies have been asked to ensure all the residents and visitors are fully vaccinated. “Ensure all the residents, house helps and visitors are checked for temperature and masks. Provision for hand sanitisation/hand wash should be there. Common areas such as doors, railings, surfaces, etc. likely to be touched by multiple people, to be cleaned using sodium hypochlorite, bleaching power, or any effective disinfectant to maintain the highest level of sanitation and hygiene,” read the advisory. Karnataka on Thursday witnessed 25,005 new Covid-19 cases and eight fatalities in 24 hours, taking the overall tally to 31,24,524 and the death toll to 38,397. The positivity rate for the day stood at 12.39%. Of the new cases reported today, 18,374 were from Bengaluru Urban alone. The total number of active cases across the state is now 1,15,733. 
14-01-2022||India||Bengaluru waste collectors demand dry medical waste segregation||As Bengaluru is witnessing another wave of Covid-19 at an unprecedented rate, the waste collectors live under constant fear of getting infected as residents in the city dispose of medical wastes without segregating them from regular household waste. Waste collectors, employed with multiple dry waste management centres of the civic body, claim they find at least 1,000-2,000 used masks every day. Besides demanding better protective gear, these frontline workers in Bengaluru also appealed to residents to segregate waste at home and dispose of medical waste separately. On Thursday morning, segregation work was in full swing at the waste segregation centre in Bengaluru’s JP Nagar. “Our job is to go through the waste and find items that can be recycled.While segregating waste, we come across a lot of used face masks,” said Srinivas, a waste segregator. Geetha, another segregator at the centre, said that even though they wear gloves and masks, but given the spike in Covid-19 cases across the city, they fear for their health. “We hear a lot of things. The virus in the second wave is spreading faster. We also hear that wearing one mask is not enough,” she said. Centre supervisor Mansoor said, “Compared to the first wave, the number of discarded masks we have collected has not increased. Maybe people are using more reusable masks now. But people are still not segregating the waste.” “Ever since the pandemic started, we have been appealing to people to put medical waste in a separate cover,” he said. Mansoor added that with more people getting treatment at home, the medical waste coming from the house poses a bigger threat to those working at the segregation centres. “It (medical waste) should be wrapped in paper. People should now segregate three kinds of waste: wet waste, dry waste, and sanitary waste; and masks should be thrown in sanitary waste,” Mansoor said. RWA president in Kammanahalli, Shankar Rao, said, “Apartments and gated communities should put in proper standard operating procedures (SOP) to maintain waste, especially given the rise in cases.” “We are spreading awareness within our building regarding the waste segregation. We have a process in place which was created after consulting the waste collectors in our area. Such a process will go a long way considering how many masks are discarded every day,” he said. BBMP on Thursday issued a fresh guideline for the apartments on waste segregation. “The housing societies should follow segregated waste disposal with one fixed place identified and used for dumping waste in separate bins. Common groups (WhatsApp, Telegram etc) of resident welfare associations (RWAs) could be used to encourage for spreading awareness,” read the advisory.

The migrant workers from East Singhbhum district were forced by a contractor to work for 18 hours a day and abused and beaten up on occasions for refusing to work long hours without proper food.“After undergoing training at Skill Development Centre, Dimna, the women had gone to work at an apparel unit in Bengaluru where they were forced to work under inhuman conditions...They were not allowed to return and were held hostage,” a statement issued by the state government said.When the matter was brought to the knowledge of Chief Minister Hemant Soren, he directed officials to ensure the safe return of the migrant workers, the statement said.The development comes close on the heels of the state government rescuing five workers of Gumla held hostage in Karnataka’s Hospet this month and 16 migrant workers from the eastern state who were allegedly held captive at an island in Andhra Pradesh for fish farming last month.Earlier, the Jharkhand government had rescued 32 migrant workers and their five children, residents of the Santhal Parganas region, from Kerala where they were forced to work at a tea garden under adverse conditions. In another instance, tribal migrant workers and their children who were made to live like bonded labourers at a brick kiln in Uttar Pradesh were brought back by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-women-migrant-workers-rescued-from-karnataka-after-jharkhand-cm-s-intervention-101642101123284.html

We hope that certain individual on the Indian side would refrain from making unconstructive remarks.”Speaking to reporters on Wednesday ahead of Army Day, General Naravane had said that the Chinese threat in the region had not reduced in any way despite partial disengagement at multiple friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.On Tuesday, confirming the date for the 14th round of talks between the militaries for both countries, Wang had said: “Currently, the situation on the border areas is stable on the whole and the two sides are in dialogue and communication through diplomatic and military channels.“We hope India will work to help the situation to move from emergency handling to a regular daily based management phase,” Wang had added.The last round of talks in October had concluded amid major differences between the two sides.Indian and Chinese border troops have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May, 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border.Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.Ahead of the Wednesday talks, an editorial in state-run China Daily newspaper warned India not be led “astray” by the US.The editorial quoted White House press secretary Jen Psaki describing China as a threat to regional security with its “attempt to intimidate its neighbors” and that the US will “…continue to stand with our partners on that”.“India must not be led astray by such remarks. It should engage in the talks with sincerity and strive to meet China half-way so that they can work together to solve their border disputes,” the editorial said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-terms-general-naravane-s-remark-on-threat-in-ladakh-unconstructive-101642101061592.html

The incident took place in Kurpaani village, under Tethaitangar police station limits, when Jhario Devi and her husband visited the house of one Florence Dungung to attend the funeral service of the latter’s wife, police said.“Florence reportedly accused the woman of practicing witchcraft and held her responsible for his wife’s death. He, and few others present there, thrashed her and then set her on fire after pouring kerosene on her. On hearing her scream, other villagers present in the neighbourhood rushed to the house and rescued her,” an official at Tethaitangar police station said. The woman sustained around 30 per cent burn injuries and was referred from Simdega district hospital to Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi. “The incident took place between 9 pm and 10 pm on Wednesday. On getting information, police rushed to the spot but by then, her relatives and other villagers had already taken her to Simdega sadar hospital. Doctors said the woman suffered around 30 percent burns. She has been referred to RIMS for better treatment,” Simdega superintendent of police (SP) Shams Tabrez said. Based on a complaint by the woman and her son, six people were arrested in this regard, the SP added. The incident came days after a Dalit man was beaten to death and set on fire by villagers, under Kolebira police station limits, for allegedly felling trees. Nine of the 13 named accused in the case have been arrested so far. In view of rising cases of mob attacks in the state, the Jharkhand government on December 21 cleared the Prevention of Mob Violence and Mob Lynching Bill, 2021 that provides for jail terms ranging from three years to life imprisonment and fines of up to ₹25 lakh against those involved in mob lynching leading to “injury or death” of an individual. The law, however, is yet to be notified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-woman-set-on-fire-over-witchcraft-suspicion-101642100763059.html
14-01-2022||India||Rahul Gandhi’s new tweet attack on PM Modi is inspired by Wordle||NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday chose the newest craze on social media, Wordle, to take a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government.Wordle is an online word game and gives a player six chances to guess the day’s secret word, which has five letters. The aim is to figure out the secret word with the fewest guesses. If a player successfully guesses the word, he is prompted to post his/her score on social media along with the number of tries.On Twitter, Gandhi used the format of the game but changed the letters to reflect Congress’s allegations against the prime minister. The photograph shared by the leader contained words like ‘Jhumla’ (scam), ‘Taxes’, ‘snoop’, ‘photo op’, in an obvious attack on the ruling party.Wordle 056 6/6 pic.twitter.com/T4eaGMEw3fHe also wrote ‘056’, a reference to a comment made by PM Modi in the run up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where he referred to his 56-inch chest -- to reiterate his strongman image.With Covid-19 cases raging across the world and several countries imposing lockdowns, many have got hooked to this online, free game that requires one to guess a five-letter word, every day. Players in India say they are also glued to it, and some have even started competing with their friends and colleagues while comparing the daily score.The game was created by former Reddit software engineer Josh Wardle, originally for his partner Palak Shah, as reported by NPR. The game can only be played on its official website and does not have an official mobile app. However, several developers have created identical app versions to cash in on surging demand for the game, with unsuspecting users driving up downloads of the clone apps.The puzzle’s rise has been meteoric: according to The New York Times, 90 people played on November 1. Two months later, on January 2, more than 300,000 tackled the challenge. The Guardian put the daily player count last weekend at two million, and rising, according to news agency AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-s-new-tweet-attack-on-pm-modi-is-inspired-by-wordle-101642099861434.html
14-01-2022||India||240mn Covid-19 vaccine doses in rich nations to expire by March||Approximately 240 million Covid-19 vaccine doses are set to expire in G7 and European Union countries by March, independent analysts said on Thursday, shedding new light on surplus stocks with rich nations that could have been used in poorer countries where millions are yet to receive their first doses.The report, released by science analytics company Airfinity, came on a day when Unicef officials told Reuters that 100 million doses were rejected last month by poorer countries because they were nearing their expiry date. The Airfinity analysis now estimates another 241 million will expire in G7 and EU nations by March. “These numbers show that vaccinating the world is now largely a distribution problem and no longer a supply issue. Even after successful booster rollouts, there are surplus doses available that risk going to waste if not shared very soon. The emergence of Omicron and the likelihood of future variants shows there is no time to waste,” said co-founder and CEO of Airfinity, Rasmus Bech Hansen. The Airfinity forecast takes into account doses administered, boosters for everyone over 12 years-old, vaccine hesitancy and donations in G7 nations and EU.“Countries need these vaccines to have a minimum shelf life of two months, otherwise there isn’t enough time to get them to the people who need them. Once this two month requirement is factored into our analysis the number of potentially wasted doses could rise to 500 million by March,” said Matt Linley, lead analyst at Airfinity,
14-01-2022||India||Sunderbans losing its dense mangrove cover: Govt report||The Sunderbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest, and home to the Royal Bengal Tiger, is gradually losing its very dense tree cover, data released by the Forest Survey of India on Thursday has revealed.Experts say rising salinity levels are taking a toll on the mangroves. This is worrying because the mangrove forests acts a green buffer against cyclones, protecting Kolkata from bearing the direct brunt of storms that originate in the Bay of Bengal.The India State of Forest Report 2021 released Thursday revealed that the very dense mangrove cover in the Sunderbans has shrunk by two square kilometres – from 996 sq km to 994 sq km - between 2019 and 2021. The delta had a mangrove cover of 999 sq km in 2017 which had declined by three square kilometres in 2019. And it was 1038 sq km in 2011. A 4.23% decrease over a decade is worrying.“We have to check exactly where the very dense forest cover has gone down. Progressive salinization is one of the reasons behind decline in density of mangrove. Very severe cyclone Amphan which hit the delta in May 2020 has definitely taken a toll” said Debal Roy, chief wildlife warden of West Bengal.The delta was hit by two very severe cyclones – Amphan in May 2020 and Yaas in May 2021 – which took a toll on the vegetation. Nearly one-third of the delta was severely damaged by Amphan. The cyclones also push sea water inland, increasing salinity levels in the delta.The report claims that total mangrove cover, which includes very dense mangrove, moderately dense mangrove and open mangrove cover, has increased from 2112 sq km to 2114 sq km in 2021. But this increase is because of a rise in open mangrove cover, primarily on account of plantations. Moderately dense mangrove cover has remained unchanged during these two years.The report mentions three kind of mangrove forest cover -- very dense, moderately dense and open. While very dense mangrove is defined as those which have canopy density more than 70%, those with canopy density 40-70% are defined as moderately dense, while those in the 10-40% range are considered as open mangroves (these are generally plantations done during afforestation programmes and not natural forests).“Rising salinity level in the delta is taking a toll on several mangrove species such as Sonneratia apetala, Nypa fruticans and Bruguiera gymnorhiza. Their growth is becoming stunted as they can’t withstand salinity above 20 psu (practical salinity unit). The average salinity of sea water in Bay of Bengal is 33 psu (which is equal to 33 gram of salt in one litre of water). Because of reduced sweet water flow and intrusion of salt water from the sea these trees are either dying or suffering from stunted growth,” said Abhijit Mitra, former head of the marine science department of Calcutta University.The Sunderbans forest sprawls over 10,000 sq km across India and Bangladesh, with 40%of it in India, and is home to many rare and globally threatened wildlife species such as the Royal Bengal Tiger and the estuarine crocodile. In India it is confined to the southern tip of West Bengal and spans two districts , South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas.Experts pointed out that the Sunderbans has been shrinking over the past few years and warned that if the trend continues it could have a disastrous effect on both Kolkata and the livelihood of local villagers.“The Sunderbans’ thick mangrove acts as a bio-shield and saves Kolkata from the direct onslaught of cyclones that originate over the Bay of Bengal. The mangrove also acts as a spawning ground for several fish and other aquatic animals such as crabs and prawns on which the locals depend for their livelihood,” Tuhin Ghosh, director of School of Oceanographic Studies in Jadavpur University, had said in an earlier interview.While very severe cyclone Amphan hit the Sunderban on May 20, 2020 with wind speeds up to 185 kmph, by the time it crossed the mangrove forest and reached Kolkata its wind speed had come down to around 130 kmph.The state government planted around 50 million mangrove saplings after cyclone Amphan. Again in May 2021 after cyclone Yaas hit the area, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said another 150 million mangrove saplings would be planted in the three coastal districts of West Bengal.Among all states West Bengal has the largest mangrove cover in the country followed by Gujarat and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
14-01-2022||India||India-China military talks fail to yield positive results||The 14th round of India-China military dialogue on Wednesday, like the 13th on October 10, failed to yield any positive outcomes, although both countries said they would work towards mutually acceptable solutions to resolving the 20-month long stand-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh.The next round is expected to be held soon to continue the momentum of discussions.On Thursday, a joint statement from the two armies issued in New Delhi and Beijing talked about a consensus on consolidating previous outcomes and taking steps for security and stability on the ground.“The two sides had a frank and in-depth exchange of views for the resolution of the relevant issues along LAC in the western sector. They agreed that they should follow the guidance provided by the state leaders and work for the resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest,” the joint statement said, stressing that this would help restore peace along LAC and improve bilateral ties.The statement was issued a day after Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said India will deal with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in a firm and peaceful way, but if it comes to war or conflict, the country will emerge victorious.The two sides agreed to stay in close contact and carry on with the military and diplomatic dialogue to swiftly work out a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues, the statement said. Both armies said the 15th round of corps commander-level talks should be held at the earliest.Every single round of talks is not likely to lead to tangible outcomes, said former director general of military operations Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd).“Talking with and to PLA is a laborious process and patience pays. The positive is that both sides are talking and have mutually agreed to carry the dialogue forward and hold it at an early date,” Bhatia added.Although the January 12 talks lasted around 13 hours, the Indian side clearly failed to persuade PLA to disengage from Hot Springs near Kongka La and resolve patrolling rights issues in Depsang Bulge in Daulet Beg Oldi sector and Charding Nullah Junction (CNJ) in Demchok sector.The statements clearly indicate that any mutually acceptable solution remains work in progress. This means both the Indian Army and PLA commanders will continue to engage in the future but there is no guarantee on whether PLA will restore April 2020 status in Gogra-Hot Springs or resolve the Depsang Bulge or CNJ issue.The Indian Army is believed to have raised the issue of PLA building a bridge over Pangong Tso, east of Srijap Complex, for faster troop deployment and rapid militarisation of the occupied Aksai Chin area by the Chinese, all along the 597-km Ladakh LAC.Analysts say that PLA, with a new border law and rapid military and technological upgradation on the Chinese side of the unresolved LAC is converting the 3,488 km LAC into a Line of Control (LOC). While the new border law passed by China in October 2021 isn’t directed at India, the country will be impacted by it. Among the provisions of the law are the placement of boundary markers to clearly mark China’s border and development of border areas, including a not-so-thinly veiled decision to settle civilians in these. The new law came into effect from January 1.On Wednesday, General Naravane said the country is prepared to deal with any military ramifications of China’s new border law.Both the Indian Army and PLA are locked in a stand-off all along Ladakh LAC after the Chinese Army under instructions from the Central Military Commission under President Xi Jinping decided to unilaterally change the LAC and impose the rejected 1959 cartographical line on the Ladakh LAC in May 2020. Since then, the two sides are fully deployed with more than three divisions of troops on each side with missile, rocket, artillery and tank regiments apart from their air forces being on standby in the hinterland.PLA, by transgressing in Pangong Tso, Galwan, Gogra-Hot Springs area in May 2020, broke the bilateral 1993 and 1996 peace and tranquility agreements signed between the two countries at the level of heads of states.While Beijing has sought to delink the border issue from other aspects of the relationship, the Modi government has decided that bilateral relations will remain in cold storage till such time Beijing does not resolve the Ladakh LAC issue.The joint statement issued on Thursday appeared to strike a conciliatory note in contrast to separate statements issued by the two sides after the 13th round of talks --- while the Indian Army said PLA did not agree to suggestions made by it, China accused India of “unreasonable and unrealistic demands” in an unusually aggressive statement.The focus of the current round of talks is on resolving outstanding problems at Hot Springs or Patrolling Point-15.At his customary annual press briefing ahead of Army Day on January 15, Naravane was optimistic about the ongoing dialogue resulting in a breakthrough in resolving the LAC standoff though he said it was unreasonable to expect every single round of talks to end with an outcome.“We have to keep talking to each other to understand each other’s viewpoints and perceptions and the differences, and every time we talk, the differences keep getting narrowed down. In this series of talks that is going on, we are hopeful that we will be able to resolve the issues at PP-15 and once that is done, we will go on to the other issues (Depsang) that predate the current standoff,” Naravane said.The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has been affected in Hot Springs and PLA’s forward presence in Depsang has also hindered access of Indian soldiers to routes including the ones leading to PP-10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13.Despite three rounds of disengagement at friction points on LAC, the two armies still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each and advanced weaponry deployed in the Ladakh theatre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiachina-military-talks-fail-to-yield-positive-results-101642099562551.html
14-01-2022||India||SC asks UIDAI review need for residence proof for issuing Aadhaar to sex workers||New Delhi: The Supreme Court has directed the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to consider waiving off the requirement of proof of residence for issuing Aadhaar cards to sex workers. A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai passed a direction on Monday, saying the UIDAI may consider the list of sex workers available with the National AIDS Control Authority (NACO) for issuance of Aadhaar documents, instead of insisting on residential proof. The UIDAI has sought time till February 11 to consider the suggestion and file a response. If the UIDAI agrees, the decision will benefit over 868,000 women sex workers in the country registered with NACO, a body under the ministry of health and family welfare. Many sex workers do not possess identity documents due to the stigma attached to their profession or the fear of being harassed if their place of residence is disclosed. The Supreme Court’s order came while hearing a criminal appeal filed in 2010 by Budhadev Karmaskar, who was accused of murdering a sex worker in Kolkata. Taking suo motu cognizance of the living conditions of sex workers, the court expanded the scope of consideration and examined steps for rehabilitation of sex workers to provide them a life of dignity, a facet of which includes issuance of identity documents. In this regard, the court had formed a committee of experts in July 2011. The committee submitted its final report in 2016, which suggested making amendments to the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 and giving a legal status to sex workers by providing them official documents such as voter I-card, ration cards, PAN card and Aadhaar card. The court had accepted this report. While states and Union territories from time to time have been directed by the court to issue ration cards and voter I-cards to sex workers, the UIDAI had filed an affidavit in the matter on January 6 after the court passed an order on December 14, 2021. “Right to dignity is a fundamental right that is guaranteed to every citizen of this country irrespective of his/her vocation….A status report relating to the issuance of ration cards and voters identity cards and Aadhaar Card shall be filed by all states and union territories within a period of four weeks,” said the court’s order last month. Advocate Zoheb Hossain, representing UIDAI, informed the court that from the Aadhaar’s database, it cannot be ascertained how many sex workers have enrolled for Aadhaar number as identifiable data about profession is not collected. Further, he stated that the system under UIDAI is the most liberal and uncomplicated where the document is issued on furnishing basic information of name, age, place of residence and mobile number. The court-appointed amici curiae (friends of the court) – senior advocate Jayant Bhushan and advocate Pijush Kanti Roy – pointed out that the UIDAI insists on residence proof, which is a hindrance for sex workers to come forward. Broadly, a large number of sex workers have ration cards but many of them are still not coming forward to get ration cards and voter cards made. Bhushan suggested to the court that UIDAI could consider the NACO list as the basis for residence proof. The order passed by the bench said, “The documents filed along with the UIDAI affidavit show that the proof of residence has to be submitted by the applicant for issuance of Aadhaar Card. UIDAI will take instructions on the suggestion made by the learned amicus curiae regarding the issuance of Aadhaar card to the sex workers on the basis of the list prepared by NACO, as a proof of residence.” It also directed states and UTs to complete the process of providing ration cards and voter cards to sex workers within two weeks and submit status report on February 11, the next date of hearing. The court, meanwhile, directed the states/UTs to continue providing free ration to sex workers during the Covid-19 pandemic, without insisting on identity documents. This process has been on since September 2020 after the plight faced by sex workers, left with no income during the lockdown, was brought to the court’s notice by West Bengal-based NGO, Darbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee. The Delhi government has informed the court that the fair price shops have been instructed not to insist on residence proof for providing ration while Chandigarh is transferring money directly into the bank accounts of sex workers identified by NACO. Senior advocate Anand Grover, appearing for the NGO, however, pointed out that there are flaws in the NACO list as it “does not identify sex workers’ community having less than 1,000 members”. The amicus curiae suggested involving community-based organisations for identifying sex workers and issuing identity documents. The bench directed, “The community-based organisations shall submit a list of members which shall be verified by the concerned district legal service authority/state AIDS control society. On such verification, the list shall be forwarded to the competent authorities in the state governments/Union territories for issuance of ration cards/voter cards.” The court also directed the authorities to maintain strict confidentiality in undertaking this process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-uidai-review-need-for-residence-proof-for-issuing-aadhaar-to-sex-workers-101642099561442.html
14-01-2022||India||Be proactive but don’t panic, Modi tells CMs||India’s readiness to combat the Covid-19 pandemic must be a step ahead of all variants, even those that may arise in the future, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said during a meeting with chief ministers on Thursday, where he also said that while being alert and careful is crucial, it is also important to avoid panic.The meeting is the first time Modi met the chief ministers to discuss Covid-19 since the third wave began. Across the country, there were 264,922 new cases on Thursday, according to HT’s tally from data released by states – representing a 253% week-on-week jump propelled by the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the Sars-CoV-2.“The doubts that were earlier there regarding the Omicron variant are gradually now being cleared. Compared to earlier variants, Omicron is infecting masses at a much higher rate. In a country like America, nearly 14 lakh (1.4 million) new cases have been reported in a single day. In India, our scientists are reviewing the situation and numbers. It’s quite clear that we have to be vigilant and cautious, but at the same time we have to also ensure that we don’t panic,” the PM said during the meeting.Modi said authorities and the citizens need to ensure Covid-19 precautions do not slacken during the upcoming festive period.The way central and state governments have adopted pre-emptive, proactive and collective approach in the past will be key going forward, he said.“India’s fight against the biggest pandemic in over 100 years has now entered its third year. Hard work is our only path and victory is our only option. With our efforts, we, close to 1.3 billion people, will emerge victorious against Corona.”The PM outlined some important steps that he said were necessary to be adequately prepared. “We will have to keep scaling up our medical infrastructure and manpower along with strengthening our scientific understanding of the disease.”“Most experts globally have to say that irrespective of the variant, the most potent weapons to fight the coronavirus are vaccines. India-made vaccines are known to be of quality globally, which is a matter of pride for every Indian,” he added.
14-01-2022||India||Haryana private job quota law takes effect from tomorrow||Chandigarh: The Haryana government’s law, which provides 75% reservation for local youth in private sector jobs that offer a salary of less than ₹30,000 a month, will come into force from January 15. As per the notification issued by the state government on January 10, the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020 requires local residents to carry the family identity card — the Parivar Pehchan Patra — for being eligible to register for employment on a designated portal of the Haryana Labour Department (https://local.hrylabour.gov.in/). The Haryana assembly passed the legislation titled the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill on November 5, 2020, and the governor gave his assent to the bill on March 2 last year. The law will be applicable for a period of 10 years. The state government also relaxed the residency (domicile) requirement from 15 to five years for a person to get a bona fide resident certificate in the state to provide some flexibility to the private companies in hiring.“Private sector hiring comes to a halt from January 15, the date of commencement of this Act. Now every employer in the state will first have to register employees receiving gross monthly salary or wages not more than ₹30,000 on the designated portal within three months of coming into force of this Act. No person shall be employed or engaged by any employer till the registration of all such employees is completed on the designated portal,’’ said an official, quoting the law. Deputy chief minister, Dushyant Chautala, had said that startups and new Information Technology (IT) companies will be exempted from the provisions of the Act for two years. Officials said that this primarily meant that start-ups, companies, firms and establishments which come into being or are set up after January 15 will be exempted for two years from hiring 75% local candidates by the state government. Also, any internal hiring (from within a company or an establishment) is likely to be exempted from the law. In November last year, the state government reduced the upper limit of gross monthly salary for jobs which will come under the ambit of the private sector job quota law. As per the official notification, jobs with a gross monthly salary of not more than ₹30,000 will be up for hiring from among local candidates. The bill passed by the assembly last year capped the gross monthly wages for jobs available for hiring at ₹50,000. However, following feedback from industrial houses and entrepreneurs, the state government decided to reduce the salary cap, people aware of the matter said.The India Inc had earlier called for a re-look at the legislation, saying that it could lead to multinational firms moving out of the state.The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said: “At a time when it is important to attract investments at the state level, governments should not impose restrictions on the industry. Reservation affects productivity and industry competitiveness.” “We hope the government re-looks the legislation or at least ensures the rules are fair. As one country, there should be no imposition or restriction,” it added.Legal experts said the new law is in contravention of the Constitution and will not withstand judicial scrutiny. Former Haryana advocate general Ashok Aggarwal had said domicile can never form the basis of employment. Aggarwal said if public employment cannot be given on the basis of domicile how can private jobs be. The government is not the employer in private sector jobs, he said. He added that only a small percentage of low-end jobs can be reserved and that too for special reasons. While tabling Bill in assembly, the government had modified its Section 23 to provide the law an overriding effect on any other state law. The same provision provided an overriding effect to the law over any other law when an ordinance was approved by the cabinet. Since the provision had the potential to be repugnant to an Act of the Parliament its wording was changed in the Bill. However, issues raised by the law and legislative secretary during vetting of the proposed law still holds good, legal experts said. The clause providing for preference in jobs to the local candidates domiciled in Haryana, experts said, was in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution pertaining to equality before the law and Article 19 (1)(g) which provides for protection of certain rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. 
14-01-2022||India||Developer to compensate homebuyer for delay in occupation certificate: SC||A real estate developer is liable to compensate homebuyers for higher taxes and other charges that the latter are compelled to pay in absence of an occupation certificate (OC), the Supreme Court has held in a ruling that furthers the latter’s interest under the consumer protection law. A bench, headed by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, said that a homebuyer shall come under the definition of “consumer” under the consumer protection law since failure of a builder to obtain occupation certificate is to be held as a “deficiency in service” under the legislation. The bench, which also included justices A S Bopanna, rejected the argument that no obligation can be fastened on a developer since it does not receive municipal taxes or electricity charges as a service provider, and underlined that the higher charges are direct consequences of the builder’s lapses. The bench was hearing a case filed by Samruddhi Co-operative Housing Society Ltd of Mumbai, which moved the national consumer commission in 2016 for refund of excess taxes and charges to the tune of ₹2.6 crore paid to municipal authorities due to the failure of the developer, Mumbai Mahalaxmi Construction Pvt Ltd, to obtain an occupation certificate for the flats.Members of the society booked units in 1993 and were given possession of their units in 1997 but the builder failed to obtain an occupation certificate from the municipal authorities, forcing homebuyers pay a 25% higher amount on account of the property tax and an additional 50% towards the water charges to the authorities for want of the document.The national consumer commission, however, did not appreciate the homebuyers’ plea, holding that the complaint was not maintainable since it was filed belatedly and that the housing society could not be considered as a “consumer” under the Consumer Protection Act because they wanted recovery of charges paid to the municipal authorities from the developer. Aggrieved, the homebuyers moved the Supreme Court in 2019. Representing the society, advocate Sunil Fernandes contended that the complaint cannot be thrown out on the grounds of limitation because it was in instance of a continuing wrong where the developer’s failure compelled the homebuyers to keep paying higher charges. Fernandes further pointed out that the builder has not obtained the occupation certificate even 24 years after giving possession and was also in breach of a 2014 order of the state consumer commission that gave the developer four months to obtain the certificate and also pay ₹1 lakh for settling water charges. The developer, on its part, sought dismissal of the homebuyers’ claims, arguing that the cause of action arose in 1997 but the complaint was filed 18 years later. It further cited provisions of the Maharashtra Ownership of Flats Act (MOFA) that states it is the liability of the flat purchasers to pay municipal taxes and water and electricity charges. But the bench underscored that owing to the failure of the developer to obtain the certificate, there has been a direct impact on the members of the society in terms of the payment of higher taxes and water charges to the municipal authority. “This continuous failure to obtain an occupancy certificate is a breach of the obligations imposed on the respondent under the MOFA and amounts to a continuing wrong. The appellants (homebuyers) therefore, are entitled to damages arising out of this continuing wrong and their complaint is not barred by limitation,” it held.Setting aside the national consumer commission’s order, the top court held that the builder was responsible for transferring the title to the flats to the society along with the occupancy certificate. “The failure of the respondent to obtain the occupation certificate is a deficiency in service for which the respondent (builder) is liable. Thus, the members of the appellant society are well within their rights as ‘consumers’ to pray for compensation as a recompense for the consequent liability (such as payment of higher taxes and water charges by the owners) arising from the lack of an occupancy certificate,” said the bench.The court held that the homebuyers’ complaint is maintainable under the Act, asking the commission to hear the case on merit and decide it within three months.The decision is unlikely to affect the buyers in Haryana because, as per the rules stipulated by town and country planning department, a developer can’t make offer of possession of property to buyers without obtaining an occupation certificate. DTCP officials said that payment of taxes to the municipality or other civic agencies does not arise because the conveyance deed can’t be registered till the Occupation Certificate is issued. They also said that urban development rules were different in different states so this Supreme Court ruling had to be seen and interpreted in that context. A developer is liable to pay penalty to buyers in case of delay in completion of projects. In November last year, the Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HRERA) had directed developer of a residential group housing project in Sector 102 to pay compensation to 38 homebuyers for delay in offering possession of apartments. Officials familiar with the matter in Noida said there are at least 30,000 housing units in around 30 different projects, which are occupied by homebuyers without the developer obtaining the occupancy certificate. The developers need to clear financial dues before becoming eligible for OC.“The developers are not clearing dues and not obtaining OC because they are not bothered if the apartment owners get adequate facilities or not. Homebuyers are made to suffer in these buildings, which are without OC and common facilities such as lift, fire safety, park, parking and other such services are affected,” said Abhishek Kumar president of Noida Extension flat owners’ welfare association.The Western UP president of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India, Prashant Kumar Tiwari, said: “The Mumbai case is a unique case of its kind and it has no relation or impact on Noida buildings or buyers since Noida is an Industrial township.”Developers said that the OC for some buildings in Noida is delayed due to policy decisions at the level of the state government. We demanded waiver of unjustified interest on group housing land. But the government did not take a decision to settle dues. Then the issue went to Supreme Court that is yet to give final verdict on interest issue and without settlement of interest issue obtaining OC is not possible.

Two international smugglers working for the ISI – Sultan and Safi, both Pakistani citizens -- have been identified as the key players in the syndicate, which has been tasked to pump huge amount of fake currency into Indian cities for carrying out terror activities, said an official familiar with developments.One of the routes being used by Sultan and Safi is suspected to be Sri Lanka.The NIA registered an FIR on December 30 in the matter under criminal conspiracy and sections related to smuggling of counterfeit currency and officials are in touch with authorities in Dhaka to gather more details.Earlier, the agency took up the investigation into the March 25, 2020 attack on a gurudwara in Kabul, in which 27 Sikh devotees including an Indian national were killed. Its second case for conducting a probe on foreign soil was registered in December 2020 against the Gurpatwant Singh Pannun-led Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) for organising protests at Indian missions in various countries including the US, the UK, Germany, Canada, etc.The third case, registered in September last year, related to a fake currency smuggling racket running out of Dhaka in which two Pakistani nationals were arrested with FICN worth ₹46 lakh.According to the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, FICN worth ₹92 crore was detected and seized across India in 2020.Over the last two years, NIA has investigated about two dozen cases related to fake currency , of which, 12 cases pertain to seizure of high-quality Indian counterfeit currency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fake-currency-nia-registers-fresh-case-fourth-probe-on-foreign-soil-101642097761160.html
14-01-2022||India||NIA to probe Ludhiana court blast case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday took over the probe into December 23 Ludhiana court blast, in which the alleged bomber Gagandeep Singh was killed and six people were injured. A senior official privy to the development said they took over the probe from Punjab Police after ministry of home affairs issued a notification. Initial investigations carried out by the Punjab Police have pointed towards the role of Khalistani groups. For past three weeks, the central anti-terror agency was assisting Punjab Police informally in the probe. During the investigation, several Ludhiana Central Jail inmates are learnt to have been interrogated as Gagandeep Singh, a dismissed police officer, lodged there in 2019 in a drug-related case. He was released in September last year after spending two years in jail.While in prison, accused Gagandeep Singh is suspected to have been introduced to several Khalistani members, including Ranjeet Singh Cheeta and Sukhwinder Boxer, who allegedly had links with Pakistani spy agency– ISI.The NIA will now investigate the role of groups operating from other countries, including Pakistan as it has a mandate for carrying out investigations abroad and has a good database on Khalistani networks. Accused Gagandeep was identified on the basis of technical evidence, including mobile location and later his family also recognized his body.Initial reports had also suggested that banned outfit Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) is behind the blast after a key member of the group, Jaswinder Singh Multani, was detained by German police on December 28 from Erfurt. However, the central agencies are yet to find any direct evidence pertaining to Multani’s involvement in the blast. Multani was earlier under investigation for terror-related incidents in Punjab in 2021 apart from allegedly sending consignments of weapons, explosives and drugs with the help of Pakistan-based operatives. A close associate of US-based SFJ chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, Multani is known as an expert in radicalising Sikh youth to take part in extremist activities. A separate first information report (FIR) filed by NIA against Multani on December 30 stated that he was “in touch with an ISI operative Jibran and Pakistan-based smuggling network members Rana Taseem, Imran and others, and is actively pursuing a conspiracy to carry out attacks in Mumbai and other parts of India, with support from his Punjab-based associates under the instruction of ISI.” Some of Multani’s associates named in the NIA case include Jagdish Singh Bhura of the Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF); deputy chief of KZF Gurmeet Singh, who is also associated with SFJ; Ranjeet Singh Pakhoke of Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF); Sukhdev Singh Heran and Hardeep Singh Nijjar of Babbar Khalsa International, and KTF members Paramjit Singh Pamma and Ranjeet Singh Neeta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-to-probe-ludhiana-court-blast-case-101642097401147.html
14-01-2022||India||Bishop Franco acquitted in Kerala nun rape case||A Kerala court on Friday acquitted former Jalandhar bishop Franco Mulakkal, who is accused of raping a nun 13 times over three years in a convent, citing lack of evidence in a case that shone a spotlight on violence against women in religious institutions.The unexpected verdict sparked a wave of condemnation, with supporters of the victim saying they will move the high court.Kottayam additional district and sessions judge G Gopakumar said the prosecution failed to produce adequate evidence against the accused during the three-year-long trial.“It is difficult to separate chaff and grain. Prosecution also failed to back its contentions with evidences,” the judge said in the 287-page verdict.Mulakkal, 57, was accused of raping the woman 13 times between 2014 and 2016 during his visits to a convent in Kuruvilanghad in Kottayam, when he was the bishop of the Jalandhar diocese of the Roman Catholic Church. The woman, 44, is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus, a congregation under the Jalandhar Diocese.Soon after the verdict was announced, a visibly relieved Mulakkal hugged his followers and lawyers.”Praise the Lord,” he said. “Lord is supreme, truth prevailed,” he told reporters. His supporters, who were present outside the court, also distributed sweets amid loud chants of “praise the lord”. Later, he conducted a holy mass at a church in Kottayam.In a brief statement in Malayalam, the Jalandhar diocese thanked those who believed in Mulakkal’s innocence.B Raman Pillai, who led Mulakkal’s legal team, said the prosecution case was very weak and the investigation poor.A group of nuns of the Kuravilangad Convent in Kerala, who helped the victim, said they couldn’t believe the verdict. “We will fight it out till the end. We are ready to die to uphold our cause. Till the end, everything was fine and we have no idea what happened later. We will stay at the convent as we are not scared of our death,” said a teary-eyed Sister Anupama, who was the public face of the years-long battle. She alleged that the trial court refused to hear hapless wails of a victim who can’t even speak loud.“The verdict is unbelievable. It is wrong to say there are not enough evidences and we conducted the investigation most scientifically. We are really disappointed and we will go in for an appeal immediately,” said former police superintendent of Kottayam, S Harishankar, who supervised the investigation.“The outcome is really shocking and we never expected this,” said public prosecutor Jithesh Babu. But defence lawyers said most of the charges were trumped up without any evidence and they fell flat in the end.Extending support to the nun, National Commission for Women chairperson Rekha Sharma tweeted: “Shocked at the judgment of Kerala Addl. dist and session court. The victim nun must go to high court. NCW is with her in this fight for justice”.The rape case against the Bishop was registered by police in Kottayam district on June 29, 2018.In her complaint to the police, the nun had alleged that she was subjected to sexual abuse by Franco between 2014 and 2016. The case attracted national attention after five fellow nuns staged a two-week sit-in protest in Kochi, seeking action against the bishop.In September 2018,the Special Investigation Team which probed the case arrested the Bishop and charged  him under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 376 (2) (indulging in sex by exhorting authority), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 506 (criminal intimidation) and unnatural sex (section 377). During the course of the trial, Mulakkal approached the high court and Supreme Court with discharge petitions, but both were turned down. Later, he was removed from the post of bishop by Vatican.Trial in the case, which started in November 2019, concluded on January 10.

14-01-2022||India||Kerala HC likely to deliver verdict in nun rape case today||Thiruvananthapuram: A special court in Kottayam is set to deliver its verdict in the 2018 rape case against former Bishop of Jalandhar Franco Mulakkal, officials familiar with developments said on Thursday. In June 2018, a nun had accused Mulakkal of sexually abusing her several times between 2014 and 2016. Though the victim filed a complaint on June 29, 2018, it took three months for the police to arrest Mulakkal on Sept 19, 2018. The case attracted national attention after five fellow nuns had staged a 2-week sit-in protest in Kochi seeking action against the bishop.Mullakkal has denied the rape charges saying he was framed after he took action against the nun for financial irregularities in the convent.The victim is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation based in Punjab, which also runs three convents in Kerala. Later, Mulakkal was charged under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code including 376 (2) (indulging in sex by exhorting authority), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 506 (criminal intimidation). During the course of the trial, he had approached the High Court and Supreme Court with discharge petitions, but both were turned down. Later he was removed from the post of bishop. The case was also marred after many witnesses turned hostile. A key witness, Father Kattuthara was found dead near Jalandhar in 2019. Cardinal Mar George Alancherry, the senior-most priest of the Catholics in the state, 24 nuns, 11 priests were among 83 witnesses deposed in the case.

14-01-2022||Today's||Time to eradicate the rot in immoral political system||Defections have become an integral part of our electoral process. The culture of deserting their parties on the eve of elections has been in fashion for decades. Our aaya Ram gaya Ram“netas” start searching for greener pastures after completing their five-year tenure as honourable members of assemblies or parliament, as the case may be. Politics is more a game of perception. Every political party strives to create the perception that they are within sniffing distance of capturing power and send an open invitation to all, with backing of some caste groupings, to join the bandwagon to enjoy the fruits of power for the next five years. This amoral game has been played for decades and is in full swing currently in Uttar Pradesh, which is poll-bound and where, very recently, a few leaders who were part of the ruling dispensation for the last five years have junked the ruling party complaining that the interest of the downtrodden, backwards, poor and marginalized sections of the people was totally ignored by the government, in which these honourable netas were ruling as cabinet ministers for as long as five years! These scenes are recurrent in the theatre of politics. The two netas who recently ditched the ruling party in Uttar Pradesh had done exactly the same some, years back, when they dumped the party which gave them cabinet berth for a full term of five years during its rule in Uttar Pradesh. Then also they had made the same feeble excuse that the then government had neglected the downtrodden sections of the population. Ironically, they were welcomed by the current ruling party with open arms, were promptly given tickets to contest assembly polls in 2017, and were inducted into the cabinet as full-fledged ministers. How long these party hoppers will last in their new dispensations is anybody’s guess. These two are not the only ones, there are hordes waiting to make a killing in the coming polls. Those who are crying foul need to introspect, at least now.This culture of politics, sans ethics and morality, has run its full circle. Many prominent leaders have travelled across all parties and are now clueless where to go next. Political parties, as they are, also don’t have any scruples or ideological strength. Anybody is welcome in their fold -criminal, corrupt, rapist, looter, thug etc, if he is perceived as capable of adding some votes belonging to his caste to their new party’s tally. If they can satisfactorily prove their “winnability” at the hustings, then parties of all hues, irrespective of their proclaimed political philosophy and colour of their flags will rush to such netas to induct them into their party with fanfare. During election time, it is immaterial whether the neta is a history-sheeter or has an infamous background or notorious character. This unscrupulous political culture has created the current political cesspool. No country can ever prosper and move forward with the kind of unprincipled political environment that is prevalent in our country. Our nation has the requisite resources and skill to remove the scourge of poverty,  and provide a decent life to its citizens minus all hassles. The corrupt political culture stifles development and has crushed its potential. Unprincipled politics leads to induction of unscrupulous people in politics who get party tickets to contest elections and become ministers and rule the country. Can the country expect implementation of rule of law when inept, criminal, corrupt and opportunistic people, are only chosen, by and large, by all the political parties as their torchbearers?The current spate of desertions by a few ministers in Uttar Pradesh is the outcome of admitting unscrupulous netas at the time of previous elections, by the current ruling party. These were the very netas who had deserted their earlier parties and had joined BJP, and they are repeating their past practice of deserting their current party to defect to another -to serve their personal interest only. There is no principle involved in their actions, so their actions don’t merit any discussion. Clearly all those who were accepted with garlands in 2017 by the ruling party are going to desert them and we will soon witness the drama of “welcome pageants” by other parties too.When will this drama end is the question that begs an answer. Apart from political parties, we, the people also need to ponder over the current state of affairs of our polluted political culture and do course correction. This rotten politics has already cost the nation dearly. We remain one of the most corrupt, poor and backward countries which has been surviving with the “developing country” tag for nearly seventy odd years. When will this tag be changed to a developed country is not known, neither has any timeline ever been presented to our people in this regard. We should not wait for a Krishna avatar to come and cleanse politics. The time has come for people to act and eradicate the rot in our immoral political system. Otherwise, our second rate political representatives will continue to provide third rate governance.(V. S. Pandey is a retired UP cadre IAS officer.
