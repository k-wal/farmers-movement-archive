25-01-2022||Mumbai||Daily cases may drop below 1,000 soon: BMC||MUMBAI Civic officials said on Tuesday that they expect the daily caseload in the city to fall below 1000 in 10 days, indicating that the Omicron-fuelled third wave of Covid-19 may be subsiding. This could also result in some relaxations in Covid norms, including allowing citizens to access public places such as gardens and playgrounds for longer hours. However, time restrictions on restaurants and bars are likely to continue. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner and the officer in charge of public health said, “We expect daily cases to go below 1,000 in about 10 days. However, we are on alert and will not lift restrictions imposed to check the spread of the disease.” On Tuesday, the city reported 1,815 cases and 10 deaths taking the case tally to 1,037,587 and toll to 16,556. The city’s recovery rate is 96% with 996,145 recoveries and the mortality rate is 1.59%. There are 22,185 active cases in the city. No Omicron variant Covid-19 cases were reported on Tuesday, and the total Omicron count remains 1,010. Covid bed occupancy in the city fell from 21% a fortnight ago to 9.1% on Tuesday. Kakani said, “We may relax timings of gardens and playgrounds, but the current cap of 50% table occupancy in restaurants and the 10pm closure deadline will remain. We will take a call on relaxations in the coming weeks after studying the case pattern.” BMC officials said that from December 21, 2021 (the day the third wave began) till the end of the month, the city was averaging 3,000 cases a day. However, by January 6, cases jumped to 20,000. By January 25, the daily caseload fell to around 2000. Daily testing, too, has dropped to between 40,000 and 50,000 from the earlier 60,000 to 70,000 tests. Covid experts opine that though cases have reduced, it will be too early to comment on lifting relaxations. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force said, “It is too early to comment on when we can relax 100% restrictions. We should wait and observe how the pandemic is progressing.” He added that deaths will also show a rise, though not at an alarming rate. “Deaths always lag case-peaks by a few weeks. Therefore, even when cases come down, deaths may take time to reduce.” To be sure, the daily positivity rate (number of confirmed cases per 100 tests) has improved from a peak of 29.5% on January 7 to 5.27% on January 25. Deaths, on the other hand, have gradually increased from up to three a day in December 2021 to up to 12 at present. Dr Kedar Toraskar, critical care specialist and another member of the state Covid task force said, “The BMC is assuming the three-digit trend on the basis of the current reduction in numbers. It could well happen that way. However, one cannot be certain. Though there is no resurgence anywhere in the world except in the UK, we cannot be complacent. We will have to remain on alert.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/daily-cases-may-drop-below-1-000-soon-bmc-101643135248717.html

25-01-2022||Noida||State polls: Noida sees increased youth participation this time||Gautam Budh Nagar has a relatively young pool of candidates fighting the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls this time. Of the 39 candidates in the fray, seven are in their 20s, while only four are over 60, according to data shared by the office of the district election commission. Whereas, during the 2017 election, of the 39 contesting candidates, only three were in their 20s and one was over the age of 60. Gautam Budh Nagar goes to polls on February 10 during the first phase of the seven-phase Uttar Pradesh assembly election.This time, in the Noida assembly constituency, seven of the 13 candidates are in their 20s while there is no candidate over 60. In 2017, of the 15 candidates from Noida, two were in their 20s and one was over 60.The youngest candidate in Gautam Budh Nagar is 25-year-old Nitish Kumar from Rashtriya Janata Party who is contesting from Noida. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate Pankaj Awana (27) and Congress candidate Pankhuri Pathak (29), both contesting from Noida, are also under 30. Other candidates in their 20s are Kush Kumar (27) from Bharatiya Jan Jagriti Party, Ashish Sharma (29) from Loktantrik Janshakti Party, Rohit (28) from Rashtrawadi Janlok Party and independent candidate Yeshu Singh (27). Experts say that an increasing participation of the younger generation is good for democracy, especially in a country that has a higher population of younger people compared to the elderly. “Relatively younger people filing nominations shows that there is a growing political vigour and a feeling of initiative among the youth of this region. The fact that campaigns are being conducted online also attracts more people, since this provides younger individuals who do not have a very strong financial background a better opportunity . The younger population is also well versed with social media and can get their points across to a larger population now,” said Dr Shalini Saxena, associate professor (political science), Amity University, Gautam Budh Nagar. According to AAP’s Pankaj Awana, the participation of the younger generation in the electoral process is important for democracy. “As a young candidate, I want to help the people of Noida deal with the common problems they face. I know I have the energy and the will to work for the people that big leaders and parties lack,” said Awana. However, there no candidate in his/her 20s from Jewar and Dadri constituencies this time. In 2017, one 29-year-old candidate fought in Dadri while there was no candidate under 30 in Jewar then either. In Dadri, there is just one candidate over the age of 60. At 68, Tejpal Nagar is the oldest candidate in all three constituencies of Gautam Budh Nagar. However, the sitting MLA from Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) is also one of the strongest contenders for the Dadri seat. His main opposition is from Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) -- 42-year-old Manveer Singh. Jewar has the largest pool of older candidates, including all the stalwarts contesting from this seat. Jewar has three candidates who are over 60. The Samajwadi Party-Rashtriya Lok Dal candidate Avtar Singh Bhadana is 64, BSP candidate Narendra Kumar is 63 and Sarva Samaj Party candidate Neeru Walia is 65. Traditionally, Jewar is the stronghold of the SP and BSP and the two parties will be giving a tough competition to the sitting BJP MLA this time as well. Though the candidates from both major opposition parties are older, they also have greater political experience. Bhadana is a four-time MP and sitting MLA from the Meerapur constituency in Muzaffarnagar, who recently left the BJP to join RLD. At 55, BJP’s candidate and sitting MLA Dhirendra Singh is also a seasoned leader in the region and has a lot of development work to his credit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/state-polls-noida-sees-increased-youth-participation-this-time-101643134889349.html
25-01-2022||Mumbai||Allies turn rivals: Local body polls may see bitter Sena-BJP fight||Mumbai The latest war of words between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Shiv Sena over Hindutva and ‘wasted period in alliance’ may be an indication of a bigger fight between the two former saffron allies during the ‘mini assembly’ (local body) polls. Leaders from both the parties and observers believe that the two, who have resolved to not join hands again ever, are set to take on each other in the future.After keeping almost away from the political appearance for more than two months following a spinal surgery, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday took the BJP head on. Addressing party workers on Sena founder Bal Thackeray’s 96th birth anniversary, he said the Sena rotted in the alliance for 25 years. He termed the BJP’s Hindutva hollow and opportunist. He also said that the BJP, which used its local allies to gain and later dumped them, benefited from its alliance with the Sena to a great extent.This evoked a sharp reaction from the BJP, which reminded the Sena that the party had its corporators and MLAs elected in Mumbai even before the latter was born in 1966. Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis produced elections results of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly from 1993, saying almost all the Sena candidates lost their deposits whenever they contested polls there. Fadnavis questioned if the Sena was doubting late Bal Thackeray-endorsed alliance till 2012 and why the Sena was pushed to fourth position in the recent local body polls after snapping ties with the BJP.No room for reconciliationAccording to leaders from both the parties, the tussle is expected to intensify. “Union home minister Amit Shah made it clear at his rally in Pune last month that there would be no reconciliation with the Sena at any cost. He also dared the Sena to fight with them. Thackeray too has clarified that the two parties, which were in the alliance for more than three decades, will not come together. Both the parties are expected to fight against each other in the municipal corporation elections, especially in Mumbai, Thane, and Kalyan-Dombivali,” said a BJP leader requesting anonymity.The two had fought the local body elections separately in 2017 and had collectively won much more seats than the then opposition parties: Congress and Nationalist Congress Party. The difference in the number of seats had narrowed in Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivali. The Sena and the BJP had bagged 84 and 82 seats in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and 52 and 42 seats in the Kalyan-Dombivali civic body respectively.The Sena that was founded on the Marathi ‘manoos’ or sons of the soil agenda in 1966 embraced majoritarian politics in the late 1980s. The use of political Hindutva helped it cultivate right-leaning voters, and the late Sena chief, Bal Thackeray, emerged as a right-wing mascot. With the split, the BJP is using Hindutva as the ammo to fight the Sena. Prestige battle“The war is basically for the Mumbai corporation, which is one of the richest civic bodies in Asia with an annual budget of more than Rs. 34,000 crore. The city has the highest number of billionaires in the country and governing it is a matter of prestige for any political party. The Sena has been ruling it for over 25 years and retaining it is more important than having power in hands at the state level. Similarly, the BJP has resolved to use all its might to wrest it from the Sena. If succeeded, the party will also be able to hit the Sena where it hurts the most,” another BJP leader said.Mumbai-based political analyst Hemant Desai said the tussle between the two has stooped to a new low and has come to the individual level. “The truce is unlikely now as the bitterness has turned into antagonism. Both have benefitted from their alliance despite their love-hate relationship for three decades.” The rivalry has intensified in the last two days. BJP MP Poonam Mahajan even warned Sena MP Sanjay Raut to not act like a ‘namard’ (a timid person). “Two mards (courageous men) late Pramod Mahajan and Balasaheb Thackeray forged the alliance for the sake of Hindutva. Do not post a cartoon like a ‘namard’,” she tweeted on Monday.Toon controversyMahajan was irked by Raut’s tweet where he posted an old cartoon of Bal Thackeray and Pramod Mahajan and wrote, “Who moved ahead because of whom”. In the cartoon, Thackeray is depicted sitting on a chair and his leg is on another. Mahajan is standing in front of him. A small chair is placed in front and Thackeray is asking him to sit.Raut, who deleted the tweet later, said he wanted to send a message to the BJP, and it wasn’t directed towards Pramod Mahajan. However, Raut questioned her role in the party, saying the families of Mahajan, Gopinath Munde, and Manohar Parrikar were sidelined. The two parties snapped the three-decade-old ties after the Assembly polls in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/allies-turn-rivals-local-body-polls-may-see-bitter-sena-bjp-fight-101643134828823.html
25-01-2022||Noida||Covid: 17-yr-old among two dead in Ghaziabad, one dies in Noida||Two persons, including a 17-year-old boy, died in Ghaziabad on Tuesday due to Covid-19 while the district also reported 820 new cases, according to the state health bulletin. In the neighbouring Gautam Budh Nagar, 1,373 new cases, along with one Covid-19 death, were reported. The two patients who died in Ghaziabad included an 81-year-old male with comorbidities such as hypertension and was fully vaccinated, officials from the district health department said. “He was hospitalised after complaining of difficulty in breathing, cough and general weakness. He died due to respiratory failure with cardio-respiratory arrest,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer, Ghaziabad. The second death in Ghaziabad was that of a 17-year-old boy who had not taken any vaccine dose yet. He was a pulmonary tuberculosis patient and had taken medications for the disease for three months last year, the officials said. “He was admitted with complaints of breathlessness, dry cough and weakness. He died of cardiopulmonary arrest with hypoxia,” Gupta said. In Noida, the patient who died was a 20-year-old female suffering from severe anaemia and was given blood transfusion at a private hospital before she tested Covid positive and was transferred to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida, the officials said. “She was in the hospital for about three days before she passed away. The treatment included remdesivir as well as plasma therapy but she could not be saved. She died on January 19, but her death was added to the records on Tuesday,” said Dr Manoj Kushwaha, district surveillance officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. Meanwhile, after reporting reducing numbers for five days, Gautam Budh Nagar saw another spike in numbers as 1,373 new cases were added on Tuesday. Before this, cases had consistently dropped for five days in a row. Since January 20, the daily count of cases went down from 1,684 to 501 on Monday. Gautam Budh Nagar now has 5,789 active cases while 1,673 people have recovered in the past 24 hours, the data shows. In January so far, the district has reported a total of 28,367 cases. The test positivity rate is also on the decline as it was 22% on Tuesday. At the peak of the third wave, the positivity rate had reached 48% in the district on January 16. Ghaziabad now has 4,000 active cases while 1,533 people have recovered in the past 24 hours. In January itself, 24,358 cases have been added to the tally. The district has reported a total of 80,272 cases so far and 2,431,869 tests have been conducted. The positivity rate on Tuesday was 10.78% .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid-17-yr-old-among-two-dead-in-ghaziabad-one-dies-in-noida-101643134530111.html
25-01-2022||Gurugram||February 1 deadline for residents with manual water supply meters in areas falling under GMDA to change to electronic meters||Residents living in newly built sectors where water supply connections are provided by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), will have to install electronic water meters by February 1, said officials on Tuesday. The change is being made to reduce non-revenue water supplied by the GMDA, which is not metered and leads to revenue loss. Officials said that residents will have to change to electronic smart meters so that the water supply can be tracked from the integrated control and command centre (ICCC) of the GMDA, where hourly water flow details can be measured. Pardeep Kumar, a chief engineer at the infrastructure-II division of the GMDA, said, “With manual water meters, chances of theft are high. In a particular area, a meter might not be working for 10 days but water is being supplied daily. The entire water supply goes unmetered, leading to loss of revenue for the authority. Developers or the body that applies for connections in areas where water supply connections are given by the GMDA will now have to switch to electronic meters. It definitely will streamline the process of monitoring water supply.” Kumar said that for all new water connections, electronic smart meters are the only option for residents. He added that the GMDA has so far given over 600 water connections, mostly in the new sectors from 81-110. For sector 111 to 115, water supply is likely to start from March. “The electronic water meters must have power backup as they will be connected to the ICCC and in case of a power cut, the water will be charged based on the hourly average supply to a particular area, as data will be available to us on how much water is being supplied throughout the day,” the chief engineer said. The authority has already taken measures such as tapping flowing water, which earlier used to get wasted, installing water flow meters and setting up flow control devices for equitable distribution of water to reduce non-revenue water. Incidentally, non-revenue water sources stood at 50% in August last year, which was reduced to 11% by November-end, said officials. Praveen Malik, the vice-president of the United Association of New Gurugram, a body comprising 40 housing societies located in Sector 77 to 90 said, “This is a good move and will help the GMDA to monitor the water supply, but still there are at least 10 societies in the new sectors where residents are yet to get supply. The authority should first ensure water connectivity to all these areas.” Societies such as the NBCC Heights and Tulip Ace in Sector 89 and three societies of Mapsko Group in Sector 82 are yet to be given water connection by the authority. Water supply became operational in the new sectors in August last year after chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar inaugurated a piped water supply initiative to residential societies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/february-1-deadline-for-residents-with-manual-water-supply-meters-in-areas-falling-under-gmda-to-change-to-electronic-meters-101643134230828.html
25-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: DMs asked to enforce EC’s guidelines on use of video vans by parties||The Election Commission (EC) on Tuesday sought to regulate the use of video vans being deployed by various political parties for campaigning for assembly polls in the state by, among other things, making it mandatory for parties to seek a prior permission for using such vehicles.“We have issued orders to all DMs asking them to ensure compliance of the Election Commission’s guidelines with regard to the use of video vans/digital video vans,” additional chief electoral officer BD Tiwari said.He said any political party that wanted to make state-wide use of such vans for publicity would have to take a prior permission from the chief electoral officer while permission for the use of such vehicles at district or assembly constituency level could be obtained from the concerning district election officer. “The permission will be granted only after the transport department certifies that the vans sought to be used for campaigning are in keeping with the Motor Vehicles Act,” he said.He further said that political parties would be allowed to use video vans to make publicity of their party and programme and for campaigning for a particular candidate. “Also, deployment of such vans will be allowed only between 8am and 8pm and the vehicles will not be used for road shows and rallies,” he clarified.He said it would be responsibility of political parties to follow Covid-19 guidelines by ensuring that not more than 500 people gathered at the viewing point and the vans did not stay for more than half-an-hour at one place. Tiwari said there was no restriction on the number of video vans but expenses on them would be included in political parties’ poll expenses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-polls-dms-asked-to-enforce-ec-s-guidelines-on-use-of-video-vans-by-parties-101643133328830.html
25-01-2022||Mumbai||EIA report on CNG pipeline in eco-sensitive zone yet to be made public||Mumbai Even as the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) is set to conduct a mandatory public hearing over a proposed 45-km natural gas pipeline through Dahanu eco-sensitive zone on January 27, the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) is yet to be made public. Moreover, MPCB issued the public notice for hearing only on January 21, despite the Environment Impact Assessment notification mandating that this be done at least 30 days before the hearing date.A truncated, executive summary of the EIA is available on the MPCB website, which environmentalists say does not provide enough details. The proposed pipeline, being executed by Gujarat Gas Limited, will supply piped natural gas to homes in the Thane district. It will start from Umargam Road at Zai Village in Dahanu taluka, running parallel to existing roads under the custodianship of the public works department and the taluka municipality. The pipeline will terminate at Dahanu’s Kolavali village.The executive summary of the EIA, reviewed by Hindustan Times, states that “The proposed Dahanu Taluka pipeline network is an intra-state pipeline which falls in Dahanu Taluka and Dahanu Taluka is notified as ecologically fragile area/ecologically sensitive area as per MoEF&CC notification vide dated 20th June 1991... and as per present EIA notification 14 September 2006 it attracts the provision of obtaining prior environmental clearance from MoEF&CC as a Category A project, to be apprised by Centre and not the state environment impact assessment authority.”“The manner in which this hearing is being pushed is clearly against the procedure. The entire Dahanu eco-sensitive zone is being fragmented by multiple linear intrusions other than this pipeline, including the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train, Mumbai-Vadodara expressway, the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor, and another set of pipelines to carry water from the Surya Dam to Vasai-Virar and Mira-Bhayander,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust and an invitee of the Dahanu Taluka Environment Protection Authority or DPTEPA (which is yet to consider this project).Goenka further said that environmental clearances for these projects need to be considered keeping in mind their cumulative impact on the ecosystem. “Such piecemeal clearances runs counter to the intent of the MoEFCC’s 1991 notification declaring the region as eco-sensitive.”Yashwant Sontakke, joint director, MPCB, did not respond to calls and messages seeking a response.The Dahanu ESZ serves as an ecological buffer between the highly industrialised region of Vapi in Gujarat, and the Boisar industrial complex in Tarapur, which is also home to the Tarapur Atomic Power Plant. It is also home to the upcoming Vadhavan port project, which is being opposed by local fisherfolk communities and environmentalists, who have for decades been advocating for stronger land-use regulations in the region.In addition to EC from the Centre, the project also requires clearance from the DTEPA, which is yet to consider the proposal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/eia-report-on-cng-pipeline-in-eco-sensitive-zone-yet-to-be-made-public-101643133150958.html

25-01-2022||Pune||Residents of PMC merged areas demand water supply or property tax relief||PUNE: Residents and elected members of 23 merged villages have demanded regular water supply or water tax waiver till the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) arranges piped supply. Ranjan Das, resident of Yeolewadi Khadi Machine, said, “Our residential society has to depend on tanker supply. With our area is included in PMC, we expect civic water supply as we pay tax. While we know that pipeline network will take time, PMC should give us water tax relief till we get piped water facility.” Juhi Parekh of Warje Ahiregaon said, “Though other PMC areas get water supply, we pay around ₹18,000 property tax per annum and buy tanker water. We are ready to pay more tax provided PMC ensure adequate water supply.” Elected member Yogesh Sasane said, “If the citizens are paying tax, they should get water facility. We have raised the issue in PMC general body to either provide water or keep water tax on hold.” Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Tuesday staged protest in front of PMC headquarters blaming the ruling party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for not providing water in merged areas. NCP city unit president Prashant Jagtap said, “Ruling BJP is intentionally not providing water in merged areas as maximum residents in these areas are voters of NCP. PMC even denied tanker supply in these areas. Our elected members are using ward development funds to make life easy in these areas.” BJP city unit president Jagdish Mulik said, “While merging the villages in PMC, it was the state government’s responsibility to allocate funds for creating infrastructure in these areas. We have approved funds for erecting the drainage lines and appointed a consultant for water supply network. As the areas are vast, it would require time to establish water network but the NCP is playing politics over the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/residents-of-pmc-merged-areas-demand-water-supply-or-property-tax-relief-101643132909887.html

In the 2007 assembly election when the BSP formed the government, the party had won six of the nine assembly seats in Agra district. In the 2012 polls when the Samajwadi Party wave swept the state, the BSP managed to maintain hold in Agra by winning six assembly seats,” said a BSP leader. In the 2017 UP polls, the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) was able to made inroad into the BSP citadel by bagging all the nine assembly seats in the district. The BSP candidates were runners-up in the eight assembly seats. Along with consolidating its hold over the Dalit voters, the BSP is working on backward-Muslim and forward community alliance formula in the 2022 assembly election.For the first phase of UP election to be held on 58 assembly seats spread in 11 districts, including Agra, on February 10, the BSP has given tickets to 16 Muslim candidates, 18 OBC, 9 Dalits and 15 upper castes nominees.Even as the rival parties, including the BJP, the SP and the Congress launched their election campaign after the slowdown in the second Covid wave in July last, the BSP chief did not address public meetings. However, BSP national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra addressed Brahmin conferences in all 75 districts of the state. “Mayawati was screening and finalising candidates for the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab where the BSP is contesting the polls in alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). After finalising candidates on all the seats, she is launching the election campaign of the party. The BSP has announced 30 star campaigners for the party that include Mayawati her brother Anand Kumar, who is national vice president, and SC Mishra,” said a BSP leader. The state will vote in seven phases—February 10, 14, 20, 23, 27, March 3 and 7. The counting of votes for all 403 assembly seats will be held on March 10.

25-01-2022||Pune||Aggravated flu symptoms can be due to Covid: Pune doctors||Pune: Even though many patients in the city are testing negative for Covid, some are exhibiting severe than usual flu symptoms. City doctors have advised patients showing excess fatigue to take rest and fully recover. Dr Kedar Deodhar, city-based general physician, said that sometimes Covid tests may show a false negative. “RT-PCR is only 70-80 per cent foolproof. If the patient has history or is a direct contact, then the person is asked for retest. If the patient shows all symptoms related to Covid and continued fatigue then it may be due to the virus infection. If the patient would come to us in December, I could say it was the common flu. But with increasing transmission and infectivity of Omicron, there is a higher possibility that patients have Covid. So, even if the test shows negative, you should isolate yourself for the safety of others and take rest and medication,” said Deodhar. He said those with Covid infection show more fatigue and weakness as compared to flu, and should take precautions. “Many times, patients are reluctant to take treatment and wait for a day or two before seeking medical help. So, those who show common flu-like symptoms show strictly follow precautions,” he said. Dr Mahendra Dadke, MD Medicine from Jupiter Hospital in Pune, said patients with cold symptoms may show a false negative. “Sometimes viral load is less and subsequently the test comes positive. Fortunately, this variant is not serious. Patients should continue medication for upper respiratory infection and consume homemade food,” said Dr Dadke. “All homemade remedies should be kept at bay and patients should follow doctor’s instructions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/aggravated-flu-symptoms-can-be-due-to-covid-pune-doctors-101643132369851.html

25-01-2022||Lucknow||UP education dept, its officers working in a casual manner: Allahabad HC||Observing that the state education department and its officers are not attending to the grievance that are raised against it and they are performing their duties in a very causal manner, the Allahabad high court has directed the principal secretary, basic education, UP, to ensure that all district basic education officers start performing their duties promptly and taking the final call on all the matters which come before them for consideration at the earliest.The court warned it would be compelled to take stringent action against these officers in case they failed to do as directed. Hearing a writ petition filed by one Avaneesh Kumar of Auraiya district, Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal observed, “This court is flooded with writ petitions every day simply for a direction upon these officers to decide the grievances. This court has recorded earlier also that the matters relating to life and property could not be decided in view of the huge pendency being created due to filing of writ petition seeking mandamus against the authorities. It is high time that now these officers of the state government should start working and attend to the grievances which come before them through representations within a period of one month”.In the present case, the posting order of the petitioner has to be issued by the district basic education officer, who has been allegedly withholding the same for the last one year. He moved the representation before him on March 6, 2021, for ventilating his grievance which till date has not been attended by the officer concerned. Hence, the present writ petition was filed.While granting the authority concerned the last opportunity of three days to decide the representation of the petitioner, the court in its order dated January 21 fixed January 28, 2022 as the next date of hearing and also directed the state counsel to inform the court about the decision taken on the representation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-education-dept-its-officers-working-in-a-casual-manner-allahabad-hc-101643131888365.html

25-01-2022||Lucknow||Aspirants allege anomalies in RRB exam results, protest in Prayagraj||Alleging anomalies in the result of non-technical popular category (NTPC) exam conducted by Railway Recruitment Board, aspirants in large numbers tried to stop a train at Prayag railway station on Tuesday. The aspirants also claimed to have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and railway officials in this regard earlier. Police reached the spot with railway officials and pacified the students. However, cops had to use a mild force when the aspirants refused to disperse. Some of them were also detained. According to reports, the students called a meeting at Prayag junction where aspirants in large numbers assembled and then moved to the tracks. They later sat on a dharna before Kanpur Intercity train and started raising slogans. Forces of many police stations along with government railway police (GRP) and railway protection force (RPF) reached the spot and tried to pacify the protestors. The protest continued for around-one-and-a-half hours. Different student organisations, including Yuva Manch and Samajwadi Yuvjan Sabha participated in the protest.The aspirants claimed that notification issued by RRB on February 28, 2019 for 35,277 vacant posts under CBT-1 and CBT-2 phases. The CBT-1 was held in six phases between December 28, 2020 and July 31, 2021. The result was CBT-1 was declared on January 15, 2022. The CBT-2 phase of exam is scheduled to be held between February 15 and 19. The recruitment included 12 vacancies on different grades which were divided into seven slots. As per the notification, CBT-1 was a screening exam and its marks were not added to the main examination. RRB was to qualify 20 times the number of posts zone wise in phase one and eight times the posts in phase which, the aspirants alleged, the RRB failed to do.This resulted in selection of high merit candidates in each slot in the first phase of exam. In such a condition, the real number of selected aspirants was quite less than the promised vacancies, the candidates alleged. In the first phase of examination, 80,643 candidates were declared as successful.Meanwhile, following similar protests in different part of the country, the union railway ministry in a communiqué has warned that railway job aspirants found indulging in unlawful activities may face lifetime debarment from obtaining railway job.“It has come to notice that aspirants of railway jobs have indulged in vandalism/unlawful activities like protesting on railway tracks, disruption of train operations, damaging railway properties etc. Such misguided activities are highest level of indiscipline rendering such aspirants unsuitable for railway/government job. Videos of such activities will be examined with the help of specialised agencies and candidates/aspirants found indulged in unlawful activities will be liable for police action as well as lifetime debarment from obtaining railway job,” the communiqué says.The notice further mentioned that Railway Recruitment Boards are committed to conducting fair and transparent recruitment process maintaining highest standards of integrity. Railway job aspirants/candidates are advised not to be misguided or come under the influence of such elements who are trying to use them for fulfilling their own selfish ends, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/aspirants-allege-anomalies-in-rrb-exam-results-protest-in-prayagraj-101643131348400.html
25-01-2022||Mumbai||Close to 34K cases in state, experts say third wave declining||Mumbai Maharashtra on Tuesday reported 33,914 Covid cases, prompting officials from the public health department to say that the third wave, which was driven by the Omicron variant, could be on the decline.As many as 28,286 people tested positive on Monday after 141,949 tests were conducted. On Tuesday, 1,72,498 tests were conducted. However, the number of mortalities were higher at 86, compared to 36 on Monday. Mumbai too saw 1,815 new infections, compared to a marginally higher 1,857 cases on Monday.Pune city recorded the highest number of cases at 5,323, followed by Pimpri Chinchwad (3,299), Nagpur city (3,023), and Pune district (2,047). A total of 13 patients with Omicron were reported in Maharashtra, and of these, 12 are from Pune city, and one from the neighbouring Pimpri-Chinchwad city. To date, a total of 2,858 patients infected with the Omicron strain have been reported in the state of which 1,534 have been discharged following a negative RTPCR test.“The wave has begun to recede,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, the state’s surveillance officer. The third wave set in earlier in Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and areas neighbouring Mumbai by December 22. This was because the Omicron variant arrived in India from foreign shores, and the effect was first felt in areas with international links and high population density. The wave also began waning earlier in these areas. “In other parts of the state, the rise started later, and is also expected to taper later,” he explained.“The infection numbers are expected to be stable by January-end or the second week of February, and they will begin to decline gradually later,” added Awate. “We were expecting the cases to be one-and-half times of the second wave. But there were several variable factors. Though Omicron is more transmissible, the virgin population, which had not been vaccinated or had not been infected during the first and second wave (and hence lacked natural or virus-induced immunity), was in a minority. This restricted the spread of the strain,” he said.Awate added that while around 50 to 60 per cent of the infections were breakthrough infections with those being fully vaccinated also testing positive, they were mostly mild and asymptomatic cases.However, officials admit that the availability of rapid antigen test (RAT) kits that allow people to get themselves tested at home had ensured that these figures were not completely captured in the system. So far, around 3,00,000 people, of which 15,000 have tested positive through the home testing route, have uploaded their reports, though the actual number of those who have tested positive yet not informed the authorities is likely to be much higher, according to state officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/close-to-34k-cases-in-state-experts-say-third-wave-declining-101643130512031.html
25-01-2022||Ranchi||RPN tried to topple J’khand govt: MLA||Hours after Congress leader and former union minister RPN Singh joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday, a Congress legislator from Jharkhand said he had colluded with the saffron party for more than a year in a bid to overthrow the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM)-led government in the state.R P N Singh was Congress’s in-charge of Jharkhand since July 2017 and has been instrumental in forging an alliance with the JMM and Congress in 2019 Lok Sabha and assembly elections. He was given extension as in-charge in September 2020 and has been acting in that capacity till the time he crossed over to BJP on Tuesday. “Since the beginning, he has been trying to destabilise the state government. We also had brought this to the notice of the central leadership. Every true Congress worker and supporter of Jharkhand is happy with him (Singh) going to BJP,” said Amba Prasad, a first-time legislator who represents Barkagaon seat of Hazaribag district in the state assembly.Asked by reporters on the allegations made by her, Singh said, “Entire Jharkhand is aware of my contribution to the formation of government in the state... I don’t make personal comments.”The JMM-Congress-RJD combine government led by chief minister Hemant Soren enjoys a comfortable majority, with 49 MLAs in the 81-member assembly. Of the 49, 30 are from JMM, 18 from Congress and one from RJD, besides outside support of one MLA each of NCP and CPI (ML). However, the ruling dispensation has, in the past, accused opposition BJP of trying to topple the government through horse trading. Last year, a case was registered in Ranchi and three persons arrested from a hotel here for allegedly trying to lure at least three Congress legislators to cross over.The exit of RPN Singh has also exposed the prevailing cracks in the Jharkhand unit of Congress, a section of which also demanded that the decisions taken by Singh related to the party be revoked, an apparent reference to appointment of new Jharkhand Congress president and four working presidents last year. “It is for the first time that party workers burst fire crackers at the party office after a leader left the party. They were forced to accept all his decisions, treating him as representative of party president Sonia Gandhi. However, he tried his best that BJP comes to power in 2019 assembly election with his decisions. Even after people threw away the BJP out of power, he installed outsiders on key positions in the state unit, weakening the organisation further,” said Alok Dubey, former spokesperson of the Jharkhand Congress. Dubey is considered close to former president and serving finance minister Rameshwar Oraon, who was made state president ahead of 2019 assembly elections. Oroan relinquished his party post in September last year after Rajesh Thakur, considered close to Singh, was appointed state unit chief. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Thakur said Singh’s exit would not have any effect on the party. “Congress is fighting for truth under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi. It requires courage. His decision to quit the party seems driven by selfishness. He would never get the stature in BJP that he had in Congress,” said Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/r-p-n-tried-to-topple-j-khand-govt-mla-101643129189117.html

When RPF and GRP personnel reached the spot to pacify them, the agitated students allegedly pelted stones causing police to use lathi-charge, officials said.A large number of students also created ruckus at Sitamarhi, Buxar, Muzaffarpur, Chhapra, Vaishali, Gaya railway station and other parts of the state as well. In Sitamarhi, the police used tear gas shells and opened fire in the air to push back the job aspirants. “Protesters turned violent and few police personnel were even injured. Public property was also damaged. Police exercised restraint and used force only when needed,” said Samastipur DM Sunil Kumar Yadav.In Patna’s Saidpur-Bhikhna Pahari localities, police resorted to baton charge and used tear gas shells on agitated students when they allegedly pelted stones on them. More than six policemen and dozens of students were injured in the clash. Late in the evening, the administration had to cut-off power facilities and conducted raids against the protestors.Demanding that corrections be made in the results, one of the agitating candidates said, “Multiple selection of the same candidate means that many genuine candidates have to sit out. They have been deprived of their opportunity.”Taking serious note of the violence by railway job aspirants since Monday, RRB on Tuesday issued a stern warning saying that those involved in “illegal activities and destruction of government property” could be banned for life for any kind of jobs in the Railways.“Demonstration on railway tracks, disrupting trains and damaging railway property reflects high level of indiscipline, making those involved ineligible for government jobs. Assistance from special agencies would be sought to look into the video footage the candidates involved in vandalism and apart from police action, they will also face life ban for railway jobs. RRB is committed to unbiased and transparent recruitment process. Railway job aspirants are advised not to get misled by those using them for their vested interests,” said the notice from the RRB chairman on Tuesday.Meanwhile, hundreds of daily commuters including office employees were left stranded at various railway stations on the busy Howrah-Patna-New Delhi main line, Dhanbad-Gaya-DDU grand Chord Rail section and Gaya-Kiul-Bhagalpur section, with trains to destinations like Buxar, Ara, Mokama and Bhagalpur unable to run due to the protests.Following the agitation and road blocked, the east central railway (ECR) authority canceled five trains including 12351 Howrah-Rajendra Nagar Terminal Exp, 13287South Bihar Express, 03616 Gaya-Jamalpur special, 15126 Patna-Banaras Express and 13024 Gaya-Howrah Express.The ECR authorities had to divert more than 15 trains including Shramjeevi Express, Poorva Express, Danapur-Secunderbad Express, Bhagalpur-New Delhi Express, Patna-Kota Express, Magadh Express, Dehradoon Express, Ernakulam Express, Gaya-Kamakhya Express and Indore-Patna express.Meanwhile, Patna DM Dr Chandrasekhar Singh said three separate FIRs have been lodged and four persons have been arrested in connection with the disruption caused at the Rajendra Nagar railway terminal. “More FIRs could be lodged against students and suspected owners of the coaching institutes, who are provoking job aspirants, “ the DM said.The RRB had conducted stage-1 computer-based test of 2019 Non-Technical Popular Category (NTPC) recruitment.

In an affidavit submitted before the division bench comprising chief justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and justice Sujeet Narayan Prasad, which is hearing a petition seeking revision of results of preliminary examination, the commission sought three weeks from the court to deliberate on the issues raised by the petitioner. “The commission informed the court that they are postponing the Mains exam and has sought three weeks time to review the issues raised by us. Our primary plea has been to postpone the mains exams as there has been discrepancy in the prelims result that needs to be reviewed,” Amritans Vats, counsel for petitioner Kumar Sanyam, told reporters. The petitioner has challenged the prelims result saying the commission provided benefit of reservation to reserved category candidates at the preliminary examination stage, which was against “The Jharkhand Combined Civil Services Examination (1st Amendment) Rules, 2021. On November 2 last year, the JPSC had declared preliminary examination result, announcing 4,293 candidates eligible for the Mains exam, including 1,897 under unreserved category, 1,057 under scheduled tribe (ST) category, 389 under scheduled caste (SC) category, 645 under OBC and 305 under EWS category.The JPSC civil services examination prelims result has been under scrutiny since beginning, with several applicants as well as opposition parties demanding cancellation of the examination and removal of JPSC chairman who they accused of corruption.Questions were raised after few selected candidates, who took the examination in the same room in at least two centres in Latehar and Sahebganj, were found to have cleared the examination. Opposition BJP had disrupted proceedings in the winter session of Jharkhand assembly over the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/amid-row-jpsc-defers-civils-mains-exam-to-review-prelims-result-101643129129641.html
25-01-2022||Patna||Patna has five original copies of Constitution in three libraries, one put on display||The Gandhi Sangrahalaya in Bihar’s capital Patna has put on display one of the original 1,000 copies of the Indian Constitution, which was gifted to it in 2017 by former Governor of Tripura, professor Sidheshwar Prasad, who was elected to the Lok Sabha from Nalanda in the first parliamentary elections in 1952, the museum’s joint director Asif said. These copies were printed at Survey of India’s printing facility in Dehradun using lithograph technique. The Indian Constitution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on November 26,1949, and came into force on January 26, 1950.The Constitution was originally hand written by Prem Behari Narain Raizada in English and by Vasant Krishna Vaidya in Hindi. There were only three copies of this hand written version of the Indian Constitution at that time. Later, 1,000 copies were printed in Dehradun.“These printed copies were given to parliamentarians and ministers and other eminent leaders of the time. Gandhi Museum did not have this copy in its collection. It was only in 2017 that the former Governor of Tripura donated some of his collections to the museum, including the original copy of the Constitution,” Asif said. “It’s now one of the most precious possession of the Gandhi Museum. Earlier, people would visit us mainly to see the collection of objects, documents and photographs on Gandhi. These days, many also turn up to take a look at the original copy of the Indian Constitution,” he said.Apart from Gandhi Museum, Patna Museum in the state capital has three of the original copies. “But these are not available for public viewing these days,” Suman Kumar, curator, Patna Museum, said, adding that Dr Rajendra Prasad gallery, where the copies is kept, is under construction these days.One of the three copies was donated to Patna Museum by Dr Rajendra Prasad, the first President of the country and president of the Constituent Assembly. “The other two copies came to us a few years ago. “In fact, these copies were handed over to the museum by the local police which had recovered them in some case,” Kumar said. The two copies were originally with the family of Mungeri Lal, who was elected MLA in the first Bihar assembly elections and went on to become a minister in the state government. Yet another copy of the Indian Constitution is at the Sachidanand Sinha Library in Patna, named after the man who was the chairman of the Constituent Assembly. “But that too is not on public display because of security reasons. It’s a precious collection and needs to be preserved,” said B K Sinha, grandson of Sachidanand Sinha.“The original final draft of the Indian Constitution still has his signature. To get his signature, the final draft had to be brought to Patna at his residence as Sachidanand Sinha was too week to visit Delhi,” he said.This printed copy, which was presented to him, later became a part of collection of Sinha library, which he had set up in memory of his wife in 1924.

Her duets with the legendary Hemanta Mukherjee, who became popular in the Hindi film industry as Hemant Kumar, are considered assets by millions of her fans. “She said an official from Delhi called her up in the afternoon. She told him that Padma Shri is not an award that should be conferred on a veteran like her. It would be demeaning for her to accept it,” the family friend said, citing a conversation with the singer.Born in 1931, Sandhya Mukherjee recorded her first song in 1948 for the Hindi movie Anjaan Garh. The music was directed by Rai Chand Boral. She sang under the direction of famous composers such as S D Burman, Roshan and Madan Mohan.Mukherjee received the Banga Bibhusan, the highest civilian honour given by the West Bengal government in 2011 and the National Film Award for best female playback singer in 1970 for the movies Jay Jayanti (a Bengali remake of Sound of Music) and Nishi Padma. Nishi Padma was remade in Hindi as Amar Prem, starring Rajesh Khanna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/demeaning-bengali-singer-sandhya-mukherjee-90-declines-padma-offer-101643128347796.html
25-01-2022||Mumbai||Torn doctor’s prescription leads to arrest of 3 for murdering 45-year-old in Bhiwandi||A torn doctor’s prescription led the Bhiwandi Nizampura Police to the three accused for allegedly murdering a 45-year-old man and dumping his body in a white gunny bag last week.The police were initially clueless about the man’s identity but later traced the doctor and the pharmacists and identified the man. The investigations revealed that the deceased was killed by three of his colleagues as one of them had an affair with the victim’s wife.On January 20, the police found the body of Arman Sher Ali Shah under the Rupala Bridge in Bhiwandi. The body had already started to decompose and was beyond identification. The police searched his person and found a torn prescription from a doctor. While inspecting his clothes, they also found a blot of colour used in pearls or beads factories. With these two clues, the investigations began. An officer from Nizampura police station said, “The deceased had several injury marks on his body, establishing that he was brutally killed. The prescription we found was torn, so we could not find the name of the patient. The doctor’s name was partially visible. So, after day-long inquiries in different areas, we traced the doctor. However, he had no record of the patient. So, we inquired in the nearby pharmacies with the same prescription and also inquired about the missing person in the nearby areas. Finally, we traced the family after two days. However, they too found it difficult to identify Shah. His elder son identified the body based on a mole on his face and a locket (Tavij) he was wearing.The police learned that the deceased never left his wife anywhere and accompanied her everywhere. The cops traced the calls on his mobile. However, he had not carried his mobile with him on the day of the murder. They called some of the repeated calls on his number for questioning, when the main accused, Salman Shaikh, 27, confessed to the murder.Deputy Commissioner of Police, Y Chauhan, said, “He allegedly had an affair with the deceased’s wife and Shah was an obstacle for him. He and two of his friends murdered Shah. The other two accused had fled to UP. So, we sent a team there. They had escaped from there and went to Bhusaval. We sent another team to Bhusaval and nabbed Taslim Ansari, 30, and Chanbabu Ansari, 26.”Chauhan added that the three assaulted the accused to death, packed him in a gunny bag, threw him under the bridge and left. The deceased’s wife, however, had no role in the murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/torn-doctor-s-prescription-leads-to-arrest-of-3-for-murdering-45-year-old-in-bhiwandi-101643125947557.html

Under the model, the BEST does not own the vehicles but hires them from contractors along with the drivers at a fixed rate for each km. In the first phase, 400 buses are expected to arrive this year, including 200 at a cost of Rs.132 crore, by March. The remaining buses will be procured in 2023. “This move will help commuters as the number of buses will increase. We are already operating mini and midi AC buses. All 900 buses will arrive by 2023,” Lokesh Chandra, general manager, BEST, said. The BEST had in December 2021 planned to procure 200 electric double-decker AC buses and subsequently added another 200 buses. The number was later increased to 900. A double-decker bus has a capacity to carry 79 passengers. It was introduced by the BEST in 1937 and it gained popularity among commuters and tourists visiting the city. From an initial fleet of 141 during 1947-1948, it grew to 882 in 1993. At present, there are only 48 double-decker buses in a fleet of 3,377 buses. Rest of the buses were phased out from the aging fleet. The drop in their number was also because of the difficulty and higher cost of maintenance. The number of single-decker buses, including AC mini and midi, stands at 3,329.The BEST buses presently have an estimated ridership of 2.7 million passengers every day. It is the second biggest mass transport system in Mumbai after the suburban railway network.

25-01-2022||Pune||In run-up to civic polls, corporators busy converting amenity spaces into gardens||PUNE With the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) polls just round the corner, elected representatives are going all out with a flurry of citizen-centric initiatives to woo the electorate. Corporators are busy converting their amenity spaces into gardens, playgrounds and theme parks to attract voters in their respective constituencies.Although only three gardens have been officially sanctioned by the civic administration over the past three months, over two dozen small and big parks have been inaugurated by corporators across the city to please citizens. According to officials, the gardens are being developed on open spaces with no reservation and are in the general category. According to the PMC, deserted places can be made green by planting trees.PMC garden head Ashok Ghorpade said, “We are developing three gardens in Kondhwa and the adjoining areas where the projects have been sanctioned. We encourage citizens to plant trees as per the guidelines of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act.” Ghorpade said that initially, citizens take care of the spaces where they develop gardens and later after completing the paperwork, the civic body takes over the project.A total of 208 public gardens have been developed in the city by the PMC. Around 100 out of these have come up on amenity spaces with 10 having come up recently. Some of these gardens were inaugurated in the Kothrud, Baner, Mohammadwadi, Kondhwa, Kharadi, Kale Padal and Hadpasar areas of the city. According to the elected representatives, the greatest demand is for public gardens followed by that for playgrounds even as some residents want a hospital or public dispensary for their ward. In the Kale Padal area of the city, a massive garden and sprawling sports ground is being readied on reserved amenity spaces to be inaugurated before the announcement of the model code of conduct.Corporator Pramod alias Nana Bhangire who has been spearheading over a dozen citizen-centric projects in ward number 26 namely Mohammadwadi said, “I have been trying to bring funds under various categories for development of the ward. We are building a world-class sports complex, playground, gardens, theme parks and a nullah garden for the citizens. Similarly, we are taking assistance from private agencies to ensure that the development works are carried out in full swing.” Of these projects, the playground-cum-garden sits on six acre of land and is being constructed at a cost of ₹6 crore while the sports complex – one of the biggest sporting venues – is being constructed on four acre of land at a cost of ₹8 crore. According to BJP corporator Srinath Bhimale, corporators carry out public works including constructing public gardens, playgrounds and schools; beautifying chowks; installing CCTVs; among others for residents of the locality. “I have completed flyover work including taking possession of the space reserved for the garden which is a major victory for the people. It’s a good thing that the corporators are completing the pending work before the civic body goes to polls,” Bhimale said. The residents of Salisbury Park from where Bhimale has been elected as corporator won a 20-year-long battle for the garden in November. The new garden spread across 3.5 acre lies adjacent to the old Gool Poonawala garden at Salisbury Park.According to social activist Pravin Chavan, with polls round the corner, the elected representatives are busy inaugurating gardens, playgrounds and other public utilities, which is a good sign. “However, we want citizens to play a direct role in the decision making process as elected representatives do not always undertake projects as per public needs. The issue of reservation of amenity spaces must be taken up after considering the citizens’ demands and not the amenity space committee which makes unilateral decisions in official cabins,” he said.

Her kin reached the hostel when they could not contact her on her mobile phone despite repeated calls. The girl’s roommate informed the family that she left the hostel on January 22 evening, saying she was going to hand over some notes to her friend, Aman Singh, of Azamgarh. Subsequently, the girl’s family approached the Colonelganj police and lodged an FIR of abduction against Aman. The cops detained Aman and questioned him about the whereabouts of the girl. He informed police that he and the girl were at a deserted spot near IERT when some miscreants attacked them. Aman claimed that he fled the spot after being assaulted and had no knowledge about the girl’s whereabouts since then. The police traced the last location of the girl’s cell phone, which was found at the same spot near IERT. Late on Monday night, police teams launched a search operation in the bushes and found the body of the girl in an old well (around 80 ft deep). An NDRF team was called to pull out the victim’s body, which was identified by her mother and other relatives.A panel of doctors conducted a post-mortem examination of the body on Tuesday, which suggested that the girl was gangraped before being strangulated. SSP Ajay Kumar said the girl’s alleged friend, Aman, was giving contradictory statements during interrogation and was the prime suspect. Investigations revealed that he did not try to get help from the police when he and the girl were assaulted at the deserted spot, and instead remained silent about the incident.

25-01-2022||Pune||PMPML to develop EV charging stations for public use||PUNE In a bid to generate non-ticketing revenue, the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) is soon going to start charging stations at their depots as well as PMPML-owned open spaces in and around Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad cities.The tendering process for the development of PMPML-owned spaces has been initiated, and depots will be developed under this project. As the demand for electric vehicles and bikes has risen following the hike in fuel prices in the country, one of the major issues faced by people is how to charge these e-vehicles.Chetana Kerure, joint managing director of PMPML, said, “We are developing depots and open spaces owned by the organisation in the city and around the highways that are currently used for the parking of buses. Already, we have our depots with charging facilities but to generate revenue and income, we have decided to develop charging stations for public use.”“Under this project, people can charge their electric vehicles at these charging stations and pay for the same. Through this, we can also get some more income as we are already suffering financially due to strict Covid-19 restrictions and decrease in the number of passengers,” she said.Citizens have welcomed the decision and Vipul Alekar, owner of an electric car, said, “I stay in Hadapsar and for charging of the car, I have to go all the way to a friend’s house. If we get a PMPML charging station nearby and also on the highways, it will be beneficial for us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmpml-to-develop-ev-charging-stations-for-public-use-101643119707312.html

It is unbearable that it has even been used on shoes. I have instructed the director-general of police (DGP) to take action by registering an FIR against the owners of Amazon.”“Prima facie, this case appears to be a violation of the Flag Code, which is painful. Insult to the nation will not be tolerated at any cost,” he added.A police officer said the case was registerd on a complaint filed by a 26-year-old private firm executive Shubham Naidu and clarified that the case names the seller as the prime accused.The exact details of the items considered offensive were not shared by the police.An Amazon spokesperson said: “Amazon.in is an online marketplace where third-party sellers offer products for sale directly to customers, and as such are responsible for ensuring their products comply will all applicable laws and regulations. Amazon remains committed to taking necessary action against sellers who list any non-compliant products, including the take-down of non-compliant listings and potential removal of their account.” This is the third time that Narottam Mishra has ordered the police to register a FIR against the e-commerce platform in recent months.In November last year, a FIR was registered against Amazon after a seller was accused of selling marijuana on the website in Bhind district. A few days later, a second FIR was registered after a youth died by suicide by consuming a poison that he ordered from the site. The home minister also said the state will come up with a law to keep a check on the sale of products on online shopping sites.

Often, in case there is a rift in the family, the bundle of joy helps mend that rift. Much the same is the case of Kesh Kumari, lodged in the Pratapgarh district jail for murdering her three-year-old son, last year.She delivered a baby girl a fortnight ago and that child is forcing a change of heart among family members, who had totally shunned Kesh Kumari, as well as fellow prisoners.Her husband, mother-in-law and other family members and fellow jail inmates, all have had a change of heart owing to the birth of the little one and have begun helping Kesh Kumari raise the newborn. Prison authorities, too, have begun providing much-needed nutritious food to Kesh Kumari as per the jail manual.The details are as follows. Rakesh Verma, a resident of Baijnath village of Antu police station of the neighbouring district of Pratapgarh is a labourer. On March 29, 2021, his wife, Kesh Kumari, insisted on going to her maternal home on Holi but Rakesh refused. It is alleged that an upset and angry Kesh Kumari killed her only son Yug (3) with a knife and even tried to slash her own throat. However, her screams of pain resulted in her mother-in-law, Prabhavati, waking up and crying out for help. Soon Rakesh and his father, Ramsukh, rushed in to find Yug’s body lying in a pool of blood, jail officials said.It is also alleged that the family members buried the body to escape police investigation. On the evening of March 30, when someone informed the police, the body was taken out and a post-mortem examination was carried out. On the complaint of Ramsukh, the police registered a case of murder against Kesh Kumari and also arrested Rakesh and Prabhavati for conspiracy.The latter two got bail but Kesh Kumari, pregnant at the time of the incident, was sent to jail. Soon, family members distanced themselves from her, prison officials said. After the birth of the girl, Kesh Kumari’s husband and mother-in-law went to meet her for the first time after a long gap and had even brought Sonthoura, Achwani and Pissua (ethnic preparations given to a woman who has delivered a baby) among other things for her and the baby. Because of this, her condition too has started to improve, officials said. Even the jail administration made arrangements of a special nutritional diet as per the jail manual. Officials said that as the jail staff and female prisoners were also worried for the new-born, the little girl has started getting extra care from everyone. A woman head warder, considered very strict by the prisoners, has started massaging the newborn after her duty hours. Women prisoners are helping in preparing ‘Uptaan’ (the paste of turmeric and gram flour) and have brought oil for the massage of the child. Jail superintendent, RP Chaudhary, said, “After the birth of the girl, Kesh Kumari is being treated and provided all help according to the jail manual and the guidelines of the Supreme Court for pregnant women in jails.”

25-01-2022||Mumbai||Shiv Sena mouthpiece hits out at Modi over his ‘correcting the mistakes’ remark||MUMBAI: Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the government was “correcting the mistakes” made after Independence, Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana criticised him, saying destroying the old does not mean creating a new history. An editorial in Saamana said searching for “mistakes” after Independence meant destroying everything that was done to build the country in the last 50-60 years and rewriting history how leaders want today.Modi on January 23 unveiled a hologram statue of Subhas Chandra Bose at India Gate and said the country was correcting “mistakes” made after independence. He added efforts were made to erase the contribution of “several great personalities” along with the nation’s heritage and culture.The Sena mouthpiece said those speaking about the fight for Independence were not involved in it while Jana Sangh and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did not even exist. Questioning Modi’s statement, the Sena asked if the construction of a new Parliament and relocating the Amar Jawan Jyoti, which was to commemorate the sacrifice of soldiers, were mistakes the government was rectifying.“The Parliament building is connected to the freedom struggle. Many great leaders who were involved in the fight are associated with the building. It is witness to many important decisions... the Constitution Assembly. When Modi was elected as prime minister, he stood at the steps of the same building and got emotional. But this building is a mistake that Modi is correcting by building a new Parliament house.”BJP leaders as a policy do not respond to criticism in Saamana.

Has he become a law unto himself? I will not tolerate such kind of indiscretion. The Speaker should not henceforth blackout the address of the governor. If he, does it, he will face the music,” Dhankhar said. He added that the speaker cannot be allowed to be a law unto himself. “He thinks he is above the governor. Who is the Constitutional head? I hope good sense prevails,” Dhankhar told reporters after visiting the assembly to pay floral tributes to BR Ambedkar on the occasion the National Voters’ Day.Biman Banerjee, who was nearby when Dhankhar made the comments, said the criticism was unwarranted. “The governor said he would pay floral tributes. But he held a press conference. I was stunned that the governor made critical statements on several issues related to the assembly while paying tribute to Ambedkar. I think this is extremely discourteous.”Dhankhar has been in the news for his acrimonious relationship with the TMC government since he took over as the governor in 2019. The government has accused Dhankhar of stalling bills.Dhankhar maintained not a single proposed law was pending with him. “No file is pending with me. I have raised questions (and sent back files to the state government). There has been no response from the government. Unless they respond to my questions, they will have a tough time. Before invoking my powers, I would want every answer well in advance.”Also Read: Bengali actor Bonny Sengupta quits BJP, says party failed to keep promisesBiman Banerjee said multiple bills were pending with Dhankhar as he refused to sign them. “He wants specific words to be included in the bills without which he would sign them. He is just delaying the bills. He is not the only governor. We have worked with several governors but there has been no resistance. We had cordial relations and no governor had made such statements. I did not understand who was the governor representing?”Dhankhar also lashed out at chief minister Mamata Banerjee and bureaucrats, alleging that they never reply to his letters. “For the last two years, the chief minister has not replied to any information sought...” He added the bureaucracy has to be held accountable. Dhankhar alleged the bureaucracy is politically committed. “Are they to follow the diktats of an individual?”TMC lawmaker Saugata Roy hit back, saying Dhankhar has no self-respect. “He sent me messages against the chief minister. He keeps on making absurd statements. He is disrespecting an elected government and the chief minister of a state. He is defying the Constitution. He is the only governor to do this.”Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party leader Sukanta Majumdar said they have been saying for a long time that there is no democracy in West Bengal. “The governor has just reiterated this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-governor-gets-into-war-of-words-with-assembly-speaker-tmc-101643105896268.html

Also read: Cold wave likely in parts of northwest India this weekPresiding over the Himachal Pradesh Statehood Day function at Solan, Thakur announced that his government had implemented the new pay scale from this month, benefitting 2.25 lakh employees. The move has put an additional burden of ₹6,000 crore annually on the state exchequer. “It has come to my notice that employees were not getting proper benefits under the two options which they have been given to opt from. Now, a third option will be given and if there is still some shortcoming, the government will reconsider their demands and decide accordingly,” he said. Government employees in Himachal Pradesh have played a crucial role in tilting the political scales. The chief minister also announced enhanced dearness allowance for the state government employees. He said that the government had announced 28% DA on revised pay scales. “However, now the state government employees will be given 31% DA, which is on a par with central government employees,” he said. The DA will be given from the due date and it cost the exchequer ₹500 crore. The chief minister said that the state government was sympathetic towards the demands of pensioners and despite its limited resources, pensioners would be given benefits on the basis of the Punjab Pay Commission, which will benefit 1.75 lakh pensioners. The decision will put an annual additional burden of ₹2,000 crore on the state government. Reiterating his commitment to the welfare of low-income groups, he said: “Domestic consumers will be provided free electricity up to 60 units.

25-01-2022||Mumbai||Kangana again moves plea seeking transfer of Javed Akhtar’s lawsuit against her||MUMBAI: Actress Kangana Ranaut has again challenged the order of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) court before the Mumbai city and civil court, Dindoshi, seeking to transfer all proceedings in a case filed by lyricist Javed Akhtar against her. The Bollywood actress has said that though she brought the alleged bias of the magistrate to the knowledge of the CMM court, it rejected her petition.Ranaut has moved the petition under section 408 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which deals with ‘power of sessions judge to transfer cases and appeals’.She has said in her petition filed through advocate Rizwan Siddiquee that being aggrieved by the orders of the Metropolitan Magistrate 10th Court, Andheri, which sufficiently proves the acts of biased and prejudiced mind on the part of the said magistrate the applicant filed a plea under section 410 of CrPC before the CMM court (withdrawal of cases by judicial magistrates). Despite bringing to the knowledge the act of bias of the magistrate the court passed an order on 21st of October rejecting the actress’ application of transfer of the case filed by Akhtar, the plea added. Thereafter, the sessions court also rejected her revision on technical grounds on December 31, 2021. So, she has filed the fresh petition under section 408 of CrPC praying transfer of the proceedings to any other court.Additional session’s judge, Shridhar Bhosale will hear the plea on January 27. The judge has asked Akhtar who was represented by his counsel Jay Bharadwaj to file a reply by the next date to her petition.The actress alleged in her transfer petition that the Andheri magistrate who is hearing Akhtar’s defamation complaint against her is prima facie biased against her, issuing a bailable warrant in a summons triable case despite she been represented by her counsel, not hearing her plea for permanent exemption which is pending since long, coercing the applicant to file exemption application on every date and threatening to issue “arrest warrants” in a bailable and non-cognizable offence to secure presence. She also made a statement through her counsel, “I am making a categorical statement that I have no faith in this court,”Akhtar filed a defamation complaint against Ranaut in November, 2020, for allegedly making defamatory and baseless comments against him in a television interview.The actress filed a counter complaint against Akhtar alleging extortion and criminal intimidation. She alleged that during her dispute with her co-star Hrithik Roshan, Akhtar called her and further acting as a mediator threatened her thereby asking her to tender a written apology to her co-star.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kangana-ranaut-moves-fresh-plea-for-transferring-javed-akhtar-s-case-against-her-101643099115183.html

"After getting down from the vehicle, he threw dust in the eyes of the police personnel and tried to snatch a service rifle from one of them. The policemen initially shot in the air as a warning but Ghosi refused to surrender, following which he was shot at in his leg," the SP said. He was admitted to a hospital and undergoing treatment.

25-01-2022||Chandigarh||Missing school instead of wanting to miss it||When they were little, one of the biggest grudges my kids held against me, was that I never allowed them to skip school. On the rare occasions that they had to stay home on account of illness, I would ensure that they didn’t have fun, keeping them in a state of ‘complete rest’ with the television out of bounds. It was easy to condemn children to boredom then, the internet and its accompanying 24x7 entertainment had yet to arrive. When my five-year-old daughter kept telling me how all her friends got to occasionally stay home. I thought it was time to put an end to the pestering. So, I told her she could miss school if she agreed to attend my class instead. She happily agreed thinking that I would get busy with my patients and she would be free to do as she pleased. Our residence is located on the floor above my clinic. I spent the day rushing upstairs between patients to check my daughter’s assignments and give her more. At first, she was compliant, but I slowly wore her down. She finally broke and cried, “Aapka school toh bahut khatarnak hai. Games period aur recess bhi nahin hota (Your school is very dangerous. There isn’t even a games period and lunch break).” Never again did my daughter ask to stay home. My son, who is seven years younger, had heard exaggerated accounts of mummy’s khatarnak school from his sister. The more diligent of the two, he wasn’t convinced. “How bad could it be?” he reasoned. “Kitna kaam dengi?Mein karta chala jaunga. (How much work can she give. I’ll keep doing it.).” So, I let him stay home for a day. I had developed a knee problem by then which made negotiating stairs cumbersome. But I knew that to make the treatment effective I had to deliver the optimum dose of ‘bitter’ medicine. So, I made countless trips from my clinic to my son’s room where he sat diligently doing the assigned work. My heart broke each time I saw that he had completed it in his beautiful handwriting. Keeping a straight face, I kept piling it on until he cried in frustration. Needless to say, it was the last day he asked to miss school. For those of you wondering whether I had scarred them for life. I hadn’t. They still call me ‘gandi mumma’ though. Recently, I watched my niece’s daughter attend school. The usual chaos, the teacher instructing a child to sit up straight, students raising hands to answer questions, some speaking out of turn. This was interspersed with some ‘unusual’ classroom banter, the monitor instructing a student to mute his mike, a child requesting the teacher to share her screen. My six-year-old grandchild followed the proceedings on a laptop, while simultaneously scrolling her mobile for an assignment the teacher had sent on WhatsApp. She wanted to be the first one to register and submit. Real competition exists in virtual classrooms! The resourcefulness of schools and the patience of the ‘constantly scrutinised’ teachers notwithstanding, kids are craving to return to real schools. Virtual can never live up to the actual. My heart goes out to these youngsters who miss school, instead of wanting to miss it. They are losing out on a large chunk of childhood due to this pandemic - chaotic classrooms, punishable pranks, forged friendships, bustling bus journeys, packed lunches, peer pressure and…the urge to play truant! dr_manjugupta@icloud.com The writer is a Gharaunda-based gynaecologist||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/missing-school-instead-of-wanting-to-miss-it-101643096474873.html

25-01-2022||Mumbai||Plea in Supreme Court seeks postponement of NEET-PG||MUMBAI: A group of aspirants has moved the Supreme Court demanding postponement of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-PG) scheduled in March to accommodate all candidates. Delay in conducting exams in 2021 due to the rising Covid-19 cases left thousands of MBBS graduates ineligible to appear for the NEET-PG exam. MBBS graduates, who are currently completing their internship, are also worried about the loss of a year. Without the completion of their internship, they will not be eligible for the entrance exam this year.“Many students will be completing their internship only by July-August, so we become ineligible for the exam which is being held on March 13. The next exam will be held in 2023, which means we will be waiting one year for no mistake of ours,” said a NEET-PG aspirant.Due to rising Covid-19 cases last year, several exams were postponed or cancelled. The Maharashtra University of Health Sciences conducted MBBS exams in late July and students managed to start their internships after that.Some students are also unsure how will they be able to prepare for the entrance exam especially since most interns have been working overtime because of Covid.“By postponing the entrance exam, the examination authority will also ensure there is an adequate gap between the counselling process for 2021-22 which goes on till March 16, and also gives us interns a chance,” said another student.

25-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiwale: Like a rolling stone||It is suddenly making an unsuspecting passerby hungry, this delicious smell of spiced veggies shallow-frying in oil. The entire lane is infused with a strong aroma of home-cooked subzi. At this evening hour, every household in the central Delhi neighbourhood must be preparing dinner.The source of the smell is identified within minutes. It is coming from a truck parked on one side of the lane. All the men in it are chatting in the front cabin. Except for one person, who is preparing the meal for everyone.“I’m making aloo-gobi,” says Mr Vinod. He, too, is inside the truck, but in another part of it, sitting on a low wooden patri by a small door-like opening on one side of the truck’s long trailer. “We are labourers, we work on the road outside during the day, and sleep inside [the truck] at night.” The men are in the area to lay underground electric cables.The interior of the truck’s trailer is coal-dark, though one can spot the cooking gas cylinder, and a cloth hanging from what looks like some blackened machine.Mr Vinod is amused at the assumption that he might have learned cooking at his village in Jharkhand. “Why will I have to cook in my own house? My wife makes food for me when I’m there.” He meets her very rarely though, he says, visiting his village once a year.“There is no direct train… we board a special bus at Anand Vihar bus adda that leaves at four in the evening.” The bus takes full “chaubis ghante”, or 24 hours, to drop him at his village at four the next evening. “It is a very long journey, and expensive,” he says in a flat tone.Although he has been working in Delhi for some years, Mr Vinod does not think of himself as a Delhiwale. “This city does not have the atmosphere of home.” Besides, the nature of his profession makes it impossible for him to set up roots anywhere in the city. “We stay in the truck [owned by a contractor], going from one site to another, spending only a few days in each site.”By now, the subzi in the kadhai is almost done. The cooking is at a delicate stage, and if he is not careful, he fears, the dish might get burnt. It will take another hour for everyone in the truck to be done with the dinner (including washing the dishes). And then, it will be time to sleep, Mr Vinod mutters, stirring the subzi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-like-a-rolling-stone-101643059107085.html

Ask her about the title of her anthology and Pachnanda says, “Life is full of uncertainty and challenges. However, the last couple of years have been particularly challenging for everyone. Poetry is an impactful form of self-expression, which touches the heart, and therefore I wrote this book to spread, hope, light and motivation.” Pachnanda, who hails from Panchkula, says she started writing poetry when she was 10 years old and has the uncanny ability to make anything rhyme within 30 seconds. Is it any wonder then that everything in the anthology be it the preface, acknowledgements, dedication or conclusion rhyme. While working on her career her creative side briefly took a back seat, but she rallied and started an Instagram page to share her poetry in 2019. “I got a warm response and within two years I had 40,000 followers,” she says. Buoyed by her online success, Pachnanda decided to publish her first poetry collection in 2020, on a slightly unusual topic – government schemes such as Make in India, Startup India, Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan, and Digital India Mission. The anthology titled A New India was launched by minister of woman and child development Smriti Irani. Her advice to budding poets is to remember that each of us have the power within us to create magic through our own personal experiences. “When I wanted to publish my anthology, I approached a number of publishers who told me there was not a big market for poetry in India, but I persevered, and used social media as a platform to share my poetry. So, my advice to budding artists is to stay consistent and to persevere no matter what.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/all-of-us-have-the-power-to-create-magic-poet-naina-pachnanda-101643059211847.html

In a statement, the former chief minister said that vegetable crops, including potatoes, have been completely destroyed. “Wheat and mustard farmers have also suffered due to the rainfall. Therefore, the government should give compensation to the farmers by conducting a special girdawari (crop inspection) for the loss caused to farmers without further delay,” he said. Hooda said farmers have been facing the wrath of the weather for several seasons and they have been demanding compensation but neither insurance companies nor the government has compensated them for their losses. “In the last season too, more than five lakh acres of crops were damaged due to excessive rain and waterlogging, but farmesr are still waiting for compensation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bhupinder-hooda-seeks-compensation-for-rain-affected-crops-101643058971988.html

25-01-2022||Chandigarh||Covid claims seven more lives in Chandigarh tricity||The tricity lost seven more residents to Covid-19 on Monday, pushing this month’s toll to 68, nearly 10 times higher than seven deaths in December.Both Mohali and Panchkula recorded three virus-related deaths each, while one person succumbed in Chandigarh.Those who died in Mohali were an 84-year-old woman from Phase 9, who was admitted at Cheema Hospital, Phase 4, and a 72-year-old man, who breathed his last at Ivy Hospital, Sector 71. Both were fully vaccinated, but also suffering from other diseases.The third victim, a 55-year-old woman from Kharar, was not vaccinated. She died at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh.All three deceased from Panchkula were men, aged 91, 78 and 58, residents of Sectors 2, 18 and 19, respectively.The nonagenarian was also hypertensive and diabetic, the 78-year-old was suffering from Parkinson’s disease and the 58-year-old was getting treated for cancer. Two of them were not vaccinated.The only fatality reported from Chandigarh was an 85-year-old man, who lived in Sector 7 and died at GMSH, Sector 16. He was also suffering from hypertension and hypothyroidism, and had not been vaccinated.Tricity’s daily cases drop below 2,000 after 13 daysThough over four deaths daily since January 16 remain a cause of concern, tricity’s daily Covid-19 cases dropped below 2,000, a first since 1,945 cases on January 11.As many as 1,845 people tested positive on Monday, down from 2,507 on Sunday, though health experts cautioned that it could be due to lesser number of tests amid the rainy weather, as the positivity rate didn’t see a significant decline.While Chandigarh and Panchkula reported a dip in their cases, Mohali’s infections rose.A total of 1,096 people were found infected in Mohali, compared to 1,084 the day before. In Chandigarh, the daily case count reduced from 808 to 568 and in Panchkula, from 615 to 181.However, Chandigarh’s positivity remained unchanged at around 14% over the past 24 hours. In Panchkula, though it decreased from 38% to 32%, it was still considerably high. Mohali found 23% people positive out of total samples, against 28% on Sunday, still a worrisome figure. Meanwhile, tricity’s active caseload also increased from 18,669 to 18,764 since Sunday.As many as 8,510 patients are still recuperating in Mohali, 7,768 in Chandigarh and 2,486 in Panchkula.The UT administration also declared 20 micro-containment zones across Chandigarh on Monday to prevent the infection from spreading.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-claims-seven-more-lives-in-chandigarh-tricity-101643057959837.html
25-01-2022||Chandigarh||Fatalities in Chandigarh tricity rose by 129% in last week||Even though tricity’s fresh Covid-19 cases dipped slightly between January 17 and 23, fatalities saw a 129% spike as compared to the previous week. The 39 deaths this week, up from 17 fatalities in the week preceding it, alone account for 63% of the total deaths (61) between January 1 and 23.According to health officials, most of the deceased patients either had comorbidities, were elderly or not vaccinated against the virus.In terms of cases, the tricity saw the figure dipping slightly from 20,904 to 20,085. Mohali remained the worst affected with 8,130 cases and 20 deaths in a week, a significant rise from previous week’s 7,808 cases and eight deaths. In Chandigarh, the case and death tallies were 8,064 and 15, respectively, against 9,207 cases and seven deaths the previous week. In Panchkula, the cases increased from 3,889 to 3,891, while the deaths dropped from two to one.Deaths less than second waveAmid the peak of second wave last year, the tricity had recorded 46,245 cases and 790 deaths in May. At 49,581, tricity’s cases since January 1 have already surpassed the second wave’s peak, but the number of deaths is far lower at 68.“The fewer deaths this time can be attributed to the fact that the virus is only affecting the upper respiratory tract, preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which poses higher risk. Also higher vaccination coverage since the second wave has helped lower the severity of the infection,” said Dr Sanjeev Palta, nodal officer, ICU management, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32.Elderly, unvaccinated, comorbid people still vulnerableDr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh, said, “Though severity of Covid infection is lower compared to the second wave, even mild infection is still a cause of concern for the elderly, comorbid and unvaccinated people. All Covid victims in the recent weeks were under treatment for other diseases, including diabetes, hypertension and heart, lung or kidney disease. Also, most of the deceased patients were above the age of 50.”Dr Singh added that it was also being noticed that people getting admitted in hospitals for treatment of comorbidities were being found infected with Covid-19.Dr Girish Dogra, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Mohali, said, “Around 60% of the Covid patients dying in Mohali this month had not even taken first dose of the vaccine. Besides, most were elderly and suffering from various diseases. People of all age groups must get fully vaccinated at the earliest to prevent risk of severe infection.”Panchkula chief medical officer Dr Mukta Kumar said a meeting was called to analyse the deaths in the recent weeks and in Panchkula, too, most victims were elderly and comorbid. “No patient is admitted in the district’s government facilities without RT-PCR or rapid antigen test for earlier intervention,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fatalities-in-chandigarh-tricity-rose-by-129-in-last-week-101643057958677.html
25-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Bedlam marks new MC House’s first meeting||It was pandemonium all around in the first meeting of the newly elected MC House on Monday, even as four key agendas related to city’s solid waste management and another got passed amid the din without any discussion.The meeting’s proceedings were stalled for around three hours as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Congress councillors sat in the well of the House, and indulged in sloganeering against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), shouting “Tanashahi nahi chalegi”, which were countered by BJP councillors’ chants of “Bharat mata ki jai”. MC marshals had to be called in to restore order, and some AAP and Congress councillors had to be even physically removed from the well of the House to allow the meeting to proceed.From the beginning of the meeting, both the AAP and the Congress voiced vociferous opposition to the agendas tabled by the BJP-led MC.‘We don’t recongnise BJP mayor’Both parties objected to the agenda regarding approval of minutes of the last House meeting on January 8, wherein the mayoral elections took place. They also demanded a vote on the agenda.AAP councillors repeatedly declared from the well of the House that they didn’t accept Sarabjit Kaur as the mayor. To this Kaur retorted that they should maintain decorum in the House, as the case was pending in the Punjab and Haryana high court.In the mayoral elections, the BJP had won the mayor’s post by one vote after an AAP vote was declared void by the presiding officer, who was from the BJP. Thereafter, the AAP challenged the election in the high court, where the matter remains sub-judice. The agenda of the mayoral elections is crucial for both the AAP and the BJP as its approval would give added legitimacy to the election.On the demand of voting for approving the mayoral election-cum-last house meeting’s minutes, senior deputy mayor Dalip Sharma, who was in the mayor’s chair for nearly an hour in Kaur’s absence, said the House rules didn’t allow for voting on the minutes of the House meetings. But the councillors could submit their objections to the mayor for consideration.Ultimately, decision on the agenda was deferred as the chair directed officials to seek legal advice.Meanwhile, Congress councillors rushed to the dais, where the mayor, MC commissioner and MC secretary are seated, when the mayor told them not to create fracas as they had abstained from the mayoral elections. Marshals were called in to push the Congress councillors away from the dais.Amid high-pitch sloganeering by the AAP and the Congress, Sharma said another agenda, the election of five members to the finance and contract committee (F&CC), was approved.Agendas passed amid opposition by AAP, CongressThe AAP and Congress councillors aggressively opposed the twin agendas of repair/overhauling of the existing solid waste processing plant in Dadumajra and the bio-mining project at the adjacent landfill. Both parties also abstained from voting when the agendas were put to vote.When House secretary Rajiv Prasad asked councillors to show support, only BJP councillors raised their hands, while AAP and Congress councillors didn’t. On being asked to express opposition, the AAP and Congress councillors again did not raise their hands. Eventually, the agendas were declared as passed without any discussion.MC will now undertake repair of the mixed waste processing plant, so that dry waste can be converted into refuse derived fuel. The ₹6.33-crore cost of the project is covered under the ₹8-crore budget provided under the sanitation head.“The plant’s upgrade will take at least a couple of years. So in the meantime, its working has to be improved to curtail dumping of unprocessed waste,” said Sharma.For cleaning up more than 7.5 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of legacy waste at the Dadumajra dumping site, which is not covered under the ongoing legacy mining work, MC will undertake a ₹78-crore bio-mining project.The corporation has already submitted a funding proposal with the Union government under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM-2). Chandigarh Smart City Limited is already cleaning up another 5 lakh MT legacy waste at a cost of ₹36 crore. A total of 2.67 lakh MT has been cleared so far.Agendas cleared- ₹6.33-crore project for repair/overhaul of solid waste processing plant in Dadumajra- ₹78-crore project for bio-mining of 7.67 lakh MT legacy waste at Dadumajra landfill- Payment of hazardous/risk allowance with salary to sewer entry professionals- House also approved to declare Chandigarh as a 5-star garbage-free city (preliminary resolution)- Election of two councillors each from the AAP and the BJP, and one from the Congress to F&CC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhbedlam-marks-new-mc-house-s-first-meeting-101643057956958.html
25-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh wettest in country this January||With another spell of 38.3mm rain between Sunday night and Monday morning, and 203.9mm rain so far this month, Chandigarh has become the wettest among all states and union territories of the country in January, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The daily countrywide data compiled by IMD, Delhi, shows that Chandigarh has received the highest rain in January, which is already 749% above normal with a week to go, followed by Himachal Pradesh with 166.4mm, Jammu and Kashmir with 162mm, Punjab with 104.1mm and Uttarakhand with 100.7mm. Due to the strong western disturbances (WD) this month, the north-west region of India received the most rain.The 203.9mm rain in Chandigarh this month is also the highest since IMD started maintaining records for the city in 1953.It is also more than the showers recorded in any monsoon month in 2021. Also around 28% of the total 735.5mm rain recorded in 2021 has already been witnessed in the first 24 days of 2022.Meanwhile, in the region, Punjab has received 104.1mm rain this month, highest since 1957, when 108mm rain was recorded, and third highest of all time, as per IMD records. In Haryana, the 69.2mm rain this month is the highest since 1911, when 70.3mm rain was received, and the fourth highest ever. According to IMD Chandigarh director Manmohan Singh, the unique location of Chandigarh and the districts around it, in the foothills of the Himalayas, led to high rainfall in January. “Though another WD is approaching the region, it is unlikely to have similar effect, but there are chances of light rain towards the end of the month,” said Singh.Dry weather likely in coming daysSingh added that dry weather can be expected for some days. “But there are chances of fog formation from Tuesday morning onwards due to moisture in the air. With the skies clearing up, the minimum temperature can also drop by 4-6 degrees in the coming days,” he said.As the sky cleared up towards Monday afternoon, the maximum temperature rose from 12°C on Sunday to 14°C on Monday, but was still 6.3 degrees below normal. The minimum temperature remained unchanged at 10.7°C, 5.1 degrees above normal. In the next three days, the day temperature will remain around 15°C and the night temperature around 8-10°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-wettest-in-country-this-january-101643057955314.html
25-01-2022||Chandigarh||Illegal axing of trees: Mohali ADC recommends action against Lalru MC president, then EO||A month after indicting Lalru municipal council president Bindu Rana and then executive officer (EO) Ashok Kumar for illegal cutting of trees on 10 acres of shamlat land in Lalru in November last, Mohali additional deputy commissioner Pooja Sayal Grewal has recommended action against both officials in her final report.In the final report sent to the principal secretary, local bodies department, Punjab, Grewal has stated that though there were procedural lapses in the cutting of trees, no financial loss took place. The report detailed that both officials did not take any permission to cut the trees, neither from the forest department nor from the MC House. On the other hand, Lalru MC president Bindu Rana said, “I have no role in the matter. It’s just petty politics by the SAD MLA to defame the Congress. Moreover, the report found no financial loss.”In November 2021, Dera Bassi MLA NK Sharma had alleged that the MC had sold the axed trees, worth several lakhs, for just ₹2.25 lakh to benefit some private persons.He had claimed that during his visit to the spot, he saw many large trees, with a diameter of about two-and-a-half feet, being axed by around 50 people.“The whole business was going on without the approval of the forest department. As per rules, a written assessment was to be done by the forest department before giving permission for cutting trees on shamlat land, after which advertisement for auctioning of trees was to be issued,” the MLA had said.EO Ashok Kumar was shunted out the same day and sent to the head office in Sector 35, Chandigarh. The next day, an inquiry was marked. Even the block officer of the forest department had confirmed that the matter regarding clearance for axing the trees was not in his notice.

25-01-2022||Delhi||Anti-CAA protest sites ‘picked near mosques’: Cops to court while opposing bail for Khalid||The Delhi Police on Monday, while opposing former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Umar Khalid’s bail plea, told a trial court that sites in Delhi for protests against the amended citizenship law were carefully picked because of their proximity to local mosques and were “purposely given secular names” to prove the legitimacy of the protests, arguing that agitators sought to “instigate the Muslim community” to join the stir.Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, claimed the organisers of the protest sites wanted to “create the groundwork for 24x7 sit-in protests”. He argued that the protest sites were “not organic” and alleged the role of “hidden elements like Popular Front of India (PFI), Jamat-e-Hind and Student Islamic Organisation of India” in their organisation.He alleged that a protest site in northeast Delhi’s Shreeram Colony was close to Noorani Masjid, the Sadar Bazar site was close to Shahi Idgaah, the Shastri Park site in east Delhi was close to the Wahid Jama Masjid and Gandhi Park protest site in south Delhi was near Jamila Masjid.“They spread misinformation and instigated the Muslim community to join the protests, including women and children,” the public prosecutor argued.The prosecution also said that northeast Delhi was “chosen for its social, economic matrix for mass-scale violence”.To this, the court asked, “But if you look at his speeches, Sharjeel Imam does not believe in any ideology starting from Gandhi till today. He only believes in himself. So how did he align with others?”Earlier, advancing his arguments on behalf of Khalid, senior advocate Trideep Pais told the court the statement of the witnesses showed that he was falsely implicated and a case can’t be made against him on half truths.Pais contended that police had written fanciful stories in the chargesheet and asked whether his client could be charged under UAPA for calling for road blockades in the city. Khalid and several others have been booked under UAPA and are accused of being the “masterminds” of the Delhi riots .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/anticaa-protest-sites-picked-near-mosques-cops-to-court-while-opposing-bail-for-khalid-101643056765005.html

My government has tried to help the families of the victims in the hour of crisis,” the CM said.

25-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ambala: Excess rains leave crops inundated for 2nd time this month||Excessive rain over the last three days in Ambala and other Haryana districts have damaged rabi crops on a large scale for the second time this month. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), Chandigarh, 10.3 mm rainfall was recorded in Ambala on Monday and 14 mm on Sunday. The rainfall recorded in January is 504% more than the normal due to western disturbances, as per the MeT department. Farmers have been left high and dry because of no drainage facilities in their fields, primarily in the Naneola-Naggal belt along Hisar Road in Ambala-1 block. Earlier, during the first week of January, incessant rain showers had waterlogged fields in several areas. Nayab Singh, a farmer from Chourmastpur village, said that it took days to drain out water from his fields in the last spell of rain and a similar situation arose this time too. “All my wheat crop has been damaged this time due to rain and lack of proper drainage system. I worked for hours amid rains to make way to clear my waterlogged fields,” he said. Another farmer Mandeep Anttal said they urgently need help from the government. “Those who have insurance should get compensation and others through special girdawari (crop inspection),” he said. Meanwhile, the officials of the agriculture department said that the crop loss will be checked and a report will be submitted to the revenue department for further action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-excess-rains-leave-crops-inundated-for-2nd-time-this-month-101643055973853.html

25-01-2022||Chandigarh||Mandi hooch tragedy: Himachal Congress chief seeks judicial probe||Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore on Monday demanded a judicial inquiry into the Mandi hooch tragedy in which seven people died after consuming toxic liquor.The government should order a judicial probe into this, he said, adding that how was it possible that the illegal liquor factory was operational for years and police or the excise department didn’t know about it.The state government swung into action only after seven people died and now the police are claiming to have cracked the case within hours.The question, however, is why couldn’t police detect the illegal business for years, said Rathore, adding that it was a complete failure of the government machinery and its department.Rathore said that the Congress has been continuously raising the issue of various mafias ruling the roost under the current regime. The government has failed to take concrete action against the liquor mafia, mining mafia, drug mafia and forest mafia, he alleged. He claimed that the lax attitude of the government on the liquor policy reflects its connivance with the liquor mafia.‘Party has no place for anti-social elements’On the involvement of Hamirpur district Congress official in the illegal liquor trade, Rathore said the party has no place for anti-social elements.Those who help or advocate such elements will not be spared either. “The party has already expelled the person found involved in the case,” he said.Rathore said the government cannot escape its responsibility by blaming the Congress. Rathore said because the mafia has spread its roots to the village and many big fish are suspected to be involved in it, therefore, it becomes necessary that the government should conduct a judicial inquiry into it so that the culprit can be brought to books.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mandi-hooch-tragedy-himachal-congress-chief-seeks-judicial-probe-101643055731367.html

The list did not have any prominent state leaders. On the occasion, Brar accused SSM leader Balbir Singh Rajwal of trying to sideline the Left groups in the morcha.“The CPI agreed to be part of the SSM for its larger political commitments. It was conveyed that our candidates will contest on the Left symbol. We were promised nine tickets but later three tickets were cancelled without citing any reason by the SSM,” he said.Former MLA and CPI’s national executive member Hardev Arshi expressed displeasure to the SSM’s choice of candidates, including gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana, who has been fielded from the Maur segment.“Rajewal is taking all electoral decisions without consulting other constituents of the SSM. Candidates should be non-controversial, who had contributed to the farmer agitation. The onus to keep the SSM united lies with its leadership,” said Arshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-cpi-to-contest-21-seats-releases-names-of-15-candidates-101643055191679.html
25-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ram Rahim plea: Taking back sacrilege cases from CBI even stamped by , SIT tells HC||Chandigarh: The Punjab Police have told the Punjab and Haryana high court that even the apex court has stamped the Punjab government’s decision of taking back the probe into the 2015 sacrilege cases from Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and constituting an special investigation team (SIT) for the same. The SIT response came to a plea from Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh filed on December 13 demanding that the CBI be asked to continue with the probe into the sacrilege FIRs of 2015. The plea demanded quashing of the Punjab government notification of September 6, 2018, wide which the consent given to the CBI to investigate three FIRs of sacrilege cases was withdrawn. The SIT says five FIRs were registered for five different incidents of sacrilege in 2015 reported within 25 km of area in a span of five months, which points towards a well-planned conspiracy to hurt the sentiments of Sikhs and to disturb peace and tranquillity. Moreover, from the modus operandi, it was evident that people of a close-knit and large organisation were behind all these incidents, the SIT claimed.The court has further been told that in November 2015, the then SAD government sent three FIRs for the CBI probe. When even in three years the CBI failed to trace the accused, a Punjab Police SIT was tasked with the probe. Subsequently, the Punjab government withdrew the consent and the SIT was re-constituted. As the CBI did not stop the probe, the matter went up to Supreme Court, which found withdrawal of consent “proper and legal”, the SIT said. The court has further been informed that after this episode, one of the accused, Sukhjinder Singh, took the matter again to the Supreme Court. However, the apex court upheld the decision. Therefore, the matter has concluded now, it submitted.The SIT says the dera chief has been nominated as an accused in some cases and quizzed too on some occasions. From the investigation of five cases, a challan has been presented in four cases. The probe would clearly indicate that conspiracy of the scurrilous acts was hatched at the dera premises. There are common accused, Harsh Dhuri, Sandeep Bareta and Pardeep Kler, who were members of the national committee of the Dera Sacha Sauda and have directed the actual perpetrators to commit the crime, it claims. “It is clear that if the planning of the crime was made at dera headquarters and the petitioner being head of the dera is bound to be involved in these criminal activities, keeping in mind the criminal bend of mind of the petitioner as he has already been convicted in three cases of murder and rape. Under these circumstances, the involvement of the petitioner is prime facie is made out,” the SIT claims adding that sacrilege incidents were committed by the followers of the dera under his “direct” command.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ram-rahim-plea-taking-back-sacrilege-cases-from-cbi-even-stamped-by-sit-tells-hc-101643054951589.html

25-01-2022||Gurugram||How gangs are using spoof applications to dupe people||Gurugram: Members of several gangs posed as bank executives and duped at least 200 people across Haryana in the last two months on the pretext of increasing their credit card limits by using call spoofing applications, said police.Police said similar cases were registered at Gurugram, Faridabad, Palwal, Nuh, Rewari, Hisar, Jind, Rohtak and Sonipat. They are still investigating over 400 complaints. Cyber crime police stations in all districts have written to banks and application developers to ensure safe and secure transactions but the process is taking time, said police.Commissioner of police KK Rao said that victims believed the perpetrators because they used spoofing apps to make it seem like they were calling via banks’ real customer care numbers. “People shared their credit card details and one-time passwords (OTP) with the perpetrators, who then transferred money from the victims’ bank accounts to their own, and withdrew it from different locations so that they could not be identified. The process of obtaining the perpetrators’ IP addresses and mobile locations is taking time, because of which the registration of several cases is getting delayed,” he said.Rao added, “The suspects are using spoof applications such as X-lite, Eyebeam and Indicall and posing as bank officials, telecom executives and insurance agents to dupe people.”NK Singh, a senior manager with an automobile company and a resident of Sector 57 in Gurugram, said that he was duped of ₹1.75 lakh after a man posing as a bank executive offered to redeem points on his credit card and offered him an iPhone 13 Pro Max. “I was on my way to a meeting and was in a hurry when the ‘bank executive’ called me. He informed me that I had been offered the latest mobile phone and they want to send it to my house. I shared my address and he asked me to verify the credit card details. While on call, I received an OTP which he asked me to share with him and before the call got disconnected money was transferred from my savings account,” he said.In another incident, a 40-year-old woman was duped of ₹1.50 lakh after she shared the details of her bank account and OTP with a man posing as a bank executive. “I received a call on December 15 from a man who introduced himself as a bank executive and offered me a free holiday package. It was a 15-minute call, I shared the OTP I received and ₹1.50 lakh was transferred from my account,” she said.The Gurugram Police have arrested over 55 members of at least six different gangs from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Delhi and Nuh in the last two months in connection with similar cases.According to police, during questioning, most suspects revealed they used different modus operandi to dupe people using spoof applications and emails. In many cases, they use mobile apps to create spoof emails supposedly sent by telecom providers, banks or social media sites. Once a user clicks on a link provided in the email, they are then susceptible to fraud.In several cases, perpetrators also used the names of well-known placement companies and matrimony sites to dupe unsuspecting victims.“We received over 200 complaints whereing victims said they were duped on the pretext of jobs, loans and dating offers via emails. We tracked the emails and found that all the companies in question had no information about such mails being sent out. A thorough check revealed that the fraudulent mails were being sent with the help of spoofing apps,” said Narender Kadiyan, Faridabad deputy commissioner of police (crime).Police said it is convenient for perpetrators anywhere to send an email to anyone from any ID.Narender Bijarnia, the superintendent of police (SP), Jind, said that perpetrators target victims after scanning their details and grievances on social media accounts and take advantage of their concerns and call them using spoofing apps. “At times people post their bad experience son social media regarding banks, companies or loan issues. Perpetrators note the details and call the victims from a toll-free number posing as bank executives from the credit card division or senior managers of job portals,” he said.He added that victims follow their instructions and lose money from their accounts.Commissioner Rao said: “Perpetrators make spoof calls using X-lite and Eyebeam--these two apps are very popular these days. They display actual toll-free numbers of banks so that if anyone checks on the Internet, they assume it is a genuine call,” he said.According to cyber experts, hackers use several methods to steal victims’ money. “Using spoofing applications is one method. There are also other applications such as Easy Loan- the moment you install the app, all your personal data is stolen from your device, including contacts and photos, which can then be misused to extort money. Also, by using screen-sharing apps such as Anydesk or Team Viewer, anyone can try to steal your OTPs, etc. from your device. They can also ask you to install apps such as SMS Forwarder, which automatically gives your OTP to hackers. Stay safe and call 155260 in case of any monetary loss or log on to www.cybercrime.gov.in,” said Rakshit Tandon, a cyber security advisor.Police said they have been spreading awareness and have asked people not to share their OTPs with anyone as no bank or insurance company asks for it..

25-01-2022||Chandigarh||Pak wanted Sidhu reinstated as Punjab minister, says Capt||New Delhi: Former Punjab chief minister and Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) chief Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday claimed he had got a message from Pakistan to reinstate Navjot Singh Sidhu in his government because he was an old friend of their prime minister.Asked about the allegation at a press conference, Sidhu dubbed Amarinder as a “spent cartridge” and refused to comment further on the matter.Amarinder, who has floated a new party after leaving the Congress and is fighting next month’s Punjab assembly polls in an alliance with the BJP, said he was told that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan would be grateful if he could keep Sidhu in the government.Amarinder, who had dropped Sidhu from the Punjab government during his tenure as chief minister, never had smooth relations with the cricketer-turned-politician and was against his appointment as the Punjab unit chief of the Congress.“I removed Sidhu from the job, the man was totally incompetent, incapable and totally useless. In seventy days he didn’t complete a file. I told him I don’t want you in my government. Then several weeks later I got a message from somebody we both know, he knows and also I know. I got a message from Pakistan that the prime minister (Imran Khan) has sent a request that if you can take Sidhu in your cabinet, he will be grateful. Sidhu is an old friend of his. And if he doesn’t work you can remove him,” Amarinder said during a press conference at the BJP headquarters here to announce a seat-sharing arrangement.The former chief minister, however, did not specify who gave him the message.Amarinder also suggested that he has stayed in contact with old political families of Pakistan and said during his earlier tenure as chief minister of Punjab, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh “asked me to make contact and see if there can be some friendship between Pravez Elahi and us.” Elahi was the chief minister of Pakistan’s Punjab province during 2002-07.In the press conference, Amarinder also expressed concern about a large amount of weaponry coming from across the border to disturb the hard-earned peace of Punjab.On Sunday, he had alleged in Chandigarh that Sidhu has “no brains” and also claimed that he had advised Congress president Sonia Gandhi five years ago not to induct “this incompetent man” into the party.Sidhu and Amarinder had been at loggerheads and never had cordial relations from the very beginning the Congress formed government in Punjab in 2017. Sidhu was dropped from the cabinet of the Singh-led government in the state, but appointed as the Congress state unit chief, against the wishes of Amarinder.Later, Amarinder resigned as chief minister of the state and move out of the Congress by floating his own political outfit Punjab Lok Congress and forged alliance with Punjab. At the press conference of Sidhu in Chandigarh, Congress leader Alka Lamba fielded a volley of questions on Amarinder’s allegation and said answer to it will be given in the next press meet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pak-wanted-sidhu-reinstated-as-punjab-minister-says-capt-101643054651918.html
25-01-2022||Mumbai||Mumbai, MMR seem to have crossed third wave peak, says health dept||Mumbai: In what could be a relief for Mumbai, its surrounding areas, the Maharashtra health department officials said that the city, Thane, Raigad, and Palghar may have crossed the peak of the third wave of Covid-19. The health department officials said that the situation in Maharashtra could be stabilising with the third wave crossing the peak in the densely populated urban areas. However, with other areas still to hit the peak, any laxity could overturn the trend, they cautioned.Mumbai on Sunday reported the lowest, 2,550, Covid-19 cases since in last three weeks or 23 days of January. Further, the city also repsaw the drop in the daily positivity rate to 5.54%, the lowest in the last three weeks. The hospitalisation rate too has come down to 10.765 from 21% two weeks ago. Maharashtra recorded its lowest single-day increase in Covid-19 cases since January 17 as it added 28,286. Monday’s dip in the cases can be attributed to a drop in the number of tests conducted in the last 24 hours. In the last 24 hours, the state tested 141,949 samples and had a positivity rate of 19.92%. The state daily average tests are around 190,000-200,000.Mumbai, meanwhile, added 1,857 fresh Covid-19 cases--its lowest single-day tally since December 28, 2021. The city also reported 11 deaths. Mumbai’s active cases stood at 16,546.The state’s active case count is at a touching distance of 300,000 and stood at 299,604 on Monday--its highest so far in the third wave of Covid infections. Maharashtra also added 36 deaths, taking the tally to 142,151.According to the data, Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Pune districts have reported a substantial number of Covid cases in the third wave so far. In January alone, the health department’s data showed that these districts have a 37.44% increase in their cases. The data also showed that other districts too have seen an increase in daily cases from the previous month.Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), said, “Mumbai, Palghar, Raigad and Thane seems to have crossed the peak. Pune will peak in seven days or so. While other districts are expected to peak at different times, so we are keeping a close watch.”A senior health department official added that the situation could be stabilising as key urban centres which have a dense population and high mobility have peaked out. “The rural and semi-urban areas of the state are seeing cases, but there is no surge that we saw in Mumbai, Pune earlier this month. So largely we are stabilising. but we need to remain cautious,” he said.The rural and semi-urban areas of the state are reporting more cases as the Omicron variant spreads to other parts, officials said. Vyas added that about 45% of samples tested in genome sequencing in the state showed the Omicron variant’s dominance and the rest are Delta variant. He added that the proportion varies between districts.Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force, too maintained a cautious stand on the overall Covid situation in the state. He said, “Some districts such as Mumbai, MMR, etc have stabilised but it is early to say that the wave has stabilised across the state.”Meanwhile, Maharashtra reported 86 new cases of Omicron variant, taking the total tally to 2845. Out of these, 1,454 have been discharged following a negative RT-PCR test. Of the new cases reported on Friday, 47 were from Nagpur, 28 from Pune city, three from Pimpri-Chinchwad, two from Wardha and one each from Mumbai, Amravati, Yavatmal, Bhandara, Thane city, and Pune rural.

The victim, Sunaina Singh, 23, suffered serious head injuries and a fracture in her left hand during the attack on Saturday evening. She was taken to a private hospital in Sector 10 and is undergoing treatment, police said on Monday.

According to the victim, she was walking towards her house in Basai Enclave from her office near Umang Bhargav Chowk, when Ajit suddenly came on her way and hit her multiple times in quick succession. “By the time passersby could understand what was happening, he had hit me with a dumbbell rod at least eight to 10 times on the head and other body parts. I fell unconscious and don’t remember anything after that,” Sunaina told police over the phone.She also said that the couple has been living separately for almost eight months following a discord between them. “I filed a divorce petition with the prayer to give custody of our seven-year-old daughter to me. Ajit did not let me bring my child with me,” Sunaina said, adding that there has not been much development in the divorce case so far and the next hearing was scheduled for April this year. Police have also recovered the dumbbell used to assault Sunaina from the spot. “The suspect revealed during interrogation that he had stopped Sunaina to talk about a reconciliation, but it turned into a heated argument, and he assaulted her with the dumbbell rod,” said a police officer privy to the case, requesting anonymity.The officer also said that Ajit was carrying the dumbbell rod, which was nearly 2kg, inside his jacket.Naveen Kumar, station house officer (SHO) of Sector 10 police station, said that the assault was a fallout of their marital dispute. “Further investigation is underway,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-31-year-old-man-arrested-for-assaulting-wife-with-dumbbell-on-road-101643054531548.html
25-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Sidhu terms AAP’s ‘CM face phone survey’ a scam, lodges complaint with EC||Chandigarh: Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday submitted a complaint to the Election Commission (EC) against the Aam Aadmi Party’s “Janata Chunegi Apna CM” phone survey to name its chief ministerial candidate, calling it a “scam” and “fake propaganda”. The PPCC chief, in his complaint addressed to the Chief Election Commissioner, said that prima facie the AAP’s survey seems to be “fake”, as the data with respect to 21.59 lakh phone calls, voice messages and WhatsApp messages within just four days is not mathematically logical. He also demanded registration of a case against the AAP through its national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal if his charges are found to be true. Kejriwal had on January 18 named the AAP’s Punjab unit president and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann as the chief ministerial face of the party in the state following its phone survey. “The party received 21.59 lakh responses from people during the drive to pick the CM face. Of them, 93.3% respondents took Bhagwant Mann’s name,” Kejriwal had said, while announcing his name at an event in Mohali. Releasing his complaint to the media at a press conference in Chandigarh, the Congress leader said the AAP was trying to fool the people of Punjab through its “deceptive” scheme. “This mechanism of deceit to create an illusion and propaganda of fake news is a complete violation of the model code of conduct,” he said, calling Kejriwal a “trickster”. In the complaint, Sidhu said the AAP claimed that they have received 7 lakh WhatsApp messages, 2.5 lakh voice messages and 8 lakh voice calls, but this does not make sense at all. “Usually, such calls take at least 15 seconds, then only 5,760 calls can be attended in one day and that shall add up to 23,040 calls in four days,” he wrote, asking the Election Commission to direct the AAP to shut this campaign and issue a public retraction. He also requested the poll panel to direct the party to provide all call and message logs for verification.Sidhu a ‘drama queen’: Chadha Calling Sidhu a “drama queen” of Punjab politics, AAP’s Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha said that no one, not even the Congress, takes Sidhu seriously. He said the purpose of Sidhu’s press conference was to divert the attention of people from the issue of sand mafia and seized money and properties in ED raids. Condemning Sidhu’s remarks, Chadha said that he is leader of the ruling party of the state and should choose his words more carefully and be more responsible. “The thing hurting Sidhu is that neither the people of Punjab, nor the Congress wants him as the chief minister. That’s why he is now making shoddy statements,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-sidhu-terms-aap-s-cm-face-phone-survey-a-scam-lodges-complaint-with-ec-101643054471549.html

25-01-2022||Chandigarh||AAP delegation meets guv, seeks FIR in illegal sand mining racket||Chandigarh : A delegation of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) submitted a memorandum to Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit on Monday seeking his intervention for registration of FIR in the multilayered illegal sand mining racket in the state. The delegation led by AAP’s Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha informed the governor that crores of rupees and documents were seized in the ED raids on chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s relative. He demanded a “more thorough and impartial inquiry” into the case. The AAP had been alleging for a long time that sand mafia was operating in Punjab, including Jindapur village of the chief minister’s constituency, no action was taken despite complaint, Chadha claimed. Quoting former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh claim that Channi’s name had come up in this connection when he was a minister and conversation with Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Chadha said instead of taking action, the Congress high command promoted him to the chief minister’s position. In response to a query, the AAP leader said there was no denying that the raid on Channi’s relative was part of political vendetta, but the recovery of cash, gold and other assets raised suspicions and, hence, the demand for an impartial inquiry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-delegation-meets-guv-seeks-fir-in-illegal-sand-mining-racket-101643054291537.html

However, after the vaccination drive for the 15-18 age group started on January 3, more than 10,000 vaccine doses were administered to the teenagers in a single day, during the first week, they said.Earlier, the district health department set the deadline to vaccinate 100% of the eligible teenagers with the first dose of the vaccine by January 10 itself.“There are approximately 151,000 people in the 15-18 age group in Gurugram, and over 98,000 of them have got the jab already. This figure was decided based on the last census, and keeping the growth rate in mind... Many children are yet to get the jab... The list on the eligible beneficiaries is likely to be revised this week, but meanwhile, we have written a letter to all the schools and RWAs in Gurugram to ensure that everyone in the 15-18 age group get the jab at the earliest... as Covid cases are still on the rise,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer.

We are now focusing on door-to-door vaccination drives, and these children are also included in this. All the children can also take the jab at government health centres in the city,” Singh added.

Both the ponds are less than 300 metres away from these major roads.The MCG has floated tenders to develop drainage channels, a non-concretised footpath and a boundary wall at a pond in Sector 12; and lay a box type stormwater drain and construct a revenue road leading to a pond in Bhondsi village.According to the officials, the civic body wants to redevelop these ponds ahead of the monsoon season this year, so that the rainwater from surrounding areas could be channelled to it and help in mitigating localised waterlogging.The pond in Sector 12 -- locally known as the Dronacharya pond -- is located in the Subhash Nagar area, right between the New Railway Road and Old Railway Road. During December 2021 and this January, the MCG officials excavated and cleaned silt and debris, and remove sewerage water from the four-metre-deep pond spread across six acres.“A pond is rejuvenated in four key stages. First is to desilt and clean it, the next is to build a boundary wall around it to prevent encroachment, third step is to redevelop the drainage channels and path leading to the pond, and the last is to cultivate native vegetation in the area,” said Subhash Yadav, district forest officer (DFO), who is also the nodal officer for MCG’s environment and sustainability wing.Yadav said the MCG has completed the first stage works -- cleaning and desilting -- on the Sector 12 pond, and is moving to the next stage of the project.“Rejuvenation of the two ponds are part of our bigger project, which is to revive 72 ponds across the city before the monsoon season this year. For each pond, we are trying to ensure that the measures are not cost-intensive, could be done in quickly, and minimal usage of concrete,” Yadav added.Regarding the Bhondsi pond, Yadav said that the civic body is constructing a box type stormwater drain, which could channel rainwater collected on Sohna Road towards the pond, and redevelop the revenue road leading to it in an inclined manner so that the rainwater naturally gravitates towards the pond. Spread across two acres, Sohna road is just 200 metres away from the pond. The work on ground on the Sector 12 pond is underway, Yadav said, adding the rejuvenating process for the Bhondsi pond will start by February.Apart from resolving localised waterlogging related issues, the MCG officials said that the rejuvenation of ponds in the city is aimed to keep the declining groundwater level on check.According to data of the district agriculture department, the city’s groundwater level has declined from 33.2 metres in 2018 to 38.7 metres in March 2021.

25-01-2022||Chandigarh||Cong CEC meet: No decision on half of 31 pending seats in Punjab||Chandigarh :The Congress central election committee (CEC) did not make much headway in deciding its candidates for half of the remaining 31 assembly constituencies in Punjab on Monday even as the process of filing of nomination papers kicks off on Tuesday. The CEC headed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, which cleared the names of its candidates for 86 of the 117 constituencies 10 days ago, discussed the remaining seats, but did not take a decision on these seats in the absence of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi who could not join the virtual meeting, a person familiar with the deliberations said. There are differences of opinion among the senior state leaders, particularly Channi, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu and campaign committee chairman Sunil Jakhar, on these seats, including some presently held by the party. The CEC has asked the sub-committee comprising party general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal, senior leader Ambika Soni and chairman of the secretary committee for Punjab Ajay Maken to hold further discussion for the finalization of candidates for these constituencies. “The list should be out in a day or two,” said the person. The sub-committee was set up in the previous meeting to build consensus for the selection of candidates. Of the 31 seats, 14 were won by the Congress in 2017 or bylections held subsequently. These include Bhoa, Attari, Khem Kharan, Khadoor Sahib, Nawanshahr, Samrala, Gill, Ferozepur Rural, Guru Har Sahai, Fazilka, Amargarh, Patiala Urban, Jalalabad and Shutrana. Capt Amarinder Singh and Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi, who represented Patiala Urban and Guru Har Sahai, respectively, have left the Congress. The party is considering dropping its candidates in half of the remaining 12, according to party insiders. In Ferozepur Rural, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi has announced that Ashu Banger, the AAP candidate who joined the Congress a week ago, will be fielded in place of sitting MLA Satkar Kaur. There are differences of opinion on the candidates of sitting MLAs Tarsem DC from Attari, Joginder Pal from Bhoa and Nirmal Singh from Shutrana. Both Tarsem and Joginder are being backed by Channi. Raminder Awla, who won the Jalalabad bylection, is keen to shift to Guru Har Sahai from where Rana Sodhi is the sitting MLA, but party leaders want him to take on SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal from there. The CEC is has not taken any call on Jalalabad and Patiala Urban from where Capt Amarinder, who has floated his separate party Punjab Lok Congress, has announced his candidature, party insiders said.

Addressing the gathering, he requested the party high command to reconsider the decision. Also, he announced to contest the elections from this constituency at every cost.Talking on phone, he said, “Ever since Jalalusman was declared party nominee, not even 100 people have visited him to congratulate him. On the other hand, thousands of party workers have been visiting me daily expressing their anger over denial of ticket to me. If the party wants to win this seat, it will have to give respect to the sentiments of party workers who want me to contest the polls.” In 2017, the party had fielded Manna from Sri Hargobindpur segment in Gurdaspur district but he lost. “This time again, I was asked to accept a ticket from Jandiala Guru. I warned the party leadership that if I am shifted to any other segment again, the party will lose from Baba Bakala as well as Jandiala,” he added.Jalalusman is considered close to former minister and Akali leader Bikram SIngh Majithia.

25-01-2022||Mumbai||BJP hits back at Shiv Sena, says Uddhav’s Hindutva claim hollow||A day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said the Shiv Sena wasted 25 years in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday said he was speaking out of frustration and ‘selective memory’. The BJP also said that Thackeray’s claim on being a Hindutva party was hollow.Responding to Thackeray’s remarks that the Sena was at the forefront of the demolition of Babri Masjid, Fadnavis said it was nowhere on the scene when the mosque was demolished in 1992.He said BJP workers and leaders faced the batons and bullets while the Sena has not been able to resolve the disputes over Durgadi and Malanggad forts (where two religions stake claim to places of worship).Addressing a press conference, Fadnavis also questioned why the Sena could not rename Aurangabad and Osmanabad districts when Yogi Aaditynath could rename Allahabad as Prayagraj. He said the BJP lives with the Hindutva and it is only under the leadership of prime minister Narendra Modi that the Ram Temple at Ayodhya is being constructed.“The CM has also criticised us that we used the local partners and could spread the roots because of them. Uddhavji should remember that we had had corporators in Mumbai and MLAs even before the Sena was born,” he said.Fadnavis said Uddhav claimed that they had a very favourable political environment in early 1990s after the demolition of the Babri masjid. “He should remember that the Sena had contested 180 seats in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, of which 179 candidates lost their deposits, while in 1996, 23 of the 24 candidates could not save their deposits. Even in 2002, all 39 candidates lost their deposits.”He said the Sena was on the top position in the local body elections when in alliance with the BJP, but now after snapping the ties, it has been reduced to fourth position in recent local body polls.Addressing party workers virtually on Sunday on the occasion of 96th birth anniversary of Sena founder Bal Thackeray, Uddhav said they wasted 25 years in its alliance with the BJP. He attacked the BJP – with whom the Sena first came together in 1994 – saying it used its local partners for politics and “threw them out at their convenience.” He said the BJP’s Hindutva is “nothing but a charade for power.” He termed the BJP’s idea of Hindutva “hollow.”Fadnavis said the Sena chief has raised questions over the leadership of his father and party founder Bal Thackeray who led the party until 2012 and approved the alliance between the two till then. He also alleged that the Sena has helplessly continued its alliance with the Congress.“We pay respect to honourable Balasaheb Thackeray and will continue to do so. But the Sena should reply why Congress leaders like Sonia Gandhi, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi do not even tweet to pay tribute to Balasaheb on his birth or death anniversary,” he asked.Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut hit back at Fadnavis, saying the BJP leader is misleading the people.“Fadnavis has said they had won corporation and Assembly polls even before the Sena was founded. He should produce the birth certificate of the BJP, which was founded in early 1980s. The Sena was born in 1966. Hundreds of Sena workers stood by Hindus during the riots in 1993 erupted after the demolition of the masjid. Sena workers sacrificed their lives and many, including Balasaheb, faced criminal cases. Where were they (BJP leaders) then?” he questioned.Replying to the remarks on the issue of renaming Aurangabad and Osmanabad, Raut said it was the responsibility of the Central government. “Why did Fadnavis himself not get it done from the Central government when he was the CM of Maharashtra for five years?” he said.Speaking about the defeat of his party in polls elsewhere outside Maharashtra, Raut said the BJP first should speak about its defeat in states like West Bengal, Kerala for the last 40 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-hits-back-at-shiv-sena-says-uddhav-s-hindutva-claim-hollow-101643053751371.html

Meanwhile, former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh tweeted: “Strongly condemn the disturbing incident of attempted sacrilege at Shri Kali Mata Mandir in Patiala. Repetitive attempts to disturb peace in Punjab will not be tolerated. I urge @ECISVEEP to take strict action so that the atmosphere in the state is not disturbed.”“The attempt of sacrilege at Shri Kali Mata Mandir of Patiala is highly condemnable.

25-01-2022||Noida||UP elections: Better upkeep, say in meetings key demands of G Noida east residents||Residents of Greater Noida East in Dadri constituency said they hope their demands are prioritised by candidates during the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. Removal of encroachment in sectors, better upkeep of civic infrastructure and representation of residents in authority’s board meetings are some of the key demands of the residents in this region. Greater Noida East comprises about 25 sectors and a population of over 1.5 lakh (150,000) out of the 5.86 lakh (586,000) registered voters in the Dadri constituency, which is one of three assembly constituencies in Gautam Budh Nagar. The district goes to polls on February 10 under phase one of the seven-phase assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.It is currently represented by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Tejpal Nagar, who defeated his rival Bahujan Samaj Party’s Satveer Singh Gurjar by a margin of 80,177 votes in the 2017 elections.This year, Nagar is again in the fray from BJP while the Congress has fielded Deepak Bhati Chotiwala from Dadri constituency. From the Samajwadi Party, Raj Kumar Bhati is fighting the elections while Bahujan Samaj Party has fielded Manveer Singh Bhati.One of the major demands of voters in this area is the representation and recognition of Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs) in Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority’s (GNIDA) board meetings and decision making procedures. “We want RWAs to be included in the decision-making process of GNIDA when they decide on any civic and infrastructure development in the area. As we currently do not have any say, we have to write several letters to the authority to make our demands heard. We hope the new Dadri representative can help us in the matter,” said Jyoti Singh, member of Alpha-1 RWA. According to Devendra Tiger, president of the Federation of Greater Noida RWAs, which comprises 70 RWAs of the area, the representation of villagers is also a major issue among the voters. “The urban villages near the residential sectors of Greater Noida no longer have self-governance or representation ever since they were brought under the purview of the local authority. As a result, development in these areas is a key issue and our public representative should ensure these matters are raised among the authorities,” he said. Removal of encroachment in sectors and better upkeep of civic infrastructure are the other issues, according to residents of the area. “Encroachment in front of market areas leads to traffic management issues everyday. A number of letters and complaints have been submitted to the authorities but to no avail. We hope the people’s representative can pressurise authorities to resolve the residents’ issues,” said Jitendra Mavi, president of Alpha-2 RWA. Harinder Bhati, a member of Beta-2 RWA, added, “Residents of Greater Noida suffer from poor civic infrastructure here. The sewer lines need redevelopment and the drainage also needs maintenance as waterlogging is a major problem during the rainy season”. Tejpal Nagar says has been attentive to residents’ demands throughout his tenure. “I am aware of the residents’ issues and have worked closely with RWAs during my tenure to resolve their problems. These issues are part of my agenda for the upcoming elections as well,” said Nagar.Congress’ Dadri candidate Deepak Bhati Chotiwala, who conducted a door-to-door campaign in Alpha and Gama sectors on Monday, said that the issue of RWAs’ representation is one of his main agendas. “I have been meeting and hearing the demands of the residents and they have high hopes from me as their issues have not been resolved in the last five years. If I win these elections, I will make sure RWAs get their say in board meetings of the GNIDA,” he said.
25-01-2022||Chandigarh||HC dismisses Majithia’s bail plea in drugs case||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday dismissed the anticipatory bail plea of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and former minister Bikram Singh Majithia in the drugs case registered against him in Mohali on December 20.Majithia, who now faces arrest, will have to approach the Supreme Court for interim protection from arrest.On dismissal of the bail plea, his lawyer, senior advocate RS Cheema, even requested the court to give him three days to challenge the high court order before the apex court and enable him to file nomination papers. The demand was opposed by the state citing some judgments, but high court bench of justice Lisa Gill observed that she would consider it in the final order, which is awaited. The nomination process in Punjab starts on Tuesday.Majithia is the brother-in-law of SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal and the brother of former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal.Majithia was booked under Sections 25 (punishment for allowing premises), 27 (A) (whoever is financing any activities pertaining to narcotic drugs) and 29 (party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act on December 20. On December 24, a Mohali court dismissed his anticipatory bail plea following which he had moved high court. On January 10, the high court asked him to join the probe on January 12 and gave interim protection. A day after this, Majithia who remained underground for 20 days, surfaced and had joined the probe.The high court had again given him interim protection from arrest to Majithia January 18 and also asked him to cooperate in the probe. Directions were given in the wake of Punjab Police complaining before the high court that Majithia did not cooperate in the probe, even though he joined the investigation on multiple occasions.The state government had roped in former Union minister and Supreme Court lawyer P Chidambaram, while apex court lawyer Mukul Rohtagi with senior advocate RS Cheema represented Majithia. On Monday, Rohtagi could not appear.In his plea, Majithia termed the FIR an “election stunt” and alleged that the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government had changed three Punjab Police chiefs in three months to get this FIR registered. The plea also accused Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu of indulging in “unwarranted propaganda” and deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa of demonstrating “intense hatred” towards Majithia. In fresh application, which was taken up on Monday, Majithia had claimed that the sole intention of registering the FIR against him was to take him into custody and torture him.Punjab Police, in its response, had said that the government machinery was used for the benefit of drug cartels during the Akali regime in the state. Majithia was a key minister in the Akali government and it was during the SAD’s term that the cartel was unearthed, the police submitted. The SIT also said incriminating material had come on record against Majithia. SIT had also submitted a sealed cover report on the probe before the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-dismisses-majithia-s-bail-plea-in-drugs-case-101643053513090.html

Sharma’s son Pankaj said, “Earlier during SAD-BJP alliance, the segment was reserved for SAD and now it has been reserved for PLC, which is unfair to the party workers. My family has won three municipal elections in the constituency and we have been preparing to contest from the seat since September 2020 when BJP and SAD parted ways. The office-bearers of BJP Daba-Lohara, Giaspura and Dholewal Mandal are also with us and want the party to rethink its decision.”“We gave a 24-hour ultimatum to the party on Sunday. If the party fails to change the decision, my father has decided to contest as an independent,” said Pankaj.Meanwhile, BJP district president said that they have tried to stop Sharma as it is the decision taken by the party and everyone should stay with the decision. If Sharma still fights the election as independent candidate, then the party will take the decision on what further action has to be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-assembly-elections-bjp-ex-councillor-to-fight-as-independent-from-ludhiana-south-segment-101643053151331.html
25-01-2022||Noida||Noida’s apparel body seeks govt intervention to rescue industry from cotton crisis||The Noida Apparel Export Cluster (NAEC) wrote to Union textile minister Piyush Goyal asking him to “rescue the apparel industry from the cotton crisis”.According to industry representatives, the industry is in a severe crisis because of the high cost of cotton yarn and raw fabric leading to a steep hike in production costs.President of NAEC Lalit Thukral said that the price of cotton has gone up by 80% over the past couple of months.“Despite being the second-largest cotton-producing country in the world, India is unable to provide cotton to the industry at reasonable rates. Notably, 75% of raw material used in apparel-making is cotton, and the price of the cotton per candy of 335kg has increased to ₹74,000 from ₹37,000 between October 2021 and January 2022,” he said.Gautam Budh Nagar houses nearly 3,000 garment export firms and has been branded as the “city of apparel” by the Uttar Pradesh government under the One District One Product scheme. It generates revenue of nearly ₹32,000 crore per annum through apparel export of the total ₹40,000 crore per annum revenue generated in Uttar Pradesh.Neeraj Prakash, whose garment factory is located in Sector 63, added that this unexpectedly steep rise in the price of cotton is posing a serious challenge to apparel manufacturers and exporters, who are struggling for survival due to the sharp hike in production cost. “Indian exporters are losing export orders and facing tough competition in the global export market. As a result, importers and buying houses are losing confidence. If the prices remain unchecked, the price of summer clothes is set to increase,” he said.In its letter to the textile ministry, NAEC suggested various solutions.“Steps like check on cotton export, removal of 10% cotton import duty, resumption of 5% rebate duty and development of a mechanism to regulate the prices of cotton and other raw materials will be beneficial to rescue the apparel industry,” the letter said.According to Thukral, the apparel industry in India constitutes 20% of the total employment in the country. “With the cost of cotton increasing, the industry is also facing an increase in unemployment as exporters will not be able to sustain jobs. In addition to this, the most badly affected firms are MSME apparel production units that constitute over 80% of the manufacturing base,” he said.On January 7, the Apparel Export Promotion Council had also written to the textile ministry complaining about the hike in cotton prices. HT had reported about the letter on January 10. However, there was no response from the ministry. The office of Union textile minister Piyush Goyal could not be reached for response despite several attempts.

Mann, who conducted a door-to-door campaign in Nakodar, said the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi will soon clear the file for the release of 1993 bomb blast convict Devinderpal Singh Bhullar. Addressing mediapersons, Mann said that the AAP also has a double engine (Bhagwant Mann and Arvind Kejriwal) in Punjab. “The Congress claims to have a double engine but their double engine is in a tussle for power, whereas AAP’s double engine is working to take Punjab forward. Instead of knowing the problems of people, all senior Congress leaders are engaged in making statements against each other. The people of Punjab are fed up with the corrupt rule of traditional parties. They now want change,” he added. Earlier, people used to vote for either the Akalis or the Congress as they did not have option, he claimed. “Now, they have got a better alternative in the form of AAP. On February 20, the people of Punjab will script history,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-channi-must-explain-source-of-unaccounted-cash-seized-from-his-nephew-mann-101643053032721.html
25-01-2022||Lucknow||Setting up highway policing: World Bank offers loan, UP weighs pros and cons||Uttar Pradesh is cautiously weighing the pros and cons before it takes a final call on the World Bank’s standing loan offer for setting up a dedicated highway police force to control road mishaps and curb crimes on state highways, people in the know of things said. The home and the PWD departments on Monday made a presentation on the long-pending proposal on creating highway policing infrastructure with the World Bank’s aide in a meeting chaired by chief secretary DS Mishra but the meeting remained inconclusive and no decision on whether to go ahead with the proposal or not could be taken.“The CS called a meeting to discuss the proposal to create a special highway police force with the World Bank’s assistance in the state but no decision was taken in today’s meeting,” additional chief secretary (home) Avnish Kumar Awasthi said when contacted over phone.The World Bank wants UP to take some proactive measures, including setting up a dedicated police force for highway patrolling to promote road safety in the state that accounts for the highest number of deaths in traffic crashes in the country every year.The World Bank is believed to have offered a loan of ₹300 crore to UP to create highway policing infrastructure but the government is in a fix over whether to accept the offer even as the international financial institution is mounting pressure on it to implement the project.“The loan offer that comes with certain tough terms and conditions will ultimately create an additional financial liability for the state that would have to repay the amount,” an official said explaining the government’s hitch. “Moreover, the state will have to bear incurring expenses as well on the maintenance of the special force and the infrastructure,” he added. According to PWD chief engineer (World Bank) VK Jain, the government might take a decision to set up a highway police force in the state after discussing and sorting out certain issues in the times to come. “The NH 2 and NH 25 have already been identified for implementing the highway policing project in the first phase,” he revealed.The NH 2 also called the GT Road runs over 700 km between Mathura and Varanasi in UP before ending in Kolkata while the NH 25 connects Lucknow and Kanpur in UP. According to a home department official, the highway police project in UP has been under consideration since the Akhilesh Yadav government decided, in principle, to create the special force in 2015 to respond to situations of crimes and accidents on highways. “But no significant forward movement was made since even as the World Bank keeps pushing the idea,” he said. 
25-01-2022||Chandigarh||Record arrival this time, Makora Pattan in Punjab’s Gurdaspur emerges as new destination for winged visitors||Migratory birds seem to have made Makora Pattan in Punjab’s Gurdaspur district their new destination during the winter season if the number of arrivals this time is of any indication. Mokora Pattan is just 7km from the Keshopur Chhamb, one of Asia’s biggest wetlands and a famous bird sanctuary that gets thousands of winged guests from Central Asia and Siberia during winters every year. Interestingly, this is for the first time that the Punjab forest and wildlife department teams have recorded birds in such a large number at Makora Pattan. The footfall of birds was so low earlier that the department never bothered to count them. As per the census conducted by the department, 2588 migratory birds have been spotted so far at the wetland situated along the India-Pakistan border. Divisional forest officer, wildlife, (Pathankot) Rajesh Mahajan said, “2,535 bar headed geese, 20 great cormorants, 4 brown headed gull, 2 eagle owl, 4 river tern, 13 ruddy shelduck and 10 spot biled duck have been seen.” Claiming that the number may increase in the final survey, he said, “We were surprised to notice such an arrival. It seems that the birds made it their habitat after finding its atmosphere suitable.” “We have deployed a team so to protect the birds. It will sensitise the local people about the need not to disturb them as they do not damage crops. We will ensure this footfall remains consistent in future,” he added. 
25-01-2022||Chandigarh||In Ludhiana’s Atam Nagar, it’s a multi-cornered contest between former allies||In battleground Atam Nagar, which is marked as a sensitive segment in view of the constant flare-ups between supporters of various political groups, the five prominent contestants have past associations with each other. Once a stronghold of Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) president Simrajit Singh Bains and Congress candidate Kamaljit Singh Karwal, Atam Nagar is now tied in a multi-cornered contest with Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)’s Harish Rai Dhanda, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)’s Kulwant Sidhu and Punjab Lok Congress (PLC)-Bharatiya Janata Party’s Prem Mittal are emerging as strong contenders. Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM) has fielded Harkirat Singh Rana.Bains, Karwal and Dhanda have remained in the SAD together before Bains and Karwal quit the party and Bains got elected as an independent MLA in the 2012 assembly elections. At the time, Karwal was a close aide of Bains. But in 2015, the two parted ways following a rift and Karwal joined the SAD again. A year later, in 2016, Bains formed the LIP. Dhanda, meanwhile, had quit politics in 2014 and rejoined SAD in 2019. Karwal, who had rejoined the SAD in 2015, quit the party again, and crossed over to the Congress in 2016. AAP candidate Sidhu was also in the Congress at the time. The two served the grand old party for around five years but remained at loggerheads, which was heightened by the fact that Congress chose Karwal over Sidhu during the 2017 assembly elections. On the other hand, former SAD Mansa MLA Prem Mittal who was named the PLC candidate from Atam Nagar on Sunday, has also been a part of LIP in the past. Mittal, who is also a former senior deputy mayor of the city, joined Bains’ party in 2018 and his son Jai Krishan Mittal also contested municipal elections in 2018 on a LIP ticket. Mittal then jumped ship to join Congress in April 2019, only to desert the party and join hands with former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s PLC. Regardless of the past associations, the five leaders are now seen lambasting each other over issues including corruption, hooliganism, failure to take up development projects etc. Due to repeated incidents of violence between their supporters, the segment was declared ‘sensitive’. On January 19, three persons, including Bains’ brother Paramjeet Singh alias Pamma, got injured in a clash between supporters of Karwal and Bains over installation of hoardings on Gill road. Just two days later, AAP candidate Sidhu accused Bains’ son, Ajaypreet, and his supporters of roughing up an AAP worker over installation of hoardings at a building on ATI Road. AAP had lodged a police complaint in this regard, but Bains had refuted the claims as baseless.Flag march conductedWith nominations beginning from Tuesday, returning officer Poonampreet Kaur, along with police officials, conducted a flag march in the vulnerable areas of the assembly segment on Monday.Kaur also took stock of security arrangements and barricading at the nomination venue - municipal corporation’s Zone-C office on Gill road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-ludhiana-s-atam-nagar-it-s-a-multi-cornered-contest-between-former-allies-101643052791589.html

Her frail body and age are no deterrent for her when it comes to exercising her voting right. A resident of Jagraon in Ludhiana district, Bhagwan Kaur has hardly ever missed taking part in the democratic exercise, and claims to have voted at least 100 times in different elections. “I have always voted as far as my memory takes me, and I will vote by going to the polling booth this time too,” she says. Kaur’s family is into agriculture and her daughter-in-law is aged 83. Vikas Hira, electoral registration officer-cum-subdivisional magistrate, Jagraon, met Kaur on Monday. He said she has refused to vote by postal ballot, when she was told about the facility meant for senior citizens like her. “Instead, she said she would like to cast her vote by visiting the nearest polling station,” he said. “In the spirit of free, fair and accessible election to all, it was ensured to her family that a dedicated vehicle with assistance will be provided to her on the polling day ,” said Hira, adding that such assistance will be extended to all such seniors in the Jagraon assembly segment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-109-yr-old-jagraon-woman-determined-to-vote-at-booth-101643052131205.html
25-01-2022||Delhi||BJP, AAP spar over enforcing anti-corruption ombudsman in Delhi||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi was deliberately not implementing Janlokpal Bill and misleading the people about it even as the AAP shot back saying if the BJP was so serious about eradicating corruption, then why it took away control of Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) from the state government. In a joint press conference on Monday, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and party’s MP from Northeast Delhi Manoj Tiwari alleged that the file related to Janlokpal Bill has been pending with the government since September 2019. Gupta said, “The Kejriwal government had said that the file is pending with the LG. In an RTI reply recently, it was revealed that the file pertaining to the Janlokpal Bill was received by the lieutenant governor’s office on September 25, 2019 and was returned to the Delhi government’s law department within two days, on September 27. The government has been lying to the people of the city. The government should tell people why it has not been implemented so far.” The AAP said the BJP was playing politics over the issue of corruption. It also questioned the BJP on why the central government took away the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) from the Delhi government. The Delhi Janlokpal Bill was passed by the Delhi Assembly in December 2015, and sent for the approval of the Centre. It was returned by the Centre in 2016 along with several other legislations, pointing out several gaps. The AAP government modified various bills, but the Janlokpal Bill has stayed in limbo. Tiwari, former Delhi BJP chief, said, “Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal now stands exposed. When the AAP was formed and it came to power in Delhi, it had announced that the Janlokpal bill will be implemented, but nothing has happened till now.” Referring to the CM’s recent press conference claiming that he has learned that that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is likely to arrest a senior minister in his cabinet, Satyendar Jain, Gupta said, “He (Kejriwal) fears that if the bill was implemented, it would expose 22 of his party MLAs who are involved in corruption and have cases against them…He is even scared that his ministers and leaders can be raided by ED. This is why he held a press meeting.” The AAP, in a statement, said, “The BJP is playing politics over the issue of corruption. Why did the BJP-led central government took away control over ACB from the Delhi government? The AAP government had eliminated corruption in 49 days (during its first stint). But, when the AAP again formed government in 2015, BJP snatched away the ACB from the state government. Not only did they snatch it away, they didn’t take a single step against corruption.” “The BJP is the most corrupt party in the history of independent India. They have no right to speak on corruption. We challenge them to return ACB to us, and we will show how corruption can be completely eliminated. They are only playing dirty politics by raising the issue of Lokpal when their own LG rejected the proposal,” the AAP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjp-aap-spar-over-enforcing-anti-corruption-ombudsman-in-delhi-101643052071151.html
25-01-2022||Mumbai||Schools reopen to 40-50% attendance, but many choose to postpone||MUMBAI City schools reopened on Monday to a mixed response nearly three weeks after they were shut on account of the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. While most state board schools reopened to anywhere between 35-50% attendance on the first day, several non-state board schools have decided to wait either until Thursday or next week to reopen physical classes. “We needed to ensure sanitisation before students walk in. Instead of January 24, we will reopen on January 27,” said Kavita Agarwal, director of DG Khetan International School, Malad. The institute has decided to follow the ‘odd-even’ rule, where students with odd and even roll numbers will show up on alternate days. “This way we can run the school for all our students in two shifts,” she added. Some institutes are working around space constraints to ensure compliance of Covid appropriate protocols. “We have both English and Marathi medium classes in our school, but with social distancing rules we have put a lot of planning in place to arrange students in classrooms,” said Kshama Valanjoo, assistant headmistress, VPM’s Vidya Mandir High School at Dahisar. “On Day One, we only started with the secondary section of Marathi medium and saw a 50% response. However, in lower classes less than half of the parents have given consent.” Some schools have decided to bring students back in phases. “As per the standard operating protocols shared by the government, we have placed one student per bench,” said Saba Patel, principal, Anjuman-I-Islam School, Bandra. “Just like in October 2021, we started with four classes—classes 10 and 11 in the morning shift, and classes 5 to 8 in the afternoon. We will gradually bring more students back to school for physical classes.” Educational institutes that completely shut down in March 2020 following the nationwide lockdown managed to reopen starting October 2021. In the last week of September, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad announced that physical classes will resume for classes 5 to 12 in rural areas while in urban areas, physical classes from classes 8 to 12 started from October 4. Classes 1 to 7 started physical classes only from December 15. Similarly, state higher education minister Uday Samant called for a reopening of colleges in a phased manner only for fully vaccinated staff and students. All institutes were asked to adopt a hybrid teaching mode until further updates. However, in the first week of January 2022, owing to increasing Covid cases being reported across the state, schools and colleges were asked to shut down again. Gunjan Ghadigaonkar was as excited as her son while dropping him to school on Monday, “The school had asked us to pay a visit and make note of all the Covid protocols and measures that they have put in place. This gave us a lot of confidence. Going to school and interacting with teachers and classmates will help their mental growth,” she said. Her son studies in class 2 of Anand Vishwa Gurukul, Thane. Preschools reopen after nearly two years to positive response Githa S Sridharan, centre head, EuroKids International, Ghatkopar, said, “We have resumed our pre-school classes today in compliance with all the guidelines and SOPs laid down by the government. We have got good response from the parents and students on the first day and are expecting the attendance to start building up over the course of this week as more parents start sending in their consent letters.” Online classes continue for students who prefer to continue attending school from home. Peter Murphy, head of school at Oberoi International School, Goregaon said, “Our youngest learners (three to five years old) turned up in large numbers. Parents have also been overwhelmingly positive, supportive and encouraging. At the end of the school day, as the children left, all were keen to give a ‘socially distant high-five’ to indicate that they had enjoyed the experience of being back in school.” Podar Jumbo group started pre-primary classes with nearly 60% attendance on the first day. “Parents were apprehensive in the morning but when they came to pick their children up, they saw the happiness. Everyone is showing a positive response to reopening of schools,” said Swati Popat Vats, director of the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/schools-reopen-to-40-50-attendance-but-many-choose-to-postpone-101643051953986.html

According to ED officials familiar with the development, Bhupinder Singh had sought adjournment of the summons on medical grounds, claiming to be suffering from Covid-19. Meanwhile, his business partner Kudrat Deep Singh, who too had been summoned, appeared before the central agency, ED officials cited earlier confirmed, while refusing to give details of the line of questioning and replies. They said that other people linked with the case have also been summoned in the coming days. Also read: Firm owned by Channi’s nephew, aides had ₹18.37 lakh revenue in 2019-20On January 18, the ED had conducted raids on 10 locations in Punjab, including the premises of Bhupinder Singh, his business partners and six miners in Mohali besides in Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib, Rupnagar and Pathankot districts. The agency had seized ₹10 crore besides other valuables from Bhupinder Singh and his business partner Sandeep Kumar during the raid that went on till January 19. According to the ED, Kudrat along with Bhupinder and Sandeep had set up a firm named Provider Overseas Consultancy Limited in 2018 with 33.33% equal shares. The firm was a key link between the CM’s nephew and the raid conducted in relation to a money laundering case based on an FIR of illegal sand mining registered by Punjab Police in SBS Nagar in 2018. The agency had lodged an ECIR (Enforcement Case Information Report) at its zonal office in Jalandhar in November last year after taking over the probe. According to the FIR, there are 26 accused, including Kudrat, and mostly truck drivers. Bhupinder was not named in the FIR, whereas Kudrat was also granted clean chit by the SBS Nagar police in a follow-up inquiry. 
25-01-2022||Chandigarh||Former Punjab DGP under lens after audio tapes leak||Audio tapes of a purported conversation between dismissed Punjab cop Sarabjit Singh, who is a proclaimed offender (PO) in the multicrore Bhola drug racket, and director general of police (DGP) Sidharth Chattopadhyaya may land the former state police chief in further trouble, as he is already facing probe in the Prime Minister security breach case.It is learnt the purported conversation took place on December 27 during a meeting between Sarabjit Singh and the then Punjab DGP at the latter’s house in Nayagaon. Inspector Satwant Singh, who was recently arrested by Chandigarh Police in the forged signature scam busted last week, was also allegedly present during the meeting. Even PO Sarabjit Singh has since been arrested in the same case. The audio tapes — that have been accessed by Hindustan Times through intelligence agencies — not only reveal how the PO was giving instructions to the DGP for certain appointments in the name of cracking whip on drug cartels, but also how the state’s top cop was allegedly taking instructions on the issue of national security from a dismissed Inspector, who is facing seven FIRs related to the NDPS Act, including one registered in Madhya Pradesh. The conversation wherein Sarabjit Singh allegedly suggests posting inspector Satwant Singh as the Kharar CIA in-charge is also part of the audio tapes. Satwant Singh was handed the post through the DGP’s orders dated December 28, a day after the purported conversation. Despite repeated attempts, Chattopadhaya remained unavailable to comment on the veracity of these audio tapes.On national security and BholaIn another alleged conversation, the PO is heard giving instructions to the DGP to carry out operations related to national security. In one such sentence, the dismissed cop is even heard referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while allegedly asking the DGP to bring some DSP-rank officer on certain postings and start recovering explosives being pushed from Pakistan.“RDX aur pistol kaafi aaye hai... Kal ton asin chakkna shuru kar dinde hain... Kum se kum Modi diyan akan khol denian hai (A lot of explosives and arms are being pushed [through Pakistan]. We should start making recoveries from tomorrow. At least, it will open Modi’s eyes),” the PO can be heard, while discussing Khalistani militant Ranjit Singh Neeta’s involvement in smuggling explosives in Punjab and his drug-related smuggling in Jammu and Kashmir. Another conversation in the audio is about facilitating Jagdish Bhola, prime accused in the multicrore drug racket, with mobile phone inside the Patiala Central Jail. “Bhola is in touch with me. He is ready to help us in big drug seizures. I have talked to Sukhi (another person). He will be shifted to the Patiala Jail with Bhola with a mobile phone. He will give us all information by using this uninterrupted mobile,” the PO is heard. At this point, Satwant intervenes in the purported conversation and suggests to the DGP to bring Sukhi to Kharar on production warrants in another case and later send him to the Patiala jail. SAD chief demands FIR Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday demanded registration of a criminal case against DGP S Chattopadhyaya, accusing him of taking orders from criminals while functioning as the Punjab police chief. The SAD president said chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had gone out of his way to appoint Chattopadhyaya as the Punjab DGP even though he was not eligible to hold the post. Questioning Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s silence on the matter, Sukhbir alleged the DGP was personally chosen by him to register false cases against the top Akali leadership. Chattopadhaya, a 1986-batch IPS officer, remained Punjab’s officiating DGP for 21 days. The drug case against former SAD minister Bikram Singh Majithia was registered on his directions. He was served a show-cause notice by the home ministry after the PM’s cavalcade was stuck on a flyover for 20 minutes due to a farmers’ blockade in Ferozepur on January 5. He was replaced by 1987-batch IPS officer VK Bhawra on January 8.

I faced a lot of problems which gave me the idea to develop a webstore for others who can’t afford books. I urged my friends to sell their books at my store instead of selling it to scrap dealers,” said Abhinav, a student of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya. He provided second hand books through his webstore, Cruise Books, to more than 10,000 students who couldn’t afford new ones. “The store has also resold over 30,000 books, saving almost 1,900 trees,” he said.“My webstore also provides low-cost printing services all over India and makes it easy to sell and collect used books. It also promotes saving of paper by promoting reuse of books,” he added. “I am committed to providing practical solutions to the world’s most pressing issues and exploring ways to use technology to empower children to become the next generation of change-makers,” he said.Chandhary Singh Chaudhary (13), was awarded the PMRBP in the sports category for making a record of skating for 96 hours.

25-01-2022||Delhi||Don’t delay award in Airport Metro Express Line case: SC to Delhi HC||The Supreme Court on Monday directed the Delhi high court not to further delay the execution of an award of more than ₹7,200 crore payable by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to a consortium headed by Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infrastructure Limited (RInfra) which operated the Delhi Airport Metro Express till 2012.The arbitration award became inevitable after DMRC’s challenge against the order was dismissed by the Supreme Court on September 9 last year.The Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited (DAMEPL) – a consortium of Reliance Energy Limited (renamed as Reliance Infrastructure) and Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles SA –approached the Delhi high court on September 12 for execution of the award, but complained of delaying tactics by DMRC. On eight occasions, the petition was listed and on January 11, the high court posted the matter to March 29. The DAMEPL came to the top court challenging this order.A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai, while disposing the petition asked the two sides to appear before the high court on January 31, and request for an early disposal of the execution proceedings. “Without commenting on the submission of either side we are of the opinion that hearing of the execution application does not brook any further delay…. We request high court to dispose of the execution application without any further delay as consequence of delay is detrimental to the petitioner and respondent (DMRC).”Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi who appeared for DAMEPL informed the court that so far, only a token sum of ₹1,000 crore has been paid by DMRC on December 8, and as on January 11, the sum recoverable from DMRC is ₹6,268.87 crore. Rohatgi pointed out that his clients are not willing to settle the matter out of court with DMRC and urged that a deadline should be set for DMRC to make the payment.The bench asked DMRC, “There is an award in their favour approved by this court and now you are seeking a settlement.”Senior advocate Parag Tripathi appearing for DMRC said, “There are several issues in execution. The whole Metro operation will come to a close, not just here in Delhi but in five other cities.” He referred to a communication addressed by DMRC to DAMEPL on January 6 making an offer to consider undertaking the outstanding liability of DAMEPL and its holding company, RInfra towards banks. Tripathi informed that in this regard talks were on as DMRC will be better placed to negotiate with banks for a haircut.Rohatgi opposed saying, “I am not interested in talking to them anymore. With over ₹6000 crore hard cash in my account, I will be better placed to talk to my lenders. Let them give a plan by when they will pay. I will deal with my debtors.”Tripathi informed the court that following these negotiations, the Delhi high court had directed DMRC to place on record all our assets. “We have since disclosed to the court and they are agreeable to settle,” he said.The bench said, “Who is to benefit from the pendency of these proceedings. You cannot compel a party to compromise. Now that they have disagreed to settle, we will request the high court to take up the matter at the earliest.”Before the high court, the DAMEPL had stated that the total decree amount payable by DMRC as on September 10 was ₹7045.41 crore. Further, the DAMEPL in its petition before the top court said that delay of each single day was resulting in incremental daily interest on the decreed sum. Between September 10 and January 11, this amount cumulatively stands at ₹223.46 crore, DAMEPL stated in its petition filed through advocate Mahesh Agrawala.With the HC ordering the matter to be listed on March 29, the petition said, “The high court instead of executing the decree by attaching the funds to the tune of ₹6208.03 crore admittedly available with the DMRC and lying in its various bank accounts towards partial satisfaction of the decretal amounts payable under the Award, embarked on a journey of acting as a conciliation court.”The DMRC had filed an affidavit before the Delhi high court on January 10 making full disclosure of its funds that stood at ₹6208.03 crore.DMRC had entered into an agreement with DAMEPL in August 2008 for the design, installation, commissioning, operation and maintenance of the 22.7 km Airport Metro Express Line from New Delhi Railway Station to Dwarka Sector 21 via Indira Gandhi International Airport.. The agreement in the nature of public-private partnership required DMRC to undertake the design and construction of a basic civil structure for the project.In May 2012, the Anil Ambani-led company complained of defects in design and quality in the installation of viaduct bearing that was denied by DMRC. A joint inspection committee was set up that gave its report in July 2012. This was followed by another letter by DAMEPL, giving 90 days for DMRC to cure the defects. On completion of 90 days, DAMEPL issued a notice terminating the agreement on 8 October 2012, accusing DMRC of defaulting on the agreement. DMRC, however, said that it had carried out the required rectifications.While the dispute between the parties was pending before the arbitral tribunal, DMRC restarted the line after obtaining a certificate from the commissioner of metro rail safety on 18 January 2013.The tribunal undertook a detailed enquiry into all aspects and found as many as 1,551 cracks in 367 girders and 80 girders with twists varying between 10 to 20 mm. The tribunal was of the opinion that these defects adversely impacted the integrity of the structure. As effective steps were not taken within the cure period of 90 days, the tribunal held that DMRC was in breach of the concession agreement.The top court’s September 9 order upheld the order of the single judge of the high court, said, “It cannot be said that the view of the tribunal is perverse. Therefore, we do not concur with the high court’s opinion that the award of the tribunal on the legality of the termination notice is vitiated due to the vice of perversity.”On November 23, the Supreme Court even dismissed the review petition filed by DMRC, making the judgment final for execution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dont-delay-award-in-airport-metro-express-line-case-sc-to-delhi-hc-101643051471325.html
25-01-2022||Other||Magh Mela-2022: Pilgrims, seers face hardships as river waters enter camps, officials on alert||PRAYAGRAJ: As seers and pilgrims are already facing hardships in the ongoing Magh Mela due to rising water in the Ganga and the Yamuna, the bad weather conditions have further added to their woes.Though the Ganga started receding at a slow pace on Monday, the release of around 19,000 cusecs more water from the barrage at Kanpur, which is expected to reach Sangam in next 24 hours, has put the mela authorities on high alert. On Monday, the level of water in Ganga at Phaphamau was recorded at 77.52 meters. With fresh rains in parts of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, water level in rivers like Ken and Betwa too has increased, adding to the volume of water in Yamuna. Meanwhile, camps from sector 2 and 3 are being shifted to safer ground towards Phaphamau. Monday too witnessed thick cloud cover because of which the mud and sludge near the ghats and some of the roads of the tent city continued to be problematic for commuters. The belongings of many kalpwasis in a camp in Sector 3 were damaged because of the rains which occurred on Saturday and Sunday. The devotees in the camps, which were not covered with polythene, had to stay awake the whole night. The bad weather is also forcing many of the kalpwasis to return to their native places. “Although because of Covid, many of our family members were not in favour of coming this time, but we braved all odds. However, the extreme weather and river water entering our camps have complicated our stay and we have decided to return,” said Manish Mishra of Rewa. “The discharge of water in Ganga from Kanpur barrage has been reduced from 21,000 cusecs to 19,000 cusecs but at the same time, because of rains and weather, we are on high alert,” said executive engineer of the irrigation department, Brijesh Kumar Verma. Divisional commissioner Sanjay Goyal, officiating Mela Adhikari, Arvind Kumar Chauhan and other officials inspected several sectors of the mela area and interacted with the seers and kalpwasis, providing all the necessary help required to them. “We have shifted almost all the camps from the affected areas where river water has entered. We are on high alert and hope that the weather will improve in coming days so that things become conducive for a comfortable stay of kalpwasis and seers,” said the Mela Adhikari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/magh-mela-2022-pilgrims-seers-face-hardships-as-river-waters-enter-camps-officials-on-alert-101643051354318.html
25-01-2022||Mumbai||CM Thackeray meets MSBCC; interim report on OBCs imminent||Mumbai: The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s hopes to restore political quota for the Other Backward Class (OBCs) candidates in local body elections received a fillip after it was decided on Monday that the Maharashtra State Backward Classes Commission (MSBCC) would submit its interim report to the government with recommendations on representation of social groups belonging to the OBC communities within two weeks. In a meeting between chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and members of the commission as well as other state ministers and officials on Monday, it was further resolved that the commission and the state government will draw up a comprehensive and time-bound programme to conduct a state-wide socio-economic, political and caste survey—the first of its kind in a century—to collect empirical data. Details of this programme will be submitted to the Supreme Court (SC), officials who were in the know of what transpired in the meeting, said. “The state government will submit its data collected from secondary sources to the MSBCC, which in turn, will analyse it, and will submit its report (with recommendations on the community’s representation in local body elections) to the state government within two weeks,” said an official who was present at the meeting. This report will then be presented to the SC. The commission is expected to meet on 28 January to examine the data. On December 6, 2021 the SC struck down two ordinances promulgated by the MVA government in September, which granted up to 27% political reservation to OBC candidates. The SC said that the ordinances failed to pass the triple test of reservation — the state must appoint an independent commission to collect empirical data on the nature and extent of backwardness of OBCs; the data must be used to specify the proportion of reservation required to be provisioned local body-wise according to the commission’s recommendations; and the total quantum of reservation must not exceed 50% of the seats including those reserved for Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe (SC, ST) candidates. The top court further directed that all OBC reserved seats in the upcoming local body polls — which took place in two phases on December 22 and January 18 — be re-notified as general category seats. The SC had, in its January 19 ruling stated that while no state or union territory can be permitted to hold local body elections with 27% political reservation for OBCs without empirical data, it allowed the Maharashtra state government to submit existing data on OBC communities to the commission for assessment. It further said that the commission could submit its interim report to the state within 15 days of receiving this data. The government will give existing data collected by various government departments including the school, higher and technical education and social justice departments to the 10-member commission, which was constituted in June 2021. The state will also provide data from institutions like the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics (GIPE), Pune, and the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), said persons in the know who were privy to the decisions taken in Monday’s meeting. The persons referred to above said that MSBCC members raised the issue of infrastructure including a well-equipped office, staff, a full-time member secretary as well as funds to conduct the survey. The CM reportedly asked chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty to tackle the administrative requirements at the earliest. On March 4, 2021, the SC stayed the 27% political reservation for OBC candidates citing the lack of fresh empirical data about the exact nature of their backwardness. This put the government on a sticky wicket as the OBC communities stood to lose 57,000 reserved seats in local bodies like municipal corporations, municipal councils, zilla parishads and panchayat samitis. Elections to 17 municipal corporations like Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nagpur and Nashik and 27 Zilla Parishads are due this year. Though the Marathas dominate Maharashtra’s politics, the OBCs, who are spread across religion, classes and castes, are considered the largest social bloc at around 53% of the population, according to the OBC community outfits. Other estimates peg their population lower; there is no scientific measurement of their numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cm-thackeray-meets-msbcc-interim-report-on-obcs-imminent-101643051294210.html
25-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi HC grants Centre 10 days to file its stand on martial rape||“A half-hearted reply” may affect life of several citizens, the Union government told the Delhi high court on Monday, as it sought more time to respond categorically on whether it was in favour of doing away with the exception in rape law that provides immunity to husbands from the offence of marital rape. A bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar, while hearing pleas seeking to criminalise marital rape, was informed by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre, that the issue should not be seen from a “microscopic angle” and several considerations would weigh with the government while formulating its stand.“Your lordships are dealing with a matter of 2015...but the central government possibly came to know about a month ago that the matter is taken up. Your lordships are not deciding just the constitutional validity of a statutory provision. It may not be looked at from that microscopic angle. Here, the dignity of a woman is at stake. There are family issues. There would be several considerations which would weigh with the government to take a position to assist your lordships. This would also perhaps need consultations with other stakeholders,” Mehta said.The SG also said it will not be possible for the Union government to respond immediately on the issue, particularly when there is no imminent threat that something is going to happen to someone. He sought 10 days to have a detailed consultation with stakeholders and place the government stand before the court.“I feel I would be doing an injustice to the citizens of India if I put the reply in a half-hearted way,” the SG submitted.The court, however, said the issue of criminalising marital rape is not going to end in the high court and whichever party felt aggrieved by its judgment, will challenge it in a superior court. “The government may have its own approach. But to keep it (the matter) hanging beyond a particular period loses meaning....for some people, every day matters for the reason that some say this abuse is happening, whether reported or not. It can’t be our answer to them that this (case) has been there for 100 years, what is the urgency now? Now that we have started, I will give you one week (to file a reply),” justice Shakdher saidResponding to this, Mehta said the very fact that the issue is important and lives are at stake was all the more reason for the central government to consider the matter in a holistic manner. He said to arrive at a conclusive answer would need a consultative process. “I can’t say “yes”, the petitioner is correct or “no”, the petitioner is wrong,” the SG said.The court finally granted 10 days to the Centre to clarify its stand.“...come back to me in 10 days. I know you can if you want. Beyond that, it would become difficult for me,” the court said.The exchange between the court and the SG took place while hearing PILs by NGO RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association and two individuals who have sought the striking down of the exception in the Indian rape law, saying it discriminated against married women who were sexually assaulted by their husbands.Exception of Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) decriminalizes marital rape and mandates that sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age, is not rape.On Monday, senior advocate Rebecca John, the amicus curiae in the matter, completed her arguments. She submitted that 498A (domestic violence) cannot be a substitute for 375 (2) as it is altogether a different offence.“IPC 498A includes the element of cruelty. It is not anyone’s case that the rape is not a cruel act but the cruelty required for the fulfilment of [IPC] 498A … is quite different from the descriptive sexual acts without the woman’s consent given in Section 375. Each of these offences are standalone offences, different in their nuances, understanding and ingredients,” John argued.While concluding her arguments, John said she received a “lot of hate mail” in connection with the case and was even asked to recuse from the matter because she has an opinion on the subject.To this, the court said that if having a view was a ground for recusal, then judges would have to recuse themselves from every case.The hearing will continue on Tuesday.
25-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi schools scale up Covid jab drives to speed up reopening||With the Delhi government focusing on complete vaccination coverage of students ahead of a possible reopening of schools, private schools in the national capital have increased their efforts to scale up vaccination of their students. Last week, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said 100% vaccination of students could pave way for the reopening of schools. The government shared that around 85% students of Delhi government schools in the age group of 15-18 years have received the first dose of the vaccine till January 21; however, private schools were lagging behind. While schools said \they were focusing on inoculation, they stressed on resuming in-person classes for children of all grades, regardless of their vaccination status. Bharat Arora, general secretary, Action Committee of Unaided Private Schools, a consortium of private schools, said the government has increased the number of vaccination centres in private schools over the past three days and that is expected to improve the vaccination coverage among students. “Around 40-50 more private schools are conducting vaccinations on campus now. Now, the percentage of vaccinated students is around 60%. By next week, that figure may rise to 75-80%. This will ensure that both private and government schools are able to reopen together by February,” said Arora. He said schools were collaborating with the district administration to ensure that the vaccination coverage touches 80% by the end of the month. “We are vaccinating students in the eligible category but the government should reopen schools for students of all classes; as a full reopening is the need of the hour,” said Arora.Sudha Acharya, the chairperson of the National Progressive School Conference (NPSC) that has 122 Delhi schools as members, including Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, Bal Bharati Public School, Springdales School, Sanskriti School, Delhi Public Schools, Ahlcon International School, and Amity International School, said the government has directed schools to complete the vaccination campaign soon so that a proposal for reopening could be placed before the DDMA (Delhi Disaster Management Authority). Acharya said while schools were striving to achieve maximum vaccination, it was crucial to reopen schools for children of all grades for the learning cycle to get back on track. “There are some children who contracted Covid recently. There will be a waiting period for them. Some parents might not be ready to get their children vaccinated as yet. We will be well placed if the government reopens for students of grades 9-12, but the reopening for children of other grades cannot be put off for long,” said Acharya, principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka. She said it was important for the government to tighten norms regarding in-person attendance in schools for all grades to ensure uninterrupted learning. “So many states have reopened schools for children in all classes. Our children will continue to miss out unless the government takes steps to ensure in-person attendance in schools,” said Acharya. The sentiment was echoed by other stakeholders. Citing the Maharashtra government’s decision to reopen schools, Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said schools will not be able to resume classes as before as long as the government gave parents the option to opt for online classes. “After two years of the pandemic, it’s high time that schools are reopened for all children. As long as the government continues to give parents the choice between online and offline classes, it is unlikely that learning will get back on track. Over the past two years, some children have gradually gotten used to online learning. We need to come out of that inertia,” said Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-schools-scale-up-covid-jab-drives-to-speed-up-reopening-101643051111008.html
25-01-2022||Delhi||Operating licence, surge pricing cap in Delhi govt’s draft cab policy||Cab aggregators operating in Delhi will have to apply for a licence to operate, register their drivers with the government, set up easily accessible customer care channels and charge a fixed a base fare, according to a draft policy proposed by the Delhi government. The proposed policy, Motor vehicle aggregators scheme, 2021, was shared on Monday in the public domain to seek suggestions from stakeholders and the general public. Estimates with the state transport department shows that Delhi has at least 150,000 vehicles plying under different cab aggregators, but it is mostly is a floating number as these vehicles keep moving between Delhi and NCR cities such as Noida, Gurugram, Faridabad and so on. The policy mandates all cab aggregators to ensure that 5% to 50% of their new fleet of two-wheelers or four-wheelers are electric vehicles in phases within the time frame of six months to two years from the date of notification of the final policy. “Delhi has become the first state to announce the draft aggregator scheme which mandates electric vehicle fleets for ride aggregators and delivery services. The policy was essential as presently, there is no accountability on the part of the cab aggregators. There is no set of rules for them. Until now, we had no policy to even keep a record of such companies, their fleet of vehicles and drivers. Our aim is to maximise the safety of users and ensure ease of doing business for such aggregator companies, while also making them more responsible as stakeholders in public transportation,” said Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot. If the policy is notified, all cab aggregators who have their offices in India, and run a fleet of more than 50 vehicles will have to mandatorily get a licence from the state transport department, failing which a fine of at least ₹25,000 per vehicle will be charged. To regulate fares, which currently has no government control and often go up to five times in the name of surge pricing, the transport department has proposed to set a base fare and the maximum surge pricing could only be up to twice the base fare fixed by the government, the policy mandates. To ensure safety of passengers and the drivers, the policy proposes that all driver partners, even if they work for multiple aggregator companies, will have to be registered with the government, failing which fines will be imposed on the company. It proposes taking “appropriate action” against a driver partner within one month if there are 15% or more grievances against him/her. The policy says that remedial training should be given to drivers having a rating less than 3.5 over a period of one year. To address the issue of air pollution, the policy promotes use of electric vehicles. It mandates that all vehicles onboarded by the companies from the date of notification cannot be older than five years, and the existing fleet may not be older than 8 years. Within the first six months from the date of notification of the policy, 10% of all newly inducted two-wheelers and 5% of all new four-wheelers will have to be electric vehicles, the draft policy says. It adds that one year from notification, 25% of all new two-wheelers and 15% of all new four-wheelers have to be EVs, while two years from notification, 50% of all new two-wheelers and 25% of all new four-wheelers will have to be EVs.HT was the first to report on cab aggregator policy in 2017, and highlighted the different aspects of the rules such as mandatory licensing for all cab aggregator companies in a series of reports in the following years. However, the policy was put in abeyance in 2019 owing to the focus on the EV policy. Expert quote needed
25-01-2022||Delhi||Green tribunal paves way for wetland tag to Najafgarh jheel||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) to prepare an integrated environment management plan (EMP), which will include specific budget allocations, for the Najafgarh Jheel, virtually paving the way for the notification of the transboundary (Delhi-Haryana) water body as a wetland. Until the plan is prepared, however, the EMPs submitted by the Haryana and Delhi governments will be enforced, said a bench headed by NGT chairperson justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, directing the two states to also submit action taken reports on the enforcement of their respective EMPs by July 31, 2022.“In view of the above, further action of preparing integrated EMP by the MoEF&CC be taken and till it is done, EMPs prepared for rejuvenation and protection of the lake be enforced by the state of Haryana and the NCT Delhi,” said the bench in its order.“The EMPs of Delhi and Haryana do not make specific provision for budget, which is necessary, except saying that provision will be made immediately. Making of such a provision may be ensured by the chief secretaries of Delhi and Haryana,” the order adds.Among the provisions of the EMP listed by the Delhi government are provisions for geo-tagging the water body falling in Delhi; monitoring and maintaining the status of biodiversity including all waterbirds; commissioning of a hydrological regime assessment to determine water, sediment and nutrient fluxes; groundwater recharge; and identifying critically silted up areas needing desiltation. The Haryana government’s EMP is based on similar lines, but it has divided the plan into immediate, mid-term and long-term measures.A Delhi State Wetland Authority official, on condition of anonymity, said no work on the EMPs had commenced yet as they were awaiting the NGT’s final decision. “After this recent order, work can now begin. The suggestions made in the Delhi EMP will be followed and an action taken report on its progress will then be submitted by July 31,” the official said, adding that notifying the jheel as a wetland was still in the MoEF’s hands.According to a report submitted by a technical committee to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the problem of sewage entering the Najafgarh Jheel, estimated at nearly 350 million litres per day (MLD) of sewage entering through Gurugram and the surrounding villages of Delhi, also needs to be solved.HT had last week reported that the Delhi State Wetland Authority is working on a plan to notify 10 water bodies in the Capital as wetlands.Not only will this ensure legal protection to the water bodies, but each of the notified wetlands will see Integrated Management Plans (IMP) prepared, allowing DSWA to get funds from the Centre to protect and rejuvenate them.While Najafgarh is expected to be on the list, officials had said that the Centre may declare it as a wetland sooner, citing the NGT hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/green-tribunal-paves-way-for-wetland-tag-to-najafgarh-jheel-101643050871168.html
25-01-2022||Delhi||Rain leaves its mark: Delhi gets first ‘severe cold day’ of season||The rain may have gone, but its effects lingered on Monday, with most parts of Delhi reeling under a biting chill during the day, with the city’s base station at Safdarjung recording the season’s first ‘severe cold day’ as the mercury dropped to 14.8 degrees Celsius . The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said it expects cold day conditions to remain in Delhi for the next two days, with a yellow alert in place for Tuesday and Wednesday.The minimum temperature on Monday fell to 8°C, from 10.5°C the previous day. While the maximum temperature at Safdarjung on Monday was seven degrees below normal, Narela was Delhi’s coldest spot during the day, with weather gauges clocking out at 13.5°C.The IMD declares a ‘cold day’ if the maximum temperature is more than 4.5 degrees below normal, with the minimum also below the 10-degree mark. It is meanwhile classified as a ‘severe cold day’ if the maximum is more than 6.5 degrees below normal. A yellow alert is generally issued to warn people about a particular weather event taking place.“Cold to severe cold day conditions were reported from almost all stations in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR). This spell will continue over the next two days as well before wind speeds once again increase from the evening of January 26,” said RK Jenamani, stating while this was not this season’s lowest maximum , most parts of Delhi recorded cold day conditions. At 14.8°C, Monday’s was the second lowest maximum temperature recorded so far this winter, with the lowest coming at 14.7°C on Saturday. However, it was still Delhi’s first severe cold day of the season because the city did not meet the criteria for this classification on Saturday. Despite having a maximum that was seven degrees below the normal mark on Saturday, Delhi’s minimum was 11.5°C on the day, over a degree-and-a-half above the level needed to be classified as a cold day.Other than Safdarjung, the Ridge and Narela stations were also classified under the ‘severe cold day’ category, with departures of seven to eight degrees below the normal mark. Palam, Lodhi road and Ayanagar meanwhile recorded ‘cold day’ conditions with the maximum six degrees below normal.Jenamani said this cold spell is not likely to be as prolonged as the previous one earlier this month, which saw cold day conditions in the city for nearly a week.“Following the last western disturbance, we saw seven consecutive days of cold day conditions as the moisture in the air led to fog prevailing at the higher level. After this weekend’s rain, we are seeing a similar effect, but wind speeds will increase from January 26 and lead to this upper-level fog dissipating,” he added.Forecast for Tuesday shows Delhi is expected to record moderate fog in the morning, with cold day conditions expected during the day. While the maximum is expected to be around 16 degrees, the minimum will hover around the 7-degree mark. A similar high and low of 16 and 7 degrees Celsius respectively is also forecast for Wednesday.Delhi’s air quality meanwhile remained in the ‘poor’ category with an air quality index (AQI) of 241 on Monday. It was 202 on Sunday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4pm bulletin. Agencies forecast air quality to remain in a similar range for the next two days. “On Tuesday, the AQI is likely to remain within the ‘poor’ category and on Republic Day too, it is expected to remain the same as the impact of western disturbance has diminished,” said the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), a government air forecasting body||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rain-leaves-its-mark-delhi-gets-first-severe-cold-day-of-season-101643050575570.html

In the seventh round of genomic sequencing, around 56% of the samples were found to be infected with Omicron variant.In terms of vaccination status, the BMC statement added, “When analysed on the basis of Covid preventive vaccination, seven out of 280 patients received only the first dose of the vaccine. Of these, six patients had to be hospitalised; two patients had to be admitted to the intensive care unit.”Further, out of 174 patients who took both doses of vaccine, 89 patients had to be hospitalised. Of these, two patients needed oxygen, while 15 patients had to be admitted to the intensive care unit. Out of the total patients, 99 patients did not take any vaccine.

25-01-2022||Delhi||‘Inflammatory speeches’: Court frames sedition charges against Sharjeel Imam||A Delhi court on Monday framed sedition and charges under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA ) against JNU student Sharjeel Imam for allegedly making inflammatory speeches at Aligarh Muslim University and Delhi’s Jamia area while addressing protesters against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).The court also rejected a bail plea moved by Imam.Imam made the alleged provocative speeches in Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13, 2019; and at Aligarh Muslim University on January 16, 2020. An FIR was registered against Imam on January 25, 2020 and he has been in judicial custody since January 28 last year.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat framed charges against Imam under sections 124A (sedition), 153A (promoting enmity on grounds of religion), 153B (assertions prejudicial to national integration), 505 (statements conducing to public mischief), of Indian Penal Code and section 13 (punishment for unlawful activities) of UAPA. In his speech, Imam allegedly threatened to cut off Assam and the rest of the Northeast from India.A detailed copy of the order is yet to be uploaded on the district court website.Imam’s plea seeking bail was also argued by his lawyer while advancing the arguments on charge. The judge said, “Vide separate order, the application filed by Sharjeel Imam for grant of regular bail is dismissed.”The Delhi Police had filed a charge sheet against Imam in July 2020, in which it claimed that Imam gave speeches inciting hatred, contempt, and disaffection towards the Central government and instigated the people which led to the violence near Jamia Millia Islamia in December 2019.Imam’s counsel Tanveer Ahmed Mir in October 2021 contended that his client’s prosecution for alleged inflammatory speeches is the “whip of a monarch rather than a government established by law”. He said that Imam’s criticism of the government cannot be the cause of sedition.Mir also said that his client is neither a terrorist, nor associated with some terrorist outfit. He added that Imam did not have criminal antecedents or political agenda. The lawyer said that there were “many prosecutions” against Imam just because he had criticised the government’s policies.The police have also accused Imam of being the “mastermind” of the February 2020 northeast Delhi riots, which left 53 people dead and over 700 injured.Earlier in December, the court granted bail to Imam in a case of alleged violence at Jamia Millia Islamia in December 2019 during the anti-CAA protests. The FIR under which he is an accused involves offences such as rioting, conspiracy, attempt to commit culpable homicide, voluntarily obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions, and assault.

25-01-2022||Lucknow||UP assembly polls: EC seeks report on Samajwadi Party’s free power supply campaign||The Election Commission (EC) on Monday sought a report from district election officers across the state on the complaint that the Samajwadi Party (SP) allegedly violated the model code of conduct for the UP assembly polls by inviting voters to fill a form in order to avail of 300 units free electricity.Yogesh Somvanshi, lawyer of the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court, on January 20 had made a complaint to the EC in this regard.In the complaint, he had stated that Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, ahead of the UP assembly polls, not only made this declaration verbally about 300 units free electricity, but also proceeded to direct his party workers to approach voters door- to- door and get the “Samajwadi Form” filled up for availing of the sop Yogesh Somvanshi had also stated that no political party should be allowed to gratify voters in order to illegally influence them for voting for a political party.On January 1, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav had promised to provide 300 units of free electricity to households and free power to farmers for irrigation if elected to office in the UP assembly polls.“It will be the number one promise on the Samajwadi Party manifesto,” the Samajwadi Party chief had said at a meeting at the party office in Lucknow.“On coming to power, the SP government will give domestic consumers free electricity up to 300 units. Farmers will get free electricity to irrigate their fields. This will be our top promise,” the former UP chief minister had said.“This will be the first promise in the Samajwadi Party manifesto.

25-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi records 20 dengue cases in January, highest in last 6 years: Civic bodies||The Capital reported five new cases of dengue in the past week, said a report issued by Delhi’s municipal corporations, taking January’s overall tally to 20 patients, the most in the month since 2016, in what is an unusual and worrying trend for the city.So far this year, Delhi added eight dengue cases in the first week of January this year, and seven infections in the week after that.The city recorded no dengue cases in the corresponding period in 2021, 2020 or 2019. It last added a dengue infection in January in 2018 (when the city recorded five cases) and three in January 2017.Delhi’s dengue season usually coincides with the monsoon, between end-June and October, since the humid, warm conditions, coupled with the abundance of stagnant water, provide the ideal breeding ground for the aedes aegypti mosquito that causes the vector-borne illness.While experts said the recurrence of dengue cases in January, when temperatures dip to their lowest in Delhi, was a cause for concern, municipal officials attributed this year’s numbers to the record rain the city has received this month.The rain in Delhi so far this month has, to be sure, broken the month’s all-time record, according to data from the Met department, which is likely to have contributed to increased breeding by the aedes aegypti mosquito.Delhi has got 88.2mm of rainfall so far in January, beating the previous record for the month (79.7mm) set in 1989, data maintained by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) between 1901 and 2022 shows.The vector borne disease report for the week ending January 22 shows that no malaria or chikungunya cases have been reported so far. The municipal corporations’ ‘action-taken’ report shows that domestic breeding checkers have so far detected 245 cases of positive mosquito breeding cases in the city, higher than 64 such instances last year and 96 cases detected in 2020. A senior public health official said instances of dengue during the height of winter may indicate that the adult aedes aegypti mosquitoes are starting to adapt to local conditions, even as the person added that detections could also be attributed to the improved sentinel surveillance system, after dengue was declared a notifiable disease last year in October. “Temperatures have, thankfully, remained low and mosquitoes need optimum [warm] conditions along with stagnant water for breeding,” a municipal official remarked. Delhi recorded 9,613 dengue cases and 23 fatalities in 2021, making it the second worst annual outbreak on record.Dr BK Tripathi, professor in the department of medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said dengue cases used to flatten out during peak winters a few years ago. “But it seems that the mosquitoes are now adapting to harsh climatic conditions, and civic bodies need to ensure that preparations and drives against controlling mosquito population should be carried out all through the year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-records-20-dengue-cases-in-january-highest-in-last-6-years-civic-bodies-101643049671168.html
25-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi: South MCD outlines new revamp plan for Meharchand market||With a view to provide relief to 130-odd traders of Meharchand Market, a commercial hub near Lodhi Colony in south Delhi, where shops have been lying sealed since 2018 over building code violations, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has outlined a new redevelopment plan with a revised standard facade regulation, and a 2.4 metre wide verandah on the ground floor, with projections on the first and second floors allowed up to the verandah line, said civic officials. The over seven decade old market besides Lodi Art District was once known for its designer clothes and boutiques with several mid-level grocery shops wedged between them. But the quaint market place lost its growth trajectory after 135 of 153 properties were partially sealed in January 2018, on the directions of a three-member Supreme Court appointed monitoring committee. The ground floors were spared while the sealing action focussed on illegal basements and upper floors, an SDMC official said. The last attempt in August 2020 to create a redevelopment plan, according to which traders will have to demolish the existing structures and rebuild the market adhering to the new norms, has so far failed to materialise or elicit any interest, officials said, prompting the civic body to go back to the drawing board. A letter from municipal commissioner Gyanesh Bharti to the standing committee on November 12, 2021, shows that a series of joint meetings were held by municipal architects, town planners and building department officials between August and November to draw up redevelopment plan.The revised plan has limited the height of shops to 10.95 metres, instead of 10.5m proposed earlier, and shops have been divided in two categories-- 38.69 square metre (sqm) shops and 40.05sqm for corner plots. The plan also allowed basements with the entry from the front.“All the existing structures will be demolished before the start of new construction. The department will declare Meharchand Market as pedestrian shopping street due to non-availability of parking space in the vicinity of market,” the final plan moved by layout scrutiny committee (LOSC) of SDMC said. LOSC has also directed the cell overseeing parking management to explore a new parking plan for the market. For a uniform look, the facade plan envisages that the walls and columns of the market will be beige up to the signboards, with a maroon laminate cladding above it. All shop shutters will be painted silver, while the veranda and steps will be paved with ruby red granite stone, the plan proposed.Ashok Sakhuja, who heads Meharchand Market Association, said, “We had requested them to incorporate veranda and entry to basement from the front, which has been done.” Leader of the house Inderjeet Sehrawat said the matter will be taken up in the next standing committee meeting for further discussion and relief is expected to be granted to traders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhisouth-mcd-outlines-new-revamp-plan-for-meharchand-market-101643049551306.html
25-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi Police arrest 4 cyber crooks behind 10 cheating cases in Jaipur||Four cyber criminals, who allegedly duped at least 10 people after gaining access to payment apps on their phones by offering to update their Know Your Customer (KYC) details, were arrested from Jaipur in Rajasthan by the Delhi Police.Police said they got on the trail of the accused after they allegedly duped a medical representative, Arvind (only first name), and his wife of ₹10 lakh on January 13. Police said the victim had saved the money for his mother’s cancer treatment.According to police, the cyber crooks allegedly tricked Arvind into downloading a remote access app on his and his wife’s phones in the guise of updating the KYC details of a payment app. Once downloaded, police said, the accused allegedly stole confidential details related to his bank account and the payment wallet, and used it to steal the money.Police said at least 10 online cheating cases registered in Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) have been solved with the arrests.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi said that Arvind had filed a complaint on the cyber crime portal of the Union ministry of home affairs and the same was transferred to the north district’s cyber cell police station. In his complaint, Arvind alleged that he received a link on his cellphone for updating the KYC of his online wallet on January 13. He clicked the link and filled in all the required details, such as wallet number, password, OTP, debit card number, its card verification value (CVV) and the expiry date.“Arvind immediately received a call from the same mobile number... The caller identified himself as the wallet executive and directed him to download an app, which facilitates remote access of devices, on his phone and got him to share its passcode. As Arvind shared that information, money started deducting from his online wallet and bank accounts as well. When his accounts were emptied, the caller tricked him into downloading the same app on his wife’s phone and emptied her accounts too. Altogether, ₹10 lakh was stolen from their accounts,” said DCP Kalsi.The investigating team collected details of the caller’s mobile number and the accounts to which the money was transferred. Through technical investigation, investigators found that the calls were made from Jaipur but the money was withdrawn from various banks in Jharkhand, West Bengal and Maharashtra.“Further investigation revealed that some suspects were in Jaipur while at least two had gone to Jharkhand. We sent one team each to Jaipur and Jharkhand. The team in Jaipur caught Mukesh Kumar Singh (19) and Pintu Mandal from Jaipur. Their interrogation revealed that their associates Dular Mandal (21) and Chet Lal (23) had gone to Giridih in Jharkhand to withdraw the cheated money. The team in Jharkhand subsequently caught the duo,” the DCP said, adding that seven mobile phones, six SIM cards and 11 ATM cards used in the crimes were seized.DCP Kalsi said that the four suspects revealed that they originally belonged to Dhanbad in Jharkhand but had been running their racket from Jaipur, where they were living lavishly in a posh residential neighbourhood. “They had recently purchased a Venue car using the cheated money. Ten cases have been solved. We are hoping to crack more cases,” added the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-arrest-4-cyber-crooks-behind-10-cheating-cases-in-jaipur-101643049371062.html
25-01-2022||Delhi||Three dry days a year in Delhi as part of new liquor plan||Delhi will now have only three dry days (when liquor stores are closed and bars and restaurants are not allowed to serve liquor) this year, down from the usual 21, according to an order issued by the excise department on Monday.In 2022, only Republic Day, Independence Day and Gandhi Jayanti will be observed as dry days, the order said.“In pursuance of the provisions of Rule 52 of Delhi Excise Rules, 2010, it is hereby ordered that – Republic Day (January 26), Independence Day (August 15) and Gandhi Jayanti (October 2) – shall be observed as “dry day” in the national capital by all the licensees of the excise department and vends located in Delhi for the year 2022,” the order said.At 21, the number of dry days in the Capital was among the highest across states and Union territories. A reduction in the number was a long-standing demand of liquor store owners, and bars and restaurants, and was expected to be part of the new excise policy that came into effect on October 1.Apart from the three, the Delhi government may declare any other dry day, from time-to-time, said the order.To be sure, the order added that restrictions on the sale of liquor on dry days will not apply for residents in hotels with a valid license.HT reported on January 20 that though Delhi had a new liquor policy, two of the key promises made previously -- the lowering of the legal drinking age to 21, and a reduction in the number of dry days to 3 -- remained just that for now, promises.In a press conference on March 22 last year, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also the city’s excise minister, announced that Delhi would have a new excise regime which would slash legal age of drinking to 21, and reduce the number of dry days besides introducing various reforms. Many of the changes have been implemented, and now, with the reduction in number of dry says, people expect that there could be some movement on lowering the drinking age.For this, the excise department has to issue separate order.A senior government official said on condition of anonymity that reducing the legal drinking age has the necessary approvals from all authorities concerned, but might not happen now. “The legal age will be reduced only when the government formally notifies the change. It may be that it wants to put the matter on hold for sometime considering the political implications and the municipal elections are only a few months away,” the official said. The BJP and the Congress have opposed the new excise regime and held several protests against the new liquor policy.Since the drinking age is lower in neighbouring cities, Delhi’s high legal drinking age forces young people to travel to neighbouring cities which allows drinking at 21. Delhi is now the only metropolitan city with the high drinking age – even in Mumbai, only hard liquor is barred for those under 25, while wine and beer is allowed at 21. In major global cities such as New York and London, the drinking age is 21 and 18 respectively.Kabir Suri, the president of the National Restaurants Association of India welcomed the government’s move to reduce the number of dry days. “It will lead to increase in sale and also ensure that there is not many disruptions in supply of liquor. Additionally, the revenue of the government will also increase and the move will also check black marketing of liquor on the dry days.”Suri demanded that the government should now also reduce the legal drinking age to 21.
25-01-2022||Delhi||Now, PWD sets March deadline for overdue Ashram underpass in Delhi||The Ashram underpass, which has already missed five deadlines, is likely to be opened for traffic in the first week of March, officials in the public works department (PWD), the agency working on the project, on Monday said.A senior PWD official associated with the project said that work on one section of the road, and covering the ramps with shade, will be completed by the end of February. The road will be opened for the public after trial runs by the traffic police, he added.The official, who asked not to be named, blamed unusually heavy rain in January, and the ban on construction activities imposed in November and December last year due to rising pollution levels, for delaying the work.To be sure, these reasons do not explain the saga of delays that has dogged this project, which was aimed at decluttering one of the city’s busiest intersections but ended up creating a two-year-long traffic nightmare.Work on the 750-metre underpass, which will connect Nizamuddin railway bridge and CSIR Apartments at Ashram Chowk, began in December 2019. The underpass is a key link between east, central and south Delhi, and also between Delhi and the NCR cities of Noida and Faridabad. The intersection is used by more than 350,000 vehicles every day.The project, which was originally slated to be completed in December 2020, has missed five deadlines, the last one being December 2021. Things reached a point when no formal deadline was set after that.“We are trying to cover the ramps as an additional safety measure to prevent water-logging in the underpass during the monsoon. The covers will be placed on entry and exit ramps on the Jangpura and Badarpur sides. Finishing touches to the art work on the side walls is also going on. The final date for the inauguration of the underpass will be decided by the government,” said a second official associated with the project.The first deadline for the underpass, which aims to ease traffic jams at the busy intersection, was set for December 2020. It was then revised to April 2021; then to June 2021; then shifted to August 31; and, having failed to deliver the project even then, the deadline was finally moved to December 31, 2021. But that deadline, too, was missed.Officials in the Delhi government did not respond to requests seeking comments.For more than two years, protracted construction work, poor site management, and haphazard dumping of construction material and debris has made Ashram Chowk a traffic choke point for commuters. And a decision to simultaneously start work on the extension of Ashram flyover up to Delhi-Noida Direct (DND) Flyway extended the chaos from the main intersection to the turn towards Sarai Kale Khan.S Khan, the president of Sukhdev Vihar Resident’s Welfare Association, said that passing through the Ashram intersection has become a persistent headache. “We have to count a delay of at least one hour during the evening rush hours. It is a pain point not just for regular commuters but also local residents who not only face the traffic chaos but also air pollution. Once, during an emergency, we got stuck in the jam and had to leave our vehicle mid-way and walk amid heavy traffic,” Khan said.An air pollution ban (starting November 2019), assembly polls (March 2020), pandemic-induced lockdowns (between March 2020 and June 5, 2021), and another construction ban due to severe air pollution (November and December last year) have been cited by PWD as factors that have delayed work on the underpass. But people who use the road say the story is more complicated than that, and complain of poor planning by PWD and poor management by the traffic police.Prabhat Agrawal, who uses the stretch for his daily commute, alleged that even cab drivers have started to cancel the rides around peak hours, if they need to pass through Ashram Chowk. “Are the authorities even aware of daily traffic jams that happen on all four sides of the Ashram Chowk? If they are not, they should ask any cab or auto driver who refuse to ply in this area just because they don’t want to avoid this junction at any cost,” Agrawal who was stuck in traffic at the intersection on Monday evening said.Kanan Bahl, who was waiting a few metres away from Agrawal, said that it was poor traffic management that leads to the chaos. “How many more years will they take to build this underpass? In the last one hour, I have moved just one kilometre,” he added.Delhi traffic police said they have suggested alternative routes to motorists avoid the congested intersection. “Ashram Chowk remains congested due to the ongoing construction work on the underpass and the extension of the flyover. Motorists travelling from Sarai Kale Khan to AIIMS are advised to take the Barapullah flyover, and those going from DND Flyway towards AIIMS have also been advised to use the Barapullah,” a traffic police official said.Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning in the School of Planning and Architecture, said Ashram is a key intersection, and it should have been executed on top priority. “We are already a decade late in the intervention at this intersection. With other projects such as Delhi-Meerut Expressway having been completed, the traffic volume at this intersection has increased. Vehicles from east Delhi now have a free flow up to the intersection, and the agencies taking up the underpass project should have factored it in,” he said.Work on such a busy and crucial intersection should have been taken up in phases with a comprehensive alternative mobility plan, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/now-pwd-sets-march-deadline-for-overdue-ashram-underpass-in-delhi-101643048290968.html

However, no casualties was reported.The fire fighters doused the blaze, which broke out on the second floor, after a six-hour operation. Ten fire tenders were pressed into service.The reason behind the fire incident is uncertain. Notably, the unit had no proper fire safety arrangements and the fire brigade had to arrange water from the Sundar Nagar station and a nearby factory.Sub-fire officer Atish Rai said the fire brigade received an alert at around 2.45pm, following which ten fire tenders were rushed to the spot. He said the unit suffered massive loss in terms of goods and machinery, adding that the poor condition of the road leading to the factory slowed down the firefighting operations. The situation came under control by around 9pm, but one fire tender has been deployed to stay on location until Tuesday morning as a precautionary measure.

Pimpri-Chinchwad is followed by Pune and Mira-Bhayandar among 27 municipal corporation limits assessed by the Think Tank that studied websites, mobile applications, social media handles along with 120 other sub-criterions of these civic bodies between November 1 to December 31 last year. According to the report, Pimpri-Chinchwad with 5.92 out of 10 points topped the chart followed by Pune with 5.50 points, Mira-Bhayandar (5.50), Mumbai (5) and Kalyan-Dombivli, (4.25). The parameters based on which the cities were judged included- accessibility, services and transparency. “When we decided to prepare e-governance index for various cities in Maharashtra, we had template of National e-Governance Service Delivery Assessment (NeSDA), which focuses on websites of Departments and Ministries of the Union Government and websites of State Governments. Since there was no provision for evaluating e-governance at the local level, we decided to take up the job,” said Neha Mahajan, director, PRO. The report, as claimed by Mahajan, was based on only those criteria which elicit objective responses such as ‘Ease of portal finding’, ‘Navigability,’ which are matters of opinion and cannot be determined objectively. “Therefore, in line with this reasoning, it was also decided not to consider aspects of e-Governance that could lead to subjective experiences. Consequently, the scope of this Index relates to the existence of services, information, etc., and does not consider the actual delivery of a service, reliability of the information, etc,” stated the report. This Index follows the binary evaluation methodology, also used in NeSDA, for assessing the municipal corporations across the indicators. “The explosive entry of technology into our everyday life has changed how we live, work, and how governments serve their people. Keeping this in mind, Policy Research Organisation (PRO) decided to study the state of ‘e- governance’ in all twenty-seven municipal corporations in Maharashtra. Considering municipal corporations are drivers of development at city/urban levels, it is imperative to assess the quality of e-governance provided and ensure that reform happens with the pace of development,” said Mahajan in the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pimprichinchwad-tops-e-governance-index-in-maharashtra-pune-second-101643038690000.html

Mohit, who died on the spot, had received 24 bullet injuries, while at least 10 bullets were fired at Vishal.“Vishal died at 4am on Monday due to multiple-organ failure. The body will be handed over to the Ambala police after autopsy on Tuesday,” doctors said. On January 20, the assailants, suspected to be three in number, had fired more than 30 shots within seconds, killing Mohit on the spot and leaving Vishal injured outside DAV Riverside School on Jagadhri Road.

25-01-2022||World||China’s Xi meets IOC chief Bach ahead of Winter Olympics||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday told International Olympic Committee (IOC) chief Thomas Bach China will “present to the world a streamlined, safe and splendid” Olympic Games in a rare pandemic-era face-to-face meeting with a foreign visitor in Beijing.Xi’s meeting with Bach is expected to be the first of several such meetings for the Chinese president - who has not left China for more than two years because of the Covid-19 pandemic - as dignitaries, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, descend on Beijing for the Olympics, scheduled to begin on February 4 and to be held in the capital and the neighbouring province of Hebei.Xi wore a white mask with a red Chinese flag in the corner as he stood next to a masked Bach at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, according to agency reports.Later, the two were shown speaking without masks across tables that were widely separated, Chinese state television images showed.Xi, according to an official statement, said that after more than six years of preparations and now with everything falling into place, the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 will be held on schedule as promised.“China will honour its commitment to present to the world a streamlined, safe and splendid Olympic Games. This is the first time since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic that a comprehensive global sporting event is held as scheduled. It is a successful example of acting upon the new Olympic motto: ‘Faster, Higher, Stronger - Together,’” Xi said.Nearly 3,000 athletes from about 90 countries and regions will compete at the Beijing Olympics.Xi said that in conformity with the “athletes-centred” concept, China has spared no efforts in the construction of venues and infrastructure as well as services for the Games.“China is confident of ensuring the safety of all Games participants, relevant personnel and the Chinese people,” he added.The Games will take place from February 4-20 inside a “closed-loop” separating athletes and other participants from outsiders, and tickets will not be sold to the public.China has all but shut its borders to international arrivals to curtail Covid-19 though a small outbreak of 67 domestic cases – a mix of Omicron and Delta variants – recorded in Beijing since January 15 have put the city authorities on an “emergency” mode.Xi and Bach talked about Covid-19 countermeasures at the Games and Bach told Xi that “China is now a winter sports country, and this is the start of a new era for global winter sports”, according to a readout on the IOC website.“Some countries are sending athletes to the Olympic Winter Games for the first time, which fully demonstrates the extensive support of the international community for the Beijing 2022 Games,” Bach said according to the Chinese readout, adding that it was in contrast to the overwhelming international opposition to the politicisation of sports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-xi-meets-ioc-chief-bach-ahead-of-winter-olympics-101643121267105.html
25-01-2022||World||China’s claims in SCS inconsistent with int’l law: US||The US on Monday reiterated its rejection of China’s expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea as “inconsistent with international law” and called on Beijing to cease its “unlawful and coercive activities” in the region.Two US state department officials reiterated their opposition to Beijing’s actions in the maritime space at an interaction to highlight a recent official report disproving the legal basis of China’s claims in South China Sea. It is the 150th report in the Limits of Seas series prepared by the department, and is a follow-up of an earlier 2014 report that had examined and rejected China’s claims in the South China Sea.The disputed waterway is one of many areas of tension between the United States and China, which claims a large swathe of the waters and has built military bases on artificial islands there.The South China Sea, crossed by vital shipping lanes and also containing gas fields and rich fishing grounds, is also claimed by Taiwan, while Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines claim parts of it.Jung Pak, the deputy assistant secretary of state for multilateral affairs in the bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said that China’s claims gravely undermine the rule of law in the ocean.Claiming that in recent years, China had “stepped up its coercive activities in the South China Sea by increasing its deployment of maritime militias…to harass and intimidate other claimant states”, she said, “These actions represent a systemic and calculated effort to interfere with the rights and freedoms, including the navigational rights and freedoms, that all countries enjoy under international law.”Additionally, acting deputy assistant secretary of state for Oceans, Fisheries, and Polar Affairs in the Bureau of Oceans, Environment, and Scientific Affairs Constance C Arvis said that China had offered “no coherent legal basis” for its claims.She reiterated the US call to China to “conform its maritime claims to international law as reflected in the Law of the Sea Convention, to comply with the July 12, 2016 decision of the arbitral tribunal in the South China Sea arbitration, and to cease its unlawful and coercive activities in the South China Sea”. The 2016 decision refers to an international arbitration ruling in a dispute between Philippines and China, which the latter has not accepted.Arvis said that the new report provided a deeper analytical basis to uphold the existing US position on the issue, and provides further basis to allies and partners to push back on Chinese claims. “We definitely are not accepting a fait accompli,” she said.Pak added that the report highlighted the US commitment to the Indo-Pacific region, and said that as long as there were “unlawful infringements of maritime rights and freedoms”, the US would continue to uphold those rights and support allies and partners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-claims-in-scs-inconsistent-with-int-l-law-us-101643120126458.html
25-01-2022||World||China: Tragic story of twice-abandoned teen’s suicide triggers online sympathy||The alleged death by suicide of a 17-year-old who was sold by his parents after birth and said to have been rejected by them after a reunion only last month has prompted an outpouring of sympathy on Chinese social media.Liu Xuezhou, who lived and grew up in the central Chinese province of Hebei, posted a lengthy note about the unexpected developments in his life in the early hours of Monday on China’s Twitter-like Sina Weibo micro-blog platform, indicating that he had decided to end his life, alerting his many followers.Liu’s body was later found by the police on a beach in the southern city of Sanya on Monday.State media reports said Liu was sold to a child trafficker by his biological parents when he was three months old as he had been born out of wedlock; his adoptive parents died in an accident when he was four years old.He had since been living with relatives of his adoptive parents and learned from them about his adoption.In December, Liu released a video stating that he was looking for his birth parents after reading about another family reunion where the son had been abducted 14 years earlier, state-run China Daily newspaper said in a report.Liu said in his video that he was born between 2004 and 2006 and was sold at about 3 months old in Datong, Shanxi province.Liu also mentioned he was bullied at school and met a “perverted male teacher” at his middle school in Nangong, Hebei, implying he was sexually molested, the news report said.Liu’s plea was picked up by the police who helped track down his biological parents with old records and DNA samples.The reunion was widely followed on China’s social media and several photos and videos of Liu and his biological parents were published online. The happy reunion, however, was short-lived.Liu found that his biological parents were divorced and neither apparently wanted Liu around. “Liu said in his note that he told his mother he wanted a ‘home’ but she accused him of forcing her to buy him real estate and blocked him on the WeChat social media platform, according to a Sina Weibo post from Jan 18,” the China Daily report said.Liu’s death sparked a heated discussion online on issues like child trafficking, cyber bullying safety in schools.Many sympathised for Liu and condemned internet trolls.Zhou Zhaocheng, a Beijing lawyer, said child abduction and abandonment can be prosecuted and if the police find relevant evidence, Liu’s biological parents are likely to be charged.(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

An autopsy is expected on Tuesday.In a statement released on Monday, Manitoba Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said, “We are aware that some media outlets are publishing the possible identities of the four victims. As a law enforcement organisation, we will not be in a position to confirm these names until we have 100% certainty of their identities and next of kin notification is completed.”The RCMP said that it continued to work “to confirm the identities of the four victims who were located on Wednesday, January 19, 2022, near the town of Emerson, Manitoba.” It said investigators were working closely with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Manitoba and pursuing other investigative avenues to confirm the names. “We are also in regular contact with Indian consular officials who have arrived in Manitoba. Once the identities have been confirmed, our priority will be to formally notify the next of kin,” the statement said.A two-member team from the Indian consulate in Toronto is in Winnipeg to coordinate with local officials and law enforcement. They will remain there till the identities are confirmed and procedural formalities completed for transportation of the mortal remains back to India.Meanwhile, a prarthana sabha or prayer meeting was organised on Monday evening by the Indo-Canadian community in Manitoba. Winnipeg-based Hemant Shah, one of the organisers, said the prayers were being offered as four young lives were lost and described the incident as “very tragic and devastating”.“Our hearts are crying. Everybody is shocked across Canada, not just in Manitoba,” he said.The bodies of the four victims, an infant, a teenaged boy and two adults, were found just about 10km from the US border and they may have succumbed due to a human smuggling operation gone wrong.Seven other Indian nationals, linked to the tragic quartet found dead on the Canadian side of the border, were apprehended in the United States. One person, a 47-year-old resident of Florida Steve Shand was arrested by US authorities for allegedly “smuggling undocumented foreign nationals”.On January 19 morning, Manitoba RCMP received “concerning information” from their counterparts that the US Customs and Border Protection had apprehended a group of individuals who had crossed into the US from Canada, near the town of Emerson in Manitoba”.A search began and four hours later, at about 1.30pm, RCMP officers found the bodies of three individuals were located on the Canadian side of the border, close to Emerson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-border-deaths-shaken-indo-canadian-community-holds-prayer-meeting-101643094375343.html

The site where the world’s worst nuclear disaster took place is a potential entry point for Russia, the report said.The isolated zone in site located in northern part of Ukraine falls on the shortest route from Russia to its capital Kiev. The meltdown of a nuclear reactor happened in Chernobyl in 1986.The site hosts ghost towns and fallow fields, decades after the nuclear disaster. The Ukrainian army is carrying weapons as well as equipment to detect radiation in the area, according to New York Times report.Lieutenant Colonel Yuri Shakhraichuk of the Ukrainian border guard service told The New York Times: “It doesn't matter if it is contaminated or nobody lives here.” He added, “It is our territory, our country, and we must defend it.”The soldiers are required to wear a device around their necks which will check the levels of radiation. In case soldiers wander into a highly irradiated area, they will be taken off duty.None of the troops have suffered exposure to high doses so far, Colonel Shakhraichuk told The New York Times.The forces deployed in Chernobyl won’t be able to repel an invasion, they have been sent there to detect warning signs, Colonel Shakhraichuk further said.The move to send army to Chernobyl in view of the aggressive tactics adopted by Russia ignited emotional reactions from those who battled to control fire at the nuclear plant 1986.Among them is Ivan Kovalchuk, a Ukrainian firefighter. "How can this be? We liquidated the accident together. For them to do this to us now just makes me feel sorry for people in Ukraine," he told The New York Times.The town of Chernobyl is still partially occupied by workers who live on rotations to maintain the safety apparatus in place. One such workers told the New York Times, “We don’t know what will kill us first, the virus, radiation or war.”Meanwhile, Russia has maintained that it has no intention of invading Ukraine and accuses the West of ratcheting up tensions in the region. The Kremlin has, however, reiterated its demand that Nato allies should remove their forces and weapons from sites near the former Soviet Republic - like Ukraine.The tension has led to the US issuing warning to its citizens to not travel to Russia. It has also brought back embassy staff from Kiev.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-tension-at-border-ukraine-sends-soldiers-to-defend-chernobyl-101643089976896.html

It is China that has changed, not Australia that has changed.”“I don’t ... blame the government and never have for the current circumstances,” Albanese added.Morrison is the third prime minister of the conservative coalition since 2013 when Albanese was the deputy prime minister of a Labor government that was voted out of office.The first conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping during a Canberra visit in 2014 that marked a high point in bilateral relations.But relations soured when Abbott’s successor Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced in 2017 updated treason and espionage laws that would outlaw covert foreign interference in politics.Throughout Morrison’s tenure, which began in 2018, Chinese ministers have refused to speak to their Australian counterparts while key Australian exports including coal, wine and barley have been disrupted.Exporters have generally supported the government’s willingness to risk angering China through policies such as calling for an independent investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.Albanese said a Labor government would deal with China “in a mature way. Not by being provocative for the sake of it to make a domestic political point.”“I don’t argue that a change of government will simply change the relationship. Because that’s just something that we have to deal with,” Albanese said.Albanese said the three pillars of a Labor government’s foreign policy would be Australia’s alliance with the United States, engagement with regional partners and engagement in multilateral forums including the United Nations.Albanese was critical of government cuts to aid spending in the Asia-Pacific region which had helped China increase its influence in the region.“It was very short sighted for this government to withdraw from aid in the Pacific in the way that they did,” Albanese said.“If Australia and democratic nations withdraw, guess what? There are others who may want to fill that gap,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-relations-won-t-change-even-if-my-party-wins-aus-oppn-leader-albanese-101643085520266.html
25-01-2022||World||Covid: why some people with symptoms don’t get tested||Testing people with Covid symptoms has been a pillar of the UK’s pandemic response, reducing transmission by identifying and isolating those with the virus. But to be effective, it relies on people with symptoms getting tested, which raises an obvious question: what proportion of symptomatic people actually take a test?The ZOE Covid Study, which is funded by the government and run by a group including King’s College London and the city’s Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospitals, is uniquely positioned to answer this question. Each day more than 4 million participants in the UK report any symptoms they are feeling via the study’s app, and record the results of any recent Covid tests.Testing rules have evolved during the pandemic, but one rule has remained consistent: if you have one of the main three symptoms of Covid listed by the NHS (fever, a persistent new cough, or loss of taste or smell) but don’t otherwise know if you have the virus, you should take a PCR test. And by analysing the study’s data, my colleagues and I have been able to see what proportion of participants experiencing any of these symptoms then go on to have a test shortly after their symptoms appear.The results were surprising. In December 2020 we found that 25% of those who reported one of the three core symptoms didn’t report a PCR result shortly afterwards, suggesting they weren’t getting tested. This was despite there being plenty of spare testing capacity at the time.Armed with this information, we then sent out a survey to a sample of 4,000 users in the UK who had had symptoms but no test, to better understand why they didn’t get tested. We found this was mostly down to three reasons.Firstly, people were less likely to get tested if they had only one of the three symptoms or if their symptoms lasted only a day. This suggests people might have the erroneous view that their illness is unlikely to be Covid if their symptoms are brief or mild.We also found that 40% of our respondents couldn’t identify all three of the symptoms that qualify you to get a Covid test. Older groups were less likely to know: 80% of respondents aged 25-34 could identify all three symptoms, but just 25% of those 75 and over could.Plus, even when individuals knew they should get a test, we found they weren’t always able to. Of those that wanted but failed to get one, the most common reason provided was, “I did not know where to go in order to get tested”. Other common reasons were “I was not able to get to a testing location” and “I tried to get a test but was not able to get one”.Together, these results demonstrate that knowledge is often a barrier to getting tested for Covid. People may not know that their mild illness could still be Covid, they may not realise that their symptoms mean they should get a test, and even if they want a test, they may not know how to get one.Expanding the symptom listThese findings could have big consequences. It’s important that we identify and isolate as many cases of Covid as possible to help reduce the spread of the disease. People that don’t get tested may continue their daily lives, unwittingly infecting people at home and at work.Our results show that educating the public is crucial for increasing test take-up. Efforts need to be made to inform the public that even mild symptoms can be Covid, to teach them what these symptoms are, and how they might get tested. It might help to target this messaging at older populations, who are less likely to know what symptoms qualify them for a test.Recently, there have been calls to expand the list of symptoms that qualify someone for a Covid test, based on evidence that with variants such as omicron and delta, many infected people have symptoms other than the core three. While this approach may be sensible, our results indicate that extensive efforts will be needed to educate the public about any new set of symptoms to ensure that people experiencing them do get tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-why-some-people-with-symptoms-don-t-get-tested-101643082648210.html

The US Navy said in a statement that the incident happened in the South China Sea during a routine flight operation."An F-35C Lightning II, assigned to Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2, had a landing mishap on deck while USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) was conducting routine flight operations in the South China Sea, Jan. 24, 2022. The pilot safely ejected from the aircraft and was recovered via US military helicopter," the US Pacific Fleet said in the statement.The statement further said that out of the seven injured sailors, were evacuated to Manila, Philippines for treatment, where their condition was listed as stable. The other four, said the US Navy, were treated by on-board medical personnel.No details were provided on the cause of the incident or the fate of the aircraft. The Pacific Fleet said the incident was under investigation.The Vinson and another US carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, and their strike groups began drills on Sunday in the South China Sea, following exercises with a Japanese naval ship in the Philippine Sea last week.The South China Sea is among China's most sensitive territorial issues and is a frequent area of tension between the United States and China.The news of the US operations coincides with Taiwan reporting the latest mass incursion by China's air force into its air defence identification zone - 39 aircraft - in an area close to the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands in the northern reaches of the South China Sea.Taiwan also reported an anti-submarine Y-8 in the Bashi Channel which separates the country from the Philippines and connects the Pacific to the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/f35-jet-crashes-on-us-aircraft-carrier-in-south-china-sea-7-injured-101643081391585.html
25-01-2022||World||US, Europe declare 'unity' against Russia over Ukraine||President Joe Biden declared "total" unity among Western powers Monday after crisis talks with European leaders on deterring Russia from an attack against Ukraine, while the Pentagon said 8,500 US troops were put on standby for possible deployment to boost NATO."I had a very, very, very good meeting -- total unanimity with all the European leaders," Biden told reporters shortly after finishing a one hour and 20 minute video conference with allied leaders from Europe and NATO.In London, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office also said "the leaders agreed on the importance of international unity in the face of growing Russian hostility."German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said "it is up to Russia to undertake visible de-escalation," while NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned of "severe costs" if there is "any further aggression" by Moscow against Ukraine.Also on the call were the leaders of France, Italy, Poland and the European Union.Despite insisting he has no intention of attacking, President Vladimir Putin has deployed some 100,000 troops close to Ukraine, where Russia already seized Crimea in 2014 and backs a separatist army in the east.Moscow is demanding a guarantee that Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, never be allowed to join NATO, as well as other concessions by the United States in return for a decrease in tension.The United States and NATO have rejected the Russian demands and told Putin to withdraw from Ukraine's borders, warning that a Russian attack will trigger damaging economic sanctions, as well as a beefed-up NATO presence in eastern Europe.In Washington, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said a force of up to 8,500 US troops was on "heightened alert" for potential deployment to reinforce any activation of the NATO Response Force in the region, where there are growing fears of spillover from the Ukraine conflict."What this is about... is re-assurance to our NATO allies," Kirby said. "It sends a very clear signal to Mr. Putin that we take our responsibilities to NATO seriously."NATO also said it was sending jets and ships to bolster its eastern flank.The tension helped fuel instability in global markets, while Russia's main stock index plunged and the central bank suspended foreign currency purchasing after the ruble slumped.The French government announced that Russian and Ukrainian officials would meet, along with French and German counterparts, in Paris on Wednesday to try to find a way out of the impasse.President Emmanuel Macron "thinks there is a space for diplomacy, a path to de-escalation," an aide said, confirming that Macron would speak to Putin "in the coming days."- Unity search -Washington is trying to maintain transatlantic unity to build a credible threat of sanctions as a deterrence against Moscow.However, members of the 27-nation European Union have starkly differing approaches and ties to Russia, which supplies about 40 percent of the trade bloc's natural gas supplies.The new government in EU economic powerhouse Germany in particular has faced criticism from Kyiv over its refusal to send defensive weapons to Ukraine, as well as hesitating over one of the harshest economic sanctions under discussion -- cutting Moscow from the global SWIFT payments system.Echoing other US warnings, Kirby said on Monday that intelligence shows "it's very clear that the Russians have no intention right now of de-escalating."However, some European leaders are signaling less alarm.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said after talks with US top diplomat Antony Blinken that there was nothing to suggest an "immediate" Russian attack."You have to stay calm doing what you have to do, and avoid a nervous breakdown," he said.While Britain and Australia followed the United States in ordering diplomats' families to leave Kyiv, the EU and the Ukrainian government said any withdrawal of foreign embassy personnel was premature.France told citizens to avoid non-essential travel to the country.- NATO troops 'on standby' -The US-led NATO alliance said members were placing troops "on standby" and sending ships and jets to bolster eastern Europe's defenses, pointing to recent mobilizations by Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands.Stoltenberg said the alliance "will continue to take all necessary measures to protect" members.The Kremlin accused NATO of "hysteria."It also claimed that Ukrainian troops fighting Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country could launch an offensive, prompting President Volodymyr Zelensky's office to say that Ukraine will not "succumb to provocations."The United States has warned that Moscow could manufacture a "false flag" incident in Ukraine to be able to then frame an invasion as a justified response.Non-NATO member Ireland meanwhile sounded the alarm over upcoming Russian military exercises off its southwest coast in international waters of the Atlantic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-europe-declare-unity-against-russia-over-ukraine-101643080027624.html
25-01-2022||World||Europe's busiest airport shuts down amid snow havoc in southeast Europe||Europe's busiest airport shut down in Istanbul on Monday while schools and vaccination centres closed in Athens as a rare snowstorm blanketed swathes of the eastern Mediterranean, causing blackouts and traffic havoc.The closure of Istanbul Airport where the roof of one of the cargo terminals collapsed under heavy snow, causing no injuries -- grounded flights stretching from the Middle East and Africa to Europe and Asia.Travel officials told AFP it marked the glass-and-steel structure's first shutdown since it replaced Istanbul's old Ataturk Airport as the new hub for Turkish Airlines in 2019.The winter's first snow created a fun atmosphere across the squares of Istanbul's ancient mosques, where children built snowmen and tourists posing for selfies.But it proved a major headache for the 16 million residents of Turkey's largest city, where cars ploughed into each other skidding down steep, sleet-covered streets and highways turned into parking lots.The Istanbul governor's office warned drivers they would not be able to enter the city from Thrace region stretching across the European part of Turkey to its western border with Bulgaria and Greece.Shopping malls closed early, food delivery services shut down and the city's iconic "simit" bagel stalls stood empty because suppliers could not get through the snow.The storm blocked roads across central and southeastern Turkey before crossing into neighbouring Syria, where it piled more misery on the war-scarred country's northern refugee camps.Istanbul Airport serviced more than 37 million passengers last year, becoming one of the world's most important air hubs.But critics of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had long questioned his decision to place the airport on a remote patch along the Black Sea coast that is often covered with fog in winter."Due to adverse conditions, all flights have been temporarily stopped for air safety," the airport said in a statement, posting pictures on Twitter of yellow snowploughs circling stranded aircraft.The airport extended its suspension twice, saying late Monday that service would not resume before 4:00 am (0100 GMT) Tuesday.- 'Everything is frozen' -Most of Turkey's main institutions stayed open.But in Greece, where overnight temperatures plummeted to -14 degrees Celsius (6.8 degrees Fahrenheit), the storm suspended a session of parliament and forced schools and vaccination centres to close in Athens.Hundreds of motorists were trapped in cars around the capital -- many of them venting their anger on TV stations -- despite attempts by police to seal off motorway entry points to the north of the city."My wife has had nothing to eat since morning. We had a small bottle of water between us," one driver who identified himself only as Christos told private Star TV."Everything is frozen stiff."The army, firefighters and police began work to free the stranded motorists in the early evening.Greece's climate crisis and civil protection minister Christos Stylianides apologised for the chaos and blamed the company managing the motorway for not keeping it open.A cold snap with sub-zero temperatures and gale-force winds last hit Athens in February 2021, killing four people on the islands of Evia and Crete and leaving tens of thousands of households without electricity for days.Kostas Lagouvardos, research director at the National Observatory of Athens, told ANT1 TV that the capital had not seen back-to-back winters like this since 1968.The snow uncharacteristically fell on several Aegean Sea islands, isolating some mountain villages on Andros, Naxos and Tinos, and covering beaches in Mykonos, in summer a party island.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europes-busiest-airport-shut-down-amid-snow-havoc-in-southeast-europe-101643079397183.html
25-01-2022||World||Facebook parent Meta creates powerful AI supercomputer||Facebook’s parent company Meta on Monday said it has created what it believes is among the fastest artificial intelligence supercomputers running today.The social media giant said it hopes the machine will help lay the groundwork for its building of the metaverse, a virtual reality construct intended to supplant the internet as we know it today.Facebook said it believes the computer will be the fastest in the world once it is fully built around the middle of the year.Supercomputers are extremely fast and powerful machines built to do complex calculations not possible with a regular home computer. Meta did not disclose where the computer is located or how much it is costing to build.The computer, which is already up and running but is still being built, is called AI Research SuperCluster. Meta says it will help its AI researchers build “new and better” artificial intelligence models that can learn from “trillions” of examples and work across hundreds of different languages simultaneously and analyze text, images and video together.The way Meta is defining the power of its computer is different from how conventional and more technically powerful supercomputers are measured because it relies on the performance of graphics-processing chips, which are useful for running “deep learning” algorithms that can understand what’s in an image, analyze text and translate between languages, said Tuomas Sandholm, a computer science professor and co-director of the AI center at Carnegie Mellon University.“We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together,” Meta said in a blog post.The company said its supercomputer will incorporate “real-world examples” from its own systems into training its AI. It says its previous efforts used only open-source and other publicly available data sets.“They are going to, for the first time, put their customer data on their AI research computer,” Sandholm said. “That would be a really big change to give AI researchers and algorithms access to all that data.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-parent-meta-creates-powerful-ai-supercomputer-101643079315687.html

No excuse is understandable or accepted. The girls of the country must return to the school," Karzai said in an interview with American news network CNN."Women should return to work. Our religion allows it. Period...No compromise on the principles or rights. Or running the country better," he added.This comes as talks are underway in the capital city of Norway over wide-ranging issues concerning the fate of Afghanistan.A Taliban delegation, led by Acting Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, met with envoys of western nations in Oslo on Monday. Prior to that, the Taliban delegation also met with members of the civil society.Karzai backed these meetings, which experts believe could play a vital role in solving the problems in the country."We have happy about the meetings that have taken place in Norway among Afghans between the Taliban government representatives and members of the civil society. We had some very constructive talks. Notes were changed," the former Afghan President said.For the good of Afghanistan, Karzai said a parallel track of two activities must happen at the same time."We...must begin to work out a stable and peaceful Afghanistan by incorporating the opinion and aspiration of all other Afghans, by enacting a constitution, by moving forward with opening schools for girls this March," he said.While supporting the issue of girls' education, the former president said, "we all sit among ourselves and understand each other and work with one another, despite the differences we have."Afghanistan is contending with drought, a pandemic, an economic collapse and the effects of years of conflict. Some 24 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity. Reports indicate that one million children could die of starvation.According to UN estimates, more than half of the population will be facing famine this winter, and 97 per cent of the population could fall below the poverty line this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-girls-must-return-to-school-when-they-reopen-in-march-hamid-karzai-101643076352800.html

With omicron spreading more than twice as fast as the delta strain that cause the last surge, experts say new cases may exceed 10,000 this week and possibly 20,000 after the Lunar New Year’s holiday break that begins this weekend and continues to next Wednesday.To prevent a sudden explosion of infections from overwhelming hospitals and disrupting workplaces and essential services, South Korea will reduce quarantine periods, expand testing and treat more people at home.From Wednesday, the quarantine periods for people who test positive after being fully vaccinated will be reduced from the current 10 days to seven days. Fully vaccinated people who comes in close contact with virus carriers won't be placed under quarantine. Officials are also planning to treat a larger number of mild or moderate cases at home and expand the use of rapid antigen tests to detect more infections sooner.Omicron has become the dominant variant in many countries and more easily infects those who have been vaccinated or had Covid-19 previously. But vaccination and booster shots still provide strong protection from serious illness, hospitalization and death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-sees-highest-single-day-spike-of-8k-covid-cases-101643074998929.html

Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said that US defense secretary Lloyd Austin's order to place 8,500 military personnel to heightened preparedness would allow America to rapidly deploy additional brigade combat teams, along with units.Kirby told reporters that giving time to prepare the US military personnel enough time to prepare makes “prudent sense” in case Nato activates its Response Force as Russia has “no intention right now of de-escalating”. The US forces placed on alert would be in addition to the significant combat-capable troops already based in Europe “to deter aggression and enhance the alliance’s ability to defend allies and defeat aggression if necessary,” said Kirby."Again, I want to reinforce that as of now the decision has been made to put these units on higher alert and higher alert only," Kirby said. "No decisions have been made to deploy any forces from the United States at this time."‘Leave Ukraine’: US tells American citizens, families of diplomats amid tensionsWhile Russia has denied intention to invade Ukraine, its aggression along the border has caused concern to the West, prompting a visit to Kyiv by US state secretary Antony Blinken and meeting with European allies. US President Joe Biden also held what he called a “great” call with European leaders as they work to strike a unified position on Russia.Biden had said that the US, in case of an invasion, would respond with stringent economic sanctions but the latest order indicates that the US President wants to send a stronger military message to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, as fears of invasion grow."As [President Joe Biden] has made clear, the United States will act firmly in defence of its national interests in response to actions by Russia that harm us, our allies or partners," the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-crisis-8-500-us-troops-on-heightened-alert-as-russia-shows-no-intention-deescalating-101643073945486.html

Then, Peter Doocy of Fox News shouted a question about inflation.“Do you think you think inflation is a political liability in the midterms?” Doocy asked.“No -- that’s a great asset,” Biden deadpanned. “What a stupid son of a b----.”Biden had been discussing his administration’s efforts to discourage greater corporate consolidation and how that would reduce inflation, which has became a threat to Democratic prospects in next fall’s elections for the House and Senate.Doocy frequently asks combative questions of the president and his press secretary, Jen Psaki. On Fox News later, he made light of the exchange. “And now we’ll just have to wait and see if the White House has to bleep that on the transcript,” Doocy joked, adding that he’d only learned about Biden’s comments after he’d left the room and other reporters repeated them back to him. “The clip will now live on,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-bristles-at-fox-inflation-query-with-hot-mic-expletive-101643071141706.html

25-01-2022||World||US asks its citizens to leave Ukraine||As diplomatic talks over Ukraine fail to yield a breakthrough, and tensions with Russia deepen, the United States ordered family members of its diplomats to leave Ukraine, and advised all US citizens to do the same, citing “the increased threat of Russian military action”.The US, Britain and Australia ordered diplomats’ families to leave Kyiv, while France told its citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Ukraine.Both Kyiv and the European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said any withdrawal of diplomatic personnel appeared premature.In an advisory on Sunday night, the US state department authorised the “voluntary departure” of US direct hire employees, and “ordered the departure of eligible family members” from its embassy in Kiev “due to the continued threat of Russian military action”.The advisory added that US citizens in Ukraine “should consider departing now using commercial or other privately available transportation options”.The US is weighing sending as many as 5,000 troops to Nato allies in the Baltic and Eastern Europe as concerns mount that Russia might invade Ukraine, US media reported on Monday.The possible deployment could involve 1,000 to 5,000 troops, along with naval vessels and aircraft, according to the New York Times. It said the number could rise sharply if conditions deteriorate.CNN said the Pentagon is identifying which units would go but that the final decision to deploy them has not been taken.The option came out of discussions on the Ukraine crisis between US President Joe Biden and his advisors, including defence secretary Lloyd Austin, over the weekend. US officials, speaking anonymously, said that they are consulting with allies on deployments and studying all scenarios.Nato said on Monday it was sending jets and ships to bolster its eastern European flank, as the US and EU looked to coordinate a tough response to Russia if it invades Ukraine. Tensions have soared over Russia’s deployment of some 100,000 troops and heavy armour at its neighbour’s borders, despite the Kremlin’s insistence it is not planning a new incursion almost eight years after it seized Crimea.Meanwhile, Top US diplomat Antony Blinken on Monday dialled in to a meeting of his EU counterparts in Brussels to brief them on his meeting on Friday with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, where they failed to make a breakthrough but agreed to keep talking.EU foreign ministers were sounding out Blinken over a written response Washington has committed to provide to Moscow this week after the Kremlin laid down a series of security demands, including preventing Ukraine joining Nato and rolling back the alliance’s forces in eastern Europe.“Nato will continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all allies,” chief Jens Stoltenberg said.The Kremlin accused the alliance of ramping up tensions through “information hysteria” and “concrete actions”, claiming the risk of an offensive by Ukrainian troops fighting Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country was “very high”.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged his western partners to “preserve the unity of all EU member states in protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state”.European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc was preparing a 1.2-billion-euro emergency financial aid package for Ukraine.(With inputs from agencies)
25-01-2022||World||Burkina Faso military coup: Junta says it has now seized power||More than a dozen mutinous soldiers declared Monday on state television that a military junta now controls Burkina Faso after they detained the democratically elected president following a day of gunbattles in the capital.The military coup is the third of its kind in West Africa in the last 18 months, creating upheaval in some of the countries hardest hit by Islamic extremists attacks.Capt. Sidsore Kaber Ouedraogo said the Patriotic Movement for Safeguarding and Restoration "has decided to assume its responsibilities before history.” They cited the deteriorating security situation amid the deepening Islamic insurgency and the president’s inability to manage the crisis.It was not immediately known where President Roch Marc Christian Kabore was, and the junta spokesman said only that the coup had taken place “without any physical violence against those arrested, who are being held in a safe place, with respect for their dignity.”He said the new military leaders would work to establish a calendar “acceptable to everyone” for holding new elections without giving further details.The announcement on state broadcaster RTB capped a day of confusion over who was in control of Burkina Faso, once a bastion of stability in the region that has faced growing violence from Islamic extremists during Kabore's time in power.In a statement, Kabore's political party accused the mutinous soldiers of trying to assassinate the president and another government minister and said the presidential palace in Ouagadougou remained surrounded by "heavily armed and hooded men.”Gunfire erupted early Sunday when soldiers took control of a major military barracks in the capital, Ouagadougou. In response, civilians rallied in a show of support for the rebellion but were dispersed by security forces firing tear gas. Burkina Faso has seen a series of anti-government protests as anger has mounted over the handling of the Islamic insurgency.Groups of people celebrated again in the streets of the capital Monday morning after reports of Kabore's capture.Kabore was elected in 2015 after a popular uprising ousted longtime strongman President Blaise Compaore. Kabore was reelected in November 2020, but frustration has been growing at his inability to stem the spread of jihadist violence across the country. Attacks linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group are escalating, killing thousands and displacing more than an estimated 1.5 million people.The military has suffered losses since the extremist violence began in 2016. In December, more than 50 security forces were killed and nine more died in November.Mutinous soldiers told the AP that the government was out of touch with troops and that they wanted military rule. Among their demands are more forces in the battle against extremists and better care for the wounded and the families of the dead.About 100 military members have planned the takeover since August, according to one of the mutinous soldiers.Sahel experts say the government was overstretched, but it’s unlikely the mutiny will change anything.“Burkina Faso’s army is profoundly ill-equipped and unprepared for the war it’s asked to fight. It’s out of its depth. Its frustration with an equally out-of-its-depth government is understandable. Regrettably, this is unlikely to improve anything,” said Michael Shurkin, a former political analyst at the CIA and director of global programs at 14 North Strategies, a business intelligence consultancy based in Senegal.But as protests over the weekend and on Monday showed, discontent among the general population is also growing.“People are tired with this situation of insecurity. Every day, people are killed. In Burkina, there are areas that can’t be accessed. We have lost a big part of our territory,” said Jean-Baptiste Ilboudou, a civilian who was biking near the military base when gunshots were heard.The West African regional bloc known as ECOWAS, which already has suspended Mali and Guinea in the past 18 months over military coups, issued a statement of support for Burkina Faso’s embattled president and urged dialogue with the mutineers.Burkina Faso has also seen its share of coup attempts and military takeovers — though it experienced a period of relative stability under Compaore, who ruled for 27 years until his ouster in 2014.Earlier this month, authorities arrested a group of soldiers accused of participating in a foiled coup plot. It was not immediately known whether there was any connection between those soldiers and the ones rebelling now. Military prosecutors said nine soldiers and two civilians were being held in connection with the plot.In 1987, Compaore came to power by force. And in 2015, soldiers loyal to him attempted to overthrow the transitional government put into place after his ouster. The army was ultimately able to put the transitional authorities back in power, who led again until Kabore won an election and took office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/burkina-faso-military-coup-junta-says-it-has-now-seized-power-101643048771193.html

There were no reports of loss of life or property, though fragments of the missiles fell in different areas around the UAE capital.The Houthi attack marked the latest escalation in the long-running war in Yemen and came exactly a week after another drone-and-missile attack by the Houthis on Abu Dhabi killed two Indian nationals and a Pakistani. Two more Indians were also injured in that attack.‘Ready for attack’: UAE intercepts Houthi attack; destroys 2 missilesThe UAE defence ministry said it destroyed missile launchers in Yemen’s northern Al Jawf region, more than 1,200km from Abu Dhabi, immediately after the projectiles were fired. The ministry said it was fully prepared to deal with any threats and that it will “take all necessary measures to protect the UAE from any attacks”.Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sare’e warned in a statement in Arabic that the group is prepared to expand its operations against Saudi Arabia and the UAE and “confront escalation with escalation”. The Houthis also “advised” foreign investors and firms in the UAE to leave the “unsafe country”.There was no immediate response from the Indian side to the latest attack by the Houthis or the threat of expanding operations against the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which the Indian government describes as part of the country’s extended neighbourhood. The two West Asian countries are home to almost six million Indians, including professionals and blue collar workers.The Houthis are also holding the 11 crew members, including seven Indians, of the merchant vessel Rwabee after seizing it in the Red Sea earlier this month. Both India and the UAE have demanded the release of crew members, though little headway appears to have been made in efforts to get them freed.External affairs minister S Jaishankar on January 18 condemned the drone attack by the Houthis in Abu Dhabi that killed two Indian nationals as a “terror attack”, and conveyed India’s strong solidarity to his UAE counterpart Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan in the face of such assaults.The Indian government has expressed concern at the recent intensification of fighting in Yemen and reiterated its position that a peaceful solution should be found through dialogue. It has called on all parties in the conflict to come to the negotiating table to find a “peaceful resolution to the Yemen issue”.Experts believe the Houthi attacks on the UAE using drones and missiles represents a major escalation of the nearly seven-year-old conflict. The Houthis earlier used drones and missiles to target oil facility in Saudi Arabia. The UAE reduced its participation in the Saudi Arabia-led coalition in Yemen, but the Houthis have retaliated in response to reports that the UAE backed a recent ground offensive in southern Yemen.The UN Security Council last week condemned the “heinous terrorist attacks in Abu Dhabi” and at other sites in Saudi Arabia, and “underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”.India is caught in a delicate position because of the long-standing support provided by Iran to the Houthis. Some reports have suggested the drones and missiles used by the Houthis are being supplied by Iran. India enjoys good relations with both the UAE and Iran, which is seen as a key player in tackling the emerging situation in Afghanistan.

The traffic police who are currently conducting an awareness program on the need for better quality helmets said that as soon as the awareness campaign is over, enforcement will begin. Anyone violating the helmet rule will be fined ₹ 500, said a senior traffic police official, privy to the matter. The officers also added that apart from the penalty, the motorist’s licence will be impounded and sent to the regional transport office (RTO) concerned recommending suspension, a period of which may vary between six to eight weeks. “We have decided to consider any person commuting without a good quality helmet as helmet-less traveller. Our biggest concern is those who travel with plastic helmets as these helmets don’t help in case of an accident,” said BR Ravikante Gowda, joint commissioner of police, traffic. According to Gowda, a study conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) and the traffic police at 15 locations across the city revealed that only 44% of motorists use quality helmets that could prevent a road accident. He said that the study also revealed that 70% of pillion riders use helmets. The enforcement campaign is based on the findings of the study, the officer added.  Deputy commissioner of police (traffic west), Kuldeep Jain said that police will keep a tab on the commuters wearing the helmets which don’t cover the back of the head or doesn’t provide adequate protection. He clarified that front open helmets are not banned completely. “Such plastic helmets look like a hat. They are made of poor-quality material and don’t provide protection. We want the commuters to wear helmets that would cover the back of the head up till the beginning of the spinal code and it should be made as per the quality requirements prescribed by the government,” he said. Under the awareness campaign, the police ran road-rollers over several sub-standard helmets in several parts of the city on Tuesday. The enforcement however will not be an easy task. In 2018 also, Bengaluru police had introduced an enforcement drive against commuters not using helmets without an ISI mark. The move came under criticism since the ISI was not an internationally accepted quality standard. Several high-quality imported helmets didn’t have these marks, resulting in a stand-off between the motorcyclists and traffic police. Later, the traffic police withdrew the campaign since they were unable to verify if the helmet was indeed ISI certified as several fake ISI marked helmets flooded the market. “As per the Bureau of Indian Standards, the visual inspections cannot ascertain the quality of the helmets. Hence it is not possible for the police to check the quality of the helmet on the spot. Bengaluru Traffic Police (BTP) advises riders to use helmets as prescribed by law,” BTP had tweeted. When asked if these issues have been sorted before the latest campaign DCP Jain said that instead of cracking down on people wearing helmets without an ISI mark, the traffic police will identify those wearing “helmet of sub-standards quality”. “As I said earlier, we have given clear instructions on which are sub-standard helmets and helmets made with poor material. We will be specifically looking for such cases instead of enforcing the ISI mark requirement,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bluru-police-to-fine-bikers-over-substandard-helmets-101643135308860.html
25-01-2022||India||Defection politics heats up in Karnataka||The leader of the opposition in Karnataka assembly and senior Congress leader, Siddaramaiah, on Tuesday said that several legislators from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) are in touch with him, indicating the possibility of more defections ahead of the 2023 assembly elections in the state. “People from both the BJP and JD(S) are in touch with me and I cannot name them. But only those people who believe in the party’s ideology, accept the leadership and join unconditionally can come,” Siddaramaiah said on Tuesday. Siddaramaiah’s claims lend to the statements made by BJP legislator Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), who on Monday said there were several persons within the saffron outfit who had already “booked their ticket” to return to the Congress. He was making an indirect reference to MLAs who defected from the Congress-JD(S) coalition government in 2019. On Tuesday, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president, DK Shivakumar also hinted that several BJP legislators were in touch with the grand old party, waiting to return to the fold. “Unlike Yatnal, I cannot speak on such things on the road,” Shivakumar said on Tuesday. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday, however, brushed aside the Congress’s “big claims”. “A sense of insecurity is haunting the Congress. Two top leaders of the party are issuing statements with big claims. There is no question of any one from BJP jumping the ship. We have many who quit Congress and joined us,” Bommai said. He added that the BJP will gain further strength in the coming days. With just over a year to go in the 2023 assembly elections and several other polls before that, all major parties are wary of defections likely to increase. At least three people aware of the developments said some of the legislators who engineered the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy-led Congress-JD(S) government in 2019 were now in talks with their former parties to return. Political observers also point at an evident divide within the BJP. Members of the old guard nurse a feeling of neglect as they have been constantly overlooked to accommodate the new entrants, a political observer said, requesting anonymity. Former chief minister and senior BJP leader BS Yediyurappa had gone out of his way to accommodate the 17 legislators, whose support helped him get to the top post. Members of the old guard or those who have always been with the BJP have also expressed their unhappiness of being left out of the current Basavaraj Bommai-led state cabinet. There is a clear factionalism within the saffron outfit, the political observer added. At least three legislators, who defected to the BJP in 2019, on Tuesday denied any plan to part ways with the ruling party. State minister N Nagaraj was one of them. “Many people ask us to return to the Congress and I have told them that we cannot take a different decision for every election,” Nagaraj said. He added that Siddaramaiah was in touch with him, but it was “not to discuss politics”. Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar, meanwhile, brushed aside Yatnal’s statements, calling them his “personal opinion”. People aware of the developments said no preferential treatment will be given anymore to those who had switched sides in 2019. Though the BJP benefited from the defections in 2019, it also caused a significant amount of disenchantment among its core party workers, who were snubbed in favour of the new entrants. The fear now is that the same leaders will want their supporters to be given preference in the upcoming elections to zilla and taluka panchayats and Bengaluru city corporation polls, the political observer said. Chief minister Bommai has had a difficult six months in the top office, with his term being plagued with allegations of widespread corruption, discontentment among BJP legislators and workers as well as fuelling a divide that continues to widen ahead of the crucial polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defection-politics-heats-up-in-karnataka-101643135128792.html
25-01-2022||India||Farmers attack Telangana MP’s convoy, clash with BJP workers||A mob of farmers attacked the convoy of Telangana BJP MP Dharmapuri Arvind with stones and sticks on Tuesday in Nizamabad district, alleging that he has failed to fulfil his pre-election promise of securing a turmeric board for the state from the Centre.Arvind, who represents Nizamabad parliamentary constituency, was going to Nandipet block to attend party programmes, when he was waylaid by a mob of over 200 farmers at Issapally village of Armoor block.Holding placards demanding the setting up of the turmeric board and raising slogans against the MP, the farmers demanded his immediate resignation for failing to live up to his promise.The windshield of the MP’s car was damaged in stone pelting. The BJP workers accompanying the convoy retaliated, sparking clashes between the two groups.With the situation going out of control, police swung into action and carried out baton charge to disperse the warring groups. Arvind returned to Nizamabad in another vehicle without attending his scheduled programmes.Arvind, who defeated Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) president K Chandrasekhar Rao’s daughter Kalvakuntla Kavitha in the 2019 general election from Nizamabad, promised during the electioneering that he would secure the much-awaited turmeric board from the Centre for the farmers within a month of getting elected as MP.He also signed a bond on a stamp paper to that effect and got it registered, saying he would resign from his MP seat if he failed to fulfill his promise.However, the Centre refused to create a separate board for turmeric as there is already a spices board which includes turmeric. Arvind got a promise from the Centre that a regional office of the spices board would be set up at Nizamabad.Soon after the incident, the BJP activists squatted on the Armoor road and staged a dharna, in protest against the attack on the MP. Traffic came to a grinding halt for over an hour. Special police pickets were posted in Issapally and Nandipet to prevent any untoward incidents.The BJP MP alleged that those who attacked his convoy were not turmeric farmers, but the TRS activists. “They have been issuing statements saying they would stall my visit to the constituency. Yet, the police have not taken any action to prevent the mob attack,” he told reporters.“I called up local police officials, but they failed to control the TRS workers, who blocked my convoy by burning tyres on the road. It clearly showed that the police are acting at the behest of the ruling party,” he alleged.Arvind said he would lodge a complaint with the privileges committee of the Lok Sabha and also bring it to the notice of the BJP national leadership.He later lodged a complaint with Nizamabad police commissioner KR Nagaraju and demanded that a case of attempt to murder be filed against the protestors.Senior TRS legislator from Armoor constituency A Jeevan Reddy said the TRS had nothing to do with the incident. “It was the turmeric farmers who prevented the MP from entering their villages, as he has miserably failed to fulfill his pre-election promise,” Reddy said.He demanded that Arvind should answer the queries of the angry farmers before making wild allegations against the TRS. “Is it not true that the MP has betrayed the farmers?” he asked. BJP national vice-president D K Aruna and legislator Eatala Rajender also condemned the attack on the Nizamabad MP.
25-01-2022||India||Andhra CM inaugurates new DBT scheme for EBC women||Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday started a direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme for financial upliftment of women belonging to the Economically Backward Classes (EBC) amongst open category (OC).Launching the scheme, named YSR EBC Nestham, at his camp office at Tadepalli in Amaravati, the chief minister transferred ₹589 crores directly into the account of 392,674 women beneficiaries.Jagan said the YSR EBC Nestham was not an election promise, nor was it included in the YS Congress Party’s manifesto. “It has been brought with the intention of uplifting poor women from the upper castes, including Reddy, Kamma, Arya Vysya, Kshatriya, Velama, Brahmin, and other OC communities,” he said.Under the latest scheme, the state government will provide ₹45,000 to each woman from OC communities in the 45-60 years age group in 3 tranches – ₹15,000 per annum for three years.Jagan said the scheme aimed at improving the livelihood and financial empowerment of women from the EBC category. “This is the first of its kind scheme to benefit the poor women from upper castes,” he said.Stating that his government was fulfilling the objectives of the welfare state envisaged in the Constitution, the chief minister said in the last two and a half years, several women-centric schemes like Amma Vodi (cash incentive for women for sending their children to schools), Swechha (free Sanitary Napkins for Adolescent), YSR Cheyutha (Financial assistance for SC/STs), YSR Aasara, YSR Sunna Vaddi, YSR Pension Kanuka, and the distribution of wholesome nutritious food for holistic nutrition (for the health care of pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children).“To ensure that women become self-sufficient, the state government brought out EBC Nestham. These women from OC category families who come from economically unsound circumstances deserve a platform where they can become financially self-sufficient and support their families in any way they can,” he said.He pointed out that over 51% of nominated posts had been given to women in Andhra Pradesh. “As a person who strongly believes that if a woman is happy, healthy, and content, the community around her will flourish, we are taking steps forward,” Jagan added.
25-01-2022||India||Tamil Nadu district engages youth to solve issues||In a bid to involve educated youngsters in local government operations, the collector of Tamil Nadu’s Thiruvallur district, Alby John, has introduced a 3-month paid internship programme to help find solutions for real time issues in the district.Youngsters from across the state are eligible to apply and five interns will be hired following a selection process, said a district administration official.Though the government has involved youngsters as interns in projects such as the Smart Cities Mission, this is a novel step at the district level. The idea came from the youngsters themselves, says John.“Several of them were informally approaching me on the social media and in person saying that they have ideas for solid waste management, water bodies restoration and they wanted to know how they should go about it,” says the doctor-turned-IAS officer.“I discussed this with my team here and we thought it would be a good idea to institutionalise and streamline this as an internship so youngsters who are genuinely interested can work with the administration in policy implementation.”This informal interaction has a pandemic context. During the lockdown, students were tweeting district collectors cheekily asking for holidays, exams to be postponed.A section of Tamil Nadu’s bureaucrats is active on the social media. And young officers like John, Virudhunagar collector Meghanath Reddy respond in equal banter. Reddy has been hosting students for a “Coffee with Collector” at his office and on Tuesday, it was with the winners of a quiz competition. Named after Bollywood’s Karan Johar’s show, Reddy is on season three.The internship is for those below the age of 32 who must have a bachelor’s or master’s degree and must be fluent in English and Tamil. “We believe they will bring in a new perspective which we can channelise in the government sector,” says John. The interns will get to be on the field and sit in on meetings with district officials.“We will give them the exposure and they will get to see if their ideas can be scaled up and how their initiatives progress. We may extend this up to six months too.”The internship is likely to start from mid-February and the interns will receive a monthly stipend of ₹10,000 from the state government. “We want to invite the best talent. We want this to be a productive affair,” John says while explaining the purpose of a paid internship when internships across the country including in private sector have been unpaid.
25-01-2022||India||Madras high court expunges judge’s remark against actor Vijay||The Madras high court on Tuesday expunged scathing remarks made against Tamil actor C Joseph Vijay by a single judge in the Rolls Royce case.A bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and Mohammed Shaffiq passed the order stating that the observation made by the learned single Judge SM Subramaniam on July 8 was unwarranted and irrelevant to decide the issue.Actor Vijay had sought an exemption of Entry Tax for his Rolls Royce Ghost car, imported from England in 2012. Justice Subramaniam dismissed his petition and made critical remarks against the actor.The judge had pointed out that Vijay has a large fan base and those fans consider actors like him real heroes. “In the State of Tamil Nadu, cine heroes have risen as rulers of the State and therefore, the people are under the impression that they are real heroes. Thus, they are not expected to behave like reel heroes. Tax evasion is to be construed as an anti-national habit, attitude and mindset and unconstitutional,” he had observed.Vijay eventually paid the entry tax as demanded by the transport authorities and filed another writ aggrieved over the adverse remarks and sought the expunction for the same. “The order of the learned single Judge, wherein, certain disparaging remarks were made, appears to be wholly unwarranted, as there was uncertainty as to the state of the law relating to Entry Tax and divergent views were expressed not only by the High Courts but by the Supreme Court as well,” the court said in its orders on Tuesday. “Thus, to impute motives to a litigant or castigating him for taking a particular legal position or exercising his constitutional right under Article 226 is unwarranted.”The court also observed that it is difficult to suggest that the petitioner, Vijay, had acted with malafide and deliberate intention. It observed that the previous order overlooks the fact that the stand taken by the petitioner relates to certain cases regarding the demand and collection of entry tax on imported vehicles and goods under the scope of Part XIII of the Constitution. A nine-bench judge of the Supreme Court had examined whether an entire state can be notified as a local area and left open the question of whether entry tax can be levied on goods entering into the land mass of India from another country to be determined by appropriate proceedings. Following that, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court reversed a judgement by the division bench of Kerala high court and ruled that entry tax on imported goods and vehicles is permissible. “The above sequence of litigation will clearly demonstrate that the appellant cannot be imputed with motive whatsoever, and therefore, the disparaging remarks are clearly unwarranted,” the court said.The court explained the background for the uncertainty over the matter by recalling that the Supreme Court had dealt with a batch of appeals questioning the competence of states to levy entry tax on vehicles and goods imported from outside India, including Orissa, Bihar and Kerala. “The history of litigation has been set out in great detail only to show that there has been grave uncertainty not only with the reference to parameter/test to be applied for determining the question of the validity of the levy of Entry Tax but also the question whether Entry Tax can be levied on imported goods stood resolved only by the decision of the Supreme Court in the State of Kerala and Others Vs. Fr. William Fernandez Etc. which was delivered on 9 October 2017,” the court said. Following the SC verdict, in this case, a division bench of the Madras high court delivered a judgement on January 29, 2019, in a batch of writ petitions in the case of V.Krishnamurthy Vs. State of Tamil Nadu.

Till then, petitioner be not arrested,” according to the order which came out on Tuesday. Majithia’s counsel had prayed for protection for seven days from the court. The dismissal of the anticipatory bail plea has come as a setback to Majithia, who is the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) candidate from the Majitha Assembly constituency in Amritsar district.The process for filling of nomination papers for the February 20 Punjab Assembly polls began on Tuesday. Majithia (46), who was booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act last month, had moved the High Court seeking anticipatory bail.The High Court on January 10 had granted an interim protection to Majithia from the arrest in the matter while directing him to join the investigation on January 12.The HC had also imposed some conditions, including not leaving the country.The court had extended the interim protection on January 18.Majithia is the brother-in-law of SAD president Sukhbir Badal and the brother of former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal.The former Punjab minister was booked under the NDPS Act on the basis of a 2018 report of a probe into a drugs racket operating in the state.The report was filed by anti-drug special task force (STF) chief Harpreet Singh Sidhu in the Punjab and Haryana High Court in 2018.The 49-page FIR in the matter was registered by the state Crime Branch at its Mohali police station.Majithia was booked under Sections 25 (punishment for allowing one’s premises for its use for the commission of an offence), 27A (for financing sale, purchase, production, manufacture, possession, transportation, use or consumption, import and export or any act pertaining to narcotics) and 29 (abetting or plotting an offence) of the NDPS Act.In his bail plea, the SAD leader had submitted that the Congress government in Punjab had “left no stone unturned to misuse its powers and position for wreaking vengeance upon its political opponents”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drugs-case-hc-stays-majithia-s-arrest-for-3-days-101643134709168.html

To be sure, a third Padma Bhushan recipient, Ustad Rashid Khan, lives in Bengal but in the home ministry list, is classified under Uttar Pradesh where he was born.“I do not know anything about the Padma Bhushan award. Nobody said anything to me about this. If I have been given the award, then I refuse it,” Bhattacharjee said in a short statement circulated by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M).Bhattacharjee was the chief minister from 2000 to 2011. The former chief minister has been unwell for some time and never leaves home. He was treated for Covid-19 last year.A senior home ministry official said a phone call was made to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee’s house on Tuesday morning, which was picked by his wife and she was informed about his Padma award. There is no provision of taking consent for giving Padma awards to anyone; the awardees are only informed after the decision has been made, the official said.To be sure, Bhattacharjee’s predecessor, Jyoti Basu, also refused the Bharat Ratna award when the Manmohan Singh government reportedly proposed to confer the award on the communist leader.No CPI(M) leader has accepted civilian awards from the Centre in the past.

As part of their initiatives, eight gaps of single row fence that remained pending for long, were completely plugged last year. Besides, they have blocked total 44 drains and culverts by installing iron gates along them. “We have taken several initiatives to complete the fencing work on the border. Initiatives have also been taken to install smart surveillance system in 24 locations that are mostly smuggling and infiltration-prone areas,” said inspector general of BSF, Tripura Frontiers, Sushanta Kumar Nath. Of the total 856-kilometres-long international border shared between Tripura and Bangladesh, some parts are yet to be fenced. As there are people living within 150 yards of the border in many places, single row fencing is expected to be erected in most of the unfenced border areas. On the other hand, the BSF apprehended a total of 221 persons including 97 Bangladeshi nationals, 118 Indians and another six foreign nationals for illegal infiltration last year. According to their previous reports, a total of 131 illegal infiltrators were apprehended in 2020 while in 2019, the number of detained infiltrators was 236. Besides, the BSF seized huge quantity of contraband items including narcotics, phensidyl, yaba tablets and cattles worth Rs. 35.64 crores across the state last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsf-installs-surveillance-system-to-strengthen-indo-bangla-border-infrastructure-101643128047770.html

25-01-2022||India||Several organisations in Nagaland to abstain from Republic Day celebrations||KOHIMA: Several tribal bodies and civil society organisations in Nagaland have said that they will abstain from participating in the Republic Day celebrations on January 26. The decision comes against the backdrop of the killing of 14 civilians at Oting village in Mon district on December 4 and 5 last year by the security forces. Eastern Nagaland People’s Organisation (ENPO), the apex body of several Naga tribes of at least five districts- Mon, Tuensang, Longleng, Kiphire, and Noklak- declared non-cooperation with the armed forces until justice is delivered to the victims’ families. The non-cooperation will include refraining from any national celebrations, therefore, the people of Eastern Nagaland shall not participate in the forthcoming Indian Republic Day celebration on 26th January 2022, said ENPO president R Tsapikiu Sangtam and general secretary C Manlang Phom. They said this decision was taken in line with the resolution of ENPO during its joint consultative meeting with all Eastern Nagaland civil society organisations on December 14, 2021 at Longleng. The ENPO’s major constituent tribes are Konyak, Khiamniungan, Phom, Sangtam, Yimkhiung and Chang. Meanwhile, the Naga Students Federation (NSF), an influential organisation, has also directed Naga youth and students community to refrain from taking part in the upcoming Republic Day celebration, taking forth its protest against the imposition of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act [AFSPA]. “The Federation reiterates that the Naga people should disassociate themselves from such celebrations for as long as the Government of India continues with its policy of militarising our Naga homeland. This is not in defiance of any forces on earth but the assertion that the voices of the Naga people cannot be muted despite the continued subjugation by forces reeking of colonial ideologies and practices,” said a release from the NSF. The student body further appealed to the state government to ensure that the special investigation team (SIT) report on the Oting massacre is made public and that the culprits be awarded befitting punishments at the earliest. Chief minister Neiphiu Rio, reacting to the decision of the organisations, said as a democracy, it was up to them, but the government will carry on with the Republic Day programme and do what is necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/several-organisations-in-nagaland-to-abstain-from-republic-day-celebrations-101643126307690.html

25-01-2022||India||President Kovind addresses nation on eve of 73rd Republic Day | Full text||President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday extended his greetings to the citizens of the country on the eve of the 73rd Republic Day. Addressing the nation, Kovind remembered the contributions of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and other freedom fighters who fought for India's independence.With Republic Day taking place under the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic, Kovind acknowledged that even though the celebrations will be held in a muted manner, the spirit of the country is as strong as ever. He urged the citizens of the country to exercise caution as the country battled the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic.Further, Kovind remembered India's first chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat who died along with 13 others in a plane crash last month near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu.Here's the full text of his speech:Dear Fellow Citizens!Namaskar!My heartiest greetings to all of you, in India and abroad, on the eve of the 73rd Republic Day! It is an occasion to celebrate what is common to us all, our Indian-ness. It was on this day in 1950 that this sacred essence of us all assumed a formal shape. That day, India was established as the largest democratic republic and ‘we the people’ put into effect a Constitution that is an inspired document of our collective vision. The diversity and vibrancy of our democracy is appreciated world-wide. It is this spirit of unity and of being one nation which is celebrated every year as Republic Day. This year’s celebrations may be muted due to the pandemic, but the spirit is as strong as ever.On this occasion, let us also remember the great freedom fighters who showed incomparable courage in their pursuit of the dream of Swaraj and fired up the people to fight for it. Two days ago, on 23rd January, all of us observed the one hundred twenty-fifth birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, who had adopted the energising salutation of ‘Jai-Hind’. His quest for independence and his ambition to make India proud inspire all of us.We are immensely fortunate that the Constituent Assembly which prepared the document included some of the best minds of their generation. They were the leading lights of our great Freedom Struggle. After long years, the soul of India was re-awakening, and these exceptional men and women were the harbingers of a new dawn. They discussed threadbare every Article, every phrase and every word, on behalf of the people. The churning went on for close to three years. Eventually, it was Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar who, as chairman of the drafting committee, prepared the final version that has become our founding document.While the text of the Constitution, dealing with the details of the workings of the State, is quite long, the Preamble sums up its guiding principles – Democracy, Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. They form the bedrock on which our Republic stands. These are the values that form our collective inheritance.These values have been accorded primacy in our Constitution in the form of Fundamental Rights and Fundamental Duties of the citizens. Rights and duties are two sides of the same coin. The observance of the Fundamental Duties mentioned in the Constitution by the citizens creates the proper environment for enjoyment of Fundamental Rights. By fulfilling the fundamental duty of rendering national service when called upon to do so, crores of our people have transformed the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and the COVID vaccination drive into mass movements. A great deal of credit for the success of such campaigns goes to our dutiful citizens. I am sure that our people will continue to strengthen the campaigns of national interest with their active participation and will demonstrate the same dedication.The Constitution of India was enacted and adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 26th November 1949, which we now celebrate as Constitution Day. But it was made effective two months later. This was done to mark that day in 1930 when India resolved to win complete freedom. From 1930 to 1947, every year 26th January was celebrated as ‘Purna Swaraj Day’, and that was the day chosen to put the Constitution into force.Writing in 1930, Mahatma Gandhi had advised fellow citizens how ‘Purna Swaraj Day’ was to be celebrated. He had said and I quote:“Remember that since we desire to attain our end by non-violent and truthful means only, we can do so only through self-purification. We should therefore devote the day to doing such constructive work as lies in our power to do.” [UNQUOTE]Needless to say, Gandhiji’s advice is timeless. He would have liked us to celebrate the Republic Day in the same manner. He wanted us to look inside, introspect and strive to become better human beings, and then also look outside, join hands with others, and contribute towards the making of a better India and a better world.Dear Fellow Citizens,The world has never been in so much need of help as now. It has been over two years now and humankind is still battling with the corona-virus. Hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost, and the world economy has been reeling under the impact. The world has suffered from unprecedented misery, and surge after surge of new variants have been posing new crises. It has been an extraordinary challenge to humankind.The pandemic management was bound to be all the more difficult in India. We have high population density, and as a developing economy we did not have the level of resources and infrastructure needed to battle this invisible enemy. But it is only in such difficult times that the resilience of a nation shines forth. I am proud to say that we have shown an unmatched resolve against the corona virus. In the first year itself, we raised the healthcare infrastructure and also reached out to help others. By the second year, we had developed indigenous vaccines and launched the world’s biggest vaccination drive in history. The vaccination drive is progressing at a quick pace in our country. During the pandemic, we have reached out to several other countries with vaccines and other medical help. This contribution by India has been appreciated by international organizations.There have been setbacks, unfortunately, as the virus makes a comeback with new mutations. Countless families have gone through a harrowing time. There are no words to express our collective trauma. The only saving grace is that many lives could be saved. As the pandemic is still wide-spread, we must remain alert and not let our guard down. The precautions we have taken till now have to be continued. Wearing mask and maintaining social distancing have been essential parts of COVID appropriate behaviour. In the fight against the COVID pandemic, it has now become a sacred national duty of every citizen to follow the precautions suggested by our scientists and experts. We have to discharge this duty till the crisis is behind us.A time of crisis has also made us appreciate how we all Indians are connected as one family. The time of social distancing has brought us close to each other. We have realised how much we depend on each other. Doctors, nurses and paramedics have risen to the challenge, working long hours in difficult conditions even at the risk of their lives to attend to patients. Others have kept the nation moving, managing supply chains and utilities. The leadership, policy-makers, administrators and others at the central and state levels have made timely interventions.Due to such interventions the economy is on the move again. It is a testimony to India’s spirit in the face of adversity that the economy is projected to grow at an impressive rate in this fiscal, after going through contraction last year. This shows the success of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan launched in the previous year. The government has shown relentless focus on reforming every economic sector and providing a helping hand wherever necessary. The impressive economic performance is made possible due to improvement in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors. I am happy to note that our farmers, especially young farmers with small holdings, are enthusiastically adopting natural farming.Small and medium enterprises have played an important role in providing employment to people and imparting impetus to the economy. Our innovative young entrepreneurs have set new benchmarks of success by making effective use of the start-up eco-system. It is a testimony to the success of our country's massive and robust digital payment platform that millions of digital transactions are being done every month.To reap the demographic dividend, the government has created the right environment with the National Education Policy that makes a perfect blend of traditional values and modern skills. It is gratifying to note that India has found a place among the top 50 innovative economies. It is all the more satisfying to note that we have been able to promote merit while also stressing upon all-round inclusion.Ladies and gentlemen,In the past year, our sports-persons also brought cheers as they made their mark at the Olympics. The self-confidence of these young champions inspires millions today.In the recent months, I have witnessed remarkable examples of our people strengthening the country and the society through their commitment and action in diverse areas. However, I will mention only two such instances. The dedicated teams of the Indian Navy and Cochin Shipyard Limited have built an indigenous state-of-the-art aircraft carrier IAC Vikrant which is to be inducted into our Navy. Due to such modern military capabilities, India is now counted among the world's leading naval powers. This is an impressive example of moving towards self-reliance in the field of defence. Apart from this, I found one special experience very touching. In a village called Sui in Bhiwani district of Haryana, some enlightened citizens who belong to that village have transformed the village under the 'Swa-Prerit Adarsh ​​Gram Yojana', demonstrating sensitivity and diligence. This example of expressing affection and gratitude for one’s village or native land is worth emulating. There remains life-long love and reverence for their native land in the hearts of grateful people. This example strengthens my belief that a new India is emerging – a Strong India and a Sensitive India; Sashakt Bharat, Samvedan-sheel Bharat. I am sure that taking inspiration from this example, other resourceful people will also contribute for the development of their villages and cities.In this context, I would like to share a personal experience with all of you. I had the privilege of visiting my birth-place, that is, my village Paraunkh at Kanpur Dehat district in the month of June last year. On reaching there, I naturally felt the urge to express respect for the sacred soil of my village and applied it on my forehead because I believe that I have been able to reach Rashtrapati Bhavan only due to the blessings of my village. Wherever in the world I may be, my village and my country remain in my heart. I request the people of India who are successful in life due to their hard work and talent, to always remember their roots, their village, town or city. Also, all of you must serve your place of birth and your country in whatever way you can. If all the successful people of India work sincerely for the development of their birth-places, then the whole country will benefit from the outcome of such local development.Dear Fellow Citizens,Today, it is our soldiers and security personnel who carry on the legacy of national pride. In the unbearable cold of the Himalayas and in the excruciating heat of the desert, far away from their families, they continue to guard the motherland. It is thanks to the constant vigil of the armed forces securing our borders and the police personnel maintaining internal security within the country that their fellow citizens enjoy peaceful life. When a brave soldier dies on duty, the entire country feels sad. Last month, in an unfortunate accident, we lost one of the bravest commanders of the country - General Bipin Rawat - his wife and many brave soldiers. The entire country was deeply saddened by the tragic loss.Ladies and gentlemen,Patriotism strengthens the sense of duty among citizens. Whether you are a doctor or a lawyer, a shopkeeper or office-worker, a sanitation employee or a labourer, doing one’s duty well and efficiently is the first and foremost contribution you make to the nation.As the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, I am glad to note that it has been a water-shed year for women empowerment in the Armed Forces. Our daughters have broken a glass ceiling, and permanent commission has now been allowed for women officers in new areas. Also, the talent pipeline for the forces will be strengthened with women coming through Sainik Schools and the prestigious National Defence Academy. Consequently, our Armed Forces will benefit from better gender balance.I am confident that India is better placed today to meet the challenges of the future. The twenty-first century is turning out to be the age of climate change, and India has taken a leadership position on the world stage in showing the way, especially with its bold and ambitious push for renewable energy. At the individual level, each one of us can remember Gandhiji’s advice and help improve the world around us. India has always considered the whole world as one family. I am sure that, inspired by this spirit of universal brother-hood, our country and the entire global community will move towards a more equitable and prosperous future.Dear Fellow Citizens,This year, India will cross a milestone when it completes 75 years of Independence. We are celebrating this occasion as ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’. It is heartening to note that our people, especially youngsters, are participating enthusiastically in a variety of events and programmes organised to commemorate the landmark year. It is a great opportunity for not only the next generation but all of us to re-connect with our past. Our freedom struggle was an inspiring chapter in our splendid saga. In this seventy-fifth year of Independence, let us re-discover the values that animated our glorious national movement. Many men and women laid down their lives for our freedom. Our freedom fighters have suffered un-imaginable torture and made countless sacrifices for us to enjoy the festivals of Independence Day and Republic Day. Let us gratefully recall their immortal sacrifices on the occasion of Republic Day.Ladies and gentlemen,India is an ancient civilisation but a young republic. For us, nation-building is a constant endeavour. As in a family, so in a nation; one generation works hard to ensure a better future for the next generation. When we won independence, the exploitation of colonial rule had left us in utter poverty, but in seventy-five years, we have made impressive progress. New opportunities await the next generation. Our youth have taken advantage of these opportunities and set new benchmarks of success. I am sure that with this energy, confidence and entrepreneurship, our country will continue to march ahead on the path of progress and will definitely secure its rightful place, befitting its potential, in the global community.I once again wish all of you a Happy Republic Day!Thank you,Jai Hind!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-kovind-addresses-nation-on-eve-of-73rd-republic-day-full-text-101643120477541.html

25-01-2022||India||Army has shared details of missing Arunachal teen with China: Kiren Rijiju||GUWAHATI: Union minister Kiren Rijiju on Tuesday said that the Indian Army has shared details of a missing teenager from Arunachal Pradesh with China to help establish his identity and ensure his safe return. Miram Taron, hailing from Zido village in Upper Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh, went missing from near the border with China on January 18 during a hunting trip. Following his disappearance, it was alleged that he was abducted by China’s Peoples’ Liberation Army (PLA) from inside the Indian territory. “To assist Chinese side in corroborating the identity, personal details and photo of the individual has been shared with the Chinese side by the Indian army. Response from the Chinese side is awaited,” the minister for law and justice, who is a Lok Sabha MP from Arunachal West seat, tweeted on Tuesday. Following Taron’s disappearance, which was informed to authorities by his friend (who was part of the hunting trip), BJP MP from Arunachal-East Tapir Gao tweeted saying the teenager was abducted by PLA from Indian side and urged authorities to take action for his safe return. “Some people reported that Chinese PLA had taken him (Taron) into their custody,” Rijiju tweeted on Tuesday without taking Gao’s name. On January 23, the Indian Army informed about the Chinese side confirming locating an Indian youth, whose identity was not established, on their side. But talking to HT the same day, Gao said that the youth located by the Chinese side was Taron. As earlier reported, as soon as news of Taron’s disappearance spread, the Indian Army got in touch with PLA and requested help to trace the teenager. On January 20, the Chinese side informed that they found a boy on their side and requested further details to establish his identity. “We are constantly following the case from day one. I appeal everyone to be cautious in making statements which are not based on facts because the safety and safe return of our young Arunachal Pradesh youth is the priority,” Rijiju said in his tweet.

Three of my security personnel were injured. I want a high-level probe into the incident,” said Jakir Hossain, minister of state for labour in the Mamata Banerjee-led government. The TMC legislator from Jangipur in Murshidabad suffered serious injuries when a bomb exploded on a railway platform at Nimtita station in the district on February 17, 2021. At least 26 others were injured. Hossain had gone to the station to board a train. Later the National Investigation Agency (NIA) started a probe into the incident. In August the central agency submitted its charge sheet. Two persons were named and charged under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and the Explosives Act. “I am going to inform the chief minister about today’s accident. I am not happy with the Nimtita probe,” he said. On Tuesday afternoon, around 1.30 pm, Hossain was returning home at Aurangabad from his rice mill. The pilot car of his convoy was hit by a pickup van on National Highway 34. “Hossain’s car was moving towards Berhampore from his factory at Raghunathganj. The car was about to take a U-turn to change lane when the front tyre of a SUV got punctured and it hit a pickup van. The pickup van in turn hit the pilot car of the minister’s convoy,” said Mantu Rahaman, a close aide of Hossain and a member of Murshidabad zilla parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/convoy-of-west-bengal-minister-who-earlier-survived-bomb-attack-hit-by-a-van-101643118337477.html

The DSLSA had recently moved the court seeking payment of the amount that was imposed on the plaintiffs on June 4 last year.The bench, comprising Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh, said they cannot propose to “waive off the costs” but can reduce it to ₹2 lakh. However, they placed a condition for the same. “Since your client is a celebrity, we would want her to do some good for society,” the bench said.The court said a programme can be conducted in which the DSLSA can contact the actor for featuring in it and “promoting the cause (5G matter).”Senior advocate Salman Khurshid, Chawla's counsel, later informed the bench that his client would be honoured to participate in such a programme and help the DSLSA for such a good cause. The matter was posted for further hearing for Thursday (January 27).Chawla and the two other petitioners had in December last year moved the high court with an appeal, challenging the dismissal of their lawsuit against the rolling out of 5G networks. They called the dismissal bad in law, citing that a suit can only be rejected once it has been permitted to be registered as a suit by the court. The petitioners also challenged the single-bench judge's earlier ruling that said the 5G lawsuit was filed only to gain publicity.Notably, in June last year, a single bench of Justice JR Midha dismissed the lawsuit and imposed ₹20 lakh cost on the petitioners, noting that they abused the process of law. It also stated that Chawla circulated the link of the hearing on social media, which led to disruption in court proceedings thrice during the particular day.The plea against 5G networks in India was moved in May last year. The Bollywood actor had virtually joined the court proceedings that took place during the second wave of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.In the plea, the petitioners sought directions to certify that 5G technology is safe for humans and all forms of living organisms and also asked for efficient research to be conducted on the issue, if not already done.After the plea was dismissed by the single-bench judge, Chawla had released a video clarifying that she is not against 5G technology, but was only seeking the government's stand on the same being safe.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-celebrity-client-do-some-good-hc-proposes-to-cut-juhi-chawla-s-5g-fine-101643111431746.html

25-01-2022||India||Kerala HC dismisses plea questioning Modi’s photo on Covid vaccine certificate||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala high court on Tuesday dismissed an appeal against a single bench order rejecting a petition questioning the photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Covid-19 vaccine certificates. The single-judge bench also slapped a fine of ₹1 lakh on the petitioner.A division of bench of Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly observed that the photo is not an advertisement and PM Modi has every right to give a message.In his petition, activist Peter Myaliparamphil challenged the inclusion of Modi’s photo on the certificates of those who paid for the vaccines. He argued the inclusion of the photo in the private certificate of an individual serves no public purpose or utility and violated the petitioner’s rights guaranteed in the Constitution.Myaliparamphil contended the messaging and campaigns, especially when they use government funds, should not personify a leader such as the Prime Minister as he is the leader of a political party as well. He added this will affect his independent choice of voting, which has been recognised as the essence of the electoral system.The bench rejected these contentions and agreed with the observation of the single bench that the Prime Minister has assumed the office in pursuant to the mandate of the citizens and once a person is appointed to the office, he ceases to be a leader of the party and is simply the Prime Minister. It also rejected the contention that the vaccine certificate may affect the petitioner’s right to vote.The bench informed the petitioner that a detailed judgment will be uploaded later. The petitioner moved the court in October questioning Modi’s photo on the vaccine certificates saying “it has no substance, utility or relevance”. He reiterated that the vaccine certificate was his private space and he has certain rights over it. Myaliparamphil said since he paid for the vaccine, the state cannot take undue credit for this. He pleaded that if the government insisted, there should be an option to issue certificates without the photo. Myaliparamphil pointed out that vaccination certificates of other countries do not have the images of their heads of the government. But the single bench rejected the plea on December 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modis-image-on-jab-certificates-hc-dismisses-appeal-against-order-rejecting-plea-for-its-removal-101643109735782.html

The actor was accused of obscenity and indecency after Hollywood star Richard Gere, a co-accused in this case, twirled Shetty in his arms, arched her over and planted three pecks on the cheek at an AIDS awarness event in Rajasthan. Metropolitan magistrate Ketaki M Chavan while discharging the actor observed that she was the victim of the alleged act of accused number 1,Richard Gere. “I pursued record, especially the complaint which has given rise to case in hand. On kind reading of said complaint, it seems that present accused i.e. Shilpa Shetty is the victim of alleged act of accused No 1. Not single element of any of the alleged offence is being satisfied in complaint,” said the magistrate. “Thus, after considering police report and documents sent with it under section 173 of CrPC, after giving the prosecution and accused an opportunity of being heard, I am satisfied that charge against present accused i.e. Shilpa Shetty is groundless,” the magistrate added. A complaint was filed before the judicial magistrate in Mundawar in Rajasthan seeking registration of offence against both the actors. Later a case was registered under sections 292, 293, 294 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for doing obscene acts in public and under the Information Technology act and Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986. The actor moved a petition to transfer all the cases registered against her to Mumbai which was allowed by the Supreme Court and all the complaints were transferred to Mumbai. Shetty filed discharge plea through her counsel, advocate Madhukar Dalvi. In her plea, the actor said that she did not protest when she was kissed by Richard Gere and this by no stretch of imagination made her a conspirator or perpetrator of any crime and therefore the complaint filed against her was baseless and frivolous. The judge accepted the actor’s contention and discharged her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-court-discharges-shilpa-shetty-in-2007-richard-gere-kissing-case-101643107398793.html
25-01-2022||India||Ordinance seeks to dilute Kerala Lokayukta’s powers, triggers row||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala government has sent for approval to governor Asif Mohammad Khan an ordinance, which seeks to empower the chief minister or the Cabinet as “competent authority” to either accept or reject verdicts of anti-corruption ombudsman Lokayukta by conducting a final hearing.The ordinance comes as the Lokayukta is probing three complaints against chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan for allegedly misusing funds meant for disaster relief. It has prompted an angry reaction from the Opposition parties, which asked Khan to refuse assent to the executive order seeking to clip Lokayukta’s wings.People aware of the matter said the executive order was approved at the last Cabinet meeting on Wednesday last and sent for approval discreetly two days back on Saturday. The government rushed with the ordinance as the state assembly is set to meet next month. Ordinances lapse if legislative bodies do not approve laws to replace them within six months.The ordinance, a person cited above said, says the “competent authority” can go through the verdict in detail and make a decision within three months of the verdict. It has been promulgated as Vijayan is accused of sanctioning lakhs of rupees to the families of former ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M) lawmaker K K Ramachandran, former Nationalist Congress Party leader Uzhavoor Vijayan and that of a gunman, who died while on security duty of the party’s state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan.Higher education minister K T Jaleel was earlier forced to resign last year after the Lokayukta found him guilty of nepotism. Jaleel was found to have lobbied for a relative to be appointed as the general manager of State Minority Welfare Corporation. He allegedly diluted some of the qualifications required for the post. Jaleel moved the high court but it refused to entertain his plea against Lokayukta’s ruling. Congress leader Ramesh Chennitahala last month moved the Lokayukta against Jaleel’s successor, R Bindhu, citing two letters she wrote to Khan recommending the reappointment of Kannur University vice-chancellor Gopinath Raveendran. Chennithala said Bindhu had no right to send such letters to Khan and that it was a clear case of nepotism and misuse of power.Chennitahala said the government was forced to take the shortcut and issue the ordinance in view of the pending decisions on some of the cases before the Lokayukta. “Three complaints against...Vijayan and one against higher education minister R Bindhu are pending (before Lokayukta). It is a naked violation of the rules to make the anti-corruption ombudsman toothless,” said Chennitahala.Former high court judge Kemal Pash called the ordinance a move to cripple the Lokayukta. “All democratic forces should oppose it.”State law minister P Rajeev justified the ordinance, saying it was long pending and the government moved as per the advice of the Advocate General. “Many states have brought amendments to the Lokayukta Act and in Kerala, this was not done. The latest move is aimed at bridging this gap,” he said.

The eruption of Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai volcano sent tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean and was heard 2,300 km away in New Zealand. According to NASA, the volcanic eruption was hundreds of times more powerful than the atomic bomb the US dropped on Hiroshima during World War 2. The tsunami impacted large sections of Tonga’s population and caused significant infrastructural damage. The death toll from the volcanic eruption and tsunami has risen to six, according to information provided by Tonga’s emergency department on Sunday. “As a close friend and partner under the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC) and as a gesture of solidarity with the friendly people of Tonga, Government of India extends an immediate relief assistance of US$ 200,000 to support relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts in the Kingdom of Tonga,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement. India also extended deep sympathy to the government and people of Tonga for the damage and destruction caused by the unprecedented disaster. “India has firmly stood by Tonga during times of crisis and devastation caused by natural disasters, as during Cyclone Gita in 2018. Disaster risk reduction and management is an important pillar of India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans’ Initiative (IPOI) announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November 2019,” the statement said. The volcanic eruption “obliterated” a volcanic island north of Tonga’s capital Nuku’alofa, NASA said. Authorities in Tonga said more than four-fifths of the population was affected by the tsunami and volcanic ash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-help-tsunami-hit-tonga-india-announces-immediate-aid-of-200000-101643100435306.html

25-01-2022||India||Covid-19: Indians set to benefit from changes to Britain’s travel rules||NEW DELHI: Indian nationals will benefit from changes announced by the UK to Covid-19 testing measures for travellers arriving in Britain from next month, including the removal of all tests for fully vaccinated arrivals. The changes will become effective from 4 am on February 11. All testing requirements will be removed for eligible fully vaccinated arrivals, and they will be required to fill a passenger locator form (PLF). The travellers who aren’t recognised as fully vaccinated will need to take a pre-departure test and a PCR test on or before the second day after their arrival in the UK. The changes in travel rules will be in place ahead of the February half term for educational institutions and follow the success of Britain’s booster programme, according to a statement from the UK government. “All testing measures for eligible fully vaccinated travellers arriving in the UK will be removed from 4 am on 11 February, as the government goes one step further to reopen the travel sector,” the statement said. The changes, announced on January 24, mean the UK “has one of the most free-flowing borders across Europe in addition to having the most open economy and society”, it added. The UK government said it was able to reduce the number of travel restrictions due to the success of the Covid-19 vaccine and booster rollout, “ensuring there is a more proportionate system in place for passengers”. Before the end of February, eligible fully vaccinated travellers will only need to fill the PLF, which will be simplified and will confirm their vaccination status, travel history and contact details. For inward travel, all under-18s, regardless of their individual vaccination status, will continue to be considered as fully vaccinated. The new framework aims to provide stability for travellers and the travel industry throughout 2022, and will result in savings of around £100 for an average family with the removal of testing. UK transport secretary Grant Shapps said: “We made the right calls at the right time and thanks to our vaccine and booster rollout it’s paying off – allowing us to safely remove nearly all Covid-19 travel restrictions for vaccinated travellers.” The UK will also scale back travel restrictions for unvaccinated arrivals. From February 11, individuals who aren’t fully vaccinated will only need to take a pre-departure test and a PCR test on or before the second day after they arrive in the UK, and fill out the PLF. They will not need to self-isolate on arrival, and will only need to do so on receipt of a positive result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-indians-set-to-benefit-from-changes-to-britain-s-travel-rules-101643096655007.html
25-01-2022||India||‘Focus on increasing voter turnout’: PM Modi’s message to parties, citizens||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday asked political parties and citizens to focus on increasing the voter turnout from panchayat to the general elections. “In the 75th year of India’s independence, we should resolve that we will ensure a 75% turnout for elections,” he said addressing ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers on the occasion of the National Voters’ Day. He urged the workers to ensure that the overall voter turnout in every election is at least 75%.Modi said the voting percentage since the first general election (45%) has gone up but is still low and needs attention from all political parties. He added in the last general election in 2019, the percentage went up to 67. “The percentage of women voters...has gone up. In some places, women outnumbered men in turning up for voting. But the voting percentage is still low and this needs everyone’s attention. All political parties and citizens need to think about this.”Modi expressed concern that in the urban areas, where people have better education and more resources, voter apathy continues and the voting percentage is low. “In urban areas... people discuss issues on social media, (but) still do not vote. This needs to change in a vibrant democracy like India.”Modi commended the Election Commission of India (ECI) for its initiatives to increase voter participation. He added the ECI made it possible for people to register as voters four times a year and made provisions for postal ballots for those above 80 and for people with disabilities.Also Read: PM Modi condoles loss of lives in Selsura road accidentModi referred to the idea of “one nation, one election”, which he supports, and added discussions on doing away with elections at frequent intervals should continue. He said in a democracy, discussion leads to churning. Modi said how repeated elections affect development needs to be debated. “ “Because of frequent elections, every move is seen through the political prism. For instance, today I wanted to reach out to the Panna Pramukhs (BJP’s workers in charge of each polling list page) and speak to party workers, but I noticed on social media some people commented that Modi is already thinking of elections.”Modi urged the BJP workers to ensure they remain connected with people and encourage them to participate in the party’s micro-donation exercise. He asked them to ensure participation in the government’s programme to weed out malnutrition.

25-01-2022||India||MP: Man beaten for travelling with Hindu woman booked under anti-conversion law||BHOPAL: A 26-year-old Muslim man was on Monday booked under Madhya Pradesh’s anti-conversation law 10 days after he was assaulted for travelling on a train with a Hindu woman in Ujjain. Arun Solanki, a local police officer, said the case was registered against Asif Sheikh, a resident of Indore, for extortion and allegedly forcing the 25-year-old woman from Mhow to marry him. He said Sheikh was booked on the woman’s complaint.In her complaint, the woman said Sheikh, a friend of her husband, would come to her house frequently, and a few months ago, clicked her “objectionable photos”. She alleged Sheikh threatened to defame her and was blackmailing her for money. Solanki said recently he allegedly started pressuring her for conversion for marriage. The woman claimed she was under pressure and was following what he was instructed her to do. She added the accused was “forcefully taking her to Ajmer” when some people stopped them. The woman said she got scared and did not file any complaint at Ujjain.Police said they were trying to arrest the accused, who was on January 14 dragged out of the train and thrashed at the Ujjain railway station for allegedly misguiding the woman, who is married and a mother of a child.Government railway police superintendent (Ujjain) Nivedita Gupta earlier said the man and woman were family friends. “The woman’s mother has confirmed the same. We allowed them to go.”Madhya Pradesh is among the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states, which have criminalised what they call forced religious conversion, including through interfaith marriages. Critics of the legislation say they are being misused to target Muslims and tend to infantilise women to prevent them from choosing who they wish to marry.Vigilante groups have targeted interfaith couples and the anti-conversion laws were passed after a campaign against “love jihad”, the term Hindu groups use to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women. The groups believe “love jihad” is an organised conspiracy of Muslim men to trick Hindu women into marriage.

The office of the commissioner of customs advised the public to not pay any amount in the name of customs to any person or private account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/impersonation-of-customs-officers-to-extort-money-customs-dept-warns-public-101643091374531.html
25-01-2022||India||No negative marking for failure in meeting timelines, says environment ministry||NEW DELHI: Days after it issued an office memorandum (OM) on incentives for states based on how quickly they accord environmental clearances to infrastructure and development projects, the Union environment ministry on Monday clarified there will be no negative marking for failure in meeting timelines.The ministry clarified State Environment Impact Assessment Authorities (SIAA) or expert appraisal panels have the freedom to do all necessary due diligence before making decisions on clearances. It added in case of a deficiency in project proposals, the authorities are free to ask for essential or additional details related to a project.The OM dated January 17 said the ministry has taken initiatives for streamlining the environmental clearance process and reducing the time taken to grant clearances. The average time taken to grant environmental clearance has reduced considerably to 75 days against the time stipulated in the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification, 2006, the OM said. It added the Cabinet Secretary cited “ease of doing business” and recommended a ranking of states based on efficiency in granting environmental clearances.Environmental and legal experts criticised the OM.In its clarification, the ministry said EIA reports are prepared as per prescribed terms of reference and projects are appraised based on the same. “Therefore, there is no question of EIA report quality being compromised due to ranking system, rather it would encourage the project proponent/ consultants to improve the EIA quality fearing the EDS/ADS or return of proposals.”The EIA notification of 2006 provides 105 days for granting environmental clearance, which includes 60 days for appraisal and 45 days for decision by the regulatory authority. This criterion was introduced to encourage efficiency and to abide by the timeline given in the notification. The ministry said marks will not be reduced for SEIAA, which takes decisions in over 120 days, but an extra mark will be granted in case a decision is made between 80-105 days. There is no negative marking proposed for not meeting the criteria, the clarification said.“The idea is to improve efficiency and ensure there is no wastage of time. State authorities are free to assess every project carefully,” an official said.Legal experts have said such a ranking system will water down the process of appraising projects and ensuring their ecological footprint is minimal.“State impact assessment and appraisal authorities are meant to foreground their scientific rigour and technical knowledge to appraise each proposal for its environmental viability and social legitimacy. These are complex subjects, requiring detailed deliberation and seeking clarifications from project proponents. This is especially because EIAs and related studies are designed to secure approvals and not truthfully represent project impacts. Incentivising quicker decisions needs to move away from looking environment clearances in the same vein as booking profits. A hasty appraisal and decisions, when crucial studies are pending, can be a matter of life and death for people living around facilities or working at a project site. It can also seriously put in question the economic futures of projects in case of industrial disasters,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.Ritwick Dutta, an environmental lawyer, cited the criteria and added a greater weightage was is given for projects where due diligence is less. “Thus, if SEIAA members conduct ‘site visits’ to ascertain the local conditions and ecology, marks are attributed for the same – and ironically the more the members visit the field to see the ecology less marks they get. Thus, if SEIAA members undertake sites to visit in less than 10% of the proposals that come to them for appraisal, they will be given one mark. However, if they do a site visit in more than 20%, SEIAA will get 0 marks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-negative-marking-for-failure-in-meeting-timelines-says-environment-ministry-101643090294415.html
25-01-2022||India||Family members claim the deceased in Naryanpur encounter was not a Maoist||RAIPUR: The family members of the suspected Maoist killed in an encounter with security personnel in Bastar’s Narayanpur district on Monday raised questions over the encounter and claimed that the deceased was not a Maoist. Police said the Maoist, Manu Ram Nureti, was killed in an encounter with security forces on Monday night. The brother of the killed Maoist, Renu Raam Nureti, who is presently in district reserve guard (DRG) of the Chhattisgarh police, talking to media persons in Narayanpur district, alleged that his brother was not a Maoist. Renu is a surrendered Maoist and was inducted in DRG in 2014 and is posted in Narayanpur district. “My brother was not a Maoist… He had also applied for recruitment in the police force recently… I will talk to my senior officials about why they are branding my brother as Maoist,” said Renu. On Monday morning, Superintendent of Police, Narayanpur, Girja Shankar Jaiswal said that the encounter took place at around 1 am. “A team of the district reserve guard (DRG) was out on a search operation when the encounter started. The encounter lasted for 20 minutes and after it stopped, the body of a Maoist and a muzzle loading gun were recovered from the spot,” the SP said, adding that a huge cache of Maoist-related items was also seized from the encounter site. The wife of the deceased also alleged that the theory of the police is false and her husband was out for hunting when he was killed. “At around 10 pm , my husband went outside with a slingshot for hunting birds ..He was wearing my sweater and also slippers but the body which the police are showing is with a uniform along with a muzzle rifle,” Manvati, the wife of the suspected Maoist said. Meanwhile, police denied the allegations. “The allegations that the encounter was fake are completely baseless. On Monday night, a team of DRG was sent for an area domination exercise and at around 1 am, Maoists opened fire on the DRG and the encounter started. On Monday morning, we recovered Bhanu Ram Nureti’s body. We have also recovered an arm and also Maoist related items from the spot,” said additional superintendent of police, Neeraj Chandrakar, answering the questions of media.

The pilots sought payment of the pending arrears or else they will initiate legal proceedings.In a letter dated January 24, the pilots said, “We appreciate that the company is attempting to settle the long overdue arrears; however, we are disappointed in the unprofessional manner the process is being carried out. Multiple deductions and recoveries have been projected in the arrears statement of many of our member pilots. We strongly protest against this illegal act.”The pilots said they should have been intimated about reasons rather than simply deducting their money. “The data on which the recovery is based has not been disclosed. This proves the ill intent of the management on the eve of handover. This recovery exercise is entirely illegal, and we demand that this anomaly is rectified and the amount due is repaid with immediate effect.”“Should the issue not be settled in a timely manner, then we would have no option but to seek legal recourse. This would cause an unnecessary burden on the new buyer post-handover,” said the letter, a copy of which HT has seen.Also Read: Air India’s handover to Tatas expected soon after Republic DayThe letter was written after an internal message sent to Air India employees said the closing balance sheet was to be submitted by the end of Monday before it is forwarded to the Tata Sons for review. The message said the airline is aiming the handover to Talace Pvt Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Sons, by Thursday.Talace Pvt Ltd will get 100% equity shares of Air India, Air India Express, and the government’s 50% stake in ground-handling company AISATS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-handover-air-india-pilots-seek-corrections-to-deductions-in-arrears-101643080394297.html

25-01-2022||India||Students protest against RRB results in Bihar, block railway tracks for 5 hours||Train services were affected in parts of Bihar on Monday after students, who appeared for Railway Recruitment Board's (RRB's) Non-Technical Popular Categories exam 2021, staged a protest at Rajendra Nagar Terminus in Patna and blocked railway tracks. The protesters were unhappy over the "inaccurate exam results".The results of the RRB Non-Technical Popular Categories (NTPC) for computer-based test (CBT) was released on January 15 for shortlisting the candidates for the CBT-2.The students were opposed to the government’s move to hold two exams.Patna district magistrate Dr Chandrashekhar Singh said that the protests hampered the train services for nearly five hours. He added that action will be taken against the culprits.“This is not the way to resolve any issue. We'll take action against the main culprits and register case against them,” said Dr Singh.East Central Railway’s (ECR) chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar said five trains originating from the station had to be canceled for the day because of the squatting on the tracks. These included the New Delhi-bound Tejas Rajdhani, Sampoorn Kranti Express and Mumbai-bound Lokmanya Tilak Terminus Express. Five other trains which pass through the station, had to be diverted.The district administration used “mild” force to disperse the protesters after efforts by Dr Singh and SSP Manavjeet Singh Dhillon to pacify the agitators yielded no results."An FIR has been registered in this connection. It is suspected that the protesters might have been instigated by those running coaching institutes for competitive exams. All those found complicit will face action," the district administration said in a release.The protesters were finally removed at 10.05pm.What the protesters are sayingThe protesters claimed that there was only one examination mentioned in the RRB notification issued in 2019. They accused the officials of playing with the future of the students.They alleged cheating by the RRB. The students gathered at the Rajendra Nagar Terminus in the afternoon and launched their protest.What the Railways ministry is sayingThe issue was highlighted when the results were declared on January 15. At that time, the Ministry of Railways issued a clarification in which it said that second stage exam was clearly mentioned in the notification."While the first stage CBT was a common examination for all the candidates, Para 13.2 of the notification clearly states that in the 2nd stage CBT there would be a separate examination for each group (viz., Levels 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) with differing graded levels of difficulty. Accordingly, all posts falling within the same level shall have a common 2nd stage CBT,” the ministry had said.If a candidate is eligible and has opted for more than one level (as per educational qualification), he/she will have to appear in the corresponding 2nd stage CBT for each level, it further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/students-protest-against-rrb-results-in-bihar-block-railway-tracks-for-5-hours-101643076195942.html

We can expect it from news channels. This doesn’t show the state in good light,” Bhushan told a bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and Dinesh Maheshwari.Bhushan was referring to the affidavit filed by the state last week in response to Hashmi’s plea alleging complicity and inaction of the state police in it.“It is very surprising to note that just few months back, a series of pre-poll and post-poll violence took place in West Bengal which were definitely wider in geography and very severe in magnitude. The so-called public spirit of the petitioners did not move few months back in a larger scale of communal violence and suddenly their public spirit aroused due to some instances in a small state like Tripura,” the state said.To this, Bhushan told the bench: “This reply does not state why the government did not carry out any investigation.”The top court bench allowed Bhushan to file his reply to the state’s affidavit by Thursday and agreed to hear the matter on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unbecoming-of-tripura-govt-to-indulge-in-whataboutery-sc-told-101643063537528.html

These were soldiers “who fought during World War 1 as part of the British Indian army to liberate this area that later became Israel”, he said.Gilon said Jews have lived “for over 2,000 years in India in total equality and peacefully”. He added, “And as someone who arrived [in India] after serving quite extensive periods in Europe, I was very much surprised to see how much love and appreciation there is in India towards Israel. There is another element – there is no anti-Semitism in India, this phrase just doesn’t exist.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/israeli-envoy-recalls-key-role-of-india-in-wwi-101643063289962.html
25-01-2022||India||Parliament to run in shifts for Budget session: Officials||Parliament will go back to working in shifts, with the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha functioning at different times of the day, and a highly dispersed seating arrangement in place for lawmakers during the Budget session starting on January 31, officials aware of the matter said on Monday.This will be second time, after 2021, that rising Covid-19 cases have caused the two Houses to function in a staggered manner during a Budget session, with the Upper House likely to work during the morning shift, and the Lower House to convene in the afternoons.According to a senior official, Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla spoke to each other and decided to implement a plan that was used during sessions held in 2020 and 2021.“For the Budget session, RS to meet first and LS later in the day, as was the case for 252nd session in 2020 and first half of budget session in 2021,” said a senior Rajya Sabha official aware of the matter, asking not to be named.Another functionary said that doubts remain if the session will run its scheduled course in the shadow of the third wave of Covid-19 cases, with several lawmakers and officials from both Houses affected. A third Parliament official said that elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, are another key factor that might result in a curtailed session.The Union Budget will be presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Lok Sabha at 11am on February 1. The Lower House will meet from 4pm-9pm every day. The timings of Rajya Sabha sessions are to be decided by chairman Venkaiah Naidu but officials said the House would meet for five hours in the first half of the day.The Budget session is perhaps the most crucial sitting of Parliament, and also its longest.“Our main target is to ensure lawmakers and other people who come to Parliament remain safe. So, to minimise the crowd and keeping in mind social distancing, we might opt for two different timetables for the two houses...” said a fourth functionary involved in the discussions.“In the monsoon session of 2020, we decided that the Rajya Sabha sits in the morning and the Lok Sabha in the afternoon...” he added.The same arrangement may be followed now, the official indicated.
25-01-2022||India||Ahead of Republic Day, BSF ups Indo-Pak border vigil amid high alert||Ahead of Republic Day celebrations and amid intelligence inputs of possible strikes by rogue elements from Pakistan, the Border Security Force (BSF) has put its troops on a high alert on and along the Indo-Pak international border and the Line of Control (LoC), said officials on Monday.BSF Jammu Frontier IG, DK Boora said, “Keeping in view the forthcoming Republic Day and security situation to deal with any nefarious attempt of anti-national elements from across the border, troops of the BSF Jammu frontier have been on high alert since last week.”He confirmed that the intel agencies have alerted the forces of attempts by the anti-national elements to try and disrupt R-Day celebrations.“Keeping in mind the present security scenario and intelligence inputs on the eve of Republic Day, the BSF, Jammu, has been on high alert on Jammu, the IB and the LoC. The BSF is carrying out extensive anti-tunnelling drive, special patrolling and depth area domination despite extremely hostile weather conditions,” said the BSF IG. “To strengthen the border domination, mobilisation of troops have been done. Regular monitoring of suspicious activities of counterpart is being carried out through surveillance equipment,” he added.He informed that the joint patrolling exercises are also being conducted along with Army, CRPF and state police to pre-empt any nefarious attempts of the enemy.“The BSF troops deployed on the Jammu International Border have been quite successful and consistent in foiling attempts from across the border by eliminating Pakistani intruders, seizing huge caches of arms and ammunition, narcotics and detecting tunnels in the past one year,” he said Boora also informed that drone activities by Pakistan have also decreased for the past quite some time but the BSF was 24x7 vigil on the border.“With anti-drone technology and a slew of other measures, the drone activities by Pakistan have reduced for the past quite some time,” he said.Boora also informed that in absence of any foolproof anti-tunneling technology, the BSF was still relying on physical domination and using tractors and other heavy machines to dig the ground and check the IB for trans-border tunnels.Since 2013 Pakistan had been digging such tunnels in the plains of Jammu to push armed terrorists for staging terror attacks.CIBMS, including smart fence, being extended on entire IBThe IG said that the Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS), including smart fence (also called laser fence), was continually being extended on the 200-km-long International Border in the Jammu region.When asked whether Israel’s technology has also gone into it, the IG said, “Now the focus is more on indigenous technology and we are constantly improving and upgrading the CIBMS. Entire IB is being fortified with the technological advancements but it is always the man behind the machine, who matters.”India had successfully launched two pilot projects of laser fence on the IB in 2018.On laser fencing the then DG BSF SS Deswal on August 16 last year had said that part of the CIBMS, two pilot projects were launched in Jammu and Kashmir and they are under action. Defence minister Rajnath Singh in the capacity of home minister had inaugurated a stretch of laser fence in September 2018.The pilot project meant to provide round-the-clock surveillance on the border uses thermal imagers underground sensors, fibre optical sensors, radar and sonar technologies to make “vulnerable stretches of the IB foolproof”.The IG also informed that work on ditch-cum-bundh (DCB) to fortify the entire international border was being carried out in a phased manner.“The land is being acquired and the work is also being carried out in phases. The basic idea is to fortify our border,” he said.R-Day full dress rehearsal held across Jammu division districts Impressive parades and colourful programmes depicting rich culture and heritage of India and Jammu Kashmir marked the Republic Day 2022 Full Dress Rehearsal across the all the 10 districts of Jammu region on Monday.

Here, the dignity of a woman is at stake. There are family issues. There would be several considerations which would weigh with the government to take a position to assist your lordships. This would also perhaps need consultations with other stakeholders,” Mehta said.The SG also said it will not be possible for the Union government to respond immediately on the issue, particularly when there is no imminent threat to someone. He sought 10 days to have a detailed consultation with stakeholders and place the government stand before the court.“I feel I would be doing an injustice to the citizens of India if I put the reply in a half-hearted way,” the SG submitted.The court, however, said the issue of criminalising marital rape is not going to end in the high court and whichever party felt aggrieved by its judgment, will challenge it in a superior court.“...come back to me in 10 days. I know you can if you want. Beyond that, it would become difficult for me,” the court said.Exception of Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) decriminalises marital rape and mandates that sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15, is not rape.On Monday, senior advocate Rebecca John, the amicus curiae in the matter, completed her arguments. She submitted that 498A (domestic violence) cannot be a substitute for 375 (2) as it is a different offence.While concluding her arguments, John said she received a “lot of hate mail” in connection with the case and was even asked to recuse from the matter because she has an opinion on the subject.To this, the court said that if having a view was a ground for recusal, then judges would have to recuse themselves from every case. The hearing will continue on Tuesday.
25-01-2022||India||In rebuttal to Gadkari, Stalin says TN prioritises NHAI projects||Amid the Tamil Nadu government feeling snubbed after the union government rejected the state’s tableau for the Republic Day parade, came another blow from union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari who complained that they were facing several bottlenecks to move projects in the state.On Monday, chief minister MK Stalin responded to him taking a defensive position that many of the current issues causing project delays are from the past decade during the AIADMK’s regime but he assured to cooperate.Gadkari was speaking at The Hindu’s Business Line Countdown to Budget 2022 last week when he said, “my problem is with Tamil Nadu” and sought the state’s cooperation making a comparison with Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan whom he said was proactive despite some issues.In a detailed reply, Stalin says a team to specifically look into National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) projects is meeting every fortnight and that they are putting their best efforts to sort them out at the earliest. “Considering the efforts taken by the state government and the resultant progress in the field, your statement made during the above-mentioned event has been a bit surprising to me,” Stalin said in the letter.He recalled that he had given a detailed reply on the action taken when Gakari had written to him on these issues in the past. “After my government took over, NHAI projects have been given very high importance by us,” he said. “We fully realise the significance of road connectivity for an industrialized state like us and hence I have given specific instructions to all departments to give top priority to NHAI projects.”The DMK government took over in May after a decade of AIADMK rule.Stalin said he held a review meeting and as a follow up, the minister for public works (EV Velu) has so far conducted four meetings with all the departments concerned with the NHAI projects. He said the chief secretary and the principal secretary, highways and minor ports department have conducted 13 different meetings on the same matters along with the district collectors and line departments along with NHAI officials. Overall, there has been a high-level meeting for NHAI projects every fortnight during the last six months.Stalin said the public works minister had met Gadkari in Delhi on October 12 last year to brief him on the steps that are being taken for speedy implementation of NHAI projects. Following that minister Velu had convened a joint meeting on December 16 last year with officials from the state and general manager of NHAI from Delhi.“All the issues and action taken on them were discussed during this full day meeting and it was noted that about 80% of the NHAI issues have been resolved,” Stalin said. Taking up specific projects such as Vikaravandi – Kumbakonam – Thanjavur Road and Melur – Karaikudi Road, Stalin said that they have been resolved with specific interventions by the state government. “The above position may also kindly be verified with the NHAI team in Tamil Nadu,” he said.The chief minister also blamed the NHAI for causing certain delays. For instance, he said the system of approval of land valuation for land acquisition under the National Highways Act needs to be streamlined. “In some cases, NHAI has not agreed to valuation fixed by the Competent Authority for Land Acquisition (CALA) or the arbitration awards given by the district collectors, putting the process in limbo,” he said.He said applications for borrow earth permission were not scrutinised properly and were being given without necessary documents in place and some sites aren’t feasible as there is water stagnation. However, Stalin said that as requested by the NHAI, steps are being taken to amend the Mining Rules to give borrow earth permits for longer periods in government lands.As of now, they are currently being given for three months since Tamil Nadu had two spells of monsoon and generally tanks/ponds are under water for six months. For private lands, the permission already is being given for nine months or more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-rebuttal-to-gadkari-stalin-says-tn-prioritises-nhai-projects-101643053091439.html
25-01-2022||India||AP employees reject govt’s talk offer on pay revision||Rejecting a reconciliatory gesture from the Andhra Pradesh government for negotiations on the contentious pay revision issue, the state employees’ unions on Monday served a strike notice with effect from February 7.The employees’ unions, which have formed a joint action committee “PRC Sadhana Samithi” (committee to achieve pay revision), issued a notice to Principal Secretary (General Administration Department) Shashi Bhushan, stating the employees would be going on an indefinite strike from the midnight of February 6.“The pay revision announced by the state government would cause immense loss to the employees. We are not going to accept it. For the first time, all sections of employees, including teachers, secretariat staff, non-muster roll (NMR) staff, public transport employees and of all the other departments would stall the work,” joint action committee chairman Bandi Srinivas Rao said after serving the strike notice.In the morning, a five-member committee of ministers and officials constituted by the government invited the employees’ union leaders for fresh negotiations on the pay revision issue. The committee members waited at the secretariat for talks, but the union leaders did not turn up.“We made an effort to talk to the employees’ representatives and explain them the factual position to remove their apprehensions. But they were firm on their stand saying there would be no negotiations unless the government revokes the orders on the pay revision. We shall wait for talks on Tuesday as well and are hopeful of settling the dispute,” said state government advisor (public affairs) Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy.Meanwhile, a single judge bench of the state high court refused to hear the petition filed by a section of the employees, challenging the pay revision announced by the state government.The judge, which took up the petition in the morning, referred it to Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra, stating that it involved larger public interest litigation.State advocate general Subrahmanyam Sriram said the government had all the rights to fix the pay hike based on so many considerations. He argued that various allowances such as house rent allowance (HRA) and city compensatory allowance (CCA) cannot be taken into consideration for working out the gross package. He said the policy of enhancing the retirement age, increasing the gratuity amounts to pensioners, 20 percent rebate in the plots etc, ought to be seen as a holistic view of the government.The advocate general further argued that the notice for indefinite strike was impermissible in law, as strike is prohibited. “The government employment is a status and not a contract and therefore the government servants do not have option of keeping the sword of strike hanging over the head of the government, that too in Covid-19 times,” he said.The employees’ unions are upset with the state government for launching a campaign in the social media as well as through pamphlets, justifying the pay revision and projecting the agitating staff in bad light.“The state government has been circulating messages in WhatsApp groups and other forms of social media to all sections of people, stating that our demands are just and projecting us as greedy. The government is also using the services of village and ward volunteers to circulate pamphlets against the striking employees. We shall effectively counter the government arguments,” a JAC leader asserted.
25-01-2022||India||KCR writes to Modi against IAS rule change||Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday expressed his strong protest against the proposed amendments to the All India Services (Cadre) Rules, 1954, by the central government, seeking to acquire overriding powers to transfer IAS and IPS officers through central deputation and doing away with the requirement of taking the approval of the state governments.The department of personnel and training (DoPT) wrote to the states on January 12 that the central government proposes to amend Rule 6 (deputation of cadre officers) of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules 1954.So far, 10 opposition party chief ministers have opposed the proposed amendment to the rules, even though the central government has said the change was proposed to meet shortage of officials in central department and ministries.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Telangana chief minister said the proposed amendments were totally against the federal structure of the Indian Constitution, both in letter and spirit. “They will also seriously erode the all-India service character of IAS, IPS and IFS. We, therefore, strongly oppose the proposed amendments,” he said.KCR, as the chief minister is called, said considering the criticality of functions discharged by AIS officers in the states, the present rule position and practice provides for concurrence of state governments in matter of deputation of officers to the central government.He said the central government assuming the power to take officers on deputation without concurrence of the officers or state government concerned was a dangerous move which is against the constitutional framework and spirit of cooperative federalism.“If the proposed amendments are effected by the Centre, the state governments would be reduced to be insignificant entities,” he said.Stating that the proposal is clearly a move to exercise indirect control by the Central government on officers working in the States, the chief minister said it amounted to interfering in the functioning of the State governments, targeted harassment of officers and their demoralisation, besides impacting accountability of officers to the State governments.KCR said the amendments were nothing but amending the Constitution of India relating to the Centre-State relations. “Instead of such a backdoor method of amending the AIS Rules, Govt. of India should muster courage to amend the provisions by the Parliament,” he said.He further said the proposal showed scant regard to the administrative exigencies and requirements of the States. They threaten the spirit of mutual adjustment and accommodation between states and central governments in the matter of shared All-India Services and will further strain the Centre-State relationship.“I demand that the Centre cease and desist from the proposed amendments in the interest of administrative fairness and federal polity of our constitution,” KCR added.
25-01-2022||India||TN girl suicide: HC asks man who shot video to submit phone to police||The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Monday directed the man who recorded the video of a 16-year-old girl, who later committed suicide, to appear before the investigating officer and hand over his mobile phone for forensic examination.While Thanjavur police were investigating the girl student’s suicide, a video purportedly recorded just before her death emerged, in which she says that her school warden urged her parents to convert her into Christianity two years ago with the promise of a free education. A man recording the video asks her if the warden has harassed her because she refused to convert, the girl responds, “Could be.” Since then the BJP and Hindu outfits have held statewide protests seeking justice for her through a CBI probe and for action to be taken against forced religious conversions. The girl’s father on Friday moved the Madurai bench of the Madras high court seeking a CB-CID probe. Justice G R Swaminathan said in his orders that the father (petitioner) and mother of the deceased girl have confirmed the attempt to convert. The investigation officer also confirmed to the court that the video that has been circulated in the social media is in the voice of the deceased. “In other words, the authenticity of the video is beyond dispute. However, this confirmation is not sufficient,” the court said. “An appropriate forensic analysis will have to be made. Therefore, the original mobile phone from which the video was recorded is required.” The parents and the man who recorded the video have been asked to appear before the investigation officer on Tuesday. The court has directed the Tamil Nadu Forensic Science Lab in Chennai to give a report on the materials of the case by January 27. The case been posted to January 28 for the next hearing. On Monday, school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi told reporters in Chennai that they have conducted a departmental enquiry of students and alumni of the school to which the girl belonged. Their statements have been handed over to the police. “We do not want any religious, caste and political bias in our schools,” he said. The minister said that though the school is run by Christians, it has more of Hindu students. The school’s hostel warden was last week arrested on charges of abetment to suicide for harassing the girl. “Several times this warden has paid for her school fees when her parents were not able to meet the expenses. But no matter what she has done, given that she caused distress to this child, we have taken action against her,” Poyyamozhi said. “Going and taking that video and provoking the child was wrong. Please do not politicise this. We will investigate this and without any bias we will take action.” Amidst this issue, a church in Coimbatore was vandalised by unidentified people and police are conducting an inquiry. The BJP held an internal meeting on Monday in Chennai following which its former national secretary H Raja said the deceased child had scored 489 out of 500 in her class 10 board examination. “So they (school) have gone to their house thrice and tried to brainwash them that if she converts she will get a free education and that they can train her to be a nun,” Raja said. “But the student stayed strong so they made her clean toilets and classrooms. So the girl died by suicide.” The BJP blamed the ruling DMK government for such instances in the state and demanded the suspension of Thanjavur superintendent of police Ravali Priya Gandhapuneni for saying that the parents had not mentioned troubles of religious conversion in their first complaint. “The only solution to this is bringing an anti-conversion law.” Congress leader and commissioner of TN’s minority commission Peter Alphonse released a statement, dismissing allegations of religious conversion. “Of the approximately 1,000 students currently studying (in the same school), 70% are Hindus, 5% are Muslim and 25% are Christians,” he said. “Hindu teachers also work in the school. Conversion that has not happened in three centuries (in this school) will take place now? Tamil Nadu will not allow hate politics as the state is known for social unity and religious harmony.” The police had earlier said that the child’s dying declaration has been recorded by the judicial magistrate and that they cannot consider the unverified video as a dying declaration but they are proceeding with investigations considering the content in the video. 
25-01-2022||India||Court asks CBI to file reply on Indrani’s plea claiming Sheena is alive||Mumbai: A special court on Monday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to reply by February 4 to a plea filed by Indrani Mukerjea, seeking probe into her claim that her daughter Sheena Bora is alive.Indrani has also sought to know the steps taken on her application addressed to CBI director Subodh Kumar Jaiswal in November 2021 requesting the agency to investigate this aspect.Indrani is being prosecuted along with three others for allegedly killing Sheena Bora.Special CBI judge AS Sayyad asked special public prosecutor Manoj Chaladan to file a reply and adjourned the matter for further hearing.Indrani moved the plea through her counsel Sana Raees Khan after she failed to get any reply from CBI on her application. Indrani, 49, said she had met an inmate of Byculla jail on November 25, police officer Asha Korke, arrested in an extortion case.She said the officer told her in Byculla Women’s Prison, where she is lodged, that she had met Sheena on June 21, 2021, near Dal Lake, while she was vacationing in Srinagar.According to Indrani, Korke had told her that she saw a woman similar to Sheena. When she addressed her as “Sheena”, she asked how she knew her. After Korke said she was a police officer, Sheena asked if she had come to arrest her. Korke said Sheena should go to Mumbai as her mother was arrested for killing her. Sheena responded, “I have started my new life and do not wish to return to my old life anymore.” She later left on a bike with a person who looked like a foreigner.Indrani has said in her plea, “Overcoming strong emotions, I relooked at certain compelling evidence that had come on record during the course of trial which had given us every reason to believe that my daughter was ‘definitely alive’ after the alleged day of murder on April 24, 2012. The same can be elaborated and explained if this court directs us to do so for the purpose of understanding the facts.”CBI officials had then told HT that they were not taking the application seriously as they had ample evidence to prove that Sheena was killed.“The DNA analysis of recovered femur bones and cervical bones exhumed in 2015, when the case came to light, concluded that Indrani was the biological mother of the dead woman,” a CBI officer said.The trial in the case started on February 24, 2017, and is at an advanced stage. Several prosecution witnesses have already been examined. The court has taken cognisance of the CBI charge sheet. The forensic superimposition of the recovered skull has matched with the face of Sheena.According to the police, Indrani and her ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna strangulated 25-year-old Sheena, Indrani’s daughter from her previous relationship, on April 24, 2012, in a car in Mumbai. The following day, they disposed of the body in a forest area in Gagode village of Raigad district.The murder came to light after Khar police arrested Shyamvar Rai, Indrani’s former driver, in another case in August 2015. Indrani was arrested on August 25, followed by Khanna’s arrest. Peter Mukerjea was arrested on November 19, 2015, after the case was transferred to CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-asks-cbi-to-file-reply-on-indrani-s-plea-claiming-sheena-is-alive-101643052553036.html
25-01-2022||India||Solar case defamation suit: Achuthanandan ordered to pay ₹10.10 lakh damages to Chandy||A court in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday ordered former chief minister and CPI(M) leader V S Achuthanandan to pay ₹10.10 lakh to Oommen Chandy, former CM and senior Congress leader, in a defamation suit filed in connection with the solar scam case. In an interview to a news channel in July 2013, Achuthanandan, then the opposition leader, alleged that CM Chandy was behind the fictitious solar firm and that he knew about the cheating case. He also alleged that Chandy had accepted a portion of the commission from the main accused, Saritha S Nair, for the help given to her. Chandy filed a defamation suit in 2014, saying that the grave charges invited embarrassment to him and sullied his image. He first sought damages of ₹1 crore but later reduced it to ₹10.10 lakh. The principal sub-court found his contention right and ordered Achuthanandan to pay damage with 6 per cent interest and with court fees. In 2019, Chandy appeared before the court in person to explain his position. Though the counsel for Achuthanandan repeated the allegation, he failed to substantiate charges with evidence, the court found. “These charges were made without any basis and they intended to sully his image, so the petitioner has every right to claim damage,” said the court. Chandy has hailed the verdict, saying truth will prevail always. “Many hands and conscience are clear. The CPI(M) cooked up stories after stories to portray me in bad light. I was sure truth will prevail,” said Chandy, who is a general secretary of the AICC. The counsel for Achuthanandan said he will move an appeal in a higher court soon. Achuthanandan is undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at a private hospital in the state capital. The solar cheating case relates to an alleged con woman, Saritha Nair, and her second husband Biju Radhakrishnan, who floated a company called ‘Team Solar’ in 2013 and cheated many promising them stakes in the firm and good returns after selling imported solar panels. They allegedly cultivated good contacts in corridors of power and flaunted them to attract investors. Radhakrishnan was later convicted in a murder case. The cheating incident surfaced in 2014 and 60 cases were registered against the two. Then CM Chandy had sacked two of his private secretaries and the state public relations director when their names allegedly cropped up in the case. Later the main accused Nair had raised sexual assault charges against many Congress leaders, including Chandy, K C Venugopal, Adoor Prakash MP, A P Anil Kumar, Hibi Eden MP and Abdullha Kutty. Later the government had constituted a judicial commission. The case was one of the reasons for the Congress’s drubbing in 2016 assembly elections. In her complaint, Nair alleged that she was subjected to sexual abuse by the accused in return of favours granted to her. Later, the judicial commission also recommended a probe into sexual assault charges. Saritha Nair is in judicial custody now in connection with another cheating case. She was convicted in seven cases related to solar cheating case, but out on bail, she allegedly cheated some people promising them government jobs. She also tried to contest against Rahul Gandhi in Wayanad but her papers were rejected. Later the Supreme Court had slapped a fine on her when she approached it. The solar scam case was handed over to the CBI last year after Nair had petitioned the CM complaining that she was yet to get justice in sexual assault cases and sought a central agency probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/solar-case-defamation-suit-achuthanandan-ordered-to-pay-10-10-lakh-damages-to-chandy-101643052551384.html
25-01-2022||India||Andhra cop suspended for ‘torturing’ Dalit woman in custody||Hyderabad A police constable was suspended on Monday for allegedly torturing a Dalit woman in custody in connection with a theft in Andhra Pradesh’s Chittoor town five days ago. The constable, V Suresh Babu of Chittoor Town-1 police station, has been suspended on charges of manhandling a woman in the theft case, pending further inquiry, S Senthil Kumar, deputy inspector general of police, said in a statement. Giving details about the case, Kumar said the Chittoor Town-1 police registered a case against a 34-year-old woman, M Uma Maheshwari, following a complaint from Chittoor district superintendent of prisons Venugopal Reddy on January 19. The woman, who was a domestic worker at the residence of Reddy, was booked under Section 381 (theft in the house of the employer) of the Indian Penal Code. On January 22, the woman told reporters that she was tortured in custody. Kumar ordered a probe soon after the allegation. “Based on the complaint, the constable has been suspended. We have asked additional superintendent of police (admin) DN Mahesh to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into the incident,” Kumar said, adding that further action will be taken after obtaining the report. Earlier, a video of the Dalit woman, a resident of Lakshminagar Colony in Chittoor town, went viral on social media. In the video, the woman, showing injuries on her body, alleged that she was beaten up while in custody. The woman can be seen sitting on steps, unable to walk to an auto-rickshaw. A man and a woman take her towards the vehicle. HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video. She told reporters that the superintendent of prisons had alleged that she had stolen ₹2 lakh from his house and handed her and her husband to police. “Police beat me indiscriminately and brought pressure on me to admit the theft. They abused me in filthy language. They did not allow me to return home till late in the night,” she said. Telugu Desam Party (TDP) politburo member Varla Ramaiah on Monday lodged a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to probe into the alleged custodial torture of the Dalit woman. Ramaiah also urged the chairperson of National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) to investigate and take deterrent action against the persons responsible for the illegal detention of Maheshwari. In separate letters to the chairpersons of NHRC and NCSC, Ramaiah claimed Andhra Pradesh has been witnessing illegal detentions, house arrests, false cases, midnight arrests, custodial torture, and police harassment. He further claimed that somebody known to the superintendent of prisons had taken the amount but the case was booked against the Dalit woman. “The police have completely ignored not only the principles of human rights, but also went against the judgments of the Supreme Court with regard to arrests and custodial torture,” he alleged.
25-01-2022||India||Jharkhand: 17 arrested over ‘Kolhan Estate’ recruitment, attack on police||Jharkhand police on Monday arrested 17 persons for allegedly recruiting people for the “Kolhan Government Estate” to establish self-rule under the British-era Wilkinson rule, and for attacking the Chaibasa police station on Sunday.The police resorted to a lathi charge and tear gassed a mob armed with bows and swords that pelted stones, protesting police action that, on Sunday, sought to stop them from recruiting people for the Kolhan Estate. Kolhan means home of the coal people.At least 10 policemen and one civilian were injured in incident; police constable Brijmohan Mishra was hit in the stomach by an arrow. Those arrested have been booked under several sections of the Indian Penal Code, including sedition, Chaibasa’s deputy superintendent of police Dilip Khalko said.“In total, 17 persons have been arrested till now. Eight among them, including one of the main conspirators of the recruitment drive, Ajay Padeya, were arrested from Ladrubasa village, where the recruitment was being done, while another nine persons have been arrested for being involved in arson and violence near the police station,” said Khalko.Preliminary investigations have revealed that Padeya, a deserter from Central Reserve Police Force’s Cobra Battalion posted in Latehar, and Anand Chatar, who recently came out of jail, have emerged as the main conspirators in the recruitment drive in the name of Kolhan Goverment Estate under the Wilkinson Rule of 1837, Khalko said.The Kol rebellion took place in the area in 1832 against high rent and usurpation of land by outsiders. The then British agent, Thomas Wilkinson, decided to declare the Kolhan region as “Kolhan Separate Estate” with headquarters in Chaibasa, and implemented the Wilkinson Rule in 1837.Under the arrangement, a quasi-police forum of Mankis at the panchayat level and quasi-judicial and revenue collection forum of Mundas at the village level were created. Until 1947, Mankis looked after a group of villages, both in terms of civil, petty criminal cases and land settlement matters, and Mundas collected tax as decided by local villagers in consultation with the British representative.According to proponents of the separate Kolhan Estatate, since no explicit legislation in Parliament has scrapped, amended or modified the Wilkinson Rule, the Manki-Munda system is still in place in the Kolhan region, comprising West Singhbhum, East Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan districts, bordering Odisha and West Bengal in southern Jharkhand.While the incident turned violent on Saturday following the police crackdown at the ongoing recruitment camp in Ladrubasa village under town police station limits, such hiring has reportedly been going on in the area for the past few months.Chatar and Padey were leading this drive, inviting applications and issuing appointment letters for policemen and teachers.The move for a Kolhan Estate revived in 2017, when Ramo Birua, a 83-year-old resident of Bhagabila village in Chaibasa, had issued a call to hoist the flag for a separate Kolhan Estate.A former block development officer, Birua retired as additional district magistrate in undivided Bihar. He began issuing certificates like for caste, income and age, under the letterhead of Kolhan Estate Government. Birua claimed that it was a separate estate and only he could be appointed its Khewatdar No. 1 (main revenue collector).Birua was booked for sedition and arrested by police and subsequently died in jail. Chatar, who is reportedly the brain behind the fresh recruitment drive for Kolhan Estate, was also booked along with Birua. He recently came out of prison and has reportedly been promoting himself as the Khewatdar No. 1, as appointed by Birua in jail before he died.Though the police cracked down on Saturday, questions are being raised at the lax approach of the district civil and police administration for allowing the group to function.The Hindustan Times has reviewed pictures of applications and appointment letters dated November 2021. Applicants were reportedly being asked to submit ₹50 as application fee and ₹500 against the appointment letters, with a promise that they could join six months later.A picture of Chaibasa Sadar circle officer Gopi Oraon allegedly handing over appointment letters at recruitment camp in the village is also doing the rounds. Oraon clarified that he visited the village to conduct an inquiry and was not part of any recruitment drive.“I don’t know what happened on Sunday as I am on leave. On Friday, I had gone to the village on instruction from Sadar SDO (subdivisional officer) to conduct an inquiry about an alleged recruitment drive. When I went there, I could not meet the organisers. However, the applicants present there told me that they were applying for recruitment for Kolhan police and school teachers. They said they have been promised that the salary would be paid to them from the Kolhan Fund of the administration. Some of them also submitted few letters to me. Someone might have clicked a picture of that,” said Oroan.Police received no prior official complaint against the recruitment drive, Khalko said.Rights activists demanded action against people taking advantage of the traditional laws by misinterpreting them, and said the government’s failure to implement Panchayat Extension of Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act is also adding to the confusion.“The (PESA) Act was made in the mid 1990s but no government has dared to implement it, which would promote the customary local governance system at the panchayat level,” said Siraj Dutta of Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha, a civil rights organisation. “Many a time, vested groups take advantage in misinterpreting and fooling innocent tribals, who later end up being a harassed by the administration.”

The activist underwent the surgery at a private hospital in Ernakulam in 2020. According to those close to her, she approached the same hospital with post-surgery complications but received no treatment. They said the severe physical discomfort she was facing led her to die by suicide. Three days after the incident, her male partner was also found dead in Kochi.On Monday, the government directed the additional director of health to make a detailed inquiry and submit a report in a month’s time. The government announced its decision in a circular.The private hospital said it will co-operative with the probe. “We have inquired about the incident when allegations cropped up last year. We found all procedures and formalities were met during the operation and she was also given enough counselling. Let the government probe it again,” said a hospital spokesman. Days before the activist’s death, she posted a message in social media about her “botched operation and how painful after-effects immobilised her”. LGBTQIA+ activists and members have been seeking a probe into the deaths. “There is no uniform protocol in sex re-assignment surgeries and LGBTQ community members often end up in traps set up by private hospitals. We need ethical committees to end this exploitation. We need a proper protocol, standard and treatment methodology,” said Syama S Prabha, state transgender justice board member. Activists say Section 15 of the Transgender Act stipulates that the government provide various health care facilities for transgender people such as sex re-assignment surgeries, hormonal therapy and treatment and separate sero surveillance centres but that the implementation is lethargic and abysmal. “Hospitals need qualified healthcare professionals associated with sex re-assignment surgery equipped with queer affirmative surgical and counselling practices. We need a health manual guided by world professional association for transgender health guidelines,” said activist Renju who used only one name. Renju added that many private hospitals view such surgeries as a money-making exercise. Kerala was the first state to formulate a transgender policy in 2015 aimed at ending discrimination against members of the community. In 2017, it also set up a transgender justice board to deal with their complaints and a separate column called “third sex” was introduced in birth and death registration forms in the state. It was also made mandatory for all government buildings to have separate washrooms for the third sex. According to the transgender board, there are at least 35,000 trans-sexual persons in Kerala. Activists working in the area say more work is required to bring them into the mainstream. ( If you need support or know someone who does, please reach to your nearest mental health specialist.

25-01-2022||India||Kolar: Row after school allows students to offer namaz||Kolar district administration has ordered an inquiry into claims that a government school allowed Muslim students to offer prayers inside their classroom last week, the state’s education minister B C Nagesh said on Monday.The development comes amid an ongoing controversy in the state after a group of students at the government college in Udupi were not allowed to attend classes while wearing a hijab.The Kolar district collector ordered the probe after a group of Hindu organisations barged into the Mulbagal Someswara Palaya Bale Changappa Government Kannada Model Higher Primary School and also held a protest on Sunday.A video of the students offering namaz inside the classroom, which was allegedly shot on Friday, surfaced on social media on Sunday. The right-wing activists barged into the school the same day.Minister Nagesh said action will be taken against the school officials.“The incident in Kolar is too bad. No institution can allow such things. We have asked all concerned officers to visit the school at the earliest. Since the two days after the incident were weekends, a visit to the school was not possible. Now, they will visit the school and give a detailed report on what transpired there. We will take strict action based on the report,” said Nagesh.Protesters alleged that prayers have been allowed in the school since December last year. A local resident and member of a right-wing group, Ramakrishna, told media that the principal permitted the students without consulting any officials. “She has allowed students to pray inside the school on her own. This is not acceptable. We demand action be taken,” he said.However, school headmistress, Uma Devi, told media that she was not aware of any prayer meeting in the school. “The students did it themselves. I was not here when this happened. The block education officer called and said this was happening at school and I rushed there,” she said.There are around 165 students from the Muslim community in the school out of a total strength is 375, according to block education officer Girijeshwari Devi. “There is a mosque right next to the school. There is no issue in them going there for prayers, but there is no provision for allowing a prayer inside,” she said.A preliminary investigation had found that the students were allowed to pray in class as they were they were found to be skipping classes after going for the Friday prayers, two officials of the education department said. A final report will be given to the district administration, they said, requesting anonymity.Since early January, eight students in Udupi’s Women’s Government Pre-University College were barred from attending classes for wearing a hijab. One of the girls, Alia Banu, said the college has been seeking leave applications on the ground of ill health. Another student Aliya Assadi said that they were threatened to be pushed out of the classroom if they didn’t remove their headscarves.“One day, we had gone inside the classroom, but the teacher’s response was, ‘If you don’t go out of class, I will push you out,” she said. Responding to the hijab controversy, minister Nagesh on Thursday alleged that it was politically motivated, keeping elections in mind.A similar incident was reported in Chikkamangaluru district on January 1.

In order to strengthen the border domination, mobilisation of troops has been done. Regular monitoring of suspicious activities of counterpart is also being carried out through surveillance equipments,” he added.The BSF is also conducting joint patrolling with the Indian army, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and police to thwart nefarious attempts of terrorists, the IG said.“BSF troops deployed on Jammu IB have been quite successful and consistent in foiling attempts from across the border by eliminating Pakistani intruders, seizing huge caches of arms and ammunition, narcotics and detecting tunnels in the past one year,” he said.BSF IG, Kashmir, Raja Babu Singh, on Monday said that about 135 terrorists are present at launch pads across the border and are waiting to infiltrate into India. Asserting that the overall situation at LoC is “peaceful”, Singh said the number of infiltration bids was lesser in 2021 in comparison to previous years.“The overall scenario along the LoC is peaceful. Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement, there has been a general peace all along the LoC in the Kashmir frontier,” he told reporters in Srinagar. Giving details on infiltration bids, he said in 2021, 58 attempts were made, in which five terrorists were killed, 21 returned and one surrendered. “There have been reports that 31 infiltrated in 2021, 130 in 2019, and 36 in 2020,” the IG said.Meanwhile, high-level security arrangements have been made across Kashmir, especially in Srinagar where main Republic Day function of the valley will be held on Wednesday, police said on Monday.Union territory’s Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha will unfurl the national flag at MA stadium in Jammu while one of the advisors RR Bhatnagar will unfurl the Tricolour at SK Stadium in Srinagar, a police spokesperson said, adding that District Development Council (DDC) chairpersons will be chief guests at their respective district headquarters.On Monday, a full-dress rehearsal parade was held in Srinagar and different district headquarters. “Since last one week, police along with Army and the CRPF have been busy in area domination in the city and other townships of Kashmir for peaceful Republic Day function. Entire security arrangements are in place,” Inspector General of Police, Kashmir Range, Vijay Kumar, said on the sidelines of the full-dress rehearsal parade.According to the police, to avert any possible attack on security installations or the venue of Republic Day functions, aerial surveillance are been done on a daily basis. “Sharpshooters have been placed at high-rise buildings across the city, especially around R-Day venue,” a police spokesperson said, requesting anonymity.A three-tier security will be in place in the city on Wednesday. Meanwhile, police on Sunday conducted surprise checking at several places in the city and on all important roads in the valley. Even in rural areas, the army has been conducting area domination operations at different places, the spokesperson added.(With inputs from Srinagar bureau and agency)
25-01-2022||India||Whitefield locality residents step in to fund civic works in neighbourhood||A small group of residents in Bengaluru’s upscale Whitefield locality is pooling in funds to help build a duct for cables that would help prevent frequent digging of roads in the neighbourhood, which leaves the streets in a mess and turns commuting a nightmare. While the initiative, like several others undertaken by the group, is part of an innovative approach to keep the neighbourhood clean, the necessity for residents to use their own funds, which is above and beyond the taxes they pay for the same services to the city corporation, comes into question. “We collect funds from our own residents to maintain the place, clean the place daily, fix potholes and get to the root of problems, such as flooding and lack of walkways. We actually put in money to build it ourselves,” said Arvind Keerthi, a retired software professional and now a full-time community organiser. Keerthi calls the initiative part of the ‘innovation’ which he and his fellow neighbours in Brookefields have put together to resolve teething issues. The proposal comes at a time when the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) budgets thousands of crores of taxpayer money each year for public works. No amount of criticism has worked so far for the agency and state government over shoddy civic infrastructure, corruption, inadequate waste management, flooding due to encroachment of lakes and water bodies, and lack of planning in a city which aspires to be ‘global’. Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai retains the Bengaluru development portfolio and the BBMP budget for 2021-22 was worth ₹9,200 crore. By his own admission, Bommai had said ₹20,000 crore was spent on road-related works in Bengaluru over the last five years, leaving most of the city’s 12 million residents wondering whether the expenditure was on paper as in reality they have to endure torturous commutes every day. Civic apathy killed at least 18 people in 2020 in Bengaluru, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), which is higher than that of other major cities of the country combined. In its latest proposal, the Brookefields residents have come forward to build a duct-cum-rainwater drain to prevent repeated digging of their road by various agencies and prevent floods. “The city government (administration) is not good structurally, and I believe, institutionally too. It is not able to send pourakarmikas to our neighbourhood. It is not able to clean drains on time. Institutionally, because of whatever reasons,” Keerthi said. He added that there was “no shame” in bringing more hands and funds to the table. But residents of other localities in Bengaluru may not be able to afford funding small civic works and administration has had no solutions so far other than spending more money on ‘quick fixes’, which have proved to be just as dangerous to lives as their earlier conditions. Interestingly, the legislator of Mahadevapura (Arvind Limbavalli) has tweeted the same proposal and “lauded” the initiative. “Their plan is self-funded and self-executed (crowd sourced by the residents themselves), that is, there is no financial commitment from the government or any government agency like BBMP or Bescom,” he wrote in a letter posted on Twitter. “Such a system of neighbourhood self-improvement and development, funded and led by the residents themselves, is to be lauded, as it gives the residents a powerful sense of neighbourhood engagement and self-governance,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whitefield-locality-residents-step-in-to-fund-civic-works-in-neighbourhood-101643051830609.html
25-01-2022||India||CM Bommai retains Bengaluru, announces district in-charge ministers||Bengaluru Karnataka chief minister (CM) Basavaraj Bommai on Monday announced the list of district in-charge ministers for 28 out of the 31 districts in the state. The CM retained Bengaluru, continuing the trend set by his predecessor as well as trying to contain the already growing divide within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The names of at least two senior ministers in the cabinet, R Ashok and JC Madhuswamy, was left out from the list.“They were left out maybe because they are seniors. There are other departments like law and order, minor irrigation, law and parliamentary affairs. They may not have the time to focus on this,” said a BJP legislator, requesting not to be named.R Ashok is the minister for revenue while JC Madhuswamy is the minister for law, parliamentary affairs and minor irrigation. Both leaders are considered to be close to BS Yediyurappa though there is no indication yet to suggest that they were left out solely because of this reason alone.The list comes almost six months after Bommai replaced BS Yediyurappa for the top job in July last year.There were several contenders for the Bengaluru portfolio that include V Somanna, Dr CN Ashwath Narayan and Ashok among others as the capital city is considered a cash cow and the biggest district portfolio in the state.Narayan was made in-charge of Ramanagara while health minister Dr K Sudhakar was made in-charge of Bengaluru Rural.Yediyurappa too had retained Bengaluru to contain the conflict between his cabinet.While some leaders were happy with the decision, the allocation of districts is unlikely to sit well with several others. Mainly since many legislators who were dislodged from their home districts where holding the to build their political might as well as to make a statement for rivals challenging their positions.N Nagaraju (MTB) was made in-charge of Chikkaballapur when he had specifically demanded Kolar. Similarly, KS Eshwarappa, who is one of the senior BJP leaders, was made in-charge of Chikmagaluru district while he sought the Shivamogga portfolio.Yediyurappa and Eshwarappa share a tempestuous relationship and the two have locked horns in the district over their long political careers with the latter also claiming to be in the race for the top job.Though it remains unclear on who helped Bommai allocate the districts, the CM is believed to be acting on the orders of the BJPs high command and has often been termed a “puppet” in the past as well.Anand Singh, who was already unhappy with the environment, ecology and tourism portfolio, was made in-charge of Koppal district while he believes he was instrumental in the carving out of the newest Vijayanagara district from Ballari.Shashikala Jolle was made in-charge of Vijanagara, much to the dismay of supporters of Singh who had raised their objections to the allocations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cmbommai-retains-bengaluru-announces-district-in-charge-ministers-101643051711286.html

According to the district administration, concentrated testing in the district has resulted in a high positivity rate. “We have been focussing on testing the contacts of the Covid positive patients and students who have come for outside the state. Because of this targeted testing, we have a higher positivity rate and most of the patients have no or mild symptoms,” said a health department official in the district. The second highest positivity rate in the state was reported in Mandya with 40.48%. According to bed availability data, no general, ICU and ventilators in the districts have been used. Similarly, 4,516 Covid care centre beds and 198 beds in hospitals remain available.

The state’s average positivity rate is 20.63% and more than half of the districts have reported a positivity rate greater than the state average as of Sunday. The state government had recently lifted the weekend curfew but decided to continue the night curfew and there is all likelihood that restrictions will be lifted from districts with lowest Covid test positivity rate. “Keeping in consideration the Covid spread, we have already taken a few decisions such as removing the weekend curfew. We have to observe the situation in the state further. All the future regulations will be based on how the state responds to the pandemic,” the CM said.

25-01-2022||India||Four seats vacant: Clamour over Cabinet expansion gains momentum, divide grows||The clamour over the cabinet expansion within the Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Karnataka continues to grow even as several leaders have been openly expressing their concerns, including making explosive claims of possible defections before the next assembly elections.Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the firebrand legislator from Bijapur city (Vijayapura), on Monday, said that there were many MLAs who are currently with the BJP but had already made deals with senior leaders of the Congress to defect.“Many people have already booked their tickets by going to the homes of DK Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah,” Yatnal said on Monday.He added that the BJP high command, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi were well aware of the identities of these people, making an indirect reference to the legislators who defected to the saffron outfit after engineering the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy-led coalition government in 2019.The statements come even as several party leaders continue to express disappointment over not being included in the Cabinet in Bommai’s government, which has four vacant berths.Yatnal said, “The same people cannot be allowed to continue in the Cabinet and if the expansion does not take place, it can threaten the party’s chances and its very survival.”At least 17 legislators from the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) had resigned from the coalition government and joined the BJP in a move engineered by BS Yediyurappa and others. They were suitably rewarded with ministerial berths even at the cost of overlooking seniors from the party.While Yediyurappa had most of this dissent under check, the divide grew wider after Bommai, who has been in the party for just over 13 years and replaced the former as chief minister, antagonising the senior fold within the state leadership.“There are four vacant berths and filling them up will help the government expand its influence and strengthen the organisation. Same people are being given chances repeatedly,” MP Renukacharya, the BJP legislator from Honnali said.The growing divide within the BJP has been helping the opposition grow stronger and arm themselves to attack the ruling government as well as dent its chances in other upcoming crucial elections like zila and taluka panchayati, Bengaluru city corporation and the 2023 assembly elections.Chief minister (CM) Bommai on Monday allocated the district in-charge ministers nearly six months after he came to power. Talking about the appointments to boards and corporations, he said that it depends on discussions within the party. “There is no proposal on the issue of appointments to boards and corporations. The party leadership would examine the issue and submit a report. Action would be taken based on that,” Bommai said.He also feigned ignorance about other meetings of BJP legislators who were purportedly discussing the cabinet expansion.A meeting was held at the residence of BJP leader and minister Umesh Katti on Saturday. The meeting was attended by several legislators from the party in Belagavi.“There are four vacant berths in the ministry. Naturally there are aspirants for them. Nothing wrong with that. Top leadership will decide on when and how to go about it. I too have brought it to the notice of the top leadership. I will provide all the details as soon as the party high command calls me for discussion,” Bommai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-seats-vacant-clamour-over-cabinet-expansion-gains-momentum-divide-grows-101643051052567.html
25-01-2022||India||Nagaland keen to pursue out-of-court settlement of border dispute with Assam||Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio on Monday said the state government is in favour of settling its decades-old border dispute with Assam out of court. This was decided at a meeting of the state assembly’s select committee to examine the Assam-Nagaland border dispute, Rio said. The Nagaland CM is hopeful that the Assam-Meghalaya model of setting up of a local body from both sides and resolving the division of disputed areas can be done to sort out the Assam-Nagaland border dispute. The select committee on Monday identified the Assam-Nagaland border into four sectors, the chief minister said.Rio, who met Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma in Guwahati on Sunday, said the out-of-court settlement of the border row was also discussed during the meeting. However, Sarma told journalists after the meeting that he hoped the border dispute case with Nagaland which is pending in Supreme Court would get sorted in another 2-3 years.After the meeting, Rio indicated that his team from Nagaland along with Sarma, will be meeting Union Home Minister Amit Shah in February to formulate how to go about settling the long-pending border row between the two states.Nagaland and Assam share about 500 km boundary and disputes along the border between the two states are believed to have been going on from 1963 after Nagaland attained statehood. Past attempts made by the two state governments to resolve the issue did not work out. Both states have refused to accept recommendations of two commissions set up by the Centre to solve the issue and a case is pending in the Supreme Court on the issue since 1988.The Supreme Court also attempted to resolve the dispute amicably through mediation in 2010 but the report submitted by the mediators which consisted of two senior advocates, was rejected by both Assam and Nagaland governments. Then the apex court in 2015 ordered both the governments to file the list of their witnesses along with their testimonies in the form of affidavits with the court’s registrar. But the progress has been slow because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.A fresh standoff occurred in the Dissoi Valley reserved forest and Tsurangkong valley between the armed police forces of the two states last year, after which a chief secretary level meeting was held on July 31 where an agreement was signed to de-escalate the situation.

25-01-2022||India||‘IAS rule change not Centre-state issue, it’s about country’s governance’||The secretary of information and broadcasting Apurva Chandra on Monday said that proposed amendments to the Indian Administrative Service cadre rules need to be viewed not from the perspective of a Centre-state conflict, but from overarching need for the smooth governance of the country, as states continue to challenge the proposed changes and say that these would destroy the country’s federal structure.“This is not just a Centre-state issue; it needs to be viewed from the perspective of the governance of the country,” Chandra said. “It cannot be a question of individual comfort when the governance of the country suffers.”Among the amendments proposed is one that says the Centre will arrive at the number of officers on CDR in consultation with states, another that in case of any difference of opinion between the Centre and the state, the latter will go with the decision of the former, and within a specified time and a third that the Centre could pick a specific officer from a state in public interest.The union government has sought state government responses to the proposed amendments to IAS cadre rules by January 25, after the last reminder on this was sent on January 6, and at least 10 chief ministers have written to the Prime Minister terming this a blow to the federal structure of governance as they will be forced under the new rules to relieve officers for central deputation.Chandra added that state-level stints are immensely helpful for officers, as it allows to take the learnings from the ground and implement them on a larger policy scale. “My Maharashtra stint, as controller of rationing in Bombay, helped me realize that there were many issues concerning the diversion of kerosene and LPG,” he said. “When I came to the petroleum ministry, we helped enact laws that could prevent such diversions.”He stressed that implementation experience at the state level can be leveraged by IAS officers at the central level to enact better policies. “What happens is that officers at the secretary and additional secretary-level (in states) agree to come to the Centre,” he said. “It is at the lower levels that people don’t take deputation. My three stints with the government of India have helped me immensely expand my oeuvre.”According to a government note seen by HT, a a trend of decreasing representation of IAS officers up to joint secretary level in GoI has been noticed as most of the States are not meeting their CDR obligations and the number of officers, sponsored by the States to serve in GoI are much lesser than the CDR. “The number of IAS officers on CDR has gone down from 309 in 2011 to 223 as on date,” states the note. “The percentage of CDR utilization has gone down from 25% in 2011 to 18% as on date. This is despite an increase of IAS officers at deputy secretary/Director level in IAS from 621 in 2014 to 1130 in 2021, the number of such officers on central deputation has gone down from 117 to 114 during the period.” HT first reported some of the contents of this note on January 21.The note adds that the reason quoted by most of the state cadres for not sponsoring officers as per prescribed CDR is a shortage of officers in the cadre. “Considering the same and the fact that shortage of AIS officers in the cadres, if any, has to be shared mutually between the Centre and the States, it has been proposed that the state cadre may now provide such number of offices as part of CDR only after adjusting the same proportionately with the number of officers available in the cadre,” states the note.The union government states that this would address the issue of genuine shortage of officers in any particular cadre. “It may be mentioned that the requirement from the states is only to sponsor adequate number of officers for posting in the Centre. The actual number of officers to be deputed to the Central Government shall be decided only in consultation with the State Government,” the note added.It further notes that for dealing with specific situations like major disasters, national security, services of an AIS officer may be warranted in the Centre. “Similarly, services of an AIS officer with a specific Domain expertise may be required for any important time bound flagship programme/project of GoI. The extant Cadre Rules do not have specific provisions to cater to such situations, which have now been proposed through these amendments,” the note said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ias-rule-change-not-centre-state-issue-it-s-about-country-s-governance-i-b-secretary-101643050991601.html
25-01-2022||India||Uttarakhand elections: Congress fields Harish Rawat from Ramnagar||The Congress on Monday announced a second list of 11 candidates for the upcoming state assembly elections. The party has fielded former chief minister Harish Rawat from Ramnagar constituency in Nainital district. The party released its first list with 53 names on Saturday late night, and is still to name six candidates for the polls to the 70-member assembly. Aside from Rawat, the list also named party state vice president Suryakant Dhasmana, who would be contesting from the Dehradun Cantonment constituency. Anukriti Gusain, daughter-in-law of former cabinet minister Harak Singh Rawat, will contest from Lansdowne. She joined the Congress about a week ago along with Harak Singh after defecting from BJP -- Harak Singh has not been named in the second list. The party is yet to announce its candidates for Narendra Nagar, Tehri, Salt, Haridwar rural, Roorkee and Chaubattakhal constituencies. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is also yet to release its second list of candidates on the remaining 11 seats after announcing candidates for 59 seats on Thursday.

The poll panel has imposed some restrictions on holding rallies and other electioneering activities in a bid to check the spread of Covid-19 during the assembly elections in the five states.Mann, along with his party’s supporters had allegedly held a roadshow at Dhuri in Sangrur district on Sunday.Dhuri Returning Officer Ismat Vijay Singh on Monday said the show cause notice was issued to the AAP’s district chief, asking him to explain why no action should be taken against the party for violating the model code. The he model code of conduct came into force on January 8 after the poll schedule for the five states, where assembly elections are slated to take place, was announced.Voting in Punjab is scheduled to take place in a single phase on February 20 while counting of votes will take place on March 10, the poll panel had earlier announced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-elections-ec-notice-to-aap-over-breach-of-poll-code-by-cm-candidate-bhagwant-mann-101643050511002.html
25-01-2022||India||Ek Mauka Kejriwal Ko: AAP kicks off drive for assembly elections||Ahead of the crucial assembly elections next month, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Monday asked Delhiites to join the party’s digital campaign by highlighting “good work” of the Delhi government on social media platforms.Launching his party’s “Ek Mauka Kejriwal Ko” (one chance to Kejriwal) campaign, the AAP chief urged residents of Delhi to upload short videos of their “good experience” of the achievements by the AAP-led Delhi government on social media and appeal to voters in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Goa to vote for the party. “Make videos on good works of Delhi government telling how you benefitted, and share them on Twitter, Instagram Facebook, Whatsapp, etc., appealing to people to give one chance to Kejriwal if they want similar good works in their states too,” the Delhi chief minister said. “Also, WhatsApp your videos to people known to you in these states appealing them to give a chance to Kejriwal,” he added.The AAP has already announced to contesting all seats in the assembly elections to be held in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Goa and Uttarakhand. Saying his party did not have “crores of money” to spend on elections, Kejriwal said the support of the people of Delhi is the most valuable asset for the AAP. “We could transform Delhi because the public showed faith in us and gave us a chance to form the government. We will be able to replicate the Delhi model in other parts of the country, if people in other states too trust and support us like Delhiites,” he said.Kejriwal also promised to host a dinner for the creators of top 50 videos after the elections.“The videos can depict how measures taken by the Delhi government have helped the public. If there’s a mohalla clinic around one, they can show what all facilities these clinics provide. They can be living proof of the education revolution of Delhi and show how our ‘happiness curriculum’ or entrepreneurship curriculum has helped the children,” Kejriwal said.“In the last seven years, the AAP government has done a lot of remarkable work in Delhi. People from the United Nations came to visit mohalla clinics and the former US president’s (Donald Trump’s) wife (Melania Trump) came to see Delhi’s schools. We are providing 24-hour free electricity to people,” he said, adding it was possible only because people of Delhi gave the opportunity to the AAP.“Do you want this good work to be replicated in other parts of the country? People of these (poll-bound) states should also get free 24-hour electricity, good roads, better schools, and better healthcare facilities,” he said.Prof Tanvir Aeijaz, an associate professor of political science at Delhi University’s Ramjas College, said campaigns by political parties during Covid-19 pandemic are done largely on social media, and AAP’s initiative by asking residents to upload videos of “good work by Kejriwal” on social media can be seen as a novel idea of political mobilisation for state elections. “It does give a veneer of participatory democracy, but largely the party workers would be uploading it. However, people at large do not understand the nuances of multilevel federalism operating in Delhi, and hence uploading videos may lead to intense propaganda in terms of blame game. The biggest casualty would be truth,” Aeijaz said. He pointed at the fact that Delhi Dialogue Commission does not have reports to back the authenticity of AAP’s claims of development. “Campaigns on social media by parties could lead to anyone’s advantage, or perhaps to the party that has major control over it. It would be better for AAP to fight on a more realistic turf, with more authentic reports than on social media,” he added. 
25-01-2022||India||UP elections: Azam, Shivpal figure in SP’s first list of candidates||Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav, his uncle Shivpal Yadav and jailed leader Azam Khan were among 159 candidates who figured on the party’s first list of candidates for the impending assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, on Monday.As many as 66 leaders belonging to the other backward classes, over 30 Dalits, 31 Muslims and 12 women were also fielded by the party for the polls starting February 10. “The list is balanced with due representations to all caste and community groups. The candidates are strong and will help the party to form the next government. The list is in sync with the party president’s motto of amalgamation of ‘Samajwadi (socialists)’ and ‘Ambadkarvadis (Ambadkarites)’,” SP national spokesperson Abdul Hafiz Gandhi told reporters here while releasing the first list. As reported by HT earlier, Akhilesh will contest the polls from Karhal (Mainpuri) constituency, while former minister and Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia chief Shivpal was declared the party’s candidate from the family bastion of Jaswantnagar in Etawah district.The party has fielded jailed leader Azam Khan from his traditional Rampur seat while his son Abdullah Azam from Suar Tanda. Azam has been in Sitapur jail since February 2020 in various cases filed against him. Abdullah, who was also in jail, was released on January 15.The party, meanwhile, has decided to re-nominate SP MLA Nahid Hasan from Kairana seat in Shamli. Hasan, who is facing a case under the Gangsters Act, was arrested by Uttar Pradesh Police on January 16 and sent to judicial custody.The party has also decided to retain sitting MLA and one of its Brahmin faces, Manoj Pandey, from Unchahar constituency. Utkrist Maurya, son of ex-BJP minister Swami Prasad Maurya, who also joined the SP recently, was denied the ticket from this seat.With Monday’s list, the SP and its allies have released the names of a total of 194 candidates: 159 of SP, 33 of Rashtriya Lok Dal, one Nationalist Congress Party, and one Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party. Former state minister Dharam Singh Saini, who switched over to the SP from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a few days ago, was named as the party’s nominee from Nakur in Saharanpur district. Former BJP leader Roshan Lal Verma (Tilhar in Shahjahanpur) was also among the turncoats who got an SP ticket on Monday. Supriya Aron, former mayor of Bareilly, who just joined the SP, was fielded from the Bareilly Cantt seat.Taking a jibe at the SP list, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said: “Many thanks to the Samajwadi Party for finally declaring its list of candidates whose names the party had been releasing secretly. Now that the list is finally out, SP’s brand ambassadors have been revealed. It contains names of people with a tainted record and even now it appears to be just a trailer. The entire film is yet to be released.” The BJP leader said the release of the list coincided with Balika Diwas or National Girl Child Day. “The list has names like Nahid Hasan, Azam Khan, Abdullah Azam, Sultan Baig, Mehboob Ali, Aslam Chaudhary, Irfan Solanki some of whom are in jail or out on bail. There are some other names of people on the list who have been accused of other crimes. So, this list is new but the trend is old of fielding candidates with a dubious track record,” he said. The SP and its allies have decided to contest all 403 seats in the state assembly. However, they are yet to provide details on the seat-sharing between them.
25-01-2022||India||Top court refuses to revisit Shaheen Bagh protest order||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to revisit its judgment on Shaheen Bagh protest and dismissed an application moved by a lawyer stating that the condition to seek prior permission for staging protest at a designated site should not be mandatory as it curtails right of citizens to protest peacefully.The application was moved on behalf of advocate Tasneem Ahmadi who was also part of the earlier proceedings in the Supreme Court which led to the judgment of October 7, 2020 where the Court held that while democracy and dissent go hand in hand, right to protest cannot be at the cost of public inconvenience and hence, it must be restricted to designated sites of protest and not on public roads and spaces.Dismissing the application, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh said, “No clarification of our judgment is required. The judgment speaks for itself.”The application, drafted by advocate Mehmood Pracha, said, “The conditions of permission and designated public place ought not to be made mandatory in case of peaceful protests expressing dissent. Inconvenience to the public has to be seen in the light of all relevant facts and a clarification in that respect is necessary to uphold the right to peaceful dissent as enunciated by this Court in its judgment of October 7, 2020.”Presenting practical situations where permission of protest is denied by authorities or a small place is designated as protest site which cannot accommodate many protestors, the application said, “Taking the instance of the protest at Shaheen Bagh, the same could not have been shifted to Jantar Mantar which has a maximum capacity of only 1000 people…The repeated attacks and attempts to attack the ladies who were sitting in peaceful protest at Shaheen Bagh only underscores the point that if they were forced to commute to Jantar Mantar every day, they would have to face and bear the brunt of violent physical attacks.”When the Court took up the application, advocate Mansoor Ali informed the Court that Pracha, who is to argue the plea, was stuck in another Court. Having gone through the plea, the Court found no reason to entertain the application and dismissed the same.The applicant said, “The observations regarding protests at designated places, in the judgment as well as the observation regarding action to be taken by the administration, defeats the pious intention of this Court, of upholding the right to protest as an integral part of democracy which cannot be crushed.”It said that the authority, when it raises a plea of public inconvenience to block protests, should be duty bound to provide a suitable site to enable the protestors to demonstrate their strength in numbers. “A suitable clarification is required to ensure that the right to dissent, as upheld by this Court, is not defeated by refusal to grant permission,” the application said, adding, “It is important to strike a balance between public convenience and the right to protest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-court-refuses-to-revisit-shaheen-bagh-protest-order-101643049851275.html
25-01-2022||India||UP elections: BJP to finalise candidates’ list today||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership, including Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, met in the capital on Monday to discuss the names of the remaining candidates for the seven-phase assembly election in the state. The party has already announced the names of 197 candidates. The remaining names will be announced after the party’s central election committee meets on Tuesday, said functionaries aware of the development. The BJP, which is contesting the upcoming UP assembly polls in alliance with the Apna Dal and the Nishad Party, is likely to put up candidates in about 380 seats of the 403-member assembly, a party functionary said. “The BJP has nearly finalised the seat-sharing agreement with the allies, the Apna Dal and the Nishad Party, and last-minute negotiations are underway for a handful of seats in the purvanchal,” the functionary said, requesting anonymity. Last week, party president JP Nadda addressed a press conference flanked by Anupriya Patel of the Apna Dal and Sanjay Nishad of the Nishad Party to assert that the allies are geared up to “jointly” contest all the 403 seats.In 2017, the Apna Dal had contested on 11 seats and won nine. This time, the party has been pushing the BJP to increase its quota in the seat distribution. Nishad Party is also pushing for a double-digit seat allocation. The BJP is also expected to shift some of the sitting legislators from their existing constituencies to boost its chances of improving the overall tally. While about a dozen legislators will move to new constituencies, between 70-80 will be dropped to buck anti-incumbency, the functionary said.“The party also follows the practice of giving newer faces a chance. This time we have announced that requests for multiple tickets per family will not be entertained ,” said a second functionary. The BJP has had to revisit its initial plan of dropping over 40% of the siting MLAs following the exit of three ministers from the other backward classes and a clutch of legislators. The party is mindful of the resentment such a move can set off, the second functionary said, declining to be named. “The anti-incumbency is usually against the sitting lawmaker and the BJP for long has followed a practice of dropping up to 30% of the sitting candidates,” the second functionary said. “But overall, ticket distribution is based on winnability.” 
25-01-2022||India||Steps taken for ‘absolutely Covid safe’ elections; use democratic right: CEC||Weeks before the assembly elections begin in five states, chief election commissioner(CEC) Sushil Chandra on Monday said that all necessary arrangements have been made for “absolutely Covid safe” polls and urged voters to exercise their democratic right enthusiastically.Chandra also said that holding elections in the past two years amid the coronavirus pandemic had proven to be “extremely challenging”.“For the last two years, the Covid-19 pandemic has made the conduct of elections far more challenging. It is with the confidence and the support of the voters that we have managed to conduct six assembly elections and many more by-elections,” he said in a video message to the public on the eve of the 12th National Voters’ Day.Referring to the elections in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Punjab and Manipur to be held in seven phases between February 10 and March 7, he said the poll panel has emphasised on increasing the pace of Covid-19 vaccination in these states.The CEC also pointed out that the number of voters in the country stood at 95.14 crore as against 17.3 crores during the first ever national elections in 1951-52.“Voters are our true heroes, our true inspiration. This year marks 70 years of India’s independence, which began with 17.3 crore voters. Now, we have 95.14 crore voters, of which over 49 crore are male and 45 crore are female. We also have 1.72 crore newly registered voters this time,” he said.The Election Commission came into being on January 25, 1950, a day before India became a republic. For the past 12 years now, January 25 has been celebrated as National Voters’ Day.The theme for this year’s National Voters’ Day is ‘Making Elections Inclusive, Accessible and Participative’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assembly-elections-use-democratic-right-enthusiastically-cec-sushil-chandra-tells-voters-101643049190874.html
25-01-2022||India||Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh among Congress’ star campaigners for first phase||The top leadership of the Congress will campaign for the party for the first phase of Uttar Pradesh’s assembly elections, according to a list released on Monday. They would include party chief Sonia Gandhi, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, party MP Rahul Gandhi and All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu, senior leaders RPN Singh and Ghulam Nabi Azad, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, his Chhattisgarh counterpart Bhupesh Baghel and former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot will also campaign in UP. Former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar, who joined the Congress in September last year, was also named. This is the first time that the student leader will be campaigning for the grand old party ahead of a key assembly election, after he jumped ship from the Communist Party of India (CPI) amid a barrage of criticism last year.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal has sent the list of the star campaigners to the chief electoral officer of Uttar Pradesh. “The following leaders of the Indian National Congress, who would be campaigning as per Section 77(1) of Representation of People Act, 1951, for the ensuing first phase of elections to the legislative assembly of Uttar Pradesh to be held on 10th February 2022,” he said in a letter. The first phase will be held on Februrary 10. Six other phases of the election are scheduled for February 14, 20, 23, 27, and March 3 and 7. The results will be declared on March 10.Last week, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had released its list of 30 campaigners for the UP elections. While many star campaigners like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah were named, party MPs and mother-son duo Maneka Gandhi and Varun Gandhi were excluded.Given the constraints of campaigning because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the parties are likely to hit the campaign trail in Uttar Pradesh in a phased manner, including door-to-door campaigning and closed-door meetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-elections-sonia-gandhi-manmohan-singh-among-congress-star-campaigners-for-first-phase-101643048713453.html
25-01-2022||India||Number Theory: How did lockdown affect jobs in election states?||Jobs (or actually, the promise of jobs) are a big part of election campaigns in India. The forthcoming election cycle is no exception. Lack of timely data makes it difficult to analyse the latest employment trends in a state before elections. Jobs (or actually, the promise of jobs) are a big part of election campaigns in India. The forthcoming election cycle is no exception. Lack of timely data makes it difficult to analyse the latest employment trends in a state before elections. |#+|Data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), the official source of employment statistics in India, is released in two formats. Quarterly bulletins give estimates of urban employment without many details, while annual data provides a comprehensive picture of the employment scenario across quarters. The latest quarterly and annual figures from PLFS are available until March 2021 and June 2020. This data can be used to answer an important question. Which of these states suffered the most on the employment front in the April-June quarter of 2020, when India had its most stringent lockdown?While the April-June 2020 quarter seems a long time ago, the fact that India went through a bruising second wave, albeit without any nationwide lockdown, and is now in the midst of a third wave may imply, at the least, some overhang from that period. Whether it will have a political impact remains to be seen.Unemployment rateIndia’s average unemployment rate saw a big jump during the quarter ended April-June 2020. At 14.7%, it increased 1.7 times compared to April-June 2019. Three out of the five states (Goa, Punjab, Manipur, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand) going to polls saw unemployment rates higher than the national average during this period. Having increased from 8.2% to 24.4%, Uttarakhand’s unemployment rate saw the sharpest increase.To be sure, the official unemployment rates given in PLFS underestimate the degree of joblessness in the Indian economy. This was explained in an August 2021 HT analysis by Ishan Anand and Anjana Thampi. It is because the official category of employed persons includes the sub-category of people looking for jobs. Accounting for this fact, Goa appears to have been the worst-hit state during the lockdown, where almost half of the labour force could be considered unemployed.Quality of employment worsenedBecause regular workers are the best paid in India, a decline in their share among all workers signifies a worsening in the quality of unemployment. A simple comparison of the share of three major employment categories – regular, self-employed and casual – shows that the share of regular workers actually went up in three of the five poll-bound states between the quarter ended June 2019 and June 2020. This is more a statistical anomaly than proof of workers moving to better jobs during the lockdown. It can be seen clearly once we break up regular wage and self-employed workers in the relevant categories. The data show an increase in regular workers and self-employed workers who were employed and not working, or doing unpaid labour.Shift towards agricultural employmentIn all states, except Punjab, the distribution of workers shifted towards agriculture. If we leave aside Goa, where the share of such workers remained comparatively low even despite this shift, the biggest such shifts happened in Manipur and Uttarakhand. In the former, the major shift was from the services sector, whereas in the latter the major shift was from industries. That such a shift was relatively less in Uttar Pradesh is not a cause for cheer either, as the agriculture sector in the state already employed 50% of workers in April-June 2019.People moved back to villages in lockdown, but did not find jobsThe quarterly bulletins of urban employment are available up to March 2021, but this analysis has avoided looking at those bulletins alone. It is not just because of detailed categories of employment are absent in quarterly bulletins, but also because of the bigger contribution of rural areas in the employment crisis.In April-June 2019, in all states except Manipur and Uttarakhand, labour force participation was higher in urban than in rural areas. Unemployment rate was also, perhaps because of the trend in the labour force participation rate (LPFR), which was higher in urban areas generally in all states (except Manipur).This changed during the lockdown months in 2020. Either the rural LFPR became higher than urban LFPR, or closed the gap, which is consistent with anecdotal accounts of migrants returning to their villages. These returning migrants did not necessarily find jobs. Except in Manipur, whose trends were opposite to other states even in 2019, the proportional increase in rural unemployment rate was higher than in urban areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-did-lockdown-affect-jobs-in-election-states-101643048710319.html
25-01-2022||India||Punjab elections: BJP to contest on 65 seats, Amarinder’s PLC 37||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will contest 65 seats in the 117- member Punjab assembly, while its two allies, the Punjab Lok Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt), will contest 37 and 15 seats, respectively. It is the first time since the 1997 assembly elections that the BJP is contesting elections in the state without its former ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal, which was a constituent of the National Democratic Alliance. The SAD snapped ties with the BJP following disagreements over the farm laws that were recently repealed.Announcing the seat-sharing agreement in the capital on Monday, BJP chief JP Nadda, flanked by Amarinder Singh of the Punjab Lok Congress and Sukhdev Dhindsa of the SAD Sanyukt, said the arrangement was arrived after detailed discussions. The new alliance has been stitched together on concerns the three parties share over the security of the nation and stability in the state that shares its border with Pakistan, Nadda said. “Punjab has 600 km of border with Pakistan. And we know what activities take place. There is drug, arms and sophisticated weapon smuggling happening. At the same time, they use drones to send drugs and ammunition,” Nadda said. “Security is a very important issue as far as Punjab election is concerned.” The BJP chief said the NDA does not see elections as just a means to change the regime, but also to “secure the future generations and give stability to Punjab.”He criticised the Congress government, saying the state was reeling under a ₹3 lakh crore debt. “Despite being a progressive state, it has slipped on the development index,” Nadda said. The security concerns was reiterated by Singh, former chief minister and Congress leader who now heads the Punjab Lok Congress. Addressing the media at the BJP headquarters, Singh said the alliance in the state came together following a consensus that the coalition was for the sake of stability and security of the nation.During his tenure, Singh was privy to the illegal activities carried out in the border state, which included sending over arms and ammunition, he said. “This has been my stand from the beginning. The weaponry that has come in the last four and a half years includes at least 100,000 rifles and 500 pistols and RDX and lakhs of rounds of ammunition. Drones were making drops. The purpose was to carry out nefarious activities,” he said. To a separate question on his allegation that Pakistan made a recommendation to include state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu in his cabinet, the former chief minister said he did not approve of the cricketer turned politician and found him “incompetent and useless.”Soon after dropping Sidhu from his cabinet, Singh received a phone call on the behest of the Pakistan prime minister requesting him to change his decision, he alleged. “I was told to take back Sidhu into the cabinet and remove him if he did not work,” the former chief minister said. Dhindsa said the alliance will focus on the need for industry and other employment opportunities in the state. “The situation is bad; there is no industry, agriculture loans have gone up and there are no other means of brining it back on its feet,” the Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) leader said. “There are other issues too. I have twice given memorandum to the union home ministry that those who have completed their terms should be released from prison.”In the backdrop of protests against the BJP government at the Centre against the farm laws and the party’s perceived alienation from the Sikh community, Nadda listed a clutch of measures that the BJP government announced for the community, which included allowing donations for Harmandir Sahib, exempting the langars or community kitchens from goods and serves tax, and setting up of a special investigation team to probe the 1984 riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-elections-bjp-to-contest-on-65-seats-amarinder-s-plc-37-101643048652538.html
25-01-2022||India||Omicron offshoot now under watch||Over the weekend, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and the World Health Organization said they have designated BA.2, one of the four Omicron variant lineages, as under investigation. The reason for this designation was early signs that the lineage is outcompeting the other three, which in themselves are among the most transmissible already. Why is BA.2 different?The Omicron variant comprises four sister lineages. The earliest, detected in South Africa, was the B.1.1.529. Then came BA.1, which is now globally the predominant one, followed by BA.2 and BA.3. It is not unusual for variants to mutate and branch off into such lineages. It happened with Delta, which grew into AY.4.2, which was found in large samples in the UK.What makes BA.2 different from BA.1 is 28 unique mutations, including 12 in what is known as the receptor binding domain (RBD) – a portion of the virus that has a key role in infection. BA.2 also has 32 shared mutations with BA.1, but the 28 unique ones are not a small number. To be sure, the number of mutations does not alone determine if the virus’s function changes. They can depend on individual or a certain set of mutations, or even a new combination that may have arisen. Is it worrying?At the outset, it does not appear so, and the most crucial sign of this may come from India. In submissions by Indian labs recently, BA.2 accounts for 33% of genomes sequenced from patients in the past month. This means the particular offshoot is already present in large numbers in India, at least in some parts of the country. According to outbreak.info, the Indian regions where most of these samples came from are Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. At present, none of the Indian regions are reporting a significantly different hospitalisation or death trajectory from others, which means almost all Omicron lineages in India are behaving in a similar manner.This has also been borne out by Denmark’s experience, where severity estimates have not changed even as BA.2 is estimated to now account for 81% of cases.Why it must be monitoredThat it is outcompeting the other Omicron lineages still makes it worth investigating because scientists need to understand what traits exactly are giving it that advantage. Remember, even Omicron’s transmissibility advantage as a whole has not been well understood. In this light, a change in the variant that makes it even fitter is important to decode. The other parameters that will be monitored are if it is more resistant, which too can give it a transmission advantage. Imperial College London virologist Tom Peacock, who was among the first to spot Omicron’s vastly mutated nature, said last week that he believes there would be a “minimal difference in vaccine effectiveness against BA.1 and BA.2” and that it is “highly likely” that an infection with BA.1 will protect against a BA.2 infection. More studies are awaited.
25-01-2022||India||Omicron forms nearly 75% of the recently submitted samples to GISAID||The Omicron variant of Covid-19 was found in nearly 75% of the recent genome sequencing test results submitted by India to a global database in January, compared with about 19% in end December, people familiar with the matter said, which shows the fast-rising presence of the highly transmissible variant in the infected population.The Omicron variant is now in community transmission in India, INSACOG, the Indian Sars-CoV-2 genomics consortium of 10 central and 28 regional laboratories, announced in its Sunday bulletin, based on whole genome sequencing results.The heavily mutated Omicron variant spreads three times faster than any other variant, but is believed to be less than half as likely as Delta to lead to serious infections, according to current scientific evidence.“The sequencing results reflect the trend that the Omicron variant is gaining prominence over Delta, especially in the cities that are worst affected,” a government official said on condition of anonymity. “But that does not mean Delta is not present anymore within the community. We are also getting samples positive for the Delta variant. Therefore, people need to be very cautious.”The Indian samples are both from international travellers and from within the community that tested positive for Covid-19. “These are results of Covid-19 tests conducted in all dedicated labs from across the country, and is a mix from travellers and sentinel surveillance samples,” said the official.Although traveller samples dominated the mix earlier, the number of samples testing positive from within the community is rising fast.“We need to do more genomic sequencing as not every case is due to the Omicron variant. As recent data from Karnataka show, around 49% of samples sequenced from the state in December and January so far were of the Delta variant,” said Giridhara R Babu, head of epidemiology at the Indian Institute of Public Health.“It’s definitely not the time to drop guard, and observing Covid-appropriate behavior is as important now as it was earlier to prevent getting infected,” he said..
25-01-2022||India||Third Covid wave now spreading faster in rural districts||India’s villages have now overtaken its big cities in reporting the rise in fresh cases of Covid-19 in the pandemic’s third wave, an analysis by HT shows, even as the growth in daily numbers is on the wane.Although urban districts continue to report a higher volume of cases than rural areas, daily cases there are now decreasing, while they continue to rise in rural districts. This shift in rising infections from urban to rural parts of the country was seen in both of India’s previous Covid-19 waves as well. The HT analysis is based on district-level data provided by How India Lives compiled up to January 21.The data shows that Delhi and Mumbai – the first two outbreak centres of the Omicron surge – have seen their seven-day average of new cases decrease everyday since January 16 and January 13, respectively. They are also not the only major cities to do so – infections are also dropping fast in other metropolitan cities such as Chennai and Kolkata.While​ the seven-day average for India continues to increase, it’s rate of growth is now much lower than the rapid pace characteristic of the Omicron surge, data showed. The seven-day average of daily infections was 309,244 for the week ended January 23. A week ago, this number was 239,100, which means it has grown 29.3% in seven days. At its peak, the weekly growth rate had touched a monstrous 528% in the week ended January 8, nearly six times of the highest growth rate seen in the second wave.In Maharashtra, while the seven-day average of Mumbai and Mumbai Suburban districts decreased from 14,038 on January 15 to 6,934 on January 21, this average increased from 28,080 to 35,315 in the rest of the state. It suggests that the growth in cases is now being led by districts that are less urban.To check whether the current wave is now being driven by rural areas, HT classified districts on the basis of the share of their population living in rural areas in the 2011 census. Districts with less than 20% population living in rural areas are classified as entirely urban, and those with more than 80% population living in rural areas are classified as entirely rural, with the largely urban, mixed, and largely rural districts falling at similar 20% intervals in between.This classification shows that in the entirely urban districts – 16 in number and including all metros and some capital cities – the seven-day average of cases has decreased in the past week – from 74,651 on January 15 to 70,142 on January 21. For these 16 districts combined, the decline so far, apart from being more recent than Delhi and Mumbai, is also less consistent. The average grew by 0.8% on January 18, for example, although it decreased on all other days from January 16 to January 21.In all other kinds of districts, the cases are still growing, but the growth is higher in districts that are more rural. The growth rate of the seven-day average on January 21 was 4.5% in largely urban districts (20%-40% population is rural), 4.4% in mixed districts (40%-60% population rural), 6.7% in largely rural districts (60%-80% population rural), and 6.9% in entirely rural districts (over 80% rural population).In absolute numbers, new infections are still somewhat higher in the urban districts. The seven-day average on January 21 was 70,142 in entirely urban districts, 60,637 in largely urban districts, 53,024 in mixed districts, 61,914 in largely rural districts, and 41,226 in entirely rural districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-covid-wave-now-spreading-faster-in-rural-districts-101643048112676.html
25-01-2022||India||Stakeholders push to lift curbs, open schools in Delhi||The Delhi government’s health department has recommended that businesses activities in the national capital should be allowed to resume without restrictions,and private schools have urged the authorities to bring children back to the classroom as the clamour to start unlocking the Capital gained momentum amid a fall in Covid-19 cases and consistently low hospitalisation rates.A decision, however, is likely only after three more days, when the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) meets on January 27 to discuss changes to restrictions.There have been growing demands in recent days from the city’s elected government, the business community, and parents of schoolchildren for the DDMA to ease Covid-19 related restrictions, which several medical experts regard as unnecessarily stifling at a time when the outbreak is under control.“Covid cases have been on a decline over the last week. On January 20, there was a minor spike but we had more tests that day and the positivity rate was lower, which was another indication of receding cases. Our assessment is that we can remove restrictions in a phased manner, and we have communicated that to the DDMA,” a health department official said on Monday, asking not to be named.Numbers released on Monday further reinforced the assessment. The city recorded 5,760 new infections from 11.79% of all tests conducted the day before, the lowest rate at which the tally grew in 20days. The number of people in hospitals with Covid-19 too shrunk significantly to 2,394, the lowest since January 16.DDMA, headed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, has called a meeting for 12.30pm on January 27 to discuss the Covid-related public health measures in the city. Last week, the agency rejected a request from the Delhi government to lift the weekend curfew and allow all shops to open instead of the odd-even rule at present, although it accepted the proposal to let private offices call back 50% of staff to their locations.“The larger opinion of the government is that we can ease restrictions so that the economy is not burdened. There are people whose livelihoods are being impacted by these prolonged restrictions, which were needed during the peak Covid period, but since that phase has passed we should not burden them,” a second health department official said, asking not to be named.Over the last week, the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and a variety of trade groups made repeated appeals to Baijal to rethink continuing restrictions such as the weekend curfew, the night curfew and a rule to allow only alternate shops in marketplaces to open in light of the infection trends. Since hitting a peak on January 13, the number of new cases in the city has only shrunk.Trader groups told HT that a survey of business across the city showed that 86% of them reported their business to have shrunk to 40% of what they routinely earn as they stay shut or work in limited hours, while markets and malls in neighbouring regions are open for regular operations.They reiterated their appeal on Monday with a stronger warning of unavoidable jobs cuts due to the strain of fixed costs like rent while their earning days are significantly limited. “Due to this financial crunch, the traders are left with no other option (but) to cut down expenses, terminate employees to sustain their business, which in fact would lead to a huge unemployment situation in Delhi,” said a letter signed by the New Delhi Traders Association president Atul Bhargava, sent to Baijal.Brijesh Goyal, chairman of the Chamber of Trader and Industry, an association of traders, said a group of traders protested in Rohini on Monday against the DDMA’s Friday decision not to lift the curbs.Similar appeals have also come from schools and parents of school-going children.“We are vaccinating students in eligible categories but the government should reopen schools for students in all classes. Complete reopening is the need of the hour,” said Bharat Arora, general secretary, Action Committee of Unaided Private Schools.The government had urged schools to ensure 100% vaccination of eligible children so that a stronger case could be made to the DDMA to allow classes to resume.Between the first lockdown, the four past Covid waves in Delhi and the period of air quality crisis, children in Delhi have spent some of the longest time out of school over the last two years in the country. Experts have warned not only will the learning loss from these be severe, particularly among those that cannot afford digital devices to learn from home, but children will have missed days of social interactions that are critical for their early age development even though their infection risk is starkly low.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital, said that the closure of schools over the past two years had derailed the overall growth of children and it was necessary for the government to reopen schools for all children. “Children have been heavily affected in the past two years. Children in the younger age group are particularly vulnerable and need to be in classrooms for the development of interpersonal relationships. The government should reopen schools without any ifs and buts. It should educate parents that children are least affected by Omicron or Covid,” said Kishore.“My children wait for turns to use the one mobile phone that we have. Despite the financial constraints caused by the pandemic, we are taking all efforts to educate our children. If other states can reopen schools, the same can be done in Delhi,” said Dharam Pal, who works with a transport company.Monday marked the first day that schools in several parts of Maharashtra opened. The state, particularly its capital Mumbai, was among the earliest to be hit by the Omicron variant along with Delhi.Students in most cities can now go back to in-person classes after the outbreak there appeared to be under control.The third nationwide outbreak of Covid-19 began in late December and has since swept across much of the country. But in keeping with other regions of the world where the Omicron variant has spread, there was a significant decoupling in the rate of hospital admissions and deaths from new infections. Even when cases reached sharp, high peaks – deaths and hospital admissions have remained a low – a trend reflected in Delhi’s numbers as well.For instance, even when the number of new cases reached close to an all-time high of over 28,000, the hospital bed occupancy rate remained under 20% throughout the month.Dr Suneela Garg, professor and member of the Lancet Commission Covid India Task Force, said that life and livelihood will have to go hand in hand now. “Life and livelihood has to be in the forefront but Covid appropriate behaviour needs to be strictly followed. For the last four days, Delhi is recording a steady decline in infections and from around 28% positivity rate during the peak period we have come down to around 11% very quickly. If the situation remains similar for the next two-three days, we can surely ease restrictions in a phased manner,” said Dr Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stakeholders-push-to-lift-curbs-open-schools-in-delhi-101643047990225.html
25-01-2022||India||PM hails youth power in Bal Puraskar meet||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday handed the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar to children picked for the honours and asked them to support the “Vocal for Local” campaign, even as he added that the awards came with a huge responsibility for the youngsters.The Prime Minister awarded the Bal Puraskar recipients certificates digitally using the “blockchain technology” during a virtual event held on Monday, an official statement said. Twenty-nine children, including 14 girls, were recognised for their exceptional abilities and outstanding achievements in six fields – innovation, scholastic achievement, sports, arts and culture, social service, and bravery.Modi said the youth was at the centre of all policies being framed by the government.Applauding the children for playing a key role in the success of the government’s Swachh Bharat campaign, Modi asked them to become ambassadors for the “Vocal for Local” drive, too. “Just like you came forward for the cleanliness campaign, you should also come forward for the Vocal for Local campaign. Make a list of the products that you use at home and are not made in India. Then urge your family members to use similar products that are made in India. This way you will help India to become an Atma Nirbhar nation,” the Prime Minister said.During his interaction with Meedhansh Kumar, 11, who has developed a web portal for providing information regarding Covid-19, Modi said: “In children like Meedhansh, the government efforts to promote entrepreneurship are bearing fruit and a tendency to become job providers instead of being job seekers is becoming more pronounced.”While speaking to Tarushi Kumar, a 12-year-old from Chandigarh who had her name registered in the Guinness Book for her Taekwondo skills, the Prime Minister asked about her opinion on the balance between sports and studies, and also assured that the government is committed to providing all the facilities to sportspersons.During the interaction, the Prime Minister also talked about the unveiling of a hologram statue of freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose at the India Gate on Sunday and said the “biggest inspiration we get from Netaji is – duty and nation first”. “Taking inspiration from Netaji, you have to proceed on the path of duty for the country,” he said.“You have been given these awards when the country is celebrating 75 years of its Independence. With this award, you have been given a huge responsibility. Now, everyone’s expectations have also increased from you. You do not have to feel stressed by these expectations but draw inspiration instead.”He also asked the children to study the bravery and sacrifice of the sons of Guru Gobind Singh. “The Sahibzadas had sacrificed themselves with immense valour at a very young age. Their sacrifice for India’s civilization, culture, faith and religion is incomparable. Youngsters should know more about the Sahibzadas and their sacrifice,” the Prime Minister said.He also lauded children for their participation in the Covid-19 vaccination programme. “Children of India have shown their modern and scientific temperament in the vaccination programme and since January 3, in just 20 days, more than 40 million children have taken the Corona vaccine,” Modi said.The Prime Minister praised the youngsters for their contribution in the field of startups and innovation. “Your own generation is leading this new era not only in India but outside India as well. Today, we feel proud when we see that the CEOs of all the big companies of the world, everyone is discussing about them. Who are these CEOs? They are the children of our own country. It is the young generation of this country which is dominant in the world today. Today, we feel proud when we see that the CEOs of all the big companies of the world are young Indians. We feel proud when we see the youth of India excelling in the world of startups,” he said.The Prime Minister also greeted the daughters of the country on the National Girl Child Day. He also remembered the contributions of women freedom fighters, including Birbala Kanaklata Barua, Khudiram Bose and Rani Gaidinilu, in India’s struggle for freedom. “These fighters made the country’s freedom the mission of their lives at a very young age and dedicated themselves to it,” Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-hails-youth-power-in-bal-puraskar-meet-101643047870164.html
25-01-2022||India||Air India’s handover to Tatas expected soon after Republic Day||Air India (AI) is likely to be formally handed over to the Tata group by the end of this week, officials with knowledge of the matter said on Monday, signaling that process to transfer the debt-laden national carrier was nearing an end.AI officials said the final handover date was not finalised but they aimed to hand over the airline by Thursday. “We cannot confirm a date, but the final handover has to happen this week,” an AI official said, declining to be named.An AI spokesperson refused to comment on the matter.The national carrier, which began its journey under the Tatas 90 years ago before the government nationalized the sector in 1953, was sold to the autos-to-steel Tata conglomerate, which will pay ₹18,000 crore for a 100% stake. The sale was announced on October 8 by the Union government.Talace Pvt Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Sons, will get 100% equity shares of AI and AI Express, along with the government’s 50% stake in ground-handling company AISATS.An internal message sent to AI employees said that the closing balance sheet was to be submitted by the end of Monday, said the officials cited above. The balance sheet was then to be forwarded to the Tata Sons for review.“The closing balance sheet as of 20th January has to be provided today (Monday) 24th January so that it can be reviewed by Tatas and any changes can be effected on Wednesday,” the message, which HT has seen, said.It added the next three days will be hectic and requested airline employees to give their best before the firm is divested. “We may have to work late in the night to complete the task given to us,” the message added, seeking cooperation of the employees.Officials are working round the clock to complete all procedures this week. They may have to work even on January 26 so that the handover can be done on Thursday, said a second AI official, requesting anonymity. “We have done an excellent job till now in providing support for the disinvestment exercise,” the official added.On October 8, the Tatas beat the ₹15,100-crore offer by a consortium led by SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh and the reserve price of ₹12,906 crore set by the government for the sale of its 100% stake in the loss-making carrier.The bid amount includes Tata’s taking on of about ₹15,300 crore of the national flag carrier’s ₹61,562 crore debt. The remaining will be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Limited (AIAHL), a special purpose vehicle formed by the government.On October 11, a Letter of Intent (LoI) was issued to the Tata group confirming the government’s willingness to sell its 100% stake in the airline. On October 25, the Centre signed the share purchase agreement (SPA) for this deal.The deal was a boost for the government’s disinvestment drive and financial books. In the 2021 financial year, which was battered by the pandemic, the airline was estimated to have lost ₹27 crore a day.For Tata Group, AI is the third airline in its stable – it already holds a majority interest in AirAsia India and Vistara, a joint venture with Singapore Airlines Ltd. It will also fetch the company prized landing and parking slots. At present, AI has control of 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing and parking slots at domestic airports, as well as 900 slots at airports overseas such as London’s Heathrow and New York’s JFK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-s-handover-expected-after-republic-day-101643016728739.html
