28-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi: A year on, little headway in Israeli Embassy blast probe||New Delhi: A year after a low intensity blast outside Israeli embassy in Delhi sent shockwaves in the security apparatus as it took place during Beating Retreat ceremony at Rajpath, the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is investigating the case, is nowhere close to cracking the case. From exploring an Iranian angle to examining the role of four Jammu and Kashmir-based students in the Capital, investigators have had little success so far. “As of now, it’s one of those cold cases in which we are looking for a concrete lead,” said an NIA official who didn’t want to be named.The low-intensity improvised device went off around 5pm near Bungalow number 5, APJ Abdul Kalam Road, near Jindal House, on January 29, 2021. Although nobody was killed or injured, the blast left a crater and damaged three cars parked nearby. Immediately after the blast, Israel said Iran was behind the attack, a claim which was confirmed by Indian intelligence agencies. Other than the fact that the blast occurred on the 29th anniversary of establishment of India-Israel diplomatic ties (on January 29, 1992), a letter found at the blast site said the attack was to avenge the killings Iran Quds Commander Qassem Soleimani, and Abu Mehdhi Al Muhandis, who were killed in a US drone attack in January 2020, and Iranian nuclear physicist Dr Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who died in a car bomb attack in Iran in November 2020, further cementing the suspicions.On June 15 last year, the Central anti-terror agency released visuals of two men suspected to be involved in the blast as they were seen roaming near the Israeli Embassy. The agency has not received any leads on the two so far.The Delhi Police’s Special Cell had arrested four Kargil-based students, all in their 20s, on June 23 last year but the Patiala House court granted them bail the next month as nothing incriminating was found against them. Even Israel sent a team of Mossad agents to Delhi to exchange leads with the NIA in April.The NIA official quoted above said that the investigations are going on, and added that they are examining all possibilities, including the role of international players. Officials said several persons who were passing by Abdul Kalam Road that day have been examined in last one year and forensic and technical evidence shared has been analysed to look for clues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhia-year-on-little-headway-in-israeli-embassy-blast-probe-101643394487524.html
28-01-2022||Mumbai||Earth moving work in Powai lake a violation of court orders, say activists||Following complaints by activists that earth moving work inside the boundaries of the Powai lake has resumed since January 26, city-based NGO Vanashakti has written to authorities saying the work is in contravention of recent court orders. Vanashakti, also a petitioner in recently disposed NGT cases seeking protection for the water body, has also provided geo-tagged pictures of the ongoing work dated January 26 and 27.“The Hon’ble National Green Tribunal has passed a judgement on how restoration of lake and protection of the crocodile habitat should be done... Please note that all acts being done presently are contrary to the directions given by Hon’ble NGT and also the orders of the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay in PIL 87 of 2013,” Vanashakti director Stalin D wrote to the district collector, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), and the forest department on Friday. “This work is going on at night also. The committee set up by Hon’ble NGT has to approve activities proposed to be undertaken and also the court orders have to be complied with,” the letter said.“The NGT this month constituted an eight-member committee to draft an action plan for the lake, keeping the wetland rules in mind, to ensure sewage ingress into the lake is stopped, and also to suggest ways for conservation of Indian marsh crocodiles which live in the lake. Without the permission of this committee, no work can go on inside the lake. As per the NGT’s directions, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the forest department (wildlife), and the State Wetland Authority are responsible for taking action,” said Zoru Bhatena, a city-based environmentalist who has been tracking the matter.Vanashakti has also complained about the use of glyphosate-containing herbicides in the lake. On January 12, the Union environment ministry instructed the state government, via its State Wetland Authority, to act on these complaints. In a letter to the assistant municipal commissioner, S Ward, on November 2 last year, the MPCB had allowed the use of glyphosate for destruction of water hyacinths in the lake. This permission was subject to certain conditions, namely that the BMC will stop the ingress of raw sewage into the lake, and carry out regular bioaccumulation studies along with water and sediment analysis reports, and submit reports of the same to the MPCB.The BMC had in August last year floated a tender for removal of water hyacinths at Ganesh Ghat, Pawarwadi, and other areas of the Powai lake to make space for immersion during Ganesh Chaturthi. The following month, the BMC launched a pilot project as part of which drones were used to spray glyphosate on 2 per cent of the lake’s water spread area affected by water hyacinths between September 3 and 5. Based on the success of the programme, larger quantities of glyphosate are set to be used, along the lines of a similar project in Aurangabad’s Salim Ali lake, executed by the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation.“The lake is a crocodile habitat. You need to seek necessary clearances from the wildlife department, which the BMC has clearly not done. Water hyacinths are invasive, but to remove them you need to first stop the entry of raw sewage into the lake, which has also not been achieved by the BMC. The effective way to tackle the issue is through arresting the pollution source, not introducing known contaminants into a natural environment,” Stalin D said.BMC officials did not respond to requests for comment. An official with the MPCB, however, said, “The NGT order should be followed as instructed. We will look into the complaint and take it up with the State Wetland Authority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/earth-moving-work-in-powai-lake-a-violation-of-court-orders-say-activists-101643394486233.html

The girl has been admitted to Pavana hospital and her condition is reported to be critical.The incident took place near the main market at Talegaon Dabhade on Friday and the accused identified as Shivam Shelke has been arrested by the police. Shelke was produced before a local court which remanded him to police custody for five days on Friday.Chitra Kishor Wagh, state vice-president of the BJP, said, “The accused hit the girl on the head with a hammer in the market in broad daylight. This attack could have been avoided. There is a need to take immediate action against inactive police personnel which led to this gruesome and life-threatening incident.”The incident has evoked sharp reactions from women social activists, including the deputy chairperson of the Maharashtra Legislative Council, Neelam Gorhe. “It is a shocking incident which has come to light in Talegaon where a young man attacked a minor girl out of one-sided love. After lodging a complaint, the police counselled the accused and took a written bond from him stating that he will not commit any such crime again,” she said.Gorhe expressed satisfaction over the action taken by the police. However, she opined that the “Shakti Act” should be passed as soon as possible to curb such incidents. “Children also need to be nurtured by the family. If something is not given to them, the children become aggressive. At that time, parents need to cultivate restraint and conscience in their children. If this does not happen, then the law must be enacted soon,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/spurned-youth-hits-girl-on-head-with-hammer-arrested-in-pune-101643394306070.html
28-01-2022||Delhi||Flyovers, underpasses in plan to smoothen west Delhi snarl hot spot||The state Public Works Department (PWD) plans to build two one-way flyovers, two underpasses for two-wheelers, three slip roads, widen a rail overbridge, build two foot overbridges, footpaths, as well as a non-motorised vehicle lane in a series of major interventions to curb snarls around west Delhi’s Peeragarhi intersection -- identified as a congestion hot spot by a Supreme Court monitoring committee in 2020.A senior PWD official aware of the matter said a 3.6-km-long corridor on Rohtak Road (NH10) -- between Jwalapuri signal to Jwala Heri signal -- along the Metro’s Green Line is just 60 metres wide, and has four signals - at Jwalapuri, Mandir Road, Peeragarhi intersection and Jwala Heri. “The road is not wide enough to accommodate the heavy traffic on the stretch, which is surrounded by industrial areas on one side, including Udyog Nagar, Mundka and Mangolpuri, and residential areas such as Paschim Vihar on the other. Four traffic intersections on a short corridor add to the congestion,” the official said, asking not to be named.What adds to the congestion at Peeragarhi junction is heavy pedestrian movement, on-street parking, presence of multiple banquet halls, and unhindered incoming traffic on the signal-free corridor from Vikaspuri to Wazirabad joining the rush.“The corridor provides a free ride on the stretch, but the narrow Mangolpuri railway overbridge (ROB) on the northern side of the Peeragarhi junction, is a bottleneck,” said the official. The agency now plans to add three lanes on either side of the Mangolpuri ROB on Outer Ring Road to de-clutter the congestion point.The PWD official said the agency has planned interventions on all sides of the main junction to ensure a lasting solution to the area’s persistent traffic problem.At the main junction, the agency will provide slip roads for traffic heading from Mangolpuri towards Punjabi Bagh; for vehicles from Punjabi Bagh towards Vikaspuri; and from Nangloi towards Vikaspuri, the official said.Two one-way flyovers at Mandir Road-Rohtak Road intersection are on the drawing board, and two one-way underpasses for two-wheelers will be built near the Jwala Heri traffic signal.“The flyovers, each 600-metre-long and 20-metre-wide, will be built over Lakshmi Narayan Mandir Road... The two underpasses will each be 120-metres-wide, with a U-turn radius of 13 metres. Each lane would be of 6.6m width and it will only be meant for movement of light motor vehicles. Those going to Jwala Heri from NH-10 will not have to wait at the signal,” the official said.The transit corridor proposal also takes into account improving pedestrian access through two foot overbridges near Peeragarhi junction, table-top zebra crossings and 2.5-metre-wide footpaths along the 3.6km corridor.“Each FOB will land near green belts which will be separated from traffic lanes through boulders and railings. A non-motorised vehicle lane of 2.5 metres has also been proposed which will also help in prevent jaywalking,” the official added. The plan makes provision of rainwater harvesting tanks under flyover and soft-areas on traffic islands which will be used in growing greenery on metro pillars and piers. HT has seen a copy of the plan.A senior PWD official said the budgetary constraints induced by the pandemic has delayed the implementation of the plan, which is now likely to be initiated in next financial year. While the Delhi government had initially set aside ₹20 crore to start the project this year, the budget was later cut to ₹20 lakh in the revised allocation, according to a senior PWD official.The budget for PWD projects has been cut by ₹471.3 crore in 2021-22 as the government turned its attention to spending on more crucial projects to help combat the pandemic, the official said.Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning in the School of Planning and Architecture, said the NH10 corridor has a mix of industrial and residential traffic due to a common access. He said the PWD should learn from Delhi-Meerut expressway, and segregate the commercial traffic, otherwise the revamp will not have he desired impact. He said since a large number of cyclists use this road, separate arrangement for non-motorised lanes should be ensured. “Segregation of industrial traffic will also lead to reduction in accidents. The stretch is nightmare during night,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/flyovers-underpasses-in-plan-to-smoothen-west-delhi-snarl-hot-spot-101643394304857.html
28-01-2022||Lucknow||NITI Aayog member highlights efforts to improve doc-patient ratio||India has scarcity of specialist doctors compared to developed nations, said Dr Vinod K Paul, member, NITI Aayog on Friday. Delivering the 4th Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Memorial Oration (online lecture), ‘Toward Adequate Medical Workforce in India: Creating opportunities by transforming capacity and regulation’ organised by King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Dr Paul highlighted the efforts of NITI Aayog in improving the scenario.He said, “In developed countries, 75% of healthcare is provided by specialists. However, in India, there is 2-5 times deficit of specialists, compared to developed nations. If we want to fill this deficit, at the current rate, it will require many decades. Therefore, more post-graduates/more specialists should be trained every day.”“Every bed (in medical institutions) should be used not only for providing care to patients but also for training doctors,” said Dr Paul. He said the NITI Aayog is making efforts to take the number of post-graduate medical seats in the country up from 55,595 to one lakh. The National Board of Examinations (NBE), which offers postgraduate training (DNB, FNB), has huge scope to fill this shortage of PG seats because DNB/FNB training is more apprentice based.He said that the current WHO norm is 1:1000 per population. “By 2024, we, in India, are near to achieving it. But we as doctors should pitch for 1.5:1000,” he said.Lt Gen (Dr) Bipin Puri, vice-chancellor of the KGMU, thanked Dr VK Paul for delivering this oration.Sharing new attempts from NITI Aayog, Dr Paul said SRESTA (Scheme for Re-deployment of Superannuated Teachers of the AFMS) is being implemented. Under this scheme, retired medical teachers of the armed forces medical services will be registered in a pool. The officers in this resource pool will be termed as SRESTA National Medical Faculty (SNMF). Other reforms that are in the pipeline include fee fixation, national exit examination MBBS in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/niti-aayog-member-highlights-efforts-to-improve-doc-patient-ratio-101643394244402.html

28-01-2022||Lucknow||New pension scheme better than the old one: UP chief secretary||The state government on Friday sought to convince its personnel that the National Pension Scheme (NPS) was comparatively better and more remunerative than the old one. “We found that the amount of money that a government employee receives under the NPS after retirement was quite greater than the one got under the old pension scheme and one could always earn money by investing the same money in saving schemes,” said chief secretary DS Mishra in a statement issued after he held a meeting with additional chief secretary (ACS), personnel and ACS, finance, here.The meeting was held in the light of various employees’ organisations demanding restoration of the old pension scheme ahead of assembly polls in the state. “It was also found during the review meeting that the gratuity, leave encashment and group insurance scheme facilities remain intact under the NPS as before and dependants of any employee covered under the NPS have an option to choose the family pension available under the old scheme or the NPS after the pensioner’s death,” the CS said. He further said the dependants of an employee covered under the NPS were eligible for compensatory employment after the death of the employee and the NPS also did not stop one from opening a GPF account in addition to the pension account. Mishra said the employees had to contribute only 10% of their salary to the NPS as their share while the government’s share was 14% and the employees had the option to increase their contribution any time.“Also, the NPS seeks to put the investment risk at the lowest level. Of the total deposited funds, 85% are invested in government securities and 15% are invested through professional fund managers. Presently, the growth of the money deposited under the NPS is 9.5% compared to 7.1% of money under the GPF,” he said.Meanwhile, the chief secretary directed the nodal officers of 31 “sensitive” districts to visit districts allotted to them between January 31 and February 4 to review the management of stray cattle, and progress of paddy procurement and Covid-19 vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/new-pension-scheme-better-than-the-old-one-up-chief-secretary-101643393704733.html
28-01-2022||Pune||26K BEd seats remain vacant after first CAP round||PUNE: After completion of the Common Admission Process (CAP) round for various professional courses in the state, a total 26,376 seats for the Bachelor of Education (BEd) course and 9,513 seats for the three years’ law course are still vacant. Despite the New Year having started, the admission process of the state Common Entrance Test (CET) cell for professional courses is still underway even as the response this year to courses in education has been very poor. The reasons for this include the Teachers’ Eligibility Test (TET) certificate scam and less job opportunities in the field. Similarly, a large number of seats are still vacant for the three year and five year law courses as per the state CET cell statistics.As per the data shared by the state CET cell, the first CAP round for professional courses including education, physical education and law has been completed. The B.Ed. course has the highest number of vacant seats (26,376) followed by the three year law course (9,513) and the five year law course (7,487). As compared to the available seats in the Masters in Physical Education and Masters in Education courses, very few students have taken admission in the same.Senior education activist-professor Dnyaneshwar Bhosale said, “There are many reasons behind the low number of admissions in the B.Ed. and M.Ed. courses this year and since the last few years. Already due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many schools and colleges have removed a large number of teachers and faculty as they cannot pay their salaries. Also there are not much job opportunities in this field, so even students don’t want to opt for a career in which there is no financial stability.”About the admission process still underway, Ravindra Jagtap, Maharashtra CET cell chairman, said, “We are continuously monitoring the admission process of all professional courses and soon by next month, the other remaining rounds for the law and educational courses will be complete. But there is less number of admissions this year to the education courses.”While students are unhappy with the delayed process of admissions, Kedar Makwana, who has applied for the five years’ law course, said, “I want to pursue further studies in law for which I had given the state CET entrance examination for the law course. The New Year has started and still, the admission process for the law courses is underway. It is too much delayed now and I have not yet got admission confirmed in any of the colleges.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/26k-bed-seats-remain-vacant-after-first-cap-round-101643393645702.html
28-01-2022||Pune||Fewer tests spike Pune’s positivity rate to 50% as dist depends on govt labs||Pune: Fewer tests have pushed Pune’s Covid weekly positivity rate, at 49.9%, to just double than the state average and also one of the highest in the country. Though new Covid cases are stabilising or going down, tests being conducted have been restricted due to the district administration’s limitation to test the samples only at government labs. Although thousands of samples could be collected for testing, the district administration can only test a limited number of samples at the designated government labs. The same laboratories are also responsible for genome sequencing and research work. Unlike Mumbai which started its own genome sequencing and testing laboratories in its own civic hospitals, Pune is yet to get a laboratory and is planning to get one sooner. In the week between January 20 and January 26, the district saw 161,216 RT-PCR Covid tests being conducted of which 78,763 tested positive and the positivity rate for that week stood at 48.9% while the state’s positivity rate for the same time stood at 29.9%. Although Pune has the highest number of national laboratories which also form a major part of the national Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), the labs are responsible for testing and genome sequencing while in Mumbai the civic body controls two of the labs which have the testing facilities, namely Kasturba and KEM hospital. However, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is limited in its testing abilities as much as the testing abilities of these labs. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer at PMC, said, “We send samples to the three national government labs at National Institute of Virology (NIV), Indian Institute of Science and Education Research (IISER) and BJ Medical College and also the university microbiology department lab. We have a capacity of about 3,500 RT-PCR tests at these labs and about 2,000 rapid antigen tests (RAT). The remaining tests results come from private laboratories which people voluntarily get tested at.” Dr Wavare said that the civic body was planning to get a testing laboratory for its hospital with about 200 testing capacity, however, the plan to yet to be executed and is at a nascent stage. Another senior health official from the district administration said, “The sample collected in rural areas are sent to NIV, BJ Medical College and to the newly opened Baramati Medical College which totally have a RT-PCR testing capacity of about 4,500 daily for rural areas which RAT testing capacities depend on the available RAT kits.” These national testing laboratories are not just involved in testing samples from Pune and also genome sequencing the labs also have to test samples from the neighbouring districts of Satara, Solapur and Ahmednagar. Despite two years of pandemic, the Pune administration has not been able to start its exclusive testing laboratories which will not only increase its testing capabilities but also get quicker result and help to improve research and get localised results and solutions. District labs The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) approved government labs in Pune districts are; ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC), BJ Medical College, Command Hospital (SC), ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), National Centre for Cell Sciences (NCCS), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Agharkar Research Institute and Government Medical College, Baramati||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fewer-tests-spike-pune-s-positivity-rate-to-50-as-dist-depends-on-govt-labs-101643393344434.html

In the PIL, it was claimed that the religious congregations in the past two years were found responsible for spreading the deadly virus across the country.The PIL petition requested the high court to direct the state government to restrict the number of devotees who will take a holy dip in the Ganga during the ongoing Magh Mela at Prayagraj. The petition said that only seers of ‘akharas’ should be allowed to take the holy dip on the dates of the ‘”Shahi Snan” to prevent huge turnout of devotees as anticipated on those auspicious dates.During the course of hearing, the additional advocate general representing the state government submitted that the government had already issued guidelines to be followed by the devotees coming to the Magh Mela. He further submitted that a separate Prayagraj Mela Authority had been set up to monitor all arrangements and check rush of people at one place.He further submitted that to advise people to take all precautions and not to create rush at Mela areas, they will issue public notices by different means of communication apprising the devotees and the prospective devotees of the restrictions and guidelines issued by the government for the purpose. On the stand taken by counsel for the state government, the court disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/allahabad-hc-disposes-of-pil-seeking-check-on-devotees-flow-to-magh-mela-101643393284525.html

28-01-2022||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Pride and Prejudice||For many years, you and your friends have dominated your building society affairs by regularly winning the elections to its managing committee; this had let you influence every decision and determine on all matters big and small in the running of your residential complex: from the hiring and firing of service -providers, to the salaries and duties of the staff, to the menu and arrangements for the much -awaited, annual, building tea party; until now, it had all been conducted according to your wishes.But this year, after having lost the last election to a new set of people, you arrive at the annual tea party and notice to your dismay, that the new secretary and his team have put paid to all the rites and rituals of the previous years, in particular, the ones you had most cherished and were attached to. For instance, instead of being greeted by the sight of your favourite flowers, subdued, artistic lighting and soft, ambient, background music, you find that the new committee has installed garish disco lights and has engaged the services of a wannabe DJ, who is belting out popular Bollywood hits even as you enter the venue. What’s worse is you notice the fresh flowers on the tables have given way to multi- coloured plastic ones, the cream tablecloths have been replaced by maroon velvet drapes and the ultimate abomination in your opinion : the elegant, bite sized asparagus and cucumber sandwiches and cheese canapés which you had so favoured, have given way to spicy samosas, chaat, chole bhature and pav bhaji.Gnashing your teeth and miserable you retreat to a corner, to find solace amongst a few other equally disgruntled erstwhile committee members, to gripe and grumble the evening away.Then, from the corner of your eye you spy a member of the new management committee bounding towards you with a smile of triumph and you begin to prepare a few choice words to convey your displeasure and criticism to deflate him. But, just as you’re about to utter something appropriately snarky and snide- something stops you in your tracks: It’s the thought that the beaming, approaching newly elected committee member –who you’ve barely deigned to notice all these years –and others like him has been suffering your tastes, preferences and decisions, mostly in silence and without much protest until now. This means accepting your insipid lighting choices when he’d longed for flashing disco bulbs, swallowing your bland asparagus canapés when he’d have much preferred spicy pav bhaji and submitting himself to hours of Yanni, when all he’d wanted was to croon along to Yo Yo Honey Singh…The thought hits you like a bolt of lightning and its realisation suddenly makes you humble. You now see yourself through the eyes of the approaching man: As arrogant, privileged entitled and self-serving; so, rather than lashing out, your disapproval you swallow your criticisms and harsh words and try to find something-anything - to appreciate in the new arrangements which he and his committee members have made.Of course, they may not be to your own taste but it appears that they appeal to a sizeable section of your neighbours who perhaps had been overlooked by you when you had been at the helm of things.Since you cannot bring yourself to compliment the choice of music picked for the occasion you are gracious enough to compliment him on the newly installed sound system which you have to admit is an improvement on the previous one.Thus, you swallow your sarcasm along with the samosa and manage a weak smile.***“We often think of peace as the absence of war, that if powerful countries would reduce their weapon arsenals, we could have peace. But if we look deeply into the weapons, we see our own minds- our own prejudices, fears and ignorance.” Said revered Zen master and peace activist Thich Nhat Hanh who died this week. “Even if we transport all the bombs to the moon, the roots of war and the roots of bombs are still there, in our hearts and minds, and sooner or later we will make new bombs.”His words are particularly significant today, when our lives appear to be awash with anger, bitterness, hatred, suspicion and extreme polarisations. Turn on any TV debate, open any social media platform, read any news report and you will encounter a surfeit of cruel and harsh words and thoughts across the board. This level of toxicity is dangerous and unhealthy and we all know that it needs addressing. But of course, none amongst us is prepared to admit that the problem starts with us. We are so convinced that ours is the only correct way of doing things; that our preferences and tastes are the only ones that matter; that we are the only ones whose motives and actions have been above board and bereft of self-interest and self-preservation, and our arrogance, pride and prejudice have made any chance of vitiating the toxicity that surrounds us- virtually impossible.Of course, this doesn’t mean that the members of your newly elected building society managing committee are paragons of virtue either; or that the same self -serving interests, dodgy motives and misguided convictions of how to go about doing things will not compel them as they had you. In fact, they might be even more inept and mala -fide than you were, who knows? It’s just that, it’s their turn now, to do things their way, you’ve had yours, so try and be sensible about it. In fact, see if there’s any common ground for constructive cooperation however flimsy and try to practice basic civility. By doing so, you just might blunt the years of resentment and suspicion you’d created when you rode your high horse over their wants and preferences. And yes, if you or some of the other members of the erstwhile committee are invited to collaborate on a project or two with the new guys, grab the opportunity, it might give you a chance to temper the more objectionable of their choices and actions in future and what do you know - might even convince them to let you choose the music for the next annual tea party...***Building society meetings are a lesson in judiciousness, discretion and human relations. Especially when you’re not on the managing committee any more. How do you replace long held hostilities, suspicions and resentments, (many of them justified) with trust, cooperation and collaboration? How do you transform your so -called ‘enemies’ into friends? How do you meet those you consider as the ‘other’ on common ground, so that they will not disregard and neglect you as you had them earlier? What else can you do, in this situation but try to be as graceful as possible? Be a good neighbour. Enjoy the pani puri, try and understand why Yo Yo is so popular; bide your time.And of course, through it all, never lose sight or determination of your goal: to win the next building society election, so that you can get on that managing committee and decide how things ought to be done once again. And hopefully, this time carrying the hopes and aspirations of more along with you.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-pride-and-prejudice-101643392805032.html
28-01-2022||Lucknow||Focusing on winning over 300 seats in UP under CM Yogi: Dy CM Maurya||Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya has said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will retain power in Uttar Pradesh and that Yogi Adityanath is the chief ministerial candidate of the party and will remain its face in the state. Maurya, who was in Agra on Friday to campaign for party candidates, said at a press conference that BJP will repeat its performance here by winning all nine assembly seats of the district this time too. Replying to a question, the deputy CM said, “We are focusing on winning more than 300 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh and our chief ministerial candidate is Yogi Adityanath. He will remain the face of the BJP and the party is contesting assembly elections under his leadership.” Taking at dig at the Samajwadi Party, he said, “Goonda, mafias and rioters are finding place as candidates in the lists being released by the Samajwadi Party. It is reminding the masses in UP that it is not new Samajwadi Party as claimed by its leader Akhilesh Yadav but in fact it is the same old Samajwadi Party which unleashed lawlessness, riots and ‘goondaism’ in Uttar Pradesh during its previous regime (2012-17).” On SP chief’s poll promise of providing 300 units of free electricity to the people in elected, Maurya said, “Akhilesh Yadav is making a false claim when the masses still remember that there was power crisis during the SP regime and now even villages are electrified. There was development in only five districts during the previous regime but the BJP focused on development in all 75 districts. Welfare schemes which should have been implemented after independence were in fact implemented by double engine regime of BJP.” He also said March 10 (when the counting of votes will take place) will mark the end of the Samajwadi Party. “When they all (SP, BSP and RLD) combined in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP got 51% of vote. Congress is now a party of a handful of leaders interested in getting photographed and they too will leave the party by the next elections,” he claimed. Reacting to the candidature SP leader Azam Khan, Maurya said SP candidates were either on bail or were in jail and on their strength, the SP was contesting elections. “Akhilesh Yadav should stop day dreaming of coming back to power as people have decide to vote for the BJP,” he said. 
28-01-2022||Pune||Younger Covid recoveries complain of “brain fog’’; Pune docs advise counselling||Pune: City neurologists are seeing many young people who have recovered from Covid complain of memory impairment, cognitive functions affected and mental fatigue. These symptoms have been identified as “brain fog” and are more reported among those with ‘white collar’ jobs and whose work is highly dependent on cognitive skills. A recent study published in an international health journal stated that “brain fog” as described by patients could be a potential long term Covid impact which may last for months. However, city neurologists attending to such patients say that it could be treated with placebo nutritional medications and counselling. According to the study by a research team from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), “brain fog” could be due to the virus’ effect on the spinal fluid. Brain fog is an umbrella term used to describe multiple cognitive issues especially among the Covid-recovered patients. Dr Lomesh Bhriud, city-based neurologist, said, “I am still getting patients who have recovered from the second Covid wave. I mostly get patients aged between 30-40 years of age who have not had any comorbidity. The most common symptoms are mental disturbances, low mood for about a month. The treatment includes mostly supplementary placebo medicines and counselling for a couple of weeks.” Dr Rahul Kulkarni, another neurologist, said, “The most common complaints that we get from patients are confusion, memory impairment, memory loss, difficulty to concentrate and other compromised cognitive functions. However, it is also important to note that it could not just be the virus, but multiple variables that are leading to this “brain fog”. The trauma of Covid or the mental stress could also be a cause for this. In the second wave, we saw many patients complaining of this, however, in the third wave these numbers have gone down because the fear is not as much as it was before and also the admission rate has gone down. This condition can be treated through counselling and there are no specific medications for the treatment. We are mostly getting complaints from patients aged between 30-40 years of age.” Dr Nilesh Palasdeokar said the most initial symptoms were headache, dizziness, mood swings, memory issues within 2-3 weeks since the quarantine was over. He said, “The most common factor among all the patients who complain of “brain fog” are mostly those with ‘white collar’ jobs at executive positions. The patients’ complaint that we get is that the they are unable to perform the same level of cognitive functions as earlier. They face lack of concentration, high irritability and are unable to work as efficiently as before. The initial symptoms are forgetting things, taking longer time to do things, lack of same competency. However, it is important to remember that these symptoms are temporary and with the right counselling, the patient can recover completely.” Dr Shripad Pujari, neurologist at a private city hospital who himself is suffering from “brain fog” said, “Despite being a doctor, I myself am suffering from “brain fog” and It took a few months to recover completely. While physical fatigue is well documented in ailments like dengue, swine, chikungunya; mental fatigue could be exclusively attributed to Covid. However, more study is needed to understand this. It could be at the neurological level to understand to connect between the group and the cognitive abilities of human being.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/younger-covid-recoveries-complain-of-brain-fog-pune-docs-advise-counselling-101643392447481.html

28-01-2022||Lucknow||Nadda plays farmer card in Shahjahanpur and Bareilly||LUCKNOW Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda gave momentum to the party’s election campaign in western Uttar Pradesh by organising door-to-door campaigns in Shahjahanpur and Bareilly on Friday. To win support of farmers, Nadda highlighted the pro-farmers’ schemes launched by the BJP government at the centre and in the state in the ‘Prabhavi Matdata Samvad’ organised in both the districts. Terming the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) as “anti-farmers”, Nadda said farmers were harassed under the governments of both parties whereas under the BJP government, the minimum support price of crops was increased and subsidy was given on fertilisers. Nadda also played the farmers card in Shahjahanpur that shares its border with Lakhimpur Kheri, where eight people, including farmers, were killed on October 3 last year while they were staging a protest against the three contentious farm laws. The support of farmers will be decisive in deciding the fate of candidates in the assembly election in both the districts. “What Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done for farmers has not been done by any leader in the country. The budgetary allocation to the agriculture sector has increased under the BJP government. It clearly shows that the BJP is committed for the welfare of farmers. The recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission was implemented with the increase in minimum support price for agriculture products,” he said. Earlier, before the general elections, the Congress party used to promise loan waivers but the BJP launched PM Kisan Samman Nidhi and funds were deposited in the accounts of 10.50 crore farmers across the country. In UP, ₹41,000 crore had been deposited in the accounts of two crore farmers. The Modi government has given 140% subsidy on fertilisers, and the price of fertiliser bag was slashed from ₹2,400 to ₹1,200, added Nadda. “Over 11 crore farmers are registered under the PM crop insurance scheme in the country while 2.70 crore farmers in UP are associated with the scheme. Soil health card has been distributed among 3.70 crore farmers in UP,” he said. Nadda said 45 lakh farmers in UP were getting pension while ₹36,000 crore loans of farmers had been waived. “The Yogi government has made ₹1.40 lakh crore payments to sugarcane farmers. Under SP and BSP governments, sugar mills were sold and closed, but new sugar mills have been set up under the Yogi government and farmers are getting 50% discount in power supply. Today, UP is number one in crop production,” he said. The BJP chief said the SP was giving tickets to candidates who were in jail or out on bail. “The SP chief has extended friendship to tainted politicians but people will reject them in the election. Criminals, gangsters and mafia have been reined in under the BJP government,” he added. 
28-01-2022||Lucknow||Chopper delay from Delhi to Muz’nagar was conspiracy: Akhilesh||LUCKNOW Alleging a conspiracy by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Friday claimed that he was stranded in Delhi as his helicopter was not allowed to fly to UP’s Muzaffarnagar for an election programme. Over two hours later, when the chopper was allowed to fly to the destination, Akhilesh called it a “historic flight to victory.”From the tarmac in New Delhi, Akhilesh posted a picture of him standing with the helicopter and crew in the background, and tweeted in Hindi: “My helicopter has been stopped in Delhi without any reason. It is not being allowed to go to Muzaffarnagar, while a top BJP leader has just flown from here. This is a desperate conspiracy of the losing BJP. People are understanding everything...”“I was in the chopper for over 2 hours... I am hoping that EC looks into it... If someone has to go for a rally, how will they work if their chopper is stopped for so long...seems like BJP will do anything before polls...” added the SP chief. Akhilesh Yadav and his alliance partner RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary were scheduled to address a joint press conference in Muzaffarnagar ahead of the first phase of the seven-phase UP assembly polls beginning on February 10.This was Yadav’s first election trip outside Lucknow since January 14, when the Lucknow police filed an FIR and the Election Commission of India (ECI) issued a notice to the SP over the violation of model code of conduct (MCC) and Covid guidelines issued by the poll body. The January 14 event saw ex-BJP minister Swami Prasad Maurya and others joining Akhilesh’s party at the SP office where an estimated crowd of 2,000-2,500 people had gathered.Half an hour of the first tweet, Akhilesh sent another tweet in which he informed that he had got permission to fly. “Abuse of power is a sign of people losing…this day will also be recorded in the history of socialist struggle! We are going to take a historic flight of victory…,” the SP chief stated.Yadav had departed for Delhi from Lucknow’s Amausi airport at 10:30am in a private plane. He landed at Delhi airport at 11:45pm. From there, he was scheduled to leave for Muzaffarnagar around 12:15pm. However, there was a delay after his helicopter was allegedly stopped in the National Capital. He reached Muzaffarnagar two hours behind schedule.Udaiveer Singh, an SP legislator, said: “The BJP is frustrated and demoralised over its imminent defeat. With this mindset, it has been trying such tricks by misusing police, administration and government machinery. This is not the first time. Earlier, one of SP’s Vijay Yatras too was stopped on the Purvanchal Expressway.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/chopper-delay-from-delhi-to-muz-nagar-was-conspiracy-akhilesh-101643388304507.html

Finally, it landed in agriculture field with wheat crops,” said Basudeo Paswan, a farmer.According to Gaya’s senior superintendent of police Aditya Kumar, police reached the spot after receiving information from Officers Training Academy (OTA) to cordon off the area so that angry farmers don’t meddle with equipment. “One of the aircraft’s wheels had been damaged so it was not in a condition to fly. It was eventually dismantled and taken to OTA,” he said. Sources in the OTA informed that this is practice landing and is part of normal procedure.

A senior finance department official there are over four crore beneficiaries of different social welfare schemes in the state. “There are nearly 2.50 crore students, who get different types of incentives from the education department. More than 80 lakh receive pension. However, the exact total number of beneficiaries is not available as different departments run their schemes on their own,” said the official. In another important decision, the cabinet approved the proposal to offer up to 25% concession in road tax against the vehicles formally declared and dismantled as per the Centre’s scrap policy notified in October last year. As per the cabinet note, the owner of non-commercial vehicles abandoned as scrap are eligible for 25% concession in road tax in case of purchase of new non-commercial vehicles. However, in case of commercial vehicles, the tax concession is 15%. The government also gave its nod to the education department’s proposal to purchase benches and desks of standard specification for 2,803 primary schools at a total cost of ₹99.75 crore. The department will also procure a pair of washable masks for each student, from class 1 to 12th, of all the government schools from Jeevika at the cost of ₹51.76 crore The cabinet also offered administration sanction for building 11 roads totalling 190 kilometres in length covering three Maoist-hit districts of Aurangabad, Banka and Gaya under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna as part of the Centre’s road connectivity project for left wing extremism affected areas. The road construction department had prepared the detailed project reports (DPRs) of the roads to be built at the cost of ₹265.36 crore.

I am myself without a pension for the last four months and it must be affecting every retired person in equal measure. Is it the justice of the Bihar government and universities. I am ashamed that I am part of such a system,” she wrote.What Sinha has written is the agony of hundreds of retired teachers of universities. Not just LNMU, most universities in the state are struggling to pay timely pension to their retired teachers for various reasons.“We don’t have funds to disburse pension. The government had released funds for a one-month pension and three-month salary that we have paid. We don’t have university funds to distribute pension on our own in anticipation of the release of government funds. As soon as we get funds, we will release it,” said LNMU vice-chancellor (VC) SP Singh.An education department official said that LNMU had been released funds for pension up to September last year. “It is the biggest university and there was some shortfall in funds. Every university has a different requirement. There was some shortfall in the case of some universities. The LNMU will gets funds for October to February in one go soon. We have already released salary grants up to February for all universities and pension funds will also be released within a few days,” he said.JP University (Chapra) also has a pension backlog since November last year. In Magadh University, where there has been turmoil for the last three months since the Special Vigilance Unit (SVU) raids on the residence of its vice-chancellor Rajendra Prasad, pension for December is due even as January is drawing to a close.“Pension up to November has been paid. As soon as we get funds for December, we will release it,” said MU finance officer Satyaratna Prasad.However, some widows, who lost their husbands to Covid 8-9 months ago, are still awaiting continuance of their revised pension in their name in MU. Besides, the retired teachers are still awaiting their 7th pay arrears, even as the Bihar government failed to get ₹383-crore reimbursement of 7th pay from the Centre due to delay in proposal submission.

Recent developments in bio-based plasticisers have led to their use as additives for various applications. In my study I found that when these bio-based plasticisers are used they harm these organisms less,” said Shaha.Phthalates are used in food packaging, medical devices, and other common products. They leach out and accumulate in the products and thus are regarded as one of the significant environmental pollutants.Shaha added that her research included the effect of these plasticisers on C. circumdatus, an insect also popularly known as the blood worms.“Blood worms are aquatic insects and live near freshwater bodies which have polluted water. These bloodworms are used to study water pollution as they are known to breed in that environment. We found that the environment of these bloodworms was stressed as synthetic plasticisers were used. Whereas the bio-based plasticisers had less stress on these organisms as they can be utilised by living organisms,” said Shaha.The bio-based plasticiser used in the research was Ethanolamine. Shaha also added that in her previous studies it was found that several synthetic plasticisers like diethyl and dioctyl have adverse effects on these organisms.“To reduce the changes mediated by these plasticisers, larvae of these insects produced certain changes in the levels of antioxidants and detoxifying enzymes. There was an increase in the enzyme activities of certain enzymes during post-exposure recovery conditions indicating that these enzymes play an important role in helping these insects to adapt to plasticiser contaminated environments,” revealed the research.Dr Radhakrishna Pandit, guide and researcher, professor at the zoology department at SPPU, said that plasticisers work differently on aquatic ecosystems.“Synthetic plasticisers creating stress on insects. This research paper highlights how these insects adapt to the stresses. From an environmental point of view, the research has important insights. We have tried to understand how these insects use antioxidants to adapt. Bio-based plasticisers are a good alternative to synthetic plasticisers. They are also cheaper to manufacture and put less stress on the environment of these insects. In the future, students can try and understand how these plasticizers can affect human beings,” said Pandit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/biobased-plasticisers-less-harmful-to-environment-says-research-101643386930946.html

In letters addressed to the state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and BMC chief Iqbal Chahal demanding normalcy be brought back to schools, the parent groups have asked for school buses to start plying.“Despite having SOPs in place, several private schools are resisting reopening of schools at 50% capacity and making excuses instead. We request the government to once again send a clear direction to institutes to follow guidelines,” states the letter signed by members of the Maharashtra English School Trustees Association (MESTA) and Parents Association of Mumbai (PMA). Among other demands made by parents, one is the need for schools buses to ply regularly. “Schools are running in shifts and conducting physical classes only for a few hours so without school buses, it is becoming impossible to pick up and drop children every day for parents,” added the letter.The School Bus Owners’ Association (SBOA) had for long decided not to ply buses unless the government agrees to a tax rebate for the two years that schools remained shut and buses were not used. “The state cabinet recently approved our demand for a tax rebate and we have now requested all SBOA members to start functioning normally. Bus owners might take a week to ensure Covid protocols are followed and only then we will start regular work hours,” said Anil Garg, president of the association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/parent-groups-want-schools-buses-to-start-plying-101643386627047.html
28-01-2022||Mumbai||Minor daughter not a property to be given away as Daan: HC||Mumbai: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court sought the urgent intervention of a district Child Welfare Committee (CWC) after a routine bail application hearing of two men charged with sexually assaulting a 17-year-old, revealed that the minor’s father had “donated” her to a self-styled godman with a “daanpatra” or a donation deed. The CWC submitted its report to the court last week and the matter has been posted for hearing on February 4. The survivor had lodged a complaint of sexual assault against two residents of a village in Badnapur taluka of Jalna district on August 13, 2021 following which the Badnapur police station registered a first information report (FIR) under sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act against the two accused. During the legal proceedings against the accused, an affidavit filed by the survivor’s father included a deed executed by him on August 29, 2018, that stated he offered his daughter to a self-styled godman residing in the village temple as “donation”. “When the girl as per her own statement is minor, then why does the father, who is in all respect the guardian of the girl, give the girl as daan? A girl is not a property which can be given in donation,” justice Vibha Kankanwadi observed. The single-judge bench hearing the bail applications of Shankeshwar (alias Shambhu Dhakne) and Sopan Dhanke through advocates SS Thombre and BP More respectively was told that the duo was falsely implicated. The advocates informed the bench that the duo had taken part in a Badnapur gram sabha which passed a resolution that the priest of the village temple, referred to as “baba”, and his disciples who consumed narcotics, should be asked to leave. They said that the complaint was filed against them on the behest of “baba”. The survivor lived in the temple premises with her father, along with the “baba” and other disciples, the accused stated. The court had asked the minor’s father to file an affidavit on December 8, 2021, but it was filed by the “baba” instead due to a mistake part of the survivor’s lawyers. The affidavit, however, contained a daanpatra in stamp paper, executed on August 29, 2018 between the father of the girl and the self-styled godman, which stated that the father had given his daughter in donation to him and the “kanyadan” [donation of a virgin; also a common reference to marriage] was done in “presence” of god. The affidavit further stated that after the girl’s mother died, her father had given her up for adoption to the godman in 2018, but the adoption deed was not executed. Disturbed by this the bench observed, “This court is concerned with the future of the minor girl and in view of such document coming forward, we can’t shut our eyes.” Adding that “it required to interfere” in view of the “actions taken by father of the girl in executing a daanpatra” the judge said, “this is in view of the future of the girl and she should not be driven to do any illegal activities.” Observing that the probe in the case was over and the charge sheet was filed, the bench granted bail on stringent conditions to the two accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/minor-daughter-not-a-property-to-be-given-away-as-daan-hc-101643386565345.html

After a protest was held by workers supported by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) salaries were given paid in phases.A woman security worker, on condition of anonymity, said, “Due to Covid-19 pandemic we are already suffering financially and now if salaries of over three months are not given how can we live. I have borrowed money from my relatives and my husband is also jobless, in such a situation we are struggling to survive.”Vinod Pawar, secretary of NCP city wing, said, “On Friday we met senior PMC officials demanding to clear the salaries of these contract staff immediately. They have assured us to pay it and also take strict action against the contractor responsible for the salaries. Also, if needed they are going to blacklist the contractor as repeated complaints are coming against him.”The security agency was changed midway and neither the old nor the new agency is taking the responsibility to pay them.“We will be continuously taking a follow-up of the issue and strict action should be taken against the contractor. These security staff have worked day and night during the pandemic, so PMC should also clear their pending salaries immediately,” added Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/salaries-of-1-500-contractual-staff-of-pmc-pending-from-three-months-101643386564104.html

28-01-2022||Mumbai||BJP attacks govt over wine sale in supermarkets, Congress points to similar decision in MP||Mumbai: The war of words between the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the government’s decision to allow the retail sale of wine in walk-in shops and supermarkets continued on Friday. On Thursday, former chief minister and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said the government was converting Maharashtra into ‘Madya Rashtra’ or a nation of liquor. He alleged that while liquor was being made cheaper, there was no relief in the prices of petrol and diesel. “We won’t allow Maharashtra to become ‘Madya’ Rashtra’,” he said. Congress leader Sachin Sawant said the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh under Shivraj Singh Chouhan had taken a similar decision that covered not just wine made from grapes, mead, fruits and flowers, but all kinds of liquor. “Sir, pls hv a glimpse at our neighbouring state which has already become “Madya Pradesh” under BJP CM @ChouhanShivraj,” Sawant tweeted.“To promote wine industry and help farmers in Maharashtra, permission is given for selling only wine. But in MP, all types of liquor will be sold in supermarkets. Also, home stock can be increased. Liquor shops will be called composite shops,” said Sawant, while asking if the BJP had a strategy to oppose liquor while in opposition and promote its consumption when in power.Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut on Friday said those opposing the decision are anti-farmer. “Wine is a product manufactured from the fruits cultivated by the farmers.” He said a rise in sale and export of wine would ensure good returns for the farmers who cultivated grape, chikoo, cashew nut, guava and grain. Sambhajirao Bhide Guruji, who heads the right-wing Shivaprathisthan Hindustan, attacked the government and called this decision “shameless, anti-national, anti-religion, immoral, and dangerous.” Bhide added that he would request Governor B.S. Koshyari to dismiss this government. Bandatatya Karhadkar, who is a leader of the warkari sect, sarcastically congratulated the government and urged it to introduce wine in the midday meal scheme in schools instead of nutritious food.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-attacks-govt-over-wine-sale-in-supermarkets-congress-points-to-similar-decision-in-mp-101643385544205.html

Recently, when five persons in the village died, the police booked him.The accused was identified as Pandurang Gholap. Social organisers claim that there are many such bogus doctors in the area.Dinesh Jadhav from Adivasi Kranti Sena, an NGO, said, “In this week, five villagers, including a three-month-old pregnant woman, of Milhe Katkarwadi and Dhasai village lost their lives suddenly while they were taking treatment under Gholap. After their condition worsened, they went to other hospitals when their families realised they had initially received the wrong treatment. We have a government hospital 5km away where we only get treatment for fever, cough, and basic things, and it’s difficult for the poor to travel to Thane Civil Hospital because of which they prefer to take treatment here.”Assistant police inspector, Santosh Darade said, “We have arrested the accused, Gholap, under IPC 304A and other sections of IPC. He gave medicines to five patients after which all of them became serious in a period of two weeks and all of them lost their lives.

28-01-2022||Lucknow||Won’t allow any “black laws” passed by BJP to be implemented in UP: Akhilesh||MEERUT Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Friday promised the farmers of Uttar Pradesh that the SP-RLD alliance would not allow any “black laws” passed by the BJP to be implemented in the state.“I still don’t understand why they brought the three farm bills and thereafter scrapped them without explaining their action. It was done for votes,” stated Yadav while cautioning farmers that the BJP could bring in any law without informing people. He was addressing his first joint press conference with RLD chief and his ally in the election, Jayant Chaudhary, in Muzaffarnagar. The Samajwadi Party president said that he and Rashtriya Lok Dal’s Jayant Chaudhary were “farmers’ sons”, who will fight for the farmers till the end. Yadav stated that his connection with the farmers was the reason why he always carried a “laal topi and a laal potli” in his pocket.“I carry an ‘ann sankalp’ to defeat them (BJP) and make them run away,” the SP chief added.Yadav also declared to create a corpus and revolving fund from the state budget to ensure timely payment of sugarcane dues of farmers, if his party was voted to power in the UP Assembly elections.He announced to establish a Kisan Shaheed Memorial in Meerut in memory of farmers who lost their lives during the yearlong agitation. Yadav demanded Bharat Ratna for former Prime Minister and late farmer leader Charan Singh. “This highest civilian award should be given to Charan Singh,” he said.“This UP election is for the future of farmers, youths and people should defeat negative forces in order to keep the ‘Ganga-Jamuni’ culture alive,” he said, adding that the RLD-SP alliance will come out with a spectacular victory in the election because people had made up their mind for a change. Promising 300 units of free electricity and irrigation facility to farmers, the SP chief said: “The payment of sugarcane dues has always been a major issue. After forming government, a corpus fund would be created from the budget to ensure timely payment of sugarcane dues. I will ensure payment in 15 days.”Attacking the BJP over its ‘tamanchawadi’ remark against the SP and its leaders, Yadav targeted the chief minister without naming him and said: “He is the BJP’s first CM who had so many cases against him and the deputy CM had even more cases. And they call those ‘tamanchawadi’ who don’t have a single case against them.” Taking a jibe at chief minister Yogi Adityanath, he said: “Babaji was demanding ticket from Mathura and Ayodhya, but was sent back home.”The SP chief claimed that the law and order situation had deteriorated in UP during BJP’s rule, which was evident by the fact that the state received maximum notices from the human rights commission. He also accused the BJP of raising old issues and insulting unemployed youth. “If youths are out on the roads for jobs, it is the government’s fault. This time it would be BJP’s ‘political migration’,” stated Yadav. Without naming Amit Shah who used his saliva during distribution of BJP’s pamphlets, he said: “They are distributing pamphlets to spread corona and the election commission should take note of this.” RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary raised the issue of election commission’s delay in giving permission to video vans of party candidates. He also accused government department heads of demanding voter ID cards for submission of ballot papers and cautioned employees to give completed ballot papers instead of providing ID in order to prevent bogus voting on their names. Akhilesh Yadav also supported Chaudhary’s allegations and said similar practice was adopted by officials during the panchayat elections, saying that that he would lodge a complaint in this regard with the ECI. Both the leaders appealed to the people to ensure victory of the SP-RLD alliance candidates on all six seats of Muzaffarnagar district.Reacting to Yadav’s statement, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said: “None needs to stop you Akhileshji. People are ready to stop you as they did in 2014, in 2017 and in 2019 polls. Stop this drama and brace for March 10, when people will make you see the reality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/wont-allow-any-black-laws-passed-by-bjp-to-be-implemented-in-up-akhilesh-101643384944116.html

However, the final area was much less than promised.The residents, with the help of former independent corporator, Arun Geeth, gave a tough fight against the KDMC for over a decade, after which Civil Judge, Sonali Sashikant Raul, ordered them to file a complaint against them on January 18.The 18 includes five ex-commissioners – Govind Bodke, Govind Rathod, E Ravindran, Ramnath Sonawane and SS Bhise.Manik Colony went for redevelopment in 2004, when a permission to build a high rise was given to the developer. According to the court order, the civic officials favoured the builder (developer), violating all rules and regulations, and promising a different area to the residents than what they actually received. They allowed the developer to carry out the construction without following any rules.After Manik Colony residents received the houses with areas different from what was mentioned in the contract, they ran from pillar to post but no one listened to them. A senior officer from Bazarpeth police station, said, “We have registered a case against 18 people as per the court order. We have started our investigation, but no arrest has been made.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kalyan-court-orders-police-to-book-18-kdmc-officials-including-5-former-commissioners-for-cheating-101643384044041.html

But, sports academies in Delhi-NCR share that they have been inundated with enquires since this Covid wave hit. Gyms in the city are closed, and it seems that residents are taking to sports to stay fit. “Not just enquiries, even bookings have increased by 50%,” says Sachin Singh, from Play Tennis Academy, adding: “People seem to have understood that the virus is here to stay for longer, and realised that sports is the only thing that they can do to continue to stay fit and build their health. Guess that’s why a lot of new queries have been coming our way, with the interest to join.” Sharad Kumar, from Progressive Tennis Academy, informs that he had closed his academy due to the sudden increase in Covid cases, but is being compelled to reopen it sooner than he had planned. “We are getting calls and messages, and people are asking, ‘Why are you not opening?’ ‘When will it open?’ Every day we would get calls and not from our old students but also from new people who want to enrol themselves with us. So we will now reopen sooner than what was planned,” he adds.Being a safe form of physical exercise, sports is also luring people to enrol themselves alongside their young ones. “My daughter goes for tennis coaching. Honestly at this point of time, there is nothing better than sports activities for kids as it helps them improve their stamina and somewhere a better immune system as well,” says Dwarka-based Vaibhav Khattar, who works in banking and insurance. He adds: “Children are still not going to school and there is a constant mental pressure at home, with so many online classes to attend. Of course we were worried to send her outside, initially when the Covid cases restarted to rise, but then we realised that sports in the open are pretty safe to pursue. And that’s what gave us the confidence to allow her to play, as she pursues her passion.” Rajan Rajpal, a coach with Apex Table Tennis Academy, says while he teaches an indoor sport for which the turn out is slow at present, but that has made many book their slots in advance. “Since this Omicron variant is mild, queries didn’t take much time to pick up. In fact, people are already booking slots with us for even for February, in the anticipation that those might get filled up with the lessening impact of the virus. Like if we used to have 25-30 players playing simultaneously in one room before Covid, now we are not allowing more than seven to eight players at a time. And if the players are adults, we are also checking their vaccination status. All this also fills up the spots faster,” informs Rajpal.And some coaches feel that overdoing isn’t the right way to go about it. “Queries have increased but there are government restrictions in place, and we feel we need to stop people from crowding the place. We cannot take too many players at the same time,” says Bhupinder Singh, a coach from Pickskills Basketball Academy, confirming that the sudden rise in requests has made them refuse quite a few bookings. “Also, the kids have become more regular as compared to earlier. And for parents, right now such physical activities have become as important as studies and they seem to be enforcing the same thought in their children as well,” he opines.Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sports-fever-soaring-delhi-ncr-academies-report-surge-101643383688221.html
28-01-2022||Mumbai||Former defence personnel and kin of martyrs to be tax exempt by BMC||Mumbai: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to exempt municipal tax to former defence personnel, kin of martyrs and army officials who have won gallantry medals during their services and are residing within the jurisdiction of the Mumbai civic body. Standing committee of the civic body cleared the proposal on Friday and this will come into effect from the next financial year starting April 1. Senior officials of the BMC said that to avail the benefits, the servicemen will have to obtain certificates from the Sainik Welfare office or a domicile certificate to the local ward office, that would state that they have been living in Maharashtra for more than 15 years now.The officials also said that only one property registered under their name will be eligible for this scheme.“We don’t know how many eligible citizens will be benefited under this scheme as the registration process has not started yet. We will only come to know about the figures once citizens start registering themselves,” said Sunil Dhamane, joint municipal commissioner on Friday.The property tax has 13 components under its bracket which includes eight components of the BMC that includes the general property tax, water tax, water benefit tax, street tax and sewerage tax amongst other components. The remaining five components are various cess imposed by the state government.The proposal also pointed out that property owners will have to pay the remaining five components imposed by the state government as they have not been relaxed.Earlier in August 2021, a similar proposal was tabled in the civic standing committee. According to the earlier proposal, an exemption of general property tax was proposed for the army professionals and their kins. This proposal was referred by the committee back then and the administration was told to revise and table it again. Following which, a new proposal was tabled in the committee on Friday.According to the new proposal, former defence personnel, kin of martyrs and army officials who have won gallantry medals during their tenure of service will be exempted from paying all the municipal taxes that fall under the property tax category. The BMC’s proposal comes in effect following a state government notification of September 2020. In the notification, the government had ordered exemption of property tax for all former defence personnel. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) meanwhile have demanded in the meeting that all the five components should also be exempted by the state government.Besides this, the committee also cleared a ₹70 lakh proposal for carrying out restoration and renovation works of a century old Pyau (Water Fountain) in Central Mumbai’s Prabhadevi area.The restoration works will include polishing the surface, repairing the broken and damaged components and replacing it with replicas along with landscaping the premises of the pyau and the footpath on which it has been constructed. The BMC also said that the pyau which has been lying defunct since past many years will be made operational as well.The BMC has appointed Vaastu Vidhan Project as the architect and consultant for this project and the completion is likely to take 36 months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/former-defence-personnel-and-kin-of-martyrs-to-be-tax-exempt-by-bmc-101643382185136.html
28-01-2022||Mumbai||With no bridge, villagers forced to use rickety path to cross dam in Kalyan||Kalyan For the people of Apati village in Kalyan, travelling to nearby cities for work is a risky affair as they have to take a broken pathway or balance on makeshift iron planks across a low head dam to reach Ambernath, Badlapur and Taloja industrial region. Some villagers even carry their bicycles and two-wheelers in groups while they cross this risky path. With the only alternative road being more than 25 km away, 2,000 villagers of Apati and 10 other villages endanger their life to earn a livelihood as the authorities failed to construct a bridge over the river.  While returning from work at night, villagers search the pathway with one hand and hold a torch on the other to see it clearly as the path submerges completely in the water. Moreover, the alternate road is over 25 kilometres away and villagers have to pay ₹200 for travelling, which most cannot afford. Whereas crossing the pathway and taking an autorickshaw to the city costs just ₹15. “Many in the village are farmers and have to visit the city to sell their produce. Students also take the same path to travel to their schools and colleges in the city,” said Shyam Shisve, 38, a resident and deputy sarpanch of Apati village. Shisve works as a plumber and travels to Badlapur for work.   The pathway was built near the weir in 2000 to control the flow of the Ulhas river water. Earlier a weir constructed in 1972, 100 metres away from the current one, was submerged in the water, prompting authorities to build a new one with increased height. A 5 feet wide pathway of 200 feet in length was also built.   “When the new weir was built in 2000, the authorities had also assured that they will build a bridge. However, they built a pathway, which is now almost submerged in the water. The villagers had tried to fix the submerged portion by supporting it with iron planks. However, that was washed away during monsoon,” said Shisve. Suresh Gaikar, former deputy sarpanch of the village and a retired teacher said, “During monsoon, some have even drowned in the river. We residents have been demanding a proper road since 2017 as the water from the weir started overflowing from the old road. However, there has been no response from the authorities.”  Since 2018, the villagers have been asking the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) to build a proper bridge.    “In 2017, some part of the pathway had washed away for which we have decided to take up the repair work. However, due to the pandemic, the work got delayed. The pathway is just a part of the weir which can be used to access the weir when required, it was not for people to cross. People use this pathway as a shortcut to reach the cities daily,” said Machindra Jadhav, deputy engineer, Ambernath MIDC.  “We cannot barricade the pathway as every year during monsoon its parts are washed away. Also, we cannot stop people from using it as it is a shortcut for their livelihood. The only way is to have a bridge or flyover for which we are trying,” Jadhav added.

28-01-2022||Delhi||Beating the Retreat: Meet IIT Delhi alumni, creators of 1,000 drones for light show||New DelhiOn January 29, as the centuries-old military tradition of troops retreating, from the battleground at sunset, comes alive at Vijay Chowk, the visitors to Beating the Retreat ceremony will be dazzled with something rather modern. For the first time ever, the sky above Rashtrapati Bhavan will be filled by an eight minute long light show, which will be created using 1,000 drones developed by a homegrown start-up by two 31-year-old alumni of Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. Incubated at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, the startup named Botlab Dynamics is helmed by Tanmay Bunkar and Anuj Barnwal. Busy preparing for the show, which will mark the culmination of this ceremony, Bunkar — a 2014 batch graduate of the tech institute — shares, “We’d be celebrating all aspects of what India has achieved in the last 75 years, and how it will progress. We’ve been creating this technology since 2016, and it will definitely be a big boost to technology in India. By seeing the hard work we’ve put in, I’m sure people will take it seriously that if we invest in technology, there are returns, and certainly some light at the end of the tunnel.”Barnwal informs how the team has been practising rigorously for the big day since a month now. “It’s the first time something like this is happening. We have been testing our drones every day for the last one year,” he says, explaining, “The drones are programmed to have 16 million colours, as many as the modern laptops have. They will change colours during the show, to form artistic patterns in the sky. There will be very engaging music during the formations, which will surely make it an audio-visual delight.” Recalling how he began working on the concept of drones, Bunkar says, “I met Anuj on my very first day of college; he was my roommate. We were part of the engineering physics batch. Initially, I was trying to make these guidance computers, and I was the first person in IIT Delhi to make a drone. The most expensive part of any system is the electronics. In 2012, we flew the first such copter in the campus. Initially, these drones were very limited in what they could do, and were nothing but glorified toys. As you try to make them more capable, in terms of longer flight time or capability of carrying loads, they become prohibitive in terms of cost. We decided that a large number of these smaller, simpler systems can be networked and made more effective.”The two have largely worked with defence forces in the past. And recalling this one time when the drones completely shut down during a showcase, Bunkar says he decided to make the drones with homegrown parts. “You have to have control over your hardware. Till now we were using off-the-shelf, imported hardware. Agar aapka ek component fail ho jata hai, then the best you can do is replace it and pray that the alternate combination works. But praying is not a scientific way to find a solution! The problem is that India doesn’t have a very mature system of making hardware. But we decided that even if it’s harder and it takes longer, it’s how we will grow. So we made the flight controller and GPS modules on these, which are now designed at IIT Delhi and fabricated at Manesar.” The technophile recollects how he got in touch with people making circuit boards for phones, and for plastic injection moulding he approached people who make broom handles and fruit baskets. Bunkar says, “Those people have made the body of the drones out of plastic. There is so much untapped potential in India, we just need to show some trust. Just relying on some Chinese maker is not going to bring anything! Very soon, about 90% of the drones would be made in India, and then the world will see our tech prowess.” Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/beating-the-retreat-meet-iit-delhi-alumni-creators-of-1-000-drones-for-light-show-101643381767595.html

The state government also supported it and announced zero construction on BDP land.Maximum land coming under BDP is owned by private parties and at least 250 acres of land is owned by the Maharashtra government.Chavan said, “Though the state government had taken the decision a few years before, PMC has failed to acquire land for the same. At least government land should be acquired on priority.”Rao said, “I will call a meeting with PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar and Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh soon and we would discuss the issue of handing over land to the PMC for BDP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/meeting-to-discuss-land-acquisition-for-bdp-soon-says-pune-divisional-commissioner-101643380023915.html
28-01-2022||Mumbai||Thane: Satellite City has a long way to go to be an independent city||Thane, known as a satellite city of Mumbai, has now expanded well in terms of population and is also creating housing and job avenues. According to urban planners and designers, it is high time that Thane is now considered an independent city as it is no more completely dependent on Mumbai for job opportunities.For example, the boundaries of Thane city comprising Bhiwandi and Rabale have become logistics and industrial hubs, respectively. The city itself has Asia’s largest industrial belt at Wagale MIDC, which provides jobs to over 60,000 people.Thane, however, is still lagging behind in providing basic amenities like good public transport, health, education and open spaces among others. Experts suggest a planned development model on the lines of Navi Mumbai for a city like Thane. This can now be possible as the old developmental plan for the city is completing 20 years in 2023 and the city needs to be re-planned.“The per square metre population within Thane city is way beyond the limits. People move cities in search of job opportunities. The overall development of any city is also on job opportunities and the facilities in the vicinity for the residents. Hence, there needs to be earmarked zones that will focus on providing job opportunities for all including those involved in daily labour and the working class,” said Pramod Nimbalkar, former Executive Engineer of Town Planning in Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC). In the last two decades, Thane city has expanded and branched out in various directions. However, finding basic amenities within the vicinity of residential areas has become difficult for many.“Those who are staying in Thane and beyond have to make use of the public transport to reach their workplaces. This is because we have a concentrated development pattern in Thane city, wherein some areas are commercial while some others are demarcated as residential. Instead, if we develop a 15-minute city with all basic amenities and infrastructure within the vicinity, it will easily bring workplaces closer for people and provide increased job opportunities,” said Mayuresh Bhadsavle, Urban Development Practitioner, Thane.An ideal 15-minute city would include varied amenities and facilities like open spaces including civic-run gardens, bus and metro depots, civic and private schools, cycle avenues and tracks, public health centres, reading or recreation halls and commercial workspaces within fifteen minutes radius of one’s residence. Moreover, in a metro city like Thane, people should not be complaining about the lack of basic facilities like water supply, solid waste management and electricity supply, according to experts.MAKE PARKING SPACESWhen it comes to availability of open spaces, it includes making parking spaces available near one’s workplace, residence or utilising the ample open spaces available in the city rather than building parking plazas at random locations, suggest urban planners. Most parking projects in the city have failed to take up. The ‘Pay and Park’ did not find any takers, but authorities claim that the work of underground parking at Gaondevi ground is in the final stages. The Parking Plaza near Jupiter Hospital is spread across 1.20 lakh sqft plot but is now functional as a field hospital for Covid care.“Until the pandemic exists, this space will be utilised for the same. After that, we’ll take a call on whether it should be used as a parking facility. Currently, we have set up oxygen plants and a complete Covid care set up at the Parking Plaza,” said an officer from the TMC.“There are certain wide roads that have spaces adjacent to the footpath that can be utilised for parking. This will not only provide multifunctional ways of utilising an area but also providing more space closer to one’s residence or work place for parking. Just having essentials within a ward will not suffice. Having these within the vicinity for residents are essential,” added Bhadsavle.Areas like Majiwada-Manpada ward in Thane are well developed with many townships and well-planned housing complexes. However, there are slums and encroachments in areas within the ward. There are ample avenues for green or open space in these townships but the situation is not the same in areas like Kisan Nagar, Mumbra, Diva and some parts of Kalwa as well.“Many areas of Thane city are well developed and include planned townships. However, areas like Naupada, Mumbra, Diva and Kisan Nagar continue to be cramped up for spaces. It is essential to look at the overall development. For example, a look at Naupada Kopri ward shows us that there are open spaces and parking areas in Naupada but the same cannot be said for Kopri as it is full of informal settlements,” said Bhadsavle.LACK OF PG COURSESAs per the 15-minute city plan, availability of schools and educational institutes in one’s vicinity is a must. Thane city has a lot of schools of various boards. Also, colleges are available for graduation and other courses. However, lack of post-graduation courses, institutes or options for higher education can be noted in the city.“Neighbouring cities of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai have made use of the space to make way for institutes that focus on higher education. While Thane city has ample options for school education, there is a lack of post-graduation or higher studies-related facilities. Students are compelled to travel further towards Mumbai or Navi Mumbai. Navi Mumbai has huge campuses for such institutes, which Thane city is lacking,” said Dr Fleur D’Souza, retired professor, St Xavier’s College and a resident of Charai in Thane.Mumbai University’s sub-centre started in Balkum has teething troubles even after seven years of its inauguration. A two-storey building set up in a vast plot of land allotted to the University of Mumbai by the TMC, continues to be hardly in operation. “There is a lack of a coordinator appointed in the centre. This is one of the reasons that the campus has to get the university’s approval for every work. Moreover, the maintenance is also very poor. Proper housekeeping staff is also not appointed,” said Mahadev Jagtap, senate member of University of Mumbai.Although the university has started with law and business courses, and more than two lakh students were supposed to benefit from the two sub-centres, the university’s lackadaisical attitude has put them in a lurch. This is one of the reasons that many prefer to travel to Mumbai or Navi Mumbai for higher education.“Every year, when students fill up online admission forms for first year college, we notice that most choose to go outside Thane. Colleges within Thane are usually the second or third option for students. This could be because of the lack of appealing campuses and a holistic education facility within the city” said a professor from a college in Thane.Advait Vaidya, in-charge of the University sub-campus in Thane, said, “We currently have a strength of 242 students for both BBA and LLB courses. Till now, online classes were going on as per the State Government guidelines. We shall reopen the college in February.”WATER WOESAccording to urban planners, an ideal city would include all the basic facilities like water supply and solid waste management. However, in Thane, some residents continue to grapple with lack of water supply and solid waste management. Some areas in Thane city are facing water supply issues. These include areas like Kisan Nagar, Mumbra, Kalwa, Diva and parts of Ghodbunder Road.“While there are plans to become a Smart City, the basic issues of the people are not catered to. Water supply is a severe problem that can be solved with basic management and planning by the civic authorities. There are many parts of the city where water is illegally drawn or potable water used at construction sites. These need to be identified. Moreover, the water that we receive from the civic body is potable water that should not be used to wash cars. For example, in my society, we make use of borewell water to wash cars. Similar concepts can be implemented by other societies as well. Mostly, everyone has borewell facilities nowadays,” said Satyajit Shah, civic activist, Thane.Last year, TMC had planned to store water from the dams of the district as the irrigation department had decided to execute 14% water cut in the district. The real estate boom has also added to the acute water crisis in the city, according to activists.WASTE SEGREGATION, HEALTH CENTRES“TMC is yet to strictly implement waste segregation in the city. It needs to be percolated in the minds of children as well in schools in order to ensure families implement the same. The corporation is hardly taking efforts in this direction. An announcement regarding single-use plastic was also made but no efforts were taken to ensure its implementation. Most big housing societies have a solid waste plant. Is the civic body involved in recycling of e-waste and plastic? Also, is the civic body ensuring that the solid waste plant in societies is functional? Through CSR and Smart City Projects involved in marketing, the compost prepared by societies can easily generate revenue,” said Vaibhav Satam, RTI activist, Thane.Thane city is spread over 127sqkm while the population of the city is 22 lakh. As per the norms of the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM), there should be one primary health care centre for a population of 50,000. The city at present has 27 primary healthcare centres. Thus, each centre caters to a population of over 1 lakh – double its capacity. As per the health department, around 52% of Thane’s population reside in the slums of Mumbra, Kausa, Diva, Kisan Nagar, Srinagar, Warlipada, Kokanipada, Ambika Nagar, Lokmanya Nagarpada Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4. These are also the areas that lack access to health care.Considering the current pandemic situation, for the Thane civic body, managing funds for any kind of development would be an issue. In the current pandemic situation, the main focus of any civic body would be to maintain the health infrastructure, if not creating new ones. If the complete focus is on maintaining the healthcare facilities, it will lessen the focus on other developments.“Not necessarily to build new health systems but maintaining the existing facilities will definitely be the focus. For the next few years, the civic body will definitely give priority to the healthcare system. This will leave the corporation with fewer funds for other developmental plans. Lack of funding will be an issue for TMC in the next few years,” added Nimbalkar.TMC COMMISSIONER REACTSMeanwhile, Dr Vipin Sharma, commissioner of Thane Municipal Corporation, did not comment on speculations about TMC not having ample funds. He said that TMC is already in the process of converting Thane Global Hospital to a cancer centre. This is a part of improving health infrastructure and medical facilities within Thane city.“We are augmenting health services in the last two years. With the pandemic, the medical facilities at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital in Kalwa and Thane Civil Hospital have improved. Even the private health facilities in the city have increased the number of beds and services. All of this will definitely be beneficial as it has added to the health infrastructure in the city. Development is a gradual process that will take place over a period of time,” said Sharma.He also denied that Thane has a lack of open spaces. With the creek on one side and hills on the other, Thane city has natural greenery available, according to Sharma. “Moreover, many lakes have been beautified such that people can enjoy the natural beauty that the city has been endowed with,” said Sharma.He added, “We are also keen on having bigger institutions like IIM or MBA colleges in the city. These will not only provide quality education but also provide job facilities in the city. We are open to such institutes and are also trying to provide such opportunities for the youngsters. TMC has already provided a substantial amount of land to the University of Mumbai to conduct courses.”The main focus for the new Developmental Plan would be to plan the city in such a manner that the real estate boom and the increasing population within the city are also taken into consideration while improving the civic and transport infrastructure, Sharma added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-satellite-city-has-a-long-way-to-go-to-be-an-independent-city-101643379965414.html
28-01-2022||Pune||Residents of Peth area in Pune irked over slow pace of road work; PMC sets Feb 15 deadline ahead of civic polls||The work of road restoration is underway in Peth areas in the city amid growing disenchantment from locals complaining of the inconvenience they are facing for months. As the roads were dug up for the 24x7 water scheme and later repaired with temporary measures, the residents of the Peth areas have had to suffer from irregular water supply, stagnant traffic, and dust.Taking note of complaints from locals in her constituency, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Kasba peth Mukta Tilak criticised the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) administration and standing committee for lack of coordination. According to Tilak, despite sanctioning money, which could have been used for road repair, the PMC did not pay heed.“Shivaji road is extremely busy and it needs to be repaired as soon as possible. So, I had allotted ₹1.30 crore to fill the potholes and restore the road, but the standing committee has opposed the resolution,” said Tilak.She had initially proposed a flyover on Bajirao road, but the project could not be carried out because the road is too narrow. She then changed her focus to restore the Shivaji road, to which the administration opposed, according to Tilak.Most Peth areas under Kasba peth constituency is considered to be BJP stronghold. However, party leaders have started facing the wrath of people due to dug up roads. The BJP now wants PMC to quickly fix it before the city goes for local body polls mostly in March this year.The PMC had given the deadline till the end of last year, then postponed it to January 2022 for completing the road works. Now the deadline is extended to February 15 and citizens continue to suffer.The roads in Peth areas are narrow but see heavy traffic. Road construction which has been going on for months has made it difficult for elderly people to catch the buses.“People have complained about the lack of parking space due to the construction. Buses cannot stop for more than a few seconds and the elderly find it difficult to board the buses. This has caused a couple of accidents as well,” said Sourabh Amrale, a restaurant owner and a local from Shivaji road, Shukrawar peth.Young locals have to handle the traffic at times, to facilitate the old people in commuting, he said.The ambitious 24x7 water supply project was one of the reasons why roads were dug in the Peth areas, but the work of replacing and installing pipes has caused irregular water supply in the area. The prolonged construction has also caused dust pollution.“Due to the construction, many houses are not getting water. Children are falling sick because of the dust,” Sourabh said.The corporation has failed in taking care of the people, believes Sourabh. “The construction is extremely slow-paced and that is the reason it is taking so long to complete the work,” he said.“People have been complaining about these issues, but the corporators are not ready to take responsibility,” Sourabh added.Mahesh Meghani, a wholesale dealer of agricultural tools, equipment, and machinery on Shivaji road, said, “The entire area in front of my shop has been filled with dust all day since the construction began three weeks ago. The road is jammed, traffic is slow and the smoke coming from vehicles makes it worse. Breathing is becoming difficult.”Large water pipes have filled the footpaths in various parts of Tilak road and Bajirao road, due to the ongoing construction. “The workers have put the pipes right in front of my shop. I have been telling them to remove them but nothing has changed,” said Anand Juju, a medical shop owner at Tilak road. He also complained about the dust pollution. “My shop is filled with a layer of dust. There’s no point cleaning because within a few hours it is back to the same,” he added.Hemant Rasne, standing committee chief, said the work is in progress and will complete soon. “It’s true that people are being inconvenienced. However, the work is underway with rapid speed and will finish it by February 15,” Rasne said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/residents-of-peth-area-in-pune-irked-over-slow-pace-of-road-work-101643379723962.html

Rahul Bhandari, the secretary of the department, said that the portal will improve transparency in the scheme. “This portal will help in maintaining records of nearly 1,900 employees working at various positions under the scheme at the state headquarters, district and block levels in a digital mode. Employees will be able to see their service record since their joining date online.” Overall, the HRMS portal will eliminate manual intervention in HR-related matters. Bhandari said that the MGNREGA staff had been seeking the timely release of salaries besides transparency in recruitment and transfer of employees. With the help of this digital mode, all employees will get their salaries on time. This will create a sense of discipline as attendance is also being captured online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-launches-portal-to-maintain-records-of-mgnrega-employees-101643379183816.html
28-01-2022||Mumbai||Police arrest 10, recover stolen gold, cash worth ₹7.12 cr||Mumbai As many as 10 people have been arrested from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan for stealing 17.4 kg of gold ornaments and ₹ 8.57 lakh from a jewellery store. The Mumbai police claimed to have recovered 89 per cent of the stolen booty worth ₹ 7.12 crore from the accused.According to police, Ganesh Devashi, the 21-year-old main accused, was hired by the jeweller six months ago. According to the police, the complainant Khushal Rashiklal Tamaka’s (48) office is in Bhuleshwar, while his jewellery making unit is in Goregaon. He had brought the latest designs for an exhibition and kept the ornaments at his office locker. Subsequently, the exhibition was cancelled due to Covid and his father also died, because of which he could not come to the office for a week. Due to this, he gave a key to the jewellery locker to Ganesh. Police said that Devashi was aware of the jewellery and he discussed it with his friend Ramesh Prajapati and they allegedly hatched a plan. Ramesh was planning to marry as his family members had found a suitable girl for him. He required the money and hence, wanted to be a part of the theft. The officers said at about midnight on January 14, Prajapati, Devashi, Turibhat and two other accused opened the locker and kept 17.4 kilograms of gold jewellery, cash ₹ 8.57 lakh in a bag. They also removed the CCTV camera, the DVR and left the office at about 1:30 am.The incident came to light when Tamaka went to the office the next morning. On the basis of a complaint, a case was registered in the LT Marg police station. “We made six teams from LT Marg and other police stations in zone 2. Five accused were captured in the CCTV footage installed at the neighbouring shop. We got a link and on the basis of technical evidence, we managed to arrest the first person - Prajapati. We recovered gold ornaments worth ₹ 4.15 crore and some cash from him,” said joint commissioner of police Vishwas Nangre Patil. Prajapati then confessed to the crime and based on the leads given by him, the others were arrested. Two accused are still wanted in the case and police teams are trying to track them as well. “We will nab them soon and will recover the rest of the booty,” said additional commissioner of police Dilip Sawant of the south region. “The police teams worked continuously for 10 days to solve the case. It was a well-coordinated effort between the teams on fields in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and the technical support team in Mumbai,” added Sawant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/police-arrest-10-recover-stolen-gold-cash-worth-7-12-cr-101643378763983.html
28-01-2022||Mumbai||Tribal couple rides 40 km on scooter with son’s body as pillion||A tribal couple were forced to travel 40 km with their deceased son on a two-wheeler after three ambulance drivers refused to carry the body to their village in Mokhada, Palghar. All three drivers were dismissed for the lapse. Ajay Pardhi, a Class 1 student, died due to acute pneumonia at Cottage Hospital, Jawhar, on Tuesday. His father, Yuvraj Pardhi, who works as a farm labourer, tried to hire an ambulance to transport their son’s body back home at the remote Sadakwadi village, about 40 km for the funeral. But at least three ambulance drivers available at the hospital refused.Ultimately, the couple wrapped their child’s body in blankets and travelled on a scooter to reach their hut in Sadakwadi village.Dr Ramdas Marad, CMO, Cottage Hospital, said that government ambulances are not allowed to transport the dead. “To help the Pardhi family, I even summoned a private ambulance but the driver was charging a huge amount as it was night and Pardhi could not afford the cost,” Marad said, adding that the hospital did not have a hearse van and no alternative transport was available.“We suggested to the family to wait till daybreak but Pardhi feared that a post mortem may be conducted of the body. We assured him that since the boy died due to natural causes, no autopsy was needed but the parents insisted on taking the body to their village,” Marad added. We have dismissed the three drivers, said Marad.According to a health department official, the state government will soon order the deployment of a hearse van in each rural hospital so that such incidents are not repeated.Vivek Pandit, ex MLA of Vasai and president of Shramjeevi Sanghatana, a tribal welfare outfit, said that such incidents are common in Palghar, Nandurbar and other tribal belts where there are no health facilities. “In hilly areas, there are no medicos, gynaecologists, nurses, ambulances, medicines but the state government is ignoring the issue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tribal-couple-rides-40-km-on-scooter-with-son-s-body-as-pillion-101643378354588.html
28-01-2022||Mumbai||Docs bank on clinical signs to differentiate between Omicron and Delta||Mumbai: Short incubation period, high fever lasting for fewer days, no lung involvement, no loss of smell or taste- these are some of the significant characteristics of the patients infected with the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2. However, in absence of quicker genome sequencing or the wide-scale unavailability of S-gene target failure tests used to indirectly detect Omicron, doctors have been using clinical signs to differentiate between the Omicron and Delta in order to decide the course of treatment. Omicron is now the predominant variant in circulation in Mumbai. The latest round of genome sequencing carried out by the civic body has shown that nearly 88% of samples sent for sequencing had the Omicron variant, while the remaining were Delta (0.8%), Delta derivatives (8%) and other variants. “There is very little Delta in circulation,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Vasant Nagvekar from the Lilavati Hospital. “We know this because a small number of patients have some lung infection, which is typical of Delta. But the majority of the cases are of Omicron which presents with an upper respiratory infection,” informed Nagvekar, who is also a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force. Doctors said that a clinical differentiation between Omicron and Delta is crucial in terms of planning the treatment. Most importantly, it also helps in deciding if the patient should be considered a candidate for the expensive monoclonal antibody cocktail drug, as the cocktails currently available in India have failed to neutralise Omicron in a laboratory setting. The cocktail drug costs nearly ₹1.2 lakh and can be shared between two patients which brings the cost to around ₹60,000 each. Nagvekar said that in Omicron when one family member develops the infection, others typically have it within three days. “In Delta, this incubation period is about five to seven days. In Omicron, we typically see high fever, severe sore throat and headaches, but no changes in the chest scans, unlike Delta which speedily impacted the lungs,” he said, adding that when he suspects Omicron, he generally prefers waiting for 48 to 72 hours by administering only symptomatic treatment. “If I suspect Delta, I go ahead with Remdesvir or monoclonal antibody cocktails depending on the patient’s prognosis,” he said. Dr Khusrav Bhajan, a physician and intensivist at the PD Hinduja Hospital said that the oropharyngeal or upper respiratory symptoms are the biggest indicators of Omicron. “Nearly 99% cases that we are seeing now are Omicron, but an occasional Delta has to be watched out for as it causes significant life-threatening problems. Some of the city hospitals such as Lilavati and PD Hinduja are already in the process of procuring the Omisure kits that can detect Omicron within four hours. “The kits will definitely be helpful when it comes to quickly detecting Omicron, and taking a call on whether the patient can be a candidate for a monoclonal antibody cocktail,” said internal medical specialist Dr Anita Mathew from Fortis Hospital in Mulund. “But we must remember that the cocktail is not a drug for the masses and must be used only for patients with the risk of progressing to severe disease,” she said. Mathew added that most Covid-19 cases are self-limiting now. “This is not simply because we have Omicron in circulation, but also because the vaccine immunity is helping. When we suspect an Omicron, we prefer sitting tight and closely monitoring the patients, whereas, in Delta, we tend to quickly start an oral anti-viral or Remdesivir which comes in an injectable form,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/docs-bank-on-clinical-signs-to-differentiate-between-omicron-and-delta-101643377623743.html

The two accused were identified as Rajesh Gupta, 56, and his son Abhishek Gupta, 30, residents of Madhavpuri colony in Dubbaga locality of Lucknow. Rajesh Gupta works as a manager at the canteen of Lucknow General Post Office in Hazratganj, stated the press note issued by the STF.A senior STF official said the duo had duped people by promising jobs in the Food Corporation of India, different banks, Metro services, power sector, education department, 108 ambulance service, community health centres as well as the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).

They disappeared after taking money from the complainant and were at large since then. The official said some more victims turned up to register their complaint against the father and son, after their arrest. Similarly, the accused had duped a Kanpur resident Shubham Chauhan of ₹2.5 lakh, a Siddharthnagar resident Shibbu Pandey of ₹4 lakh, Etawah resident Sushil Yadav of ₹2.7 lakh and one Rama Shankar Shukla of ₹50,000, he added. He said the key accused Rajesh Gupta’s service record was also tainted. Gupta joined the GPO canteen in 1989, but was terminated in 2002 due to some reasons and was reinstated after 17 months. He was again suspended in 2005 and his suspension was revoked in 2006. But he was demoted to a primary scale.

28-01-2022||Mumbai||Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation records most deaths in third Covid wave||The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has witnessed the highest number of deaths during the third wave across Thane district.Thane district overall has recorded 112 Covid deaths in January, out of which 92 deaths were reported since January 15. KDMC itself has recorded 34 deaths after January 15. In December 2021, there were 29 Covid deaths in the entire month across Thane district. While the number of cases has declined, the deaths are on the rise in the aftermath of the third wave.According to the KDMC health department, the deaths involved senior citizens with comorbidities. The civic body has appealed to residents and general practitioners to recommend hospitalisation if senior citizens with severe comorbidities tested positive for Covid.Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC, said, “Almost each of the deaths that occurred during the third wave was a comorbid senior citizen. Although they had mild symptoms, their immunity was low due to comorbidities. There were a few patients who were admitted for other illnesses but as Covid tests during hospitalisation are mandatory, we conducted their tests and they ended up being positive. A few bedridden patients who did not get vaccinated due to the fear of their existing illnesses have also lost their lives. Hence we recommend even asymptomatic Covid patients among senior citizens to seek medical help.”As per the State government figures, close behind KDMC is Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation at 22 deaths in the last 12 days. Rural areas of the district have witnessed 13 deaths and Thane Municipal Corporation has recorded 11 deaths since January 15.“Most of the deaths that occurred in the last few days involved senior citizens or incidental Covid cases. There is hardly anyone with pure Covid complications in this wave. The increase in deaths during a downward decline of the third wave across the district shows that these are mostly instances where the deceased are under hospitalisation for a long period,” said a senior officer from district health department, Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kalyan-dombivli-municipal-corporation-records-most-deaths-in-third-covid-wave-101643371384065.html

The corporation generates 400 MLD of sewer water and recycles it. This water can be put to good, non-potable use, NatConnect director, BN Kumar, pointed out and called for a one-time investment.NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, has asked his team of officers at ward levels to see how best the recycled water can be used.Bangar said, “NRI Seawoods already gets treated water. This process can be extended to other colonies.”Kumar appreciated the commissioner for his “quick, positive and pro-environment response”. Kumar pointed out that considering the city will see a massive construction in view of the redevelopment projects and infrastructure works, recycled water could ideally be used for these.Moreover, the use of precious drinking water for washing cars, two-wheelers, terraces and parking pots should be discouraged forthwith and the recycled water should be used.“And, till we have a dedicated pipeline, recycled water may be supplied to housing societies by tankers,” Kumar said. The societies must invest in separate internal pipelines and storage.NMMC can offer discounts in regular water tariff for the societies taking recycled water, Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-civic-body-considering-idea-to-use-recycled-water-for-constructions-non-potable-purposes-101643368269760.html

28-01-2022||Mumbai||3 arrested in Bhiwandi for smuggling barking deer fawn||The Padgha unit of the Maharashtra Forest Department busted an animal smuggling racket earlier this week by arresting three accused for smuggling the fawn of a barking deer in Bhiwandi.Also known as a muntjac, the barking deer is a protected species under the Wildlife Protection Act and is often hunted for its meat.According to the forest officials, the arrests were made on Monday on the basis of a tip off received last week.“We learned that certain people were offering to sell a live barking deer fawn. We verified this information by getting in touch with the accused through a dummy customer and a trap was laid. On Monday, the accused were picked up from near the Paramount Hotel in the Kasne village on the Mumbai-Nashik Highway, and the fawn was rescued from their custody,” Range Forest Officer, SB Deore, said.The three arrested, identified as Ramesh Walimbe, Bakru Hilam and Ganesh Wagh, are all residents of Alyani village in Shahapur. They were placed under arrest and charged under the Wildlife Protection Act.“Inquiries conducted so far indicate that they had caught the fawn from the forest area in Shahapur. Barking deer is not usually smuggled internationally and has more demand at a local level,” Deora said.The forest department is now investigating whether the trio has similarly caught and sold barking deer or any other endangered or protected species of wildlife in the past. Inquiries are also under way to find out if any other accused are involved in the racket, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3-arrested-in-bhiwandi-for-smuggling-barking-deer-fawn-101643366824341.html
28-01-2022||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Knock knock... who’s there? Covid. Now the first 48 hours||January 24, 2022, 12.39 pm: Teevr is the word on my mind at the moment. And if I dwell upon it, it’s the teekshan level of teevrata that I am experiencing. Mercury rising, sharply: 100.3 Fahrenheit to be precise. If I had more fever in school, I would have done so much better in my Hindi papers. I am inside a warm room wrapped in a warm blanket but there’s a chill snaking its way, randomly, through my limbs and testing my joints. That’s how I know it is a fever. It all started Sunday morning on the terrace with my morning mug of ginger chai. It was misty with a chill merrily searing through the cityscape. I enjoyed the winter breeze for 10 minutes and then throughout the day was wearing a hooded fleece jacket. But I guess ten minutes was enough. 1.27 pm: Have isolated myself. Leaving my better half to deal with everything. There’s a lot written about the virus, governance … but not much about the physical workload and psychological impact of quarantine on family members. This is one of the reasons we decided not to send the children back to school till next year - no sense in subjecting them to endless cycles of restricted freedom, infection, quarantine, closures because that’s what living with the virus really means. The lower back, knees, elbows and knuckles are paining. I feel warm like someone has just lit a tiny spark inside me and the twigs are starting to catch. No breathing problems. A minor cold, a little cough occasionally, but I am getting up and clearing my throat. It’s less than an hour and I already can’t get out of bed. That was quick. Salute SARS-CoV-2. 3.36 pm: Spoke to physician Dr Narendra Kulkarni and took Dolo 650 as advised (as a rule, I do not self-medicate). Took a Covid antigen self-test from Abbot and tested positive. Yay! Now on to RT-PCR. 4.39 pm: RT-PCR sample given. Just had Maggi noodles - taste and smell are fine. There’s something about Maggi noodles that makes a great meal when am ill. Body-ache is persisting accompanied by a headache. We also called our trusted family paediatrician Dr Anand Pandit, a wise grandfatherly gentleman, and he told us he’s also got Covid and advised us to do exactly what he’s doing: nothing. Just wait out the seven days and take fever controlling medication as required. 6.15 pm: In the 22 months from January 2020 (when I first heard of Covid) till November 2021, I have been to office, hospitals (several times), clinics, had surgery, been on walks, generally been out and about with proper precautions and did not contract Covid. I got my vaccine second dose end of November and now I have Covid with very little interaction with the world. Does the vaccine make the body more amenable to the new variants? Hmm? Have been walking around the room, sometimes singing, sometimes checking in on work, writing stuff, playing the odd game of chess. Activity really helps in dealing with the pain. 7.43 pm: We are not very different - the virus and I. We are both trying to survive in a hard world. It has the advantage of being able to mutate fast. It is a dynamic organism that is evolving with every passing day, picking up new survival skills in true Darwinian prophecy, adapting faster to human contingencies, getting better at fulfilling its destiny: to infect and kill more humans. I can adapt but my response time is affected by government, non-government, medical, local, family and work decision protocols. I think this new Omicron variant has learned to penetrate the vaccine defences by sacrificing lethal effect. Who knows what skills and capabilities the next variant of concern will combine (Omicron’s penetration and Delta’s firepower)? January 25, 1.54 am: Just woke up after a fitful sleep. Dozed off around 10 pm. I can feel the illness snaking its way through my digestive system. The joints are the main target - feels as if someone is pressing on the knees, shoulders, knuckles, waist … and then trying to pull them apart. 9.39 am: Just woke up after a good sleep. No body-ache. No headache. No fever. It’s just gone. RT-PCR test result came in at 2.38: am positive for Covid. The test result does not tell me what variant. 10.15 am: Informed colleagues that I will take the day off. Had hot ginger chai and now pacing the room. 11.26 am: Had breakfast and realised that the virus generates a lot of phlegm. Have to keep throwing it out else it accumulates in throat and then makes me choke. Dehydration seems to be a by-product as is fatigue from the body fighting the infection. I think the body-ache and fever are distractions - the phlegm is the real problem since it can easily lead to congestion. But when you have aches and fever, you tend not to get up and just give in to the pain. It’s tiring. 11.55 am: Just touched a kilometre of walking. It’s ridiculously difficult racking up kilometres inside a tiny room. The number of rounds I walk makes me think I am walking a lot but after 10 minutes it’s just 100 meters. Bolt did it in under 10 seconds. A friend just Whatsapped to ask if I had stepped out of doors recently. So, I replied: “Nope, we don’t really step out of the house. Aaj kal Covid home delivery de raha hai. Service improve ho gaya.” 1.30 pm: Spoke to Dr Madhuwanti Abhayankar of AG Diagnostics. She explained that all positive test samples are sent to the state government and they then run genome sequencing tests to accurately determine the variant. That information is not available to individual patients but it becomes part of clinical research data for the state and nation. 3.30 pm: No new adverse symptoms at the moment except for heaviness in the head and a cough-like feeling in the chest (no cough). If I take a deep breath, I feel sharpness down my windpipe. 6.20 pm: Finally had a long chat with my childhood friend, Dr Sandeep Khurana, MD, certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine in Gastroenterology and Transplant Hepatology. He also serves as Professor of Medicine at Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Pennsylvania. “Omicron is marching through the population.” He said and asked several questions on symptoms, reports, current state. “Don’t do anything, don’t take any medicines. At those CT levels, and with your fever already broken, you’ll be out of the difficult part in a day. Stay isolated, vigilant, keep mind and body active.” January 26, 1 am: Having difficulty falling asleep. No major aches, but a slight and constant stomach discomfort and a mild headache. A cold has suddenly developed. Actually, whenever I touch cold water or anything cold, symptoms of cold appear quickly but then subside if I clear my nose and throat. 11.30 am: Constant vigilance is required, not just a desire, but a will to adapt, fight and do the hard work to survive and live despite of the virus. I have never taken any vaccines, except for polio when I was a kid. But I took the Covid vaccine because my logic was: if my body can build immunity against diseases, it will also know how to address any risks from vaccines. But if I stay unvaccinated, I may put others with less immunity in danger. I have realised that we don’t have to abandon logic and prudence nor take refuge in logic and prudence only. A prescription that works for some may not for others. There does not seem to be any specific medication approved as a blanket treatment of Covid anyway. It is therefore important for individuals and families to make decisions based on their doctor’s advice after informing them about the specific symptoms, medical history, and health. 1.30 pm: Today is the third day. Am feeling better. Some Covid affected don’t have any hardships on any day. Some have difficult symptoms for days, weeks. Others have different experiences. I intend to focus on what Khurana said as we wrapped our call: “If you are healthy, vaccinated and maintain activity, you’ll be fine. People with co-morbidities and those who are obese, overweight or have chronic health concerns run the main risk with Covid. So, we have to treat our lives with more respect and reimagine our lifestyle with more responsibility and care.” Sanjay Mukherjee, author, learning-tech designer and management consultant, is founder of Mountain Walker and chief strategy advisor, Peak Pacific.

28-01-2022||Delhi||Post-wedding shoot: New normal amid Covid?||You may have heard of weddings getting postponed due to the Covid-19 scare. But now, pre-wedding shoots are being pushed to after the ceremony for couples in Delhi-NCR, say wedding photographers. “January is the peak time for pre-wedding shoots. But, couples kaafi confused hain ki shaadi kab hogi, pre-wedding shoot kitni pehle karein,” says photographer Karandeep Rana from Dee Photography. Azad Ali, a photographer from The Video Junction, says: “Mere paas do post-wedding shoots lined up hain. Pehle inka pre-wedding shoot final hua tha, but they cancelled the idea because 20 guests mein pre-wedding video chalayenge kahan, kisko dikhayenge.” Witnessing similar sentiments from clients is photographer Mayur Khanna from Video Tailor. He says, “Weddings par restriction ki vajah se kaafi problems hain. A lot of couples are now going for post-wedding shoots, as they don’t find it feasible to go out of town before their wedding, due to the Omicron scare.” Many who had planned to shoot abroad are abandoning that thought due to the risk involved. “Couples who had originally wanted to shoot in places like Italy, Thailand and Bali are now looking for places that are at a drivable distance from Delhi,” says wedding photographer Arjun Kartha from Twogether Studios. Foreign locales aside, shooting at popular cities like Jaipur, Jodhpur and Manali also seems risky. Jasmine from Photo Rachna Studios says, “Abhi outdoors mein safety concerns hain. There are travel restrictions, and pre-wedding shoot sets are sanitised, so it’s a win-win for couples to shoot at nearby locations.”Author Tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter

Pramanik rushed to the spot and found they had been poisoned a few days earlier. The carcasses were dumped near a paddy field with the legs of the cats tied with ropes. “They were all females,” said Pramanik.The killings shocked conservationists seeking to protect the state animal of West Bengal. “Earlier too fishing cats have been killed in the state or their bodies were found on highways after being run over by speeding vehicles. But this is for the first time that we found three animals being killed and their bodies dumped,” said Pramanik.The state forest department started an inquiry and found the involvement of local residents Prabhas Patra and Pratap Patra. Their houses were raided but both were absconding. An arrest warrant has been issued against them and the police are looking for them.In 2009, the fishing cat was declared the state animal. It is also included as a Schedule I species in Wildlife (Protection) Act and hence enjoys the highest level of protection equal to that of tigers, lions, and elephants.“Imagine the hue and cry we would have seen had it been three tigers or lions being killed. But when it comes to the state animal, there has been hardly any concerted effort to protect it, barring a few local NGOs, conservationists or researchers working to save these smaller cats,” said Tiasa Adhya from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)’s Species Survival Commission, which has been researching on the cats for over a decade.According to a study conducted by The Fishing Cat Project as part of a WWF grant, at least 27 cases were reported from Howrah and Hooghly alone wherein fishing cats were found dead. Most of the cases pertained to retaliatory killings.According to a recent report published in CATnews, a biannual newsletter of the IUCN-SSC Cat Specialist Group, between January 2019 and February 2021, 11 such cases were reported. In February 2020, villagers at Shyampur in Howrah allegedly skinned a dead fishing cat for meat and even sold a portion of it.About twice the size of a typical house cat, the fishing cat primarily preys on fish in wetlands and marshy lands. In India, fishing cats are mainly found in the mangroves of the Sundarbans, on the foothills of the Himalayas along the Ganga and Brahmaputra river valleys, and the eastern coast up to Andhra Pradesh.Even though cats living in national parks and wildlife sanctuaries are protected, a huge population of the fishing cats in marshes and wetlands outside the parks along the floodplains of the Ganga are vulnerable and under threat.To date, there has been no proper estimation of the animal’s population outside protected areas despite being the state animal. “We are not doing enough to protect it. An animal listed under Schedule I... denotes that its population is on the decline. Loss of habitat is its primary threat... The land mafias are after wetlands... Only a handful of local NGOs and local conservationists are working on them even as the entire focus of the administration and big NGOs still remains on larger animals and key species such as tigers, elephants, and lions among others,” said Biswajit Roy Chowdhury, secretary of Nature Environment and Wildlife Society, an NGO.Experts want the government to play a more proactive role to protect and conserve the fishing cat and its habitat as it is listed as an endangered species on the IUCN’s Red List.“The animal is protected but its habitat is not. Unlike the US, where a law prevents changing the nature of land with protected species, we do not have such laws in India. The disappearance of the habitat of the fishing cat is the main reason behind the decline in population. ...some animals such as leopard, elephant, wolf, fishing cat live in areas which overlap with human habitat and increases their vulnerability,” said Debal Deb, chief wildlife warden, West Bengal.The report of a West Bengal Biodiversity Board study on fishing cats last year identified the threats to the animal even as it has faced criticism. “During the study, only 28 camera traps were placed across 80 locations. From such a low data set, the study concluded that Murshidabad district has the highest relative abundance of fishing cats. This is wrong because they are extrapolating site-specific results to the level of the district. Secondly, jungle cat kittens were misidentified as fishing cat kittens which casts doubt on the survey results,” said Adhya.Forest officials and researchers said the only way to conserve these animals is to protect their habitat, wetlands, and marshy areas, with a socio-ecological approach. Generating awareness, liaisoning with local conservationists for stricter enforcement of the law is necessary, they say.Experts said one way of protecting their habitats is by tagging them as Biodiversity Heritage Sites under the Biological Diversity Act. This can be done because there are many local practices endemic to that region that helps to protect the cat’s habitat. A reed locally called khari is found in their habitat. Khari is cultivated to support betel leaf cultivation. Another plant named hogla is used to pack vegetables and fruits. Both of these provide habitat to the cat.“It is difficult to estimate their numbers outside protected areas but through satellite mapping we can always estimate the areas of wetlands and marshy lands. An estimation of their habitat would be a good enough indicator of the status of their populations,” said Adhya.

28-01-2022||Mumbai||Supreme Court revokes suspension of 12 BJP lawmakers in Maharashtra||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday set aside the suspension of 12 Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmakers from the Maharashtra assembly for a year, saying it should not have extended beyond one session of the House.A three-judge bench headed by justice AM Khanwilkar held any suspension beyond that period is “substantially illegal”, “irrational” with no basis in law. The bench, also comprising justices Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar, said the lawmakers shall be entitled to all consequential benefits after the conclusion of the session in July.The lawmakers challenged the suspension calling it a deliberate attempt to suppress dissent in the House and dangerous for democracy. Senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi, Mahesh Jethamalani, Neeraj Kishan Kaul, and Siddharth Bhatnagar represented them. Senior advocate CA Sundaram, who appeared for the state, argued that once it is recognised the legislature has the power to suspend its members, the court could not review the quantum of punishment.The lawmakers were suspended for “unruly behaviour”. The court noted the assembly’s power to suspend is not doubted. But it added the period of suspension could not be such that it keeps a constituency unrepresented for a period beyond a session and in no event beyond six months within which any vacant seat must be filled.The lawmakers argued the resolution for their suspension was malafide and brought by the parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab. They added it was passed with a majority voice vote without giving them an opportunity of hearing. The resolution accused the lawmakers of misbehaving in the House and using “abusive language” against the presiding officer, Bhaskar Jadhav.The lawmakers argued the only means to punish an unruly act of a member of a House is by suspension for not beyond 60 days or expulsion, in which event the seat has to be filled by a fresh election.A seat can be declared vacant due to a member’s absence without permission for 60 days. The lawmakers submitted that keeping a member suspended beyond this period has a detrimental impact on democracy.The Speaker was not represented in the proceedings. The court observed the action of the House was dangerous for democracy. “Absolute power doesn’t mean unbridled power. Who knows this can be a precedent for experimentation. Today it is 12, tomorrow it may be 120. Is it not hitting the basic structure of the Constitution?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/screvokes-suspension-of-12-maharashtra-bjp-lawmakers-101643357942930.html
28-01-2022||Mumbai||Wine is not liquor, Sanjay Raut rebuts Fadnavis’ ‘Madya-rashtra’ remark||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Friday defended the Maharashra government's decision to allow sale of wine in supermarkets and walk-in stores saying that wine cannot be equated with liquor. Raut’s comment comes amid criticism from former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis that the Shiv Sena-led coalition government in the state wants to turn Maharashtra into “Madya-rashtra (liquor state)”.“Wine is not liquor. If wine sales increase (in the state), farmers will benefit from it. We have done this to double farmers' income. The BJP only opposes moves, but does nothing for farmers,” Raut hit out at Fadnavis' remarks.Accusing the Uddhav Thackeray government of prioritising liquor sale over other critical issues, Fadnavis has said, “We will not allow Maharashtra to become a Madya-rashtra. He said the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government did nothing to help people during the two years of the pandemic, and their “priority is promoting the sale of liquor”.The Maharashtra cabinet on Thursday cleared a proposal to sell wine in supermarkets and walk-in stores across the state at a flat annual licensing fee of ₹5,000. The move aims to ensure a more accessible marketing channel for Indian wineries.Wine bars, which already sell wine for consumption, but only on their premises (using what is called the E-2 license) will also be allowed to sell wine in sealed bottles for off consumption.The two-decade tax holiday for wine produced in Maharashtra came to an end on December 31, 2021.Maharashtra has 72 of the 110 wineries across the country. Of these, around 40 to 45 are operational. However, only 15 to 20 units are into direct marketing, while the rest are involved into contract manufacturing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/wine-is-not-liquor-sanjay-raut-rebuts-fadnavis-madya-rashtra-remark-101643350199491.html
28-01-2022||Chandigarh||BSF recovers 58 kg of heroin after encounter in Gurdaspur||The Border Security Force (BSF) recovered 58kg of heroin and a cache of arms after an encounter with Pakistani smugglers near Chandu Wadala outpost in poll-bound Punjab’s border district of Gurdaspur on Friday morning. During the encounter, a BSF personnel, identified as head constable Gyan Singh, received a bullet injury in the head and has been hospitalised in Amritsar, an official said. The incident took place at 5.15am when BSF personnel noticed suspicious movement across the barbed-wire fence. They found suspects trying to push in something into Indian territory and challenged them. “The suspects did not stop following which our jawans opened fire. The suspects retaliated. One of our personnel got a bullet injury but the smuggling bid was foiled,” said a senior BSF official, requesting anonymity. He said the condition of the BSF jawan is stable. When the area was searched, 47 packets of heroin wrapped in plastic covers weighing 58 kg, seven packets of opium weighing 1.17 kg, 44 rounds of 0.30 caliber, a Chinese pistol and two magazines, a Beretta pistol, and four magazines of AK series rifles were recovered from the spot. The BSF also recovered a shawl, a muffler and a winter cap suspected to be of the smugglers from across the border. On January 11, the BSF recovered 22 kg of heroin in Tarn Taran district besides seizing 7.5 kg of heroin along with arms and ammunition from the Pakistan border in three operations in Amritsar and Ferozepur sectors on January 12, a BSF official said. In the Ferozepur sector, the incident was reported early in the morning when troops observed suspicious movement ahead of the barbed-wire fence. On searching the area, six packets of the contraband, suspected to be heroin wrapped in a yellow packet, along with a pistol, a magazine and 50 rounds were recovered. In another incident, during a search in the Ferozepur sector, the BSF recovered a 1-kg packet of contraband suspected to be heroin. In the third incident, a pistol, a magazine and five rounds of ammunition were recovered after a search in the Amritsar sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsf-recovers-47kg-of-heroin-after-encounter-in-gurdaspur-101643350802754.html
28-01-2022||Mumbai||‘Promote grassroots research’: Padma awardee Bawaskar to government||MUMBAI: In 2013, Dr Himmatrao Bawaskar received a ₹1,200 cheque from a laboratory after one of his patients went there for a CT scan. Bawaskar, 71, returned the cheque and filed a complaint against the lab with the Medical Council of India, exposing the system of “cut practice”.Bawaskar, who runs a hospital in Maharashtra’s Mahad, is also known for his research on the management of scorpion stings and snake bites for over four decades. He has also highlighted the threats of polluted drinking water in rural areas. Bawaskar’s work was recognised when he was awarded India’s fourth-highest civilian award Padma Shri this week.“It is important to understand the challenges and problems faced by people at the grassroots. The government has to promote research, especially directed at the grassroots to identify the issues. I have been doing just that for years and will continue to do so,” said Bawaskar.Born in Jalna, Bawaskar did his MBBS from Nagpur and then pursued an MD in medicine from Pune. In the late 1970s, when he was posted at a Primary Health Centre in Raigad, he focussed on the high mortality due to scorpion bites.“I was perplexed, and wondered how an animal bite was causing so many deaths,” he said. He added the higher mortality prompted him to research the subject. In a research paper, Bawaskar highlighted the use of the hypertension drug Prazosin for the management of cardiovascular manifestations of scorpion sting. He researched another hypertension drug Nifedipine in combination with Prazosin. Bawaskar’s work on Prazosin was recognised internationally and replicated in many parts of the world.Over the past few years, Bawaskar has focussed on snakebite deaths. He wants the government to make snakebite deaths notifiable like HIV and TB. He has published research papers on snakebite deaths and envenoming and the lack of knowledge among doctors about the right dosage of anti-snake venom (ASV) and its rampant shortage.“In India, there is always a short supply of ASV. Medical officers are untrained and usually have never examined or managed a snake bite case before,” Bawaskar wrote in 2014 in the Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine. “To reduce the crisis of ASV supply medical officers should be given training regarding dose and indication of ASV.”Social activist Dr Abhay Bang said Bawaskar, who was his junior at the Nagpur medical college, has come up despite a lot of financial hardships. “He did odd jobs to fund his education. He also battled mental health issues and rose as a grassroots doctor finding solutions to the problems faced by the rural poor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/govt-must-promote-grassroots-research-padma-awardee-101643347983068.html

In Gopalganj, 28,589 passports were issued even as 30,697 people applied for them. As many as 13,269 passports were granted while 14,028 applications were submitted in Saran. In East Champaran, 14,141 passports were issued while there were 14,970 applicants. As many as 22,925 passports were issued in Patna while there were 23,820 applicants.In 2020, 21,642 passports were issued in Siwan, followed by Gopalganj (18,483), Saran (9,822), and Patna (20925). As many as 169,000 passports were issued in 2020 in the state compared to 326,000 in 2019 and 298,000 in 2018. In 2021, 270,000 passports were.Regional passport officer (Patna) Tavishi Behal Pandey said the higher number of passports issued in Siwan, Gopalganj, Saran indicates people were going abroad for employment.A large number of people from the region have been going abroad for employment especially to West Asia.“Siwan, Gopalganj, and Saran not only have linkages with employers in cities in India but over the past few decades have become a hub for getting semi-skilled people for employment be it for UAE or other nations. This is why the passport applications are high from this area even in these pandemic times,” said Rakesh Tiwary, a social scientist.Krishna Kumar Singh, an educationist from Siwan, said the trend of people going to West Asia has increased over the last decade and continued during the pandemic as skilled and semi-skilled persons from all communities are keen to work in places such as Dubai.Districts such as Katihar, Purnea, Kishanganj, Madhepura, Saharsa, and Khagaria, which have a high rate of migration of labourers to other states, do not have a higher volume of passport issuance.In 2021, 3333 passports were issued in Katihar, 6790 in Purnea, 910 in Madhepura, and 1637 in Sarharsa.

Videos of coaching institute teachers inciting the aspirants to take law into their own hands have also reportedly gone viral.A probe is on to find the teachers who have been named by those arrested during interrogation.Meanwhile, Left-associated All India Students' Association (AISA) and other youth organisations have called a "Bihar bandh" on Friday.Terming the formation of a committee by the railways ministry to look into the concerns of the aspirants as a "hoax" and "conspiracy", the youth organisations, led by AISA, in a press statement said the panel is “under the pressure” to postpone the matter till the election next month in Uttar Pradesh."There is no doubt on the questions being raised by the candidates. This massive movement of the student youth, who are facing extreme unemployment, has arisen at a time when there is an election in UP. Under the pressure of this, this proposal of the government and the railways has come and a conspiracy is being hatched to postpone the matter till the elections," they said.Thousands of students took to streets earlier this week to protest against the alleged irregularities in Railway Recruitment Board's exam and clashed with police, leading to a huge ruckus.Agitating students blocked rail tracks, pelted stones and even set a passenger train on fire in Arrah district of Bihar. Police carried out baton-charge and fired shots in the air to disperse the protesters.The RRB NTPC CBT 2 exam that was scheduled to be conducted in a single phase from February 15 to February 19 across the country at various exam centres remains postponed as a result of the violent protests. The Level 1 exam which was scheduled to begin on February 23, has also been postponed until further notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rrb-ntpc-exam-violence-four-held-for-vandalism-in-bihar-101643332136191.html

28-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn hikes NHM, NAS staff’s salaries by up to 10%||Fulfilling their demand for pay hike, the UT administration has increased the salaries of National Health Mission (NHM) and National Ambulance Service (NAS) staff with retrospective effect from January 1, 2022.All NHM staff, whose salary is less than the current DC rates, will be given up to 10% rise in salary, provided that the increased pay does not exceed 90% of the DC rates. Also, if the salary is less than 70% of the minimum wages even after the 10% hike, it will be brought up to 70%.UT will meet the additional annual expenditure from the state budget. The decision comes after the executive committee, NHM, conducted a meeting under the chairmanship of the UT health secretary on December 31 last year.It will benefit around 81% of the NHM and NAS staff in Chandigarh. The 19% staff, who will not get any financial benefit, are either already getting salary more than the DC rates or their pay is more than 90% of the DC rates.The NHM staff will also be given annual increment as per the Union government. In case of changes in the DC rates, there will not be any automatic revision in the salaries.Notably, in October 2021, 178 NHM employees were terminated after they went on strike without prior intimation to press for salaries at DC rates. Despite termination, the staff went on indefinite strike until they were reinstated on December 7.Around 500 NHM employees are working under the Chandigarh health department as doctors, paramedical staff, managerial employees, nursing officers, pharmacy officers, auxiliary nurse midwives, lab technicians, dental technicians and other Group-4 staffers. But their salaries have been lower than the approved minimum wages since 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-hikes-nhm-nas-staff-s-salaries-by-up-to-10-101643320512149.html

28-01-2022||Chandigarh||HC puts stay on Panjab University syndicate polls||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday stayed the proposed elections of Panjab University (PU) syndicate. On January 8, the senate, varsity’s apex governing body, had authorised the vice-chancellor to decide on a date for the syndicate elections. The high court bench of justice Rajbir Sehrawat acted on the plea of some PU teachers, who are demanding that election of six senate members – from the faculty constituency – be notified by the varsity. Syndicate members are elected from among the senate. It is the executive arm of the PU senate and responsible for day to day functioning of the varsity, but its elections have not been held for two years now. Of the 91 members in the senate, 36 are nominated by the Vice-President of India, two from the Punjab Assembly, six are ex-officio members and the remaining 47 are elected from the eight constituencies. The elections took place last year in August after a period of two years, primarily due to the Covid-19 pandemic. During the hearing, the petitioners informed the court that they had been duly declared as elected senate members from the faculty constituency by the returning officer appointed by the university. However, the university authorities had not issued the necessary subsequent statutory notification in this regard.On the other hand, varsity’s counsel told the court that under the statutory provisions, the election of the senate members is subject to the approval of the varsity chancellor and in the case of these members, some petitions had been received challenging their election. Accordingly, they have been issued show-cause notices, but they have not filed any response. As the petitioners told the court that they did not get copies of the said petitions, the court directed that they be supplied the petitions within a week and thereafter, they should file their responses within 10 days. The court was assured that a decision on the petitions will be taken within two weeks thereafter.“Keeping in view the above situation and as an ad interim measure, it is ordered that the election of the syndicate members will remain stayed till the next date of hearing,” the HC bench ordered, posting the matter for hearing on February 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-puts-stay-on-panjab-university-syndicate-polls-101643320509441.html

28-01-2022||Chandigarh||Mohali: NIA grants bail to one of seven accused in extortion case||The Special National Investigating Agency (NIA) court of Mohali on Thursday granted bail to one of the seven accused, Mohammad Asif Ali, 32, in an extortion case of Punjab businessmen, for not having a direct link with other accused. Special judge, NIA, Mohali, Karunesh Kumar while allowing the bail stated that Asif Ali, who has been in custody since July 10, 2021, has been simply charge-sheeted for the commission of offense under Section 120-B of the IPC and Section 25 (1-A) of the Arms Act. He has neither been charge-sheeted under the UA (P) Act nor any sanction under the UA (P) Act has been obtained against him. Therefore, the bar of Section 43 (D) (5) of UA (P) Act, 1967, is not attracted. Except for the alleged recovery of two weapons, nothing has been brought on record that he has any connection with any of his co-accused or supplied any arms to them. He is ordered to be released on bail on his furnishing personal bond of ₹1 lakh and submit his passport in court and would not leave the country. The case dates back to May 22, 2021, when a case was registered against the accused in extortion of prominent businessmen of Punjab in a police station in Moga. However, later, the investigation of the case was transferred to the NIA. Counsel for Asif Ali contended the claim of the NIA that during the custodial interrogation of co-accused Gagandeep Singh, the role of his client emerged, and a search was conducted at the house of the applicant/accused, where two country-made pistols were reportedly recovered. Even on perusal of the connectivity chart prepared in the report, the name of the present applicant does not figure anywhere to show his involvement or association with other co-accused and no useful purpose would be served by keeping his client in jail, who may be released on regular bail. NIA public prosecutor averred that during the investigation, it has been revealed that the accused persons namely Arshdeep Singh, Charanjit Singh and Ramandeep Singh, had formed a gang and were threatening and extorting money from people and on the directions of accused Hardeep Singh Nijjer, chief of the Khalistan Tiger Force, Punjab-based shooters from the gang targeted prominent persons of other faiths to create a sense of fear and disharmony in society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-nia-grants-bail-to-one-of-seven-accused-in-extortion-case-101643319900438.html

28-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiwale: Two friends in a subway||They live together. Noor Muhammed is in his 60s. The nameless one is one year old. The first one is a human. The other is a cat. They pass their time together in a subway. Mr Muhammed sells masks and handkerchiefs in the underground. The nameless one has no known occupation.“She walks here and there, but never ventures very far from me,” says Mr Muhammed. He goes silent. It is obvious that he wants to share something, but hesitates, as if conflicted about whether to disclose a secret or not. Finally, he says in a mumbling tone, “She has a very lazy nature. She sleeps most of the time.”This afternoon, the subway is empty. It is tunnelled under a busy road in central Delhi, but the sound of traffic is muffled, and can hardly be heard. On both sides of the passage, daylight seeps in through staircases. This subway is otherwise immersed in darkness, which would be very appealing in Delhi’s sweltering summer. But these days, the dimness is adding to the gloom of the cold dampness. Mr Muhammed is sitting on a corner chair — the handkerchiefs and masks are arranged on an upturned umbrella. The nameless one is ambling about the floor.“Her mother dumped her not long after she was born. One morning, I heard her sobbing — meh-meh-meh — over there,” he points to a corner. A Bihar native, Mr Muhammed has been serving as the subway’s unofficial custodian since it opened in 2006. “I think she was hungry. I fed her a bowl of milk. Since that day, we are together… I never thought of naming her.”Suddenly, a rush of footsteps. A group of young men enter the subway on their way to the other side. One of them pauses to gaze at the nameless one. He takes out his mobile phone and focuses the camera lens on her. The nameless one freezes, but does not show fear. Stilling into a statue, she gazes back at the young man, her eyes unblinking. The man takes a series of photos, and walks away. Only after a few moments, she stirs.“She isn’t naughty,” Mr Muhammed says. “I give her milk. She drinks it without complaining. I buy her 250g of kaleji (liver) from the meat shop every day.”About half an hour later, the nameless one is nowhere to be seen. Mr Muhammed is sitting cross-legged on his chair, his eyes closed. He appears to be asleep. The ramshackle chair beside him is empty, except for a blanket slumped upon… well, it’s the nameless one. She sleeps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-two-friends-in-a-subway-101643317389459.html
28-01-2022||Delhi||Uphaar fire: Delhi HC reserves order on Ansals' plea seeking suspension of jail term||The Delhi high court on Thursday reserved its order on the pleas by real estate barons Sushil and Gopal Ansal who sought a suspension of their seven-year jail term in the Uphaar cinema fire evidence tampering case.Justice Subramonium Prasad heard the arguments on behalf of the counsel for the Ansals, another convicted person Anoop Singh Karayat, the Delhi Police, and Association of the Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT).A trial court in November last year awarded the Ansal brothers, former court staff Dinesh Chand Sharma and two others -- PP Batra and Anoop Singh Karayat -- seven-year jail terms. The sessions court refused to suspend the sentence and release them on bail.Also Read | Uphaar fire: 7-yr jail to Ansals for tampering with evidenceThe 1997 fire left 59 dead.While dismissing the Ansals’ plea, the sessions court said the case was one of the gravest of its kind and the offence appeared to be the outcome of a calculated design to interfere with the course of justice.Seeking to suspend the jail term, Sushil Ansal’s counsel contended before the high court that the “mutilated” documents were not relevant to his culpability in the main Uphaar trial and his conviction in the evidence tampering case was a “travesty of justice”.He highlighted that Sushil Ansal was over 80-years-old and suffered from various ailments.Gopal Ansal’s counsel similarly argued that his client was over 70-years-old and said that the court should exercise its wide and liberal discretion to release him.The plea was opposed by the Delhi Police, which argued that the petitioners mutilated vital documents which formed part of the trial record in the main Uphaar cinema case, which forced the prosecution to record the secondary evidence in the main case and resulted in an enormous delay of trial court proceedings.AVUT’s counsel opposed the plea contending that the accused persons cannot be allowed to take law in their hands and claimed that the Ansals were “incorrigible’ and that the instant matter pertained to “majesty of the law” and “obstruction of justice”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/uphaar-fire-delhi-hc-reserves-order-on-ansals-plea-seeking-suspension-of-jail-term-101643316923426.html
28-01-2022||Delhi||MCD polls: Ward list sends parties back to drawing board||The Capital is all set for the crucial municipal corporation elections, due to be held in the city this April, with the state election commission (SEC) completing two crucial tasks ahead of the polls — revising the electoral rolls and fixing reserved seats.The revision of reserved seats, an exercise repeated before each full-term election, has set the cat among the pigeons since several key municipal leaders will now have to look for a new seat to contest.According to the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, of the city’s 272 municipal wards, 46 are reserved for people from the Scheduled Caste (SC) category. Additionally, 114 seats are reserved for women.The notification issued by the SEC on Tuesday said the commission has arranged wards in descending order of percentage of SC population, and the selected SC reserved wards for 2022 were the ones that follow the last ward reserved in 2017. For instance, the Punjabi Bagh ward with 20.45% SC population was the last reserved ward in descending order in 2017. So, this year, the election commission has selected subsequent wards in descending order such as Khyala (20.02%), RK Puram (19.45%), and so on.Several prominent councillors from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress will scout for new seats this year with the change in the status of wards they won in 2017.BJP leaders who have been hit by the revision include former mayor and current Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, sitting North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Raja Iqbal Singh, former North Delhi mayor and corporation veteran Jai Prakash, incumbent South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) mayor Mukesh Suryan and his predecessor Narendra Chawla.The Sadar Bazar ward (80-N), currently represented by Jai Prakash, has gone from being a general seat to one reserved for women. Jai Prakash said he also contested the assembly election from the Sadar Bazar assembly constituency in 2020, and added that he would have no problem shifting to a neighbouring ward, if given a ticket.In 2017, former Delhi BJP chief Satish Upadhyay had to leave his seat, Malviya Nagar, after it was reserved for women. Upadhyay did not contest the civic polls in 2017. This year, the seat has been restored to the general category.The shift in reserved wards has also impacted the AAP, which is main opposition in the three MCDs and is widely regarded as the front-runner to topple the BJP, which has governed the civic bodies for 15 years now. According to the list released by the state election commission, wards of all leaders of the Opposition in the three corporations have been reserved.Vikas Goyal, leader of the opposition (LoP) in North MCD, who represents Wazirpur ward (72-N) will have to look for a new seat, as it has now been made a reserved (SC) seat. The Dakshipuri ward represented by Prem Chauhan, who heads AAP councillors in SDMC, has now been reserved for women. The LoP in East MCD, Manoj Tyagi’s Khajoori Khas (63-E) ward has gone from being a general seat to one reserved for women.Goyal said his party was studying the revised list, and its probable impact on the seat arithmetic.“The rotation of wards is legal exercise, but it deprives a person from having a continuous connect with the area. If a person has worked hard for five years in an area, why should they not get an opportunity to be judged on their work? Since it is a legal exercise, it might need an amendment in the wake of ground realities,” he said.In the case of Abhishek Dutt, a senior Congress municipal leader, it could be a possible return to his home turf as Andrews Ganj (59-S), a ward he won in 2012, was reserved for women in 2017. Then, under the delimitation exercise, the ward’s boundaries were changed. Dutt got elected from then newly carved seat, which retained the name of Andrews Ganj. Now, that his seat has been reserved (women), he may move back to Kasturba Nagar ward, which contains part of his old seat.“In the new areas which have been added to the ward in Lodhi complex, we are showcasing our achievements in colonies like Sadiq Nagar,” Dutt said.Subhash Arya, a former mayor and senior BJP municipal leader, said the party has constituted a four-member team to study the election commission’s order, and added that the party will come up with a formal response in a few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mcd-polls-ward-list-sends-parties-back-to-drawing-board-101643316436662.html
28-01-2022||Chandigarh||Khadoor Sahib MP hints at revolt as son’s name not on Congress nominee list from Khadoor Sahib||Senior Congress leader and Khadoor Sahib MP Jasbir Singh Dimpa on Thursday hinted at raising a banner of revolt, a day after his son’s name did not figure in the second list of 23 candidates released by the party for the Punjab assembly elections. Dimpa was apparently eyeing party ticket for his son Updesh Gill from the Khadoor Sahib assembly constituency from where the party declared two-time MLA Ramanjit Singh Sikki as its candidate. “What should be done if your party ignores hard work, loyalty and honesty & prefers stacks (sic),” Dimpa tweeted Wednesday. Dimpa’s tweet came after his close associate and Congress leader Satinderjit Singh Chhajalwadi joined the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in the presence of party president Sukhbir Singh Badal. Dimpa, who won the parliamentary seat by defeating SAD leader Jagir Kaur in 2019, was campaigning hard in the constituency for the last few months. The father-son duo stopped their poll-related meetings in the segment soon after the party announced Sikki as its candidate. MP Dimpa had been supporting Chhajalwadi and wanted to secure Congress candidature for the latter from Baba Bakala, a reserve constituency, where the MP holds a considerable sway. Chhajalwadi was announced as SAD candidate from the Jandiala constituency on Thursday. Earlier, Dimpa and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu had attended a rally in Baba Bakala in support of Chhajalwadi’s candidature from the segment from where the party announced incumbent MLA Santhok Singh Bhalaipur as its candidate in its first list. Also, Dimpa’s absence during Rahul Gandhi’s visit to Amritsar on Thursday is being seen as another sign of a brewing revolt. Dimpa was not available for comments. He, however wrote on Twitter, “I was not able to attend the Amritsar function due to personal obligation and I had already informed the party leadership about this.”In another Tweet, he said, “Only Congress candidates from 117 assembly constituencies and not MPs were invited. So there was no boycott.” But the Congress’ Amritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla was also present during Gandhi’s visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/khadoor-sahib-mp-hints-at-revolt-as-son-s-name-not-on-congress-nominee-list-from-khadoor-sahib-101643316661785.html

28-01-2022||Chandigarh||People wise enough not to vote for a drug accused: Navjot Kaur on Bikram Majithia||Congress leader Navjot Kaur Sidhu on Wednesday said that people of the Amritsar East segment were wise enough not to vote for a drug smuggling accused, referring to the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikram Singh Majithia’s candidature from the seat against her husband and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu. Asked while campaigning for her husband whether it will be a high-profile contest in Punjab, she said, “I don’t think so. People are not stupid that they would vote for someone who is absconding after the high court dismissed his anticipatory bail in a drug case.” “Whoever comes to contest against my husband is welcome. But I would like to ask him if he would contest the polls from jail?” she said.Kaur, who also represented the constituency from 2012 to 2017, said, “It will be up to the people to decide whom they want to vote for. We don’t face any challenge from anyone as we have worked in this segment,” she added.On SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal terming Sidhu as “arrogant”, she said, “We are not arrogant. Those who do not get down from their vehicles or consider themselves as big are arrogant. How can we be arrogant since we are meeting people at their doorsteps.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/people-wise-enough-not-to-vote-for-a-drug-accused-navjot-kaur-on-bikram-majithia-101643316239828.html
28-01-2022||Chandigarh||Will challenge DSGMC presidential poll in court, say Paramjit Sarna, Manjit GK||Once-sworn rivals — Shiromani Akali Dal (Delhi) president Paramjit Singh Sarna and Jag Aasra Guru Aasra (JAGO) president Manjit Singh GK — on Thursday said they will jointly challenge in court the presidential polls of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC). In a poll session held at Delhi’s Gurdwara Rakab Ganj on January 22, the newly elected members associated with the SAD (Badal) had elected Harmeet Singh Kalka as gurdwara body president. But Sarna and GK, both of whom remained DSGMC chiefs in the past, alleged that the Badal faction forcibly captured the president’s and other posts of the committee with the help of the Delhi Police.Addressing a press conference in Amritsar, the two said, “The SAD (Badal) camp called police to the hall where Guru Granth Sahib was kept to take control of the committee by force. The rival members, including the nominee against Kalka, were chucked out of the hall with the help of police.” This was for the first time that police entered the gurdwara where Guru Granth Sahib was kept, they said. “The SAD (Badal) camp is responsible for this grave sacrilege. Also, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Harjinder Singh Dhami played a role in the sacrilege. Ironically, the Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh has not said anything on this so far. Both should quit if they are not able to ensure respect and maryada of Guru Granth Sahib,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-challenge-dsgmc-presidential-poll-in-court-say-paramjit-sarna-manjit-gk-101643316061685.html
28-01-2022||Noida||39 candidates to contest three assembly seats in Gautam Budh Nagar||With the first phase of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections a fortnight away, the total number of candidates for the three seats in Gautam Budh Nagar district remained at 39 on Thursday, the last day for the withdrawal of candidature. The 39 candidates will be contesting from the three assembly seats of Noida, Dadri and Jewar. Twelve candidates will contest from the Jewar seat, 13 from Noida and 14 from Dadri. The Jewar constituency has four candidates from national parties, three candidates from registered parties other than the recognised national parties and five Independents. This assembly seat also has the highest number of candidates over 60 years of age. The seat also has the highest women’s participation with two candidates — Poonam from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Neeru Walia from the Sarva Samaj Party — in the fray here. Dadri constituency has four candidates from national parties, six candidates from registered parties other than the recognised national parties and four Independents. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate and sitting MLA Tejpal Nagar, (68), is the only candidate over 60 years of age here. Incidentally, he is also the oldest among all candidates in the three constituencies. Also, there are no women candidates contesting from the Dadri segment. The Noida seat is expected to see an open contest of youth leaders as seven of the 13 candidates are in their 20s. Pankhuri Pathak from the Congress is the only women candidate. The constituency has four candidates from national parties, six candidates from registered parties other than the recognised national parties and three Independents. Despite having a large pool of youth leaders, sitting MLA Pankaj Singh from the BJP appears to have an advantage. Historically, apart from the top two or three candidates in all the three constituencies, the rest had to forfeit their deposits in the elections of 2007, 2012 and 2017. Forfeiture is required if a contesting candidate fails to get a minimum one-sixth of the total votes cast. The parties that usually get maximum votes are BJP, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP). One exception was in 2012, when Dhirendra Singh, then a Congress candidate, was the runner-up and lost by 9,500 votes in Jewar. In 2017, Dhirendra Singh, who fought on a BJP ticket, won by a margin of over 22,000 votes and this time he is seeking a re-election from the same seat again on a ruling party ticket. Experts say that the candidates’ list is an encouraging sign for democracy because of the increased political participation, especially from the youth, despite knowing that they may not be in a position to win. “Better political participation is always an encouraging sign in a democracy as voters get several options. Social media plays a big role as election campaigns are going virtual. Now, more and more people are able to participate in the electoral process”, said Dr Shalini Saxena, associate professor (political science) at the Amity University in Gautam Budh Nagar. “The online space is not a challenge for the youth today. With digital campaigns, we are moving away from the legacy politics of yesteryears. Now, voters are more approachable. It may be likely that the votes will be divided among more candidates this time, especially in an urban constituency such as Noida. Voters also have more candidates to choose from and this augurs well for democracy,” Dr Saxena added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/39-candidates-to-contest-three-assembly-seats-in-gautam-budh-nagar-101643316001697.html

A joint committee of the Central Pollution Control Board, Punjab Pollution Control Board and Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) may monitor compliance, the NGT has ordered.Notably, the NGT had already directed Punjab and UT to ensure that no solid waste is dumped into the N-Choe or catchment area, which is polluting the Ghaggar River, and STPs must have online monitoring system to monitor quality and quantity of wastewater being discharged.The joint committee in its report with the NGT had submitted that Punjab and Chandigarh are required to sort out the issue and take appropriate action of laying of sewage network and its treatment in a time-bound manner.Punjab is required to take action for collection and treatment of untreated sewage from villages of Mohali Area like Amb Sahib colony, Kambala, Papri, Manauli, Dairi, Kaura Majra, Chachu Majra, Saini Majra, Chau Majra, Nagiari, Ginemajra, Kalauli, Mote Majra, Hulka, Nadiali, Jhansali and many other villages of the Patiala region in the vicinity of the drain, which are discharging untreated sewage leading to the Ghaggar.The committee has also recommended that immediate action is required to regulate dairies and gaushalas in villages of Chandigarh and Mohali by following the “Guidelines for Environmental management of Dairy Farms and Gaushalas” as per Orders of NGTRespective local authorities/ urban local bodies of the Chandigarh administration and Punjab government are required to ensure that STPs are operated efficiently to achieve prescribed parameters without diverting untreated effluent into drains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pollution-of-ghaggar-river-punjab-chandigarh-asked-to-act-on-suggestions-of-joint-action-committee-101643316000224.html
28-01-2022||Delhi||‘For freedom fighters’: 75 Tricolours unfurled in city||Whenever someone in Delhi steps out of their home, they should see a Tricolour no matter which direction they look, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said while unfurling a 115-foot-tall national flag in Timarpur as part of the Delhi government’s project to set up 500 such high-mast flags across the Capital.The Delhi government, in all, unfurled 75 such high-mast national flags on Thursday across the city to mark the 75th year of India’s Independence.Kejriwal said 500 high-mast flags, including the 75 that were unfurled on Thursday, will be set up in the next couple of months. The plan is to have 115-foot tall national flags in every district and assembly constituency, he said, and so far, 80 such tricolour installations have come up.The ₹104 crore project is part of the 2021-22 budget, which finance minister Manish Sisodia had at the time termed the “Deshbhakti Budget”, to commemorate the 75th anniversary of India’s Independence. The budget contained several projects meant to instil a sense of patriotism among residents of the Capital.“We have installed the tiranga at a height of 115 feet at 75 places in Delhi to pay homage to our freedom fighters. Our goal is to ensure that whenever someone steps out of their home, they see a tiranga in every direction they look. Seeing the tiranga fly high instills a stronger sense of patriotism in everyone. Delhi is perhaps the only city in the world to have installed their national flag on such a large scale. Hopefully, we have secured a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records for this feat,” Kejriwal told reporters at the event.Till August 15, 2021, the public works department (PWD) had installed high-mast national flags at five locations in the city -- East Kidwai Nagar, Rani Bagh, East Vinod Nagar, Kalkaji, and Dwarka.“Our target was to set up the 500 high-mast flags by January 26 (Republic Day), but because there was a ban on construction activities due to pollution and also the third Covid-19 wave, it will now take place over the next couple of months,” Kejriwal said.PWD minister Satyendar Jain, who was also present at the Timarpur event, said that the state agency has executed the project in accordance with the 2002 Flag Code of India rules, which pertain to the laws and practises around the display of the national flag.“Abiding with the flag code rules, illuminating the flag with adequate lighting was given priority. Each foundation was painted red and white. The Delhi Government has executed this colossal project largely on PWD roads under its purview. The project has been executed while overcoming challenges of the multiplicity of road-owning agencies in Delhi, like the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), both of which are under the control of the central government and the municipal corporations of Delhi,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/for-freedom-fighters-75-tricolours-unfurled-in-city-101643315410221.html
28-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Lack of social interaction, excess screen time causing stress among kids, say parents||Even as physical classes will resume for Classes 10 to 12 from February 1, the other students will continue with online classes even as year-end exams are drawing near. Many students and parents say this is leading to stress, as physical classes have been suspended since January 10 amid the Covid surge.Ever since the first lockdown, it has been a common complaint by parents that sitting in front of the computer screen for long periods of time is making kids more irritable, leading to mood swings and damaging their eyesight.Due to limited social interaction, parents say kids have become more introverted and since they are not getting enough exercise, their health is also suffering.However, as per president of the Chandigarh Parents’ Association Nitin Goyal, the numbers of complaints have reduced as parents are now accustomed to the downsides of online classes.Goyal said, “The UT education department can set up a dedicated helpline for students where they can share issues related to Covid or online classes.” Chandigarh district education officer (DEO) Prabhjot Kaur said that the phone numbers of class teachers and school counsellors have already been shared with all students and they have also been told to check in routinely to ensure the childrens’ well-being.The counsellor of a government school on condition of anonymity, said, “Students from poorer socio-economic backgrounds are suffering the most and many of them call us about problems they are facing with their family or with online classes. Worksheets are prepared for students unable to attend online classes. Other problems also include issues with certain subjects like maths.” She added that the number of calls received were higher during the second wave in 2021.Chairperson of Chandigarh Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (CCPCR) Harjinder Kaur, said, “The commission is also concerned about the mental health of children, as online teaching can’t compare to physical classes. We are running virtual programmes to involve kids more and create awareness among both students and parents till offline classes can resume.”Dr Adarsh Kohli, professor of clinical psychology at PGIMER, said, “Children are being deprived of social learning and learning by observation and parents have to ensure that more interactive methods of play and study are practiced at home. More video sessions with cousins, playmates and school friends need to be encouraged.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-lack-of-social-interaction-excess-screen-time-causing-stress-among-kids-say-parents-101643315640167.html

Rahul visited the Golden Temple and other shrines in Amritsar. While the Congress has so far declared candidates from 109 constituencies, not more than half of them made it to the Gandhi scion’s visit, a local party leader said. Among those who failed to turn up were state cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Rana Gurjit Singh who had unsuccessfully sought party ticket for their sons from the Batala and Sultanpur Lodhi seats.Amritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla, who accompanied Rahul, claimed that more than 85 percent of nominees were present. “Some of the candidates who were to file their nominations and had other scheduled programmes could not join him, but many reached the shrine later,” the Amritsar MP said. Gandhi scion listens to gurbaniSoon after paying obeisance at the Golden Temple sanctum sanctorum, the former Congress national president along with Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, deputy CMs Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, OP Soni, Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa listened to gurbani kirtan. District Congress (rural) chief Bhagwantpal Singh Sachar honoured him with ‘siropa’ and ‘kirpan’ outside the shrine complex. The Congress leader partook of langar along with devotees. Later, he paid tributes to the martyrs at the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial following which he paid obeisance at the Durgiana Temple and the Bhagwan Valmiki shrine at Ram Tirath.Khadoor Sahib MP Dimpa, who was seeking party ticket to his son from Khadoor Sahib constituency, tried to explain his absence in a Twitter post, “Due to my personal obligation I was not able to attend Amritsar function & for this I had already informed my leadership, no assumptions please (sic).” But he had tweeted on Wednesday, “What should be done if your party ignores hard work, loyalty and honesty & prefers stacks”.Also, former state party chief Sunil Jakhar clarified on his absence in a tweet, “Heartiest welcome to Sh @RahulGandhi as he arrives in Guru-ki-Nagri... Eagerly awaiting my 7 day quarantine to end to personally carry forward his msg for - Punjab di Chardi Kala (sic)!”

He said that as many as 318 towers of Airtel, Vodafone, BSNL, ATC, Indus and Jio are installed in Panchkula, but after 2016, prescribed fees and other charges were not paid by themGupta issued directions to disconnect the connections of companies which don’t clear their dues within a week. He added that MC is owed ₹100 crore on account of fees for installation of tower and laying lease lines and notices have been issued to the companies to clear their dues. Gupta said that of the 87 files which were found missing, 21 were of Reliance Jio, 16 of Indus Company, 13 of Airtel, 18 of Vodafone, three of BSNL and 16 of ATC.“We are cross checking every file. The discrepancy could be because a few files were earlier handled by the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran,” said the MC commissioner.“The revenue realisation committee in its investigation has found that an official issued permission to a mobile company to install tower without paying processing fee and rent of about Rs. 1.65 crore,” he said.The MLA said that the potholes on the roads are not filled properly by the mobile companies after the completion of work. “I have issued directions to take strict action against such companies. A detailed report in this regard will be sent to the senior officials of urban local bodies department as well as ULB minister Kamal Gupta so that appropriate action can be taken,” the MLA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-87-files-of-telecom-firms-missing-from-mc-office-101643315339726.html
28-01-2022||Chandigarh||High court grants bail to Punjab Congress leader Sukhpal Khaira in money laundering case||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday granted bail to Congress leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money laundering case in November last year. Khaira, who is lodged in the Patiala jail and is Congress candidate from the Bholath segment for the Punjab assembly elections, had moved the HC seeking bail on December 13 after his bail petition was dismissed a week earlier. The bench of Justice Sureshwar Thakur observed, “When the offence under the money laundering law is directly linked with the predicate offence and that the matter is pending in the apex court, the high court, prima facie, cannot firmly draw an objective conclusion that the money drawn in the drug case also resulted in committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Khaira was told to surrender his passport and appear in the trial court when hearing in the case is fixed. He was also told not to leave Punjab and Haryana without the trial court’s permission. The ED had raided Khaira’s premises in March 2021 and later initiated proceedings in connection with a first information report (FIR) registered in a 2015 drug case. A court had convicted four persons and by the same order, Khaira was summoned as additional accused in 2017.Claims political vendettaKhaira, who joined the Congress in June last year, has maintained that the proceedings against him were part of a political vendetta. Khaira claimed that the ED’s action was a case of witch-hunt as he had been vocal against the Centre’s three farm laws which were later repealed. The ED had initiated proceedings under the PMLA in January even as there was a stay from the Supreme Court in the 2015 matter, he had claimed.The ED opposed the bail claiming that Khaira was an accomplice of drug case convicts and fake passport racketeers. Also, a special ED court in Mohali on Thursday allowed him to come out of jail to file nomination as a candidate on January 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-court-grants-bail-to-punjab-congress-leader-sukhpal-khaira-in-money-laundering-case-101643315219878.html
28-01-2022||Noida||Congress’ Pilot sounds poll bugle in Ghaziabad||Senior Congress leader Sachin Pilot on Thursday slammed the “double-engine ki sarkar” (Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre and Uttar Pradesh) and said that the state never re-elects the same party. Pilot was in Ghaziabad to campaign for Congress candidates who are contesting in all the five assembly constituencies in the upcoming state polls. “In this area, we have a direct fight with the BJP. The “double-engine ki sarkar” has posed problems for the people. The farmers were forced to carry on agitation for over a year and about 700 of them also died. People of every segment suffered and are annoyed with them,” Pilot said. Pilot also slammed the BJP on a host of issues such as healthcare, education, roads, electricity and unemployment. “After failing on all these accounts, chief minister Yogi Adityanath is talking about 80:20, religious divide, love-jihad and mandir-masjid for which he is well known. People are fed up with all this and want development. Also, many of their leaders have run away to other parties and this gives an indication. If the BJP is so strong, what is the need for the Union home minister Amit Shah to hold meetings with Jat leaders?” Pilot added. Pilot was campaigning for Congress candidate Sushant Goyal, who is contesting his first election. He is the son of former Congress MP late Surendra Prakash Goyal. He also went to the grain market at Ghanta Ghar and visited several shops during the election campaign. “People in UP need change and in UP governments don’t get repeated. So, there will be change this time and the Congress is the best bet for the people. They have seen different governments in the past 30 years and other parties have not been able to perform the role of Opposition. If they (BJP) are not fearful this election, why is Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Adityanath holding so many election campaigns,” Pilot said. BJP leaders countered Pilot and said that the Congress party has lost base across the state. “If they think that they have a fight with the BJP, let them remain in illusion. They have lost their base in UP and the coming election will be another eye-opener for them,” BJP’s city president Sanjeev Sharma said. Political experts agreed and said that the Congress has lost base in India’s most populous state over the last 30 years. “For any political outfit to succeed, it needs to have workers and cadres. Congress cadres have shifted to other parties over the years. If their leaders are trying to gain ground, they should first build a strong base of party workers, so that the party gains strength in the next 5-10 years,” said KK Sharma, associate professor (history) from MM College, Modinagar. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the Congress general secretary, is leading her party’s campaign in UP and has also promised 40 percent seats to women candidates. The party also launched a manifesto for the youth to woo young voters. The Congress fared poorly during the last three assembly elections held in 2007, 2012 and 2017.

Police said that the car driver, a businessman, couldn’t produce documents to verify the cash.“While searching, the total ₹21,23,990 cash was recovered. The driver of Porsche car identified himself as Rohit Awana, a resident of Sector 19 in Noida,” said Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police (Noida 2).The ACP said that Awana was released after questioning. “During questioning, Awana revealed that he runs a petrol pump and was returning home from Gaur City in Greater Noida West with the collection money of last three to four days. We have informed income tax officials to probe into the matter. A case will be registered if we find irregularities in connection with the seized money,” said Verma. In the second incident, ₹3,01,000 was recovered from a WagonR car at Sector 60 checkpost. “The car’s occupant, Gopal Swarup, was unable to answer any questions with regards to the cash recovered. He said that he is a businessman working in Noida. Swarup was let go after questioning. Income tax officials have been informed about the cash,” said a senior police official. The officials said that they are probing if the money was meant to be used in the upcoming state assembly elections. The seven-phase state polls are set to commence from February 10 when the voters in three constituencies of Gautam Budh Nagar — Noida, Jewar and Dadri — will cast the ballot.The district police have seized unaccounted cash worth about ₹1.50 crore in the past ten days. On January 18, cash worth ₹99 lakh was recovered from an SUV near Noida Stadium in Sector 24 while on January 20, ₹4 lakh was recovered from another SUV in the Knowledge Park area of Greater Noida. Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said police teams have intensified checking in the district ahead of the assembly elections. “We are checking every vehicle entering the city,” he said.“Apart from borders, our teams are continuously visiting guest houses, hotels, and markets. The SHOs have been directed to keep a watch in the areas falling under their jurisdiction and take swift action against suspicious people,” he said.The officer further said that a total of 9,000 personnel of the Uttar Pradesh police and home guards, along with some paramilitary troops, are presently deployed in Gautam Budh Nagar for the assembly elections.
28-01-2022||Delhi||Why leave schools behind, learning at stake: Principals||Administrators and parents on Thursday were a disappointed lot as the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) deferred a decision on reopening school to its next meeting, which is likely to take place on February 7. Stakeholders said the delay in opening schools has been causing immense harm to children who have stayed away from in-person for most of nearly two years now.Also Read | Covid-19: Schools, colleges to remain closed in DelhiDuring the DDMA meeting on Thursday, officials said a decision on reopening schools will be taken up for discussion in the next meeting, after experts suggested a phased reopening of institutions. In the first phase, schools will be reopened for students in classes 9-12, followed by classes 5-8, and classes 3-4 in the third, they said.But school administrators said educational institutions were not accorded priority whereas curbs on bars, restaurants, and markets were being relaxed. They said prolonged suspension of in-person classes was exacerbating the learning gap among students.Sudha Acharya, chairperson of the National Progressive School Conference (NPSC) said most had expected a positive outcome on Thursday as deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had earlier highlighted the learning loss on account of school closure, and said the government backed their reopening.Acharya said the delay did not make sense as the government was relaxing other curbs. “The meeting is scheduled next week and we are not certain what decision might be taken or by when it would come into effect,” said Acharya.“We also need to conduct practical exams for students of board classes (class 10 and 12). Now, we will have to wait before planning exams. This is an unnecessary delay. We are unable to understand why schools are not a priority if other establishments such as restaurants and malls can function with relaxations,” said Acharya.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said the deferment of reopening has thrust schools into uncertainty again. “How is it possible that we are able to open schools in Maharashtra for children of all grades but the same can’t be done in Delhi?” said Joshi.Parents also expressed their disappointment with the continued closure. They said the lack of clarity on reopening was a disappointment after their demand was supported by Sisodia.More than 1,600 parents on Wednesday signed an online petition requesting government authorities and other key stakeholders to reopen schools for in-person classes on priority. A delegation of parents met Sisodia who said school reopening was crucial to bridge the learning gap.“We are disappointed that schools continue to remain closed, despite Manish Sisodia supporting the reopening of schools. We are unable to understand the rationale behind the continued closure when experts nationally and internationally have recommended the opening of schools,” said Tanya Aggarwal, lawyer, and one of the petitioner parents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/why-leave-schools-behind-learning-at-stake-principals-101643313932520.html
28-01-2022||Noida||Shah starts poll campaign from Dalit’s house in Greater Noida||Eyeing Dalit votes in the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) bastion of Dadri, Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday kicked off his door-to-door campaigning for the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls from a Dalit’s home in Greater Noida’s Tugalpur village of Dadri assembly constituency.Dadri is the home turf of BSP chief and former chief minister Mayawati and approximately 15% of a total 587,000 voters are Dalits, according to the latest voters’ list.Shah, along with Dadri candidate Tejpal Nagar, visited at least four houses and a few shops in Tugalpur’s by-lanes, where Dalits live in large numbers. His visit to the predominantly Dalit area assumes significance as Mayawati hails from Badalpur village of Dadri and, for that reason, the assembly segment has always been a stronghold of the BSP. However, in 2017, BJP’s Tejpal Nagar effected an upset by defeating BSP candidate and two-time MLA Satveer Singh Gujjar by a margin of 80,000 votes. And, this time, the BJP is sparing no trick to win the seat again, including having the home minister open his campaign from Dadri.A confident Nagar said, “We are winning Dadri and forming a government in UP easily because our government has worked for all communities. We aim to defeat our rivals by a margin bigger than that of 2017 because people have realised that only the BJP can develop UP,” he said. After interacting with Shah and Nagar, Juhi Sagar, an MBA student and a Dalit from Tugalpur village, said, “We are with the BJP because it has provided a safe environment to women and worked for the welfare of all communities,” Shah also addressed a “prabhaavi matdaata samwad (effective voter dialogue)” in Greater Noida’s Sharda University and delivered a 35-minute speech to motivate party cadre ahead of the seven phased polls, starting February 10. Speaking at the event, Shah said the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh has brought about a change in the last five years in every section of society and is now seeking a second term for the betterment of society.“This election is not only to elect an MLA or chief minister but to constructively support Yogi Adityanath’s good governance. This is the election to fight against the “four misdeeds” of previous governments -- corruption, nepotism, appeasement of a particular section of people and mafiaraj -- that destroyed this state for long. Recalling the rule by the Kalyan Singh government of the BJP in 1991, Shah said,”Babu ji Kalyan Singh of BJP was the first to give good governance in the state and now it is the Yogi government. This government has worked for all sections of society; created jobs, set up industries, put mafias in jail, built infrastructure, hospitals, universities, expressways and what not to improve the image of the state. But a lot more is left to do.”“In the last five years, the Adityanath government has put every goonda behind bars -- be it Azam Khan, Ateeq Ahmed, Mukhtar Ansar and others,” said Shah.Asking why the opposition parties were feeling uncomfortable about income tax searches, Shah said, “The income tax searches found truckloads of black money and they started feeling the pain. Why? Because they have a connection to that money.” They claimed to work for the backward caste but did nothing during their regime, he said. “Our government created a commission to work for the backward castes and provided reservation for medical students. We are working for all communities,” he affirmed.Accusing the BJP leader of resorting to falsehoods, SP spokesperson Raghwnedra Dube said, “BJP leaders will say any falsity to woo voters. These elections, voters will teach the BJP a lesson. the SP government from 2012 to 2017 provided a conducive environment for all sections -- be it businessmen, Dalits, professionals or others. People will vote for the SP-RLD combine because they want change.” Countering Shah’s allegations, Gautam Budh Nagar BSP chief Lakhmi Singh said, “It is the BSP that developed Noida and Greater Noida and also built the Yamuna Expressway, among other important development projects in the state and the people know that. All allegations made by Amit Shah are baseless and people will teach the BJP a lesson using their votes.” said Lakhmi Singh BSP president from Gautam Budh Nagar.

28-01-2022||Chandigarh||PM Rashtriya Bal Puruskar awardee: Karnal youth’s portal a weapon to fight Covid||The adage ‘necessity is the mother of invention’ holds true for Karnal’s Aakarsh Kaushal, who has been awarded with the PM Rashtriya Bal Puruskar for helping lakhs of Covid-19 patients amid the pandemic.Kaushal, a Class 12 student’s karnalcovid.in helped people to get real-time data of cases, deaths, availability of beds and their RT-PCR test reports while sitting at home. It also helped the authorities deal with the situation and counter false information as there was no source of credible information available in smaller cities like Karnal.“During the first wave, I realised that people were facing problems in getting their RT-PCR reports. They were unable to move out due to the pandemic. I felt that an online portal was the best alternative,” Kaushal said, on how he got the idea.Kaushal, with the help of his father, contacted the Karnal deputy commissioner and the CMO. They agreed to assist him with the data and information if he creates a portal in October 2020.“In the beginning, I created the portal to facilitate people with real time data of Covid cases, recoveries and deaths, then I realised that people were not able to get their RT-PCR test reports as going out was not safe and with the help of Karnal health department, I created another portal enabling people to get their RT-PCR report within 24 hours of sampling,” he said.But the worst was yet to come and a few months later, the second wave of the pandemic hit the country. The number of cases increased manifold and people were running from pillar to post to get hospital beds. Thus, Kaushal created another portal with real-time information of availability of beds in all government and private hospitals.“The initiatives evoked huge response and helped lakhs of people. Even people from different states were able to get details of empty beds in Karnal,” said chief medical officer (CMO) Yogesh Sharma.Later, CMOs from other districts also contacted Kaushal and he created the portal for RT-PCR test reports for 10 more districts.The initiative has been implemented under the guidance of Dr Chintan Vaishnav, a senior lecturer at MIT’s Solan School of Management and the academic director of MIT Tata Centre for Technology and Design wrote him an e-mail and Dr Chintan helped him with a mentor regarding design of the website, and other features on it.His parents Aarti and Gagan Kaushal are both doctors. They run a private hospital in Karnal. “Since Class 7, he was learning computer science and web development online. Soon after, I noticed his interest in computer science,” said Dr Gagan.Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said the initiative helped the public and the administration to deal with the situation. He had recommended Kaushal’s name for this national award.Presently, the project has 10 websites serving in 11 districts of Haryana and till date, it has over 1.3 millions views over 8,00,000 hosted RT-PCR reports with 2,00,000 downloaded reports and is serving a population of about 16.5 million.
28-01-2022||Lucknow||Seers’ meet in Magh Mela tomorrow, ‘Jihad’, ‘Hindu nation’ on agenda||PRAYAGRAJ: Saints and seers belonging to various sects and organizations will discuss “ways to counter Islamic Jihad” and “steps to help bring a Hindu nation into being” at a “Sant Sammellan” to be held during the ongoing Magh Mela-2022 at the camp of the Brahmrishi Ashram Trust on January 29. It has been organised by the Dharm Sansad Sanchalan Samiti. “The aim of this “Sant Sammellan” is to get saints from across the country to sit together on a single platform and discuss pressing issues and challenges facing the country and the Hindus,” informed a key organizer of the meet and president of Varanasi-based Shankracharya Parishad, Swami Anand Swaroop. He said that a large number of noted saints from across the country, including Shankaracharya of Puri Swami Nischalananda Saraswati, Mahamandaleshwar Prabodhanand Giri, Khak Chowk saints’ president Damodar Das and Mahamandaleshwar Santosh Das aka Satua Baba would attend the meet, apart from many others. According to his Twitter bio, Swaroop is the president of the Shankaracharya Parishad and the Ganga Mission. The Shankaracharya Parishad’s official website claims that it is reaching the society globally, with the mission of reconstruction of ancient India. “The saints will deliberate on the various forms of jihads being waged against the members of the Sanatan dharma, including “Love Jihad” targeting Hindu girls and women, besides other such efforts to drive away Hindus from Muslim-dominated areas and localities, forcefully grabbing their properties and also cow slaughter. The saints want strict laws against such acts across the country and their proper enforcement,” said Swaroop, who has hogged limelight for his anti-Muslim remarks in the past. Though the saints claim that the meet has nothing to do with politics and the UP assembly elections 2022, they do concede that the saints would always support political parties and leaders who “believe and work to take forward” their suggestions. “This “Sant Sammellan” is apolitical. However, we will propagate support for a leader who would work towards making the country a “Hindu Rashtra” and respect the values that go with it, added Swaroop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/seers-meet-in-magh-mela-tomorrow-jihad-hindu-nation-on-agenda-101643311322520.html
28-01-2022||Lucknow||BJP only option for people who want rule of law: Yogi||LUCKNOW Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was the only option for people who wanted rule of law, good governance, zero tolerance towards crime and no politics of appeasement. He called upon people to vote for the BJP, as their vote would not only elect an MLA but also (indirectly) elect the chief minister of UP. “Decisions (of governance) are taken by the chief minister. How to deal with criminals, anarchists and how the benefits of development schemes will reach the people are decided by the CM,” said Yogi in an obvious bid to educate voters how 2022 assembly elections may affect them at the state level. Adityanath was addressing a select gathering at the ‘Prabhavi Matdata Samvad’ in Bijnor, where he tried to establish an instant connect with people. He called Bijnor as the land of Mahatma Vidhur (of Mahabharat).The chief minister targeted the Samajwadi Party, the BSP and the Congress alike, reciting a verse from the Gita to make his point that they would never say “paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśhāya cha duṣhkṛitām” (to protect the righteous, to annihilate the wicked, and to re-establish the principles of dharma I appear on this earth, age after age) and follow the righteous path. Adityanath said previous chief ministers refrained from visiting Bijnor because of some myth and as chief minister he had been visiting the district frequently with the recent one being for laying the foundation of a medical college in the name of Mahatma Vidhur. Adityanath said the district was left “Bhagwan Bharose” as there was no development, no hearing for farmers while criminals and mafia were having a field day. “We decided to set Duryodhans and Dusshasans right,” he said while referring to action taken against criminals and mafia in western UP after the installation of BJP government in 2017. He said the SP, the BSP and the Congress-led governments followed wrong policies, had bad intentions and used to differentiate among people. He said there was a clear difference between how the BJP worked and the work done by the opposition. The CM said loan waiver for farmers, setting up of Anti-Romeo squads and ban on illegal slaughter houses were the first three decisions of the BJP government following its installation in 2017. “When the Samajwadi Party came to power in 2012, they withdrew cases against terrorists…the difference is clear,” he added. Adityanath said the previous governments deprived people of the benefits of government schemes and the money they collected by indulging in loot from poor, farmers, labourers, children, women and health and education budget was being recovered and the Samajwadi Party was getting upset. Referring to the “poor state of affairs in UP” during the previous regimes, he said: “This is the same UP that used to witness a riot every third day. Big incidents of violence used to take place here. Girls were not able to go to school while women were not able to go to the market and farmers were upset. Bijnor faced utter neglect as it is situated on the UP-Uttarakhand border. Youths used to hear taunts from the people of Uttarakhand that no development is taking place in Bijnor while Uttarakhand is developing.” Adityanath said the people of Bijnor now know how farmers were getting prosperous, youths were getting government jobs, traders were feeling secure and how medical colleges were coming up in the state. ‘Yogi Adityanath zindabad’ slogans rent the air at regular intervals as the CM asserted that his government followed the principle of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’. The CM concluded his address with “Jai Sri Ram”, asking people to take his message to every citizen of Bijnor to make UP the number one state in the New India.Adityanath also went door to door to meet people and said he was there to seek support for BJP candidates. He stopped to interact with children and asked them whether they were attending school. He visited the local Covid hospital and spoke to media persons later, pointing out how the third wave of Covid would be contained in the next 10 days, like the first and second waves of the pandemic.

A medical report also confirmed that she was not sexually assaulted.According to reports, the biker has been identified and has faced an initial round of questioning.The state government has referred the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on January 16 after the opposition BJP cited the incident as an example of deterioration in the law and order situation, particularly in the context of crimes against women.
28-01-2022||Gurugram||Third wave of Covid under control in Gurugram, say health department officials||Health department officials on Thursday said that the Covid-19 situation in Gurugram district has reached a plateau and is stabilising with a gradual decline in the positivity rate and daily testing numbers. On January 21, the district had witnessed a 33% positivity rate with 3,509 cases and 10,401 samples were tested that day. Till the third week of January, the positivity rate was on an increase with some sharp fluctuations. On January 18, the district had reported a positivity rate of 30.82% against 10,191 tests, which dropped to 22.59% on January 20 with 12,591 tests and again increased to 33.73% on January 21 against 10,401 tests. In the past seven days (from January 21-27), the positivity rate in the district is on a downward trend with minor fluctuations as testing numbers have also declined from over 10,000 samples a day to around 7,500 samples. Officials said that testing numbers reduced in proportion to the number of cases being reported daily. In the first week of January, 5,000 daily average tests were being conducted when the district had less than 1,000 cases, according to official records. This was increased to 12,000-13,000 tests by mid-January as the district reported over 3,000 cases. Now, around 7,000-9,000 daily tests are being conducted as cases have come down to below 2,000. Along with this, the positivity rate in the district increased from 5% (approximately) in the first week of January to 25% by the mid of the month, reaching a peak of 33% on January 21 and since then, it has been on a decline. On Thursday, the district reported a positivity rate of 21.62%. “With a declining positivity rate, we can safely say that the district has reached stability for the third wave and cases are on a downward trend now. If a lesser number of cases are being reported then automatically the contacts of the positive patients also drop, so daily testing numbers are also reduced accordingly,” said Dr Jai Prakash, the district surveillance officer. On January 14, the district health department issued new guidelines regarding testing and hospitalisation, based on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. According to the district surveillance officer, all symptomatic patients with cough, fever, sore throat, and other symptoms must get tested along with the at-risk contacts of confirmed positive cases. Health experts also said that decreased daily testing numbers does not affect the positivity rate as more symptomatic patients are being tested. Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of department of community medicine and school of public health at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER) said, “With the revised guidelines of the Union government, mostly symptomatic patients are being tested. In such a scenario, if there is a downward trend, then it is real and means that the wave is stabilising, irrespective of the number of tests being conducted. “When asymptomatic patients are also tested, the number of daily tests will definitely be high in comparison with daily cases, due to which positivity rate may or may not be accurate. But with testing of only symptomatic patients, the denominator has shrunk and a downward trend in this situation is good news,” Dr Kumar added. Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, a health expert and epidemiologist said, “When we conduct test on more symptomatic patients, test positivity rate will be high, but now, over two weeks since the new testing policy has been implemented, if there is a decline in positivity rate, it shows that there is a downward trend. But such data must be interpreted with hospitalisation rate and as that has also been less than 2 percent, it is safe to conclude that Gurugram might have crossed the third wave peak and the situation is stabilizing. However, there is no reason to relax or lower our guards.” Experts also said that reduced testing numbers may or may not show an actual decline in cases. Dr Arun Sharma, a health expert who was with the community medicine department of University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi said, “Overall what we are seeing, irrespective of the decline in the number of tests, is that proportion of people who are testing positive is low and that is why we can say the number of cases is definitely coming down. It could be so that out of 10 symptomatic people, nine are coming forward for testing because of fear”. “But since it not known whether the samples are a representative of the population, that is a greater number of samples being of symptomatic people or the larger chunk being of asymptomatic people, we cannot draw an inference that what we are seeing right now is the actual decline in cases,” Dr Sharma added. Meanwhile, Gurugram on Thursday reported 1,671 fresh cases of Covid-19 along with 3,177 recoveries, taking the active cases tally to 9,288. The district also reported three deaths. On the brighter side, the district reported less than 2,000 cases for the first time since January 8. “Gurugram reported three deaths, which include a 75-year-old fully vaccinated male who was suffering from nasopharynx carcinoma. Another deceased was a 79-year-old man who was unvaccinated with comorbidity of carcinoma prostate and the third deceased was a 72-year-old man who was unvaccinated and suffering from Parkinson’s disease and coronary artery disease,” said the district surveillance officer. On Thursday, a total of 8,342 doses were administered to beneficiaries in the district, including 2,499 first doses, 4,246 second doses and 1,597 precautionary doses. Gurugram has administered a total of 4.75 million vaccines till date.

28-01-2022||Lucknow||New Covid cases down but Jan saw 7 deaths a day on average||The number of daily Covid-19 cases has reduced in the last one week and experts say this could be an indication of the peak having been crossed, but cautioned that despite the fall in the number of daily cases, the threat from infection remains.“New cases are reducing which indicates that we have peaked,” said Dr PK Gupta, a microbiologist and former president of Indian Medical Association, Lucknow.If the trend remains the same for the next few days, the peak would indeed have been crossed, they said. “The falling trend (of the new Covid-19 cases), hopefully, will bring new daily cases below 1,000 next month. That will be a clear indication of the present Covid-19 wave having ebbed,” said Dr Surya Kant, HoD respiratory medicine, King George’s Medical University.“It took 20 days for Uttar Pradesh to reach a level of 18K new daily cases from 383 on January 1 and in the next seven days, the (new daily) cases are down below 9K, just half. The fall in new cases is significant, yet, keeping in mind the intensity of the virus spread this fall should not become a cause to lower the guard,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary-general, Association of International Doctors.“A majority deaths during the present wave are being reported among people who were admitted for some other ailment,” said Prof Surya Kant.According to statistics, a maximum of 18,554 new cases were reported on January 20 in the state and then a gradual fall was recorded for the next one week. A maximum of 22 deaths were reported on January 21. And since January 1 there have been 210 deaths reported which is at least 7 deaths a day, on an average.Amit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary, medical and health, said that the test positivity rate has also recorded a fall. The positivity rate was 7.78% on January 19 and now it is 4.98%. However, some districts, individually, have higher positivity rate, hence, there is a need to remain cautious against the spread of infection.UP reports 20 Covid deaths, tally up to 23,125Uttar Pradesh reported 20 new Covid-19 deaths on Thursday with six districts reporting two deaths each.Gorakhpur, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Varanasi, Moradabad, Hapur, Bijnor, reported two deaths each, according to data from the state health department. Auriya, Banda, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Hardoi, Gonda, Ballia reported a death each.With 8,901 new Covid-19 cases, the state’s total case load reached 19,89,095 while the death toll reached 23,125.“In all, 16,786 patients recovered in the last 24 hours. We are recording for the past few days that recovery is more than new daily Covid-19 cases,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary, medical and health, during a press conference.Lucknow too recorded a fall in new Covid-19 cases. “Over 900 male and over 500 females tested positive for Covid-19. In all, 2,777 patients recovered,” said Yogesh Raghuvanshi, the Lucknow district’s health education officer. Among the new cases in Lucknow, 527 tested positive during the contact-tracing.Only 1.5% of eligible in state yet to get vaxAbout 1.5% of the eligible people over 18 years of age are still to take their first dose of the anti-Covid-19 vaccine in Uttar Pradesh.UP has till now administered a total 25,48,92,031 doses of the anti-Covid-19 vaccine, including 15,44,33,589 first doses, 9,94,11,800 second doses and 10,46,642 precautionary doses.“In all, 98.58% of the eligible population above 18 years have taken their first dose of the anti-Covid-19 vaccine, which means very few or hardly 1.5% are remaining. I appeal to all eligible to take their vaccine doses,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary, medical and health, at a press conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/new-covid-cases-down-but-jan-saw-7-deaths-a-day-on-average-101643311019484.html
28-01-2022||Gurugram||At 5.5°C, Gurugram shivers on second lowest minimum temperature of the season||The city on Thursday recorded the minimum temperature at 5.5 degrees Celsius (°C) -- two degrees below normal -- which was the second lowest minimum temperature of the season, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Gurugram recorded the lowest minimum temperature of 4.8 degrees Celsius on December 22, 2021. The city, however, got a slight respite from the cold wave conditions on Thursday with a rise in daytime temperature owing to a sunny day. Gurugram recorded the maximum temperature at 18.1 degree Celsius, which was four degrees below normal.On Wednesday, the city recorded the minimum and maximum temperatures at 6 degrees Celsius and 16.2 degrees Celsius, respectively.The Meteorological Centre, Chandigarh -- a regional centre of India Meteorological Department (IMD) -- on Thursday issued a weather bulletin, stating that a “fresh feeble western disturbance is very likely to affect the western Himalayan region from Saturday”. “Under the influence of the fresh western disturbance, isolated pockets are likely to experience cold wave conditions, over the south Haryana region, during the next two to three days. ‘Cold day’ conditions in isolated pockets are likely during the next 24 hours, along with dense fog conditions during the night and morning hours. The minimum temperatures have been below normal in the past two days, but no significant changes are likely over the next 48 hours (two days), and the region will witness a clear sky during the day,” said Manmohan Singh, director of Meteorological Centre, Chandigarh. According to the IMD, a “cold day” is when the minimum temperature is less than 10 degrees Celsius and the maximum is at least 4.5 degrees Celsius below normal. A “severe cold day” is when the maximum temperature is at least 6.5 notches below normal.Meanwhile, Gurugram on Thursday recorded the air quality index at 228 in the “poor” category for the third consecutive day, according to the 4pm bulletin issued by the CPCB. According to the CPCB, an AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.According to the weather bulletin issued by the Air Quality Early Warning System (AQWS) for Delhi-NCR (national capital region), owing to moderate winds and better ventilation conditions, which are likely to prevail for the next seven days, the air quality is likely to remain largely in the “poor” to “moderate” category over the next few days.The wind speed will remain between six and 12 kilometres per hour (kmph) over the next three days, with the ventilation index -- a measure of air pollution based on the speed of the wind and the height of the column of air in which smoke or other pollutants mix -- is likely to be approximately 10,500 meters per second (m2/s) on Friday, and 8,200 m2/s on Saturday.According to experts, a ventilation index lower than 6,000 m2/s with an average wind speed less than 10 kmph is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/at-5-5-c-gurugram-shivers-on-second-lowest-minimum-temperature-of-the-season-101643310899623.html
28-01-2022||Chandigarh||Lapsed assistant registrar posts: Kashmir varsity goes ahead with recruitment process, aspirants cry foul||In a clear violation of its own recruitment rules, Kashmir University is going ahead with the hiring process for assistant registrar posts which had lapsed in October last year, eliciting allegations of nepotism by prospective aspirants. The university advertised seven positions of assistant registrar/assistant controller of examination on October 24, 2019, and as per the varsity statutes, the posts should have been filled within two years of the date or else re-advertised. Interestingly, when the posts were advertised in 2019, the varsity had asked those candidates who had already applied for the posts for different campuses way back in July 2015 to apply afresh. The university failed to fulfil the posts within stipulated time and invoked the emergency powers of the outgoing vice-chancellor to go ahead with the process, even though this was not under the purview of Section 13(4) of the Jammu and Kashmir Universities’ Act 1969 because of the non-exigency nature of the issue. “Why is university denying us the opportunity to apply for the posts when the recruitment process has legally lapsed? The only thing they should have done is not to ask for submitting fresh application fee from those who have already applied. But the posts had to be advertised afresh without fail,” said an aspirant of Srinagar. “We want the current process quashed and the posts re-advertised,” he added.The recruitment process involved three-tier criteria for the selection which included holding of preliminary examination, mains examination and personality test. While the varsity could conduct the preliminary examination in August 2021, it had scheduled the mains for January 6, 2022 which was postponed due to inclement weather.Sources in the university said that the entire process, including the final selection, as per the university’s own regulations, had to be completed by or before October 24, 2021 or else re-advertised in terms of subsection xiv of Section 17 of the regulations. They said the university administration got a special approval from the V-C for an “illegal extension” for validity of these posts which had already expired.They said that extending validity of these posts, which is essentially a domain and purview of the two top bodies - syndicate and university council, was neither reported to the syndicate which wasn’t held, nor the chancellor who heads the university council. Some candidates who had applied for the posts in 2019 alleged that less than 50% of candidates could appear in the preliminary examination because the varsity didn’t give enough publicity to the schedule of the exam and hastily conducted the preliminary examination.“I came to know about the conduct of prelims after the varsity issued the provisional list of candidates who qualified the exam. It appears there is a hidden hand trying to reduce the competition for the posts aimed at favouring some people,” said an aspirant of Old City, Srinagar. Sources in the university said that the varsity authorities also received several representations from the aggrieved candidates informing them about the lack of publicity to the exam schedule, but they were not considered. Kashmir University registrar Nisar Ahmad Mir, meanwhile, rejected allegations of any nepotism claiming that the whole process was transparent.He acknowledged that the process couldn’t be completed within two years and attributed it to government restrictions owing to Covid.“We had to conduct the entrance exam of 6,000 candidates. The government itself didn’t allow us because of the pandemic SOPs.That means it could not have been completed in two years. We have sought a six-month exemption from the competent authority because of the given circumstances,” he added.Mir said he was aware that some aspirants have also written to higher authorities about the issue of publicity and time which they have answered. “We gave wide publicity in newspapers and social media. Our publicity is handled by the government itself,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lapsed-assistant-registrar-posts-kashmir-varsity-goes-ahead-with-recruitment-process-aspirants-cry-foul-101643310781216.html

28-01-2022||Mumbai||BJP rules out alliance with MNS||After several rounds of discussion, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has said that there will be no alliance with the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) and the party will fight the local body polls with its smaller allies. The development comes as a setback for MNS chief Raj Thackeray who was keen to alter his image as a spoiler who cuts into the Shiv Sena’s Marathi votes. The BJP’s decision followed its core committee meeting on Tuesday. Party insiders said the BJP has decided to not join hands with the MNS fearing the backlash from north Indian voters in Mumbai and other parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The party is also wary about the reaction during the Uttar Pradesh elections. The indication came on Wednesday when state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said, “There is no proposal of the alliance with the MNS under consideration. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis plays a key role in taking the final call on such proposals.” Isolated in the state’s political space after the Sena, NCP and Congress came together to claim power following the 2019 Assembly elections, the BJP started considering the possibility of adding the MNS as its new partner. Patil had called on Thackeray at his residence a few months ago and discussed the possibility. Fadnavis too visited Thackeray’s new house at Shivaji Park. The MNS was looking forward to the alliance for various reasons. It saw an opportunity to grow in the state with the help of the largest party and also rub off its image of a ‘spoiler’ by dividing Marathi and Hindu votes. In fact, Thackeray started showing that he had changed his stand towards north Indian migrants whom his party had targeted for over a decade since he formed the MNS in 2006. He even adopted hardline Hindutva to create a separate identity of his party. “Most of the core committee leaders, including Ashish Shelar, Manoj Kotak and election in-charge of Mumbai Atul Bhatkhalkar, were against any official alliance. They see a direct impact on the north Indian voters who stand by the party in Mumbai and neighbouring cities. Secondly, the UP elections have been announced. Most of the north Indians living in Mumbai are from eastern UP. Many are also expected to return to their hometowns for voting. At this juncture, we cannot take any risk of disturbing them,” a BJP leader said on the condition of anonymity.A senior BJP leader, who did not want to be named, said there could be an indirect understanding between the two. “Instead of a formal alliance, we can have a tacit understanding by which we can dent the Sena, the prime enemy of both the parties. We know the MNS is in no position to have any major impact in Mumbai, but It would definitely help us reduce the Sena’s tally,” he said.An MNS leader said, “Rajsaaheb had even clarified to the BJP, during his meeting with Patil, that the MNS had dropped its ‘anti-north Indian’ stance long ago and had not undertaken any such protest in the last few years. The party leaders have not spoken anything against the Modi government.” Political analyst Hemant Desai said Thackeray and leaders from his party were keen on the alliance with the BJP as they think it will help them win a few seats. “Thackeray has not spoken on any key issues like farmers’ agitation, infiltration by Chinese forces as they were against the Modi government. In fact, he changed his party flag to establish his new political stance. He has not spoken against the north Indians and it might have been clarified by him during his meetings with Patil and Fadnavis. The BJP would not speak anything about the alliance with the MNS until the last phase of the UP elections was over. The cards will be opened after the results of the five states are announced,” he said. MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar said the party will soon clarify its stand on the issue. “Rajsaheb will speak on it. We have been used to fight the elections on our own and will continue to do so. We had made our stand on the north Indians clear during our meetings with them. After all the BJP too has to fight with the three parties.” Nandgaonkar said it was wrong to call the MNS a spoiler and they were not looking at the alliance to tweak that image. “The Sena has been cribbing about us over division of votes, but all the parties, including the Congress and the BJP, have taken our help in various elections. Like all other parties, even we have our own vote bank. We would have welcomed had the BJP decided to join hands.” 
28-01-2022||Mumbai||Ashok Chavan leaves cabinet meet after getting Covid-19 positive report||Mumbai Maharashtra minister Ashok Chavan left the state cabinet meeting, minutes after it commenced on Thursday, as his RT-PCR report came positive. Chavan, who heads the public works department, was present in the meeting at Mantralaya for around 10 minutes, those in the know said. Before that, he even attended a meeting of top state Congress leaders to discuss the party’s strategy for the civic polls. A senior Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi minister said the Congress minister had cough and cold and therefore had taken a rapid antigen test on Thursday afternoon, which was negative. The other swab was sent for the RT-PCR test.“He was present in the cabinet meeting when he was informed that his test was positive. He immediately left the meeting... Obviously, there was some unease among others who were present,” said a minister who did not wish to be named. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was chairing the meeting via videoconferencing.Chavan later tweeted about his Covid-19 test result and urged those who came in contact with him to be “careful”.The minister, who is said to have mild symptoms, is in home isolation for seven days. Chavan had recently participated in public events in his hometown Nanded. Following his test results, his visit to Goa was cancelled, where he was slated to campaign for the assembly election. Despite attempts, Chavan did not respond to calls from HT.This is the second time the former chief minister was infected by Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ashok-chavan-leaves-cabinet-meet-after-getting-covid-19-positive-report-101643310539453.html
28-01-2022||Lucknow||BJP may project RPN Singh as OBC face of party in east UP||Lucknow: Political equations on the seven assembly seats in Kushinagar district have changed with former union minister RPN Singh joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In the 2017 assembly election the BJP bagged five seats- Padrauna, Khadda, Fazilnagar,Kushinagar and Hatta while its ally the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) captured one seat- Ramkola and one seat- Tamkuhi Raj went to the Congress. Labour and employment minister, Swami Prasad Maurya who was contesting from Padrauna seat, led the charge of the BJP, mobilizing the other backward class (OBC) voters in the district. After Maurya switched to the Samajwadi Party (SP), it seemed that the BJP would face difficulty in repeating its performance in the district that has a large chunk of OBC voters. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav projected Maurya as a prominent OBC face of the party in the 2022 UP assembly elections. However, the BJP turned the tables on the Samajwadi Party by inducting RPN Singh who comes from the OBC- Sainthwar community that has a sizeable presence in eastern UP districts of Kushinagar, Gorakhpur, Deoria and Maharajganj. Even as the BJP, SP and BSP are yet to announce candidates on the seven seats in Kushinagar that will be going to poll in the sixth phase of the election on March 3, the churning among the political parties to win the support of the OBC voters has started. “To check the drift of the OBC voters to the SP after joining of Swami Prasad Maurya, the BJP might field RPN Singh or his family member from the Padrauna assembly seat. The party central leadership had held discussions with Singh as well as chief minister Yogi Adityanath over the strategy in Kushinagar district,” said a BJP leader. The leaders close to Singh are likely to be fielded on a few seats that have strong OBC presence, particularly Kurmi, Sainthwar and Kushwaha communities. Congress district unit president, Manish Jaiswal who was the party candidate from Padrauna seat has already resigned from the primary membership of the party. More backward community leaders were likely to join the BJP, he said. A scion of the Padrauna royal family, RPN Singh enjoys influence over dalit, upper caste and Muslim voters along with the OBC. To consolidate its hold over the OBC voters made in the 2017 assembly election, the BJP is likely to project Singh as an OBC face of the party in eastern UP region. “Although chief minister Yogi Adityanath has a considerable influence over the backward community in the region, the BJP does not have an OBC leader of RPN Singh’s stature in the area,” said Dharmesh Singh, a BJP leader. A three-term MLA from Padrauna assembly seat, Singh had also won from Kushinagar Lok Sabha seat in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls. He defeated Swami Prasad Maurya who contested on the BSP ticket. He lost the 2014 Lok Sabha election when Modi wave swept the state but still gave a tough fight to his BJP rival Rajesh Pandey. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Singh had polled 2.84 lakh votes and had stood third. His father CPN Singh had represented Padrauna twice (1980, 1984) in Lok Sabha. He was also a union minister of state in the Congress government in 1980. 
28-01-2022||Mumbai||BJP opposes move to rename Malvani garden after Tipu Sultan||Mumbai The BJP and right-wing outfits are opposing the renaming of a civic garden at Malvani after Tipu Sultan, the former ruler of Mysore. The proposal has been pushed by textile minister Aslam Shaikh (Congress). The Shiv Sena and the NCP pointed out that President Ram Nath Kovid had praised Tipu while the Congress said BJP corporators had earlier supported a proposal to rename a road after Tipu Sultan. Meanwhile, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said it has not received any proposal for renaming the garden.Members of the BJP and right-wing groups staged a protest on Wednesday as Shaikh inaugurated a sports facility at the garden. “For the last 15 years, the garden has been known after Tipu Sultan,” said Shaikh, adding that he was, however, unaware if it had been named formally. “Before independence, Sher-e-Mysore Tipu Sultan was the only ruler who laid down his life fighting the British,” claimed Shaikh, adding that for 70 years, roads and museums had been named after him in many states. He alleged that the BJP was targeting him and Shiv Sena minister Aaditya Thackeray as they had launched a slew of developmental works in Mumbai.While Thackeray told reporters that the BMC had not named the garden formally, Mayor Kishori Pednekar said the BJP is creating a controversy. She, however, said the facility should be named after ‘Jhansi chi Rani Laxmibai.’“These are just attempts to destabilise law and order situation in the city. Why have they been having problems since 2019? They did not have problem in 2012 when their MLA supported the naming in a similar situation?” asked Pednekar.Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis slammed the MVA government, saying it is a shameful act by its leaders for the sake of power. “The police lathi-charged BJP and Bajrang Dal workers who opposed the naming of the sports complex after Tipu Sultan who was responsible for the atrocities against Hindus,” he said.The slugfest continued even on Thursday. Congress leader Sachin Sawant accused the BJP of trying to polarise sentiments using historical figures. “The BJP’s opposition smacks of double standards. The BMC elections are here, and they have no roadmap for development except spreading communal sentiments…,” he said.Sawant said during a visit to Tipu’s dargah, then Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa praised his bravery. Accusing the BJP of double standards, Sawant said in 2013, BJP corporator Vitthal Kharatmol had proposed renaming a road in M-East ward of Mumbai as ‘Shahid Tipu Sultan Marg.’ In 2012, the standing committee hall of the Akola Municipal Corporation was named after ‘Shaheed Watan Shere Mysore Tipu Sultan’ and this resolution was proposed by former Mayor and incumbent BJP Akola city president Vijay Agrawal, he said.Meanwhile, replying to Shaikh’s claims that he had had seconded the proposal of naming a road after Tipu Sultan, BJP MLA Amit Satam warned the minister with a defamation notice. “The minister and the mayor said I seconded the proposal of naming a street after Tipu Sultan during my tenure as a corporator in the BMC. Infact, I never had supported any such proposal. Either they should prove the claim by producing documents or apologise for defaming me. In case they fail to do so, I will move a criminal defamation case against them,” Satam said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-opposes-move-to-rename-malvani-garden-after-tipu-sultan-101643310299218.html
28-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram: Underpass work on Dwarka Expressway in limbo after issues over land||After completing almost 70 percent underpass work on the Dwarka Expressway near Kherki Majra village, construction has come to a standstill.A local landowner has refused permission to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to construct approach roads to the underpass as he has not received the compensation for his land. The 29-kilometre Dwarka Expressway is being constructed in four phases, of which the first two phases are in Delhi and third and fourth phases in Gurugram. The ₹10,000-crore project will connect Kherki Daula and Mahipalpur in Delhi on the NH-48 and also provide access to the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport. Incidentally, the road is among the first in the country to have eight lanes on a single-pier flyover. A senior NHAI official said that after constructing the underpass, when they started making approach roads, the local villagers stopped the work and claimed the land was owned by one of them and he had not received compensation from the authorities. “A survey of the land was carried out by the contractor and it was revealed that around one and half acre land had not been acquired and it was owned by locals,” he said, on the condition of anonymity. Following this, the NHAI wrote a letter to the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) on January 10, stating that work is getting hindered due to intervention by local villagers and asked the authority to take steps for making the land available for constructing the underpass. “It is requested to take necessary steps for providing possession of aforesaid land so that the NHAI contractor can take up development work of the underpass,” said the letter written by manager (technical) of the NHAI. Meanwhile, Sandeep Dahiya, who owns the land in question, said that the authorities have not paid him compensation despite a clear order by the Punjab and Haryana high court in his favour. “We have allowed the work to happen till date in public interest but if the compensation is not paid even now, why should we allow the work to happen. Once the project is over, who will pay us ₹3 crore plus interest, which is the total value of this land,” he said. Prakhar Sahai, a local activist, said that the delay in paying compensation for land will also delay the completion of the highway project. “This underpass will provide connectivity to residents of Sector 101, 102, 104 and 10A. Already, the project is delayed and the state authorities must act quickly,” he said. The HSVP officials said that the matter was under consideration and will be resolved soon. “A proposal for purchase of the land for constructing the approach roads on both sides of the Dwarka Expressway has been sent to the headquarters in Chandigarh. The land will be acquired soon and handed over for the construction of the underpass,” said Vikas Dhanda, HSVP estate officer. 
28-01-2022||Chandigarh||Traffic partially restored on Jammu-Srinagar highway||Traffic movement on 278km-long Jammu-Srinagar national highway was partially restored around 4.30pm on Thursday following a landslide at Panthial in Ramban district, said officials. SSP (traffic, national highway) Shabir Malik said, “At 11am, a big slide blocked the highway at Panthial in Ramban. However, NHAI immediately pressed into service its men and machinery and by 4.30pm, we were able to partially restore the affected stretch.” “For now, we are allowing one-way traffic, but we expect to restore the stretch in another two hours,” he added. The SSP informed that around 400 light motor vehicles were left stranded following the landslide. Chief secretary AK Mehta on Monday had reviewed the progress of works at the Panthial Tunnel and directed the NHAI to double its efforts to complete the pending works by April 15. He said on completion, the tunnel will provide reliable connectivity bypassing the current landslide-prone stretch of NH-44. Mehta also stressed on wearing of body cameras by traffic police personnel.

BRO restores Solang-Keylong stretch on Manali-Leh highway for four-wheel driveThe Border Roads Organisation restored the Solang-Keylong stretch through Atal Tunnel, Rohtang, on the National Highway 003 (Manali-Leh) for one-way traffic on Thursday for four-wheel drive. This is for the information of general public that the NH-003 which was blocked due to heavy snowfall earlier this week has been restored for one-way traffic, Lahaul-Spiti superintendent of police (SP) Manav Verma said. However, the road conditions are still not suitable for vehicular movement and avalanche threats also loom large. So, only four-wheel-drive vehicles with chains are allowed to ply on the stretch, he added. It is worth mentioning that more than 365 roads are still blocked for traffic across the state. Maximum 144 roads are closed in the Lahaul-Spiti district alone. Besides the Manali-Leh highway from Darcha to Sarchu, NH-505 is also closed for traffic from Gramphu to Losar.

28-01-2022||Mumbai||Maharashtra to allow sale of wine in supermarkets, stores||Mumbai: In a move aimed at giving a boost to the wine industry, the state cabinet on Thursday cleared a proposal to sell wine in supermarkets and walk-in stores across Maharashtra at a flat annual licensing fee of ₹ 5,000. This move will ensure a more accessible marketing channel for Indian wineries even as the two-decade-long tax holiday for wine produced in Maharashtra ended on December 31, 2021. The decision will also ensure a level playing field for supermarkets and walk-in stores across the state, when it comes to licensing fees to stock wine for retail sale. At present, fees for beer shopee (currently available to supermarkets to stock wine and beer) depends on the slab that the city or town falls under, based on its population — and often exceeds the new amount decided upon. “We have many wineries in Maharashtra and to boost their business, the state government has decided to allow them to sell wine at supermarkets having an area of 1,000 square feet… No permission will be given to any shop smaller than 1,000 square feet. The decision will also help the farmers get better prices for their produce and was taken considering their interest,” said Nawab Malik, minister for skill development and minority affairs. Of the close to 110 wineries in India, Maharashtra has 72 wineries, of which around 40 to 45 are operational. Of these, just around 15 to 20 units are into direct marketing, while the rest are involved in contract manufacturing. The cabinet’s decision will apply to establishments which have an area of at least 100 square metres and are registered under the Maharashtra Shops and Establishments (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 2017. Supermarkets and walk-in stores will be allowed to retail wine in sealed bottles for “off-consumption” as per the “shelf in shop” concept — a separate lockable shelf of 2.25 cubic metre will have to be installed for wine to ensure that it is not retailed with other products. Though some supermarkets stock wine, they have to seek a beer shopee license which allows them to retail both wine and beer, but carries steep and varied license fees. Wine bars, which already sell wine for consumption, but only in their premises (using what is called the E-2 license) will also be allowed to sell wine in sealed bottles for off consumption. There are around 40 such establishments in the state. The department is also considering allowing shops to retail only wine— at present, only wineries can launch an outlet to sell wine. “Despite excise duty holidays and concessions, the sale of wine has not picked up in Maharashtra. One reason for this is the lack of exposure to consumers,” said a senior state government official. He added the state excise department would soon clear more measures to enhance retail availability of wine by opening up alternate channels. There are around 1,685 wine shops in the state. The wine industry has a turnover of around ₹1,000 crore in India, of which 65% in Maharashtra. Most wineries are located in Nashik, which produces around 80% of India’s wine, and is referred to as the wine and grape capital of India, followed by Sangli, Pune, Solapur, Buldhana and Ahmednagar. India sees around 4 million cases of domestically produced and imported wine (one case includes 12 bottles of 750 ml each) being consumed. Maharashtra’s share hovers around 40%. However, India lags in wine consumption with per capita consumption estimated at a miniscule 10ml compared to 4 liters in China. “A growth in wine sales will boost the backward linkages and strengthen the value chain. The industry will grow and the rural economy will get a boost… this will benefit not just wine grape cultivators, but the horticulture sector, as other fruits (like bananas and flowers) are also used to produce wine,” said Jagdish Holkar, President, All India Wine Producers Association (AIWPA). Maharashtra is said to have the right soil, topography, mineral content, weather and water for growing grapes. One of the leading producers of table grapes, Maharashtra grows wine grapes on just 5,000-acre land, compared to 2.5 to 3 lakh acre for table grapes. Internationally, most grape cultivation takes place for wine production. On an average, one kg of grapes can be used to produce around 600 ml wine. Former chief minister and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis called this move an attempt by the government to make Maharashtra into a “Madyarashtra” (liquor capital).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-allow-sale-of-wine-in-supermarkets-stores-101643310179297.html
28-01-2022||Lucknow||Previous UP govts worked for a particular section, sheltered goondas: Amit Shah||GREATER NOIDA Wooing Dalit voters, union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday started a door-to-door campaign from a Dalit’s house in Greater Noida’s Tugalpur village in Dadri constituency.Shah, along with Dadri candidate Tejpal Nagar, visited at least four houses and a few shops in Tugalpur’s bylane, where Dalit voters are in large numbers. His visit to this Dalit area is crucial because Dadri is the home turf of former UP chief minister Mayawati, who belongs to Badalpur village in this constituency that has been a stronghold of the Bahujan Samaj party. However in 2017, BJP candidate Tejpal Nagar had defeated the BSP candidate here. The BJP is leaving no stone unturned to win this seat again.“Our government in Uttar Pradesh has brought about a change in the last five years for every section of society and is seeking vote for the betterment of the society,” said the home minister while addressing a ‘Prabhaavi Matdaata Samwad’ (Effective Voter Dialogue) in Greater Noida’s Sharda University later. In his 35-minute speech, Shah criticised the previous governments of BSP and Samajwadi Party in UP.“This election is not only to elect an MLA or CM but for a constructive voting to support Yogi Adityanath’s good governance. This is the election to fight four misdeeds of previous governments – corruption, nepotism, appeasement of a particular section and mafiaraj that destroyed this state,” said Shah, who recalled BJP’s Kalyan Singh’s government in the state in 1991.He added, “Babuji Kalyan Singh of BJP was first to give a government of good governance and now it is Yogi government that has worked for all sections of the society, created jobs, set up industries, put mafias in jail, built infrastructure, hospitals, universities and expressways, to improve the image of this state.”Shah said that previous governments of ‘Bua-Bhatija’ worked for a particular section and sheltered the ‘goondas’.“Somebody told me that BJP is easily winning 2022 election because Akhilesh has two beacons- red and blue. Because he has these two beacons, BJP will continue to win the elections because red beacon means no permission for development and blue beacon means free passage to goonda raj. In 5 years, Yogi Adityanath government has put every goonda behind bars, be it Azam Khan, Ateeq Ahmed, Mukhtar Ansar or others,” said Shah.On the opposition’s reaction over income tax searches, he said:“I-T raids found truckload of black money and they started feeling pain in the stomach. Why? because they have a connection with that money.”

28-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram: 2 quacks arrested for illegal termination of pregnancies in Badshahpur||Police arrested two men from two areas in Badshahpur on Wednesday night for their alleged involvement in illegally terminating pregnancies by impersonating as doctors. A health department team led by Gurugram deputy civil surgeon, Dr Pardeep Kumar, trapped both the quacks by sending a woman as a decoy who told them she wished to get her pregnancy terminated. After payment, the decoy was handed over MTP kits or medicines used to terminate pregnancy at both places by the two ‘doctors’ without any qualification and prescription, as per FIR after which authorities raided them. The two persons were Sandeep Kumar (28) of Palra village and Khalid Hussain (29) of Sakatpur village, in Badshahpur. They had allegedly studied only till class 12.After finding them allegedly involved in illegal activities, the health department team informed police which arrested them.Sandeep was allegedly impersonating as a doctor for two months, while Khalid was doing the same for at least three years and giving medicines to women for terminating their pregnancies, as per FIR. Police said Sandeep ran Divya Medicose at Fazilpur while Khalid ran Muskan medical store on Sohna road, in Badshahpur. They said a health department team first raided Sandeep then Khalid. Separate FIRs were registered against them at Badshahpur police station on the basis of a written complaint of Dr Pardeep under Section 15 (2) of The Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, Sections 3, 4 and 5 of Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, Section 27 of Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Sections 120-B and 420 of Indian Penal Code. As per FIR, the health department team also found the duo to be running the medical stores allegedly on basis of licenses issued to someone else and in absence of pharmacists. In the first FIR, Rahul, Dinesh Kumar and Bhawna Dhingra were made co-accused with Sandeep. As per the FIR, Rahul was allegedly supplying MTP kits to Sandeep illegally which he used to prescribe to pregnant women, Dinesh was the former owner of shop while Bhawna was pharmacist on whose name drug store’s license was issued but was illegally being used by Sandeep. Besides Khalid, Mohammad Rafik was made co-accused in the second FIR as he was allegedly the registered pharmacist of the shop but was absent during the raid. Police said one MTP kit was seized from Sandeep and three from Khalid against which they failed to produce any bills. Both the shops were later sealed by Gurugram drugs control officer Mandeep Mann who had reached the spots after the raids for investigation. “One MTP kit of five tablets is available between a price range of ₹120 to ₹180 at a drug store. The duo was selling them for ₹600 to ₹800 to women willing to get their pregnancies terminated,” a senior official said. Dr Pardeep said that the decoy, used in trapping both quacks, was sent to them with prescriptions and ultrasound films of her foetus. “It’s a matter of investigation how many pregnancies the quacks got terminated in such a way,” he said. Gurugram chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav said there has to be a valid reason for pregnancy termination. “Only a registered practitioner can prescribe these medicines needed to be administered with caution as they have side-effects too. Such medicines can be sold or made available at hospitals or drug stores only on valid bills. They can’t be sold or prescribed in the manner the two quacks were doing,” Yadav said. Dinkar Yadav, station house officer of Badshahpur police station, said that a joint investigation was going on in both the cases. “Sandeep and Khalid may be released on bail from the police station as their offences attract imprisonment of less than seven years as per Supreme Court direction,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-2-quacks-arrested-for-illegal-termination-of-pregnancies-in-badshahpur-101643309880594.html
28-01-2022||Mumbai||Jolt to Congress as 28 corporators in Malegaon join NCP||Mumbai: In a major setback to the Congress, its almost entire elected corporators in the Malegaon Municipal Corporation defected to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Thursday. Led by Mayor Tahira Shakh, 27 of the 28 elected representatives and one nominated corporator joined the NCP in the presence of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and state NCP president Jayant Patil. The defection is likely to increase bitterness with Congress leaders threatening a “tit-for-tat”. The Congress is part of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government along with the Shiv Sena and the NCP. Ironically, the announcement was made by Pawar when top state Congress leaders were in a closed-door meeting with All India Congress Committee in-charge of Maharashtra, H K Patil, over the party’s prospects in the civic polls. Elections to several municipal corporations, including the Malegaon civic body, are expected to be held in the next few weeks. The development in Malegaon is significant for the Congress because it had emerged as the single largest party in this Muslim-dominated town in 2017 by winning 29 seats. As the election threw a fractured mandate, the Congress had won power with the help of the Sena and the BJP against the NCP and the AIMIM in the house of 84 members. Of the 29 corporators, one died two years ago. “We were planning a rally for induction of the corporators but it could not be held because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Ultimately it was decided to hold it at the party office. NCP chief Sharad Pawar never discriminated against people over religion, caste, creed or relations,” said Pawar after inducting the corporators and the mayor at the NCP headquarters at Ballard Pier.Congress candidate in last Assembly elections and former MLA from Malegaon Central constituency Asif Shaikh too resigned from the party in February last year. He also joined the NCP along with his father Shaikh Rashid Haji Shaikh, a former MLA and Congress district president.“The problem with the Congress is there is no respect for ordinary workers anywhere,” alleged Shaikh Rashid, who had breached the Janata Dal (Secular) stronghold in 1999 and 2004.The Rashid family held sway in the Congress locally and in the minority community in Malegaon and in parts of north Maharashtra. Rashid was a two-term MLA from the Malegaon constituency between 1999 and 2009. His son Asif Shaikh too won the seat in 2014 but in 2019 he lost the battle against AIMIM candidate Mufti Mohammad Ismail. Rashid’s wife Tahira is mayor of the Malegaon municipal corporation.For the mayoral polls, the party had joined hands with the Sena and Shaikh Rashid was elected mayor in the first half of the term while his wife Tahira won the mayoral polls later in December 2019 along with Sena’s Nilesh Aher as deputy mayor for the remaining term.Asif Shaikh was disappointed after his name was not considered for the state Congress committee formed after Nana Patole took reins of the Maharashtra unit. “The party was overlooking us. It failed to provide development funds for Malegaon city despite being in power. We are answerable to the people. Thus, first I decided to quit the party in February last year. Two months ago, my father (Shaikh Rashid) resigned from the post of district Congress chief but he is yet to receive any communication from party leaders. Despite being a senior leader, no one cared to ask him the reason for quitting the party position,” said Asif Shaikh.Congress reacts The defection was discussed between H.K. Patil and senior Congress leaders. Party insiders said revenue minister and Congress legislative party leader Balasaheb Thorat spoke to Sharad Pawar and conveyed their displeasure. “The party is upset at the NCP poaching Congress leaders. Before Malegaon, the NCP has weaned away Congress corporators in Bhiwandi. Though the defection of leaders does not mean a shift in the loyalties of party workers, this is not right (as the Congress and the NCP are in an alliance),” a Congress leader said. State Congress chief Nana Patole threatened a “tit for tat”. “They have taken a few from us but there are many from them (NCP) who want to join the Congress. Discontent is part of politics. So, we don’t take such matters seriously… Tit for tat is also part of politics. We are not saying what they (NCP) did is wrong but they also should not feel bad when we do the same to them,” he said.In response, the NCP said the Congress leaders had been unhappy for the last three months and were planning to join some other party. Thus, it decided to take them along. “Ahead of elections, leaders do shift from one party to another to ensure they get elected. Asif Shaikh had already joined the NCP three months ago. His father (Shaikh Rashid) had also been upset with the party (Congress) for the last three months and was also planning to join some other party. This is when we decided to induct him to the NCP. If the Congress or any party believes that NCP leaders want to join them then they are free to take them. We are not stopping anyone,” said Nawab Malik, chief spokesperson and cabinet minister.At present, Mufti Muhammed Ismail of the AIMIM is the MLA of Malegaon.BOXEnergy Minister Raut upset Energy minister Nitin Raut is said to have left a meeting of senior leaders that was chaired by party’s state in-charge H.K. Patil in Mumbai to discuss the performance of the Congress in the local body elections. Sources said Raut had not been invited to the meeting. However, later, it was denied by Patole and Raut. “The meeting was about the recent elections and forthcoming polls,” said Patole, adding that just Thorat, former chief ministers Ashok Chavan and Sushilkumar Shinde, and he (Patole) had been invited. Raut said he had an appointment with Patil at 10 am and their meeting went on till 10.30-10.45 am. “I am not upset with the party,” Raut said.

The matter came to light when the 42-year-old house owner, Manoj Deshmukh, returned home from his office late Tuesday night. His wife and son live in Rajasthan.Deshmukh works as a senior manager at the corporate headquarters of Airports Authority of India (AAI) in Delhi’s Safdarjung Airport.Based on Deshmukh’s complaint, a case was registered against the unidentified suspects under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 380 (theft) and 457 (house trespass) at the Bajghera police station on Wednesday evening.Deshmukh, who went to office on Monday and returned home late Tuesday night as he had some important work, said in his complaint that the thieves ransacked his house and stole 134-gram gold jewellery, a laptop, one LCD TV, and three watches -- total worth nearly ₹5 lakh from there.“I live in a duplex. From scratch marks, it seems that the thieves had attempted to break the lock on the main wooden door (ground floor), but failed. They supposedly climbed to the second floor‘s balcony and broke the lock on the door to gain access to the house. They broke open a steel almirah and other closets in both the floors and decamped with all the valuables,” Deshmukh said.He informed the police immediately after he reached home late Tuesday night.“I found a rope with knots lying on the terrace. The thieves likely used it to drop TV and other items from the terrace to an empty plot next to my house. According to my neighbours, they did not hear any sound or spot any suspicious movement...,” Deshmukh said, adding that CCTV cameras were not installed in the neighbourhood. “We have launched a search to nab the suspects and an investigation is underway,” said Aman Kumar, station house officer (SHO) of Bajghera police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/suspects-booked-for-breaking-into-gurugram-duplex-stealing-valuables-worth-5l-101643309459359.html

28-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram and Faridabad witness 2,584 mishaps in factories in five years: Survey||The two districts of Gurugram and Faridabad in Haryana witnessed 2,584 accidents in automotive factories in the past five years, revealed a report released by Safe In India (SII), a city-based NGO, on Wednesday.According to the report, most of the workers lost their fingers and in some cases their hands while working on machines like power press, shearing machines and others. Most of the affected workers were contractual workers with a minimum salary, it added.Gurugram witnessed 305 such accidents in 2022-21, 316 in 2022-20, 457 in 2020-19, 488 in 2019-18, and 544 in 2018-17, the report said. Faridabad recorded the remaining mishaps.The report, however, said that there has been a dip in the number of accidents in the past two years.  The SII report released on Wednesday stated that 92% of the injured workers are from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Orissa.The survey revealed that 70% of the workers were on a contractual basis, and had little or no legal documentation. Most of the injured are aged less than 30 years and have a salary of less ₹10,000, it said.According to the data, more than 60% of the workers lost their hands and a large number of them lost one to two fingers in such accidents. Another finding by the study said that the majority of the workers got their ESIC e-pehchan cards only after the accident, and not on the day of joining their jobs, as the ESIC regulations require. However, if these workers had the card, they could have availed the required medical facilities with its help.All the insured people whose Aadhaar numbers are linked to the IP numbers at the time of registration or subsequently are issued e-Pehchan cards by the employers, which can be used as permanent identity cards for availing medical benefits till the eligibility for medical benefit exists.  The report said that 93% of the injured workers in Gurugram have been working for original equipment manufacturers of top two companies. 22% percent accidents happened in large numbers of units, and this problem is not only an issue at small firms, it said.Sandeep Sachdeva, co-founder and CEO of SII Foundation, said, “All we need is the boards of the auto industry’s top 10 brands to think more about the workers who contribute immensely to their profits, and their productivity once a quarter. They should come together to form a joint action group with SIAM and ACMA.”The city-based trade union leaders, meanwhile, said that there was a need for the auto companies to realise that “this was a serious problem and it creates a support system for them”. “Most of these workers are contractual. There are several legal loopholes, which are used to deny compensation. Due to long legal processes, workers lose interest in getting justice,” said SL Prajapati, secretary of CITU, Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-and-faridabad-witness-2-584-mishaps-in-factories-in-five-years-survey-101643309279280.html

However, she mostly stayed at her parents’ home to take care of her ailing father and minor sibling. They were surviving on the income of the woman’s husband and her brother, who lives and works in south Delhi.According to the family, the teenaged boy from the neighbourhood wanted to be in a relationship with her and began stalking her.“My sister repeatedly told him that she was happily married, and did not want to have anything to do with him, but he kept stalking her. He also used to threaten her,” the woman’s sister said.On November 12, the teenager left home saying that he was going to kill himself, and ran towards the nearby railway tracks. His family members ran behind him to stop him. But before they could reach him, he was overrun by a train, police said quoting statements from the woman victim’s family members. Police said since the day the boy died, his family members have been abusing and threatening the woman.The woman’s father said, “My daughter stopped living with us and shifted to her in-laws’ home in north-east Delhi. However, the family members of the boy got hold of that address and began visiting there and threatening her her and her in-laws. Then, my daughter moved to Karkardooma about a month and a half ago. Except my family members, nobody knew her new address. The boy’s family members often threatened and pressured us to give them that address.”East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir tweeted on Thursday that he has talked to senior police officers and demanded swift action in the case, “Have spoken to DCP Shahdara over barbaric assault on the 20-year-old woman. Some arrests have been made & more will follow. I assure that these animals (men & women) will not be spared. Every kind of support will be provided to the survivor,” Gambhir tweeted.
28-01-2022||Delhi||Capital crime: Woman raped, paraded by neighbours in east Delhi||New Delhi: A 21-year-old woman was abducted by at least 11 members of a family in her neighbourhood -- including women and minor boys -- locked in a room where she was gang-raped in front of the women, who later chopped her hair off, blackened her face, put a garland of footwear around her neck, and paraded her in the lanes near their house on Wednesday, police said.Also Read | East Delhi gang-rape victim was living in fear since stalker died by suicide: FamilyIn an incident that has sent shock waves across the Capital, the accused filmed the whole gamut of demeaning and criminal acts on their cellphones. For nearly an hour, barely 50 metres from the local police booth in east Delhi’s Kasturba Nagar that was unmanned at that time, the woman was subjected to torture in full public view.The motive for the crime, police said, was personal enmity -- the family held the woman responsible for the death by suicide of one of their kin, a 16-year-old boy whose advances were rebuffed by the woman.As more than half-a-dozen video clips of the crime surfaced on social media, attracting criticism and anger from political leaders including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Delhi residents, the Shahdara district police registered a case under 12 different sections of Indian Penal Code. These include gang rape, abduction, molestation, physical assault, wrongful confinement and criminal conspiracy. Of the 11 accused, seven women were arrested and two minor boys, aged 15 and 17 were apprehended by the police till Thursday evening. Raids were on to nab two other men from the family who were also allegedly involved in the crime, police said“They are all family members and relatives of a 16-year-old boy who allegedly killed himself on railway tracks in east Delhi in November last year. The teenager was stalking the 21-year-old woman living in his neighbourhood, who is married and has a child. His family members blamed the woman for his death. They committed the crime to take revenge on her,” said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram, quoting the statements of the victim and the arrested women.The woman’s family said that they were receiving threats and abuses from the teenager’s family since his death.Things had reached an extent that the woman stopped visiting her parent‘s home, and also shifted to a rented home in Karkardooma with her husband and two-year-old child. Except her 17-year-old sister and her uncle, who is visually impaired, nobody else knew her new address.CM Kejriwal called the incident “shameful”, and urged the Union government to direct Delhi Police to take strict action against the culprits. “This is very shameful. How did the criminals get so much courage? I urge the Union home minister and the Lieutenant Governor (LG) to instruct the police to take strict action, pay attention to the law and order situation. Delhiites will not tolerate such heinous crime and criminals at any cost,” Kejriwal said on Twitter on Thursday.What happened on WednesdayThe woman’s 17-year-old sister, who is the prime witness in the case, said that around 11.30am, she left home to deliver some wheat at her sister’s house. As the girl reached there on an e-rickshaw, and called her sister out, 11 people who were following her in a car, an auto-rickshaw, and two-wheelers, rushed out. They had brought her uncle along, after threatening to kill him with if he did not tell them his niece’s new address, the girl said.“As my sister came out with her child, they overpowered her, and snatched her child. When I tried to stop them, they assaulted me and snatched my cellphone so I could not inform the police. I somehow took the child from them. They grabbed my sister, bundled her in the three-wheeler, and left. I followed them back to our neighbourhood, which is nearly 2km from the abduction spot. They took my sister inside their house locked themselves,” the girl added.Around half an hour later, the girl said, the abductors pulled the woman out with her hair chopped and face blackened. They paraded her in the nearby lanes for another half an hour after putting a garland of footwear around her neck. The girl said that she borrowed the mobile phone of a neighbour, and informed the police.Before that call, however, the woman’s husband had already informed the police about her abduction, after their landlord had called him frantically to tell him about what happened. The woman’s family members alleged that the police reached too late. However, police contended that their team got to the spot within four minutes of the first call.“After receiving the calls, our police team immediately reached there and rescued the woman. She was removed from the place. The suspects locked the house and fled. Four of them were caught in the evening while two were arrested on Thursday,” added DCP Sathiyasundaram.In one of the videos circulating on social media, the woman is seen pleading with folded hands while a woman is cutting her hair with a razor and scissors. In another video, she is seen standing among a crowd with her face blackened. She is taken inside the room and made to sit on a cot, while some women pose for shots with her. One woman is also seen holding a currency note and humiliating the victim.In a third video, a man and a boy are seen mercilessly assaulting the woman with objects which looks like sticks and a belt. It is alleged by the victim’s family that the two and another sexually assaulted and raped the woman in front of their women family members inside the room.HT is withholding the names of the arrested women since they live a few metres away from the victim’s parental home, and information about them could reveal her identity.Victim being counselledPolice said they have kept the survivor in a “safehouse” with trained counsellors who are helping her overcome the shock and trauma of the crime. Her statement before a magistrate was recorded on Thursday afternoon, the DCP said.Police said that a majority of the arrested and absconding suspects are involved in illegal sale of liquor, and have previously been booked in the past under the Excise Act. The husband of one arrested woman is registered as a “bad character” (habitual offender) with the local police station. The criminal history of the suspects was the reason nobody from the neighbourhood informed the police about the crime even as they witnessed the horrific scenes playing out in full public view, police said.Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) Swati Maliwal said the panel has issued a notice to the police. “A 20-year-old girl was gang-raped by illegal liquor sellers in Kasturba Nagar. Her head was tonsured and black paint put on her face and then she was paraded in the streets wearing a garland of slippers. I am issuing notice to Delhi Police. All the accused men and women should be arrested and the girl and her family should be given security,” Maliwal tweeted while sharing the video.Rajat Mitra, a clinical psychologist, said he has never heard such a horrific incident in his 25 years of work with police and other organisations. “I have heard it happening in remote villages and smaller towns. But it’s for the first time that it has happened in a city like Delhi. What is also very poignant and shocking is that nobody (in the neighbourhood) protested against it.”Terming it a signature crime, Mitra said that in the present case the sexual assault was not the main goal but shaming the woman and humiliating her was the main objective of the “perpetrators”.“That shaming and humiliation is what we call a signature crime. When perpetrators sexually assault a woman in order to humiliate her in public. The sense of a city where there is safety is slowly giving away to a kangaroo court culture,” he added.
28-01-2022||Delhi||Warmer day for Delhi as Capital finally gets some sunshine||Daytime was significantly more comfortable in Delhi on Thursday, with residents treated to a sunny day – a relative rarity for the city this January, which has seen the Capital shadowed by cloud cover and with maximum temperatures well below normal.The maximum temperature rose by two or three degrees in most parts of Delhi on Thursday, with “cold day” conditions largely abating in the region, the weather office said.The Safdarjung station, considered representative of Delhi’s weather, recorded a maximum temperature of 19.1°C on Thursday – three below the normal mark, but significantly higher than 16.4°C a day ago and a biting 12.1°C on Tuesday (which was the coldest January day for the city in nine years).Experts said the warmer day was down largely to impact of the sunshine, which was relatively unhindered by cloud- or fog-cover.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasts the maximum temperature to continue its rise and touch 21°C between Sunday and Monday. However, the minimum temperature could drop below 5°C by Saturday, it added.Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 6.3°C on Thursday – three degrees below normal, slightly warmer than 5.8°C on Wednesday.RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said a weak western disturbance is expected to influence the region from Friday, but unlikely to bring rain.“The maximum is beginning to rise again and the upper-level fog has started to dissipate. Cold day conditions have largely abated in the region, but at the same time, colder winds are now blowing from the snow-clad mountains, which will lead to the minimum dropping further,” said Jenamani.The IMD classifies it as a “cold day” if the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees or more below the normal mark, with the minimum also below the 10-degree mark. Only three spots in the city met this criteria on Thursday – Lodhi Road in New Delhi, Mungeshpur in north-west Delhi and Narela in north Delhi.Lodhi Road was Delhi’s coldest location with a maximum of 16.4°C – five degrees below normal mark.Forecasts for the week ahead also show Delhi is expected to record strong winds, ranging from 10-15 km/hr, with chances of only shallow fog formation in the early hours of the day. “Visibility will remain good during this period, with only some parts to see shallow fog in the early hours. Good winds will prevent fog formation,” a met official said.Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality remained in the ‘poor’ category, with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of 262 as per Central Pollution Control Board’s daily 4 pm bulletin. Agencies forecast the AQI to remain in a similar range in the next three days, as wind speeds remain high..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/warmer-day-for-delhi-as-capital-finally-gets-some-sunshine-101643308439824.html
28-01-2022||Chandigarh||Disconnect domestic sewer connection attached to CETP line, Ludhiana MC told||Acting on a complaint against illegal attachment of municipal corporation’s (MC) domestic sewer with the dedicated sewer line of the Focal Point Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) in Vishwakarma colony of ward number 23, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has issued a notice to the civic body directing the authorities to immediately disconnect the sewer line and take action against the defaulters.In a letter dated January 24, it has further been stated that action will be taken against the MC as per the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, if it fails to disconnect the connection in three days. Further, the MC has also been restrained from any such action in the future.Earlier on January 20, the dyeing industry representatives stated that the sewer connection was attached to the directions of area councillor Sandeep Kumari’s husband, Gaurav Bhatti, despite objections raised by the industry. The industry anticipated loss to the CETP machinery due to the inflow of domestic sewer waste.A Focal Point special purpose vehicle’s (SPV) director Rahul Verma said,” The 40 mld Focal Point CETP has been established at Tajpur road at a cost of around ₹96 crore. The sewer connection was attached on the directions of the councillor’s husband and the MC has failed to act on our complaint even after a week. The machinery worth crores installed at the plant can be damaged and the COD level in the treated water has already increased due to the inflow of sewer waste in the plant which is meant to treat industrial waste.”“ MC officials have assured that they will disconnect the connection by Friday, but if they failed, we will be forced to file an FIR in the case. The industry has been accused of polluting the nullah by dumping untreated waste, but now when we have established the plant to remove the blot, the MC has started dumping waste in the dedicated sewer line of CETP,” said Verma.Despite attempts to reach MC superintending engineer Rajinder Singh, he was not available for comments. Notably, the CETP established on Tajpur road had been in the pipeline since 2014 and was made operational in the first week of January. The plant has been established to stop the untreated waste of the dyeing industry from getting into the Buddha Nullah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/disconnect-domestic-sewer-connection-attached-to-cetp-line-ludhiana-mc-told-101643307179352.html

28-01-2022||Kolkata||Veteran singer Sandhya Mukherjee falls ill in Kolkata; rushed to hospital||KOLKATA: Legendary singer Sandhya Mukherjee, 90, who refused to accept the Padma Shri award on January 25, tested positive for Covid-19 at the state-run SSKM Hospital in Kolkata on Thursday afternoon, hours after she was rushed there with signs of lung infection and breathlessness. Doctors at SSKM hospital found that Mukherjee also has a serious heart problem that complicated her condition. Mukherjee suffered an injury on her waist a few days ago after a fall in her room, members of her family said. The veteran singer rarely interacted with outsiders but received many phone calls after the controversy over the Padma award. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who instructed the administration to take Mukherjee to SSKM Hospital through a green corridor around noon, said the government decided to shift her to Apollo Hospital in Kolkata. “Sandhya Di (elder sister) is in critical condition because of the heart problem. She also suffered an injury due to the fall. Since treatment for Covid-19 cannot be done at SSKM, we got in touch with Apollo Hospital and decided to shift her. She could have been taken to any of the other state hospitals in Kolkata. Her daughter was also ready for that but we decided to opt for Apollo,” the chief minister said after visiting Mukherjee.“Let’s all pray for her recovery. She is a national asset,” the chief minister added.Members of Mukherjee’s family said in the morning that she was running fever since Wednesday night and had signs of congestion.“She was feeling drowsy and had a breathing problem. Our family physician advised that she should be hospitalised,” a member of the family, who did not want to be named, said. Former West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Sandhya Mukherjee and tabla maestro Anindya Chatterjee refused the Padma awards offered by the central government on the eve of Republic Day.The focus of most people was on the Centre’s decision to confer the Padma Shri award on 90-year-old singer whose illustrious career spans over 70 years. Sandhya Mukherjee, a student of Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, has sung thousands of songs for Indian cinema and her albums of modern, classical and semi-classical music. She received the national award in 1970 for play-back singing. Mukherjee’s relatives told the media that she expressed her refusal when a central government official called her up on Tuesday afternoon. She said accepting the Padma Shri, the lowest in the rank of the civilian awards, would be demeaning for her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/veteran-singer-sandhya-mukherjee-falls-ill-in-kolkata-rushed-to-hospital-101643282275279.html

Pictures posted by the first lady on Twitter showed the gray-and-white-striped pet prowling in the red-carpeted splendor of the presidential residence.It was the kind of soft, even cuddly Friday news the White House might need in these days of tension with Russia, soaring inflation and a stubborn, if receding, Covid-19 pandemic."We're waiting for a bad news day," Press Secretary Jen Psaki joked back in June about going through with the long-expected cat plan. "If you see a tail wagging coming out of the briefing room, you'll know something bad is about to happen."Willow brings serious political chops: she's a farm cat from Pennsylvania -- ground zero in tight presidential elections -- and was first encountered in 2020 when she jumped onto a stage where the future first lady was campaigning."Willow made quite an impression on Dr Biden," Michael LaRosa, the first lady's press secretary, said."Seeing their immediate bond, the owner of the farm knew that Willow belonged with Dr Biden."LaRosa said, "Willow is settling into the White House with her favorite toys, treats, and plenty of room to smell and explore."There was no answer to questions on Willow's ability to bridge the bipartisan divide with dogs, but Washington probably won't have to wait long to find out: the Bidens got a new German Shepherd puppy, Commander, just before Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meet-willow-bidens-welcome-first-family-cat-to-white-house-101643380126259.html
28-01-2022||World||UN rights chief welcome to visit Xinjiang, only for cooperation: China||China on Friday said it welcomes a visit by the UN’s top rights official to Xinjiang but only for exchange and cooperation and not for “political manipulation”, essentially ruling out any probe by the global body to investigate allegations of human rights abuse against Muslim minorities.China has been accused of running massive internment camps where more than a million people from Muslim minority groups, majority of them Uighurs, have been held in mass detention.Beijing denies the allegations, saying the camps are for vocational training and deradicalisation.Responding to questions about a possible visit by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, to Xinjiang, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said an invitation had been issued long ago and was being discussed.“China welcomes UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Madame Michelle Bachelet to visit China and take a trip to Xinjiang. The invitation was extended a long time ago. Since then, the two sides have maintained communication over this,” Zhao said on Friday.“China’s position is consistent and clear. The purpose of the visit is to promote exchange and cooperation. We oppose any attempt to exploit this matter for political manipulation,” he added.To a related question, Zhao said: “I can assure you that Xinjiang enjoys stability and prosperity and residents there lead happy and fulfilling lives with their human rights fully protected.”“We firmly oppose acts that use issues relating to Xinjiang to attack and smear China in disregard of the fact that the region enjoys stability, development, prosperity and constant progress in its human rights cause,” the spokesperson added.The Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post had reported on Friday that approval for Bachelet’s visit was given only after the end of the Beijing Winter Olympics - to be held between February 4 and 20 - and on condition that it should be “friendly” and not framed as an investigation.Beijing also insisted that Bachelet’s office hold off on publishing a report on Xinjiang ahead of the Games, as requested by Washington, anonymous sources told the newspaper.The report is expected to be the UN’s first comprehensive ruling on the allegations of systematic abuse of rights, which western governments, including the US have called genocide.In December, a UN spokesperson said the human rights office was finalising its assessment of the situation in China’s Xinjiang, adding that Bachelet hoped to publish its report in the coming weeks and that there had been “no concrete progress” in long-running talks with Chinese officials on a proposed visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-rights-chief-welcome-to-visit-xinjiang-only-for-cooperation-china-101643377804087.html
28-01-2022||World||China to help Pakistan build space centre, satellites||China will prioritise constructing a space centre and develop communication satellites for ally Pakistan over the next five years, according to a white paper on space published by the Chinese government on Friday.While China and Pakistan have an agreement on space exploration, it’s the first time that China has formally announced that it would help Islamabad to build a space centre, the Pakistan Space Centre, which is likely to build satellites.The strategic allies have close economic and military ties with China recently supplying Pakistan with new warships.The policy paper outlined China’s plans in space for the period 2021-25, which included strengthening its governance and protecting “its space activities, assets and other interests” and to study plans to build “a near-earth object defence system, and increase the capacity of near-earth object monitoring”.The white paper, titled “China’s Space Program: A 2021 Perspective”, was released by China’s State Council Information Office.Under “international cooperation”, the paper highlighted its plans to help Pakistan in developing its space programme. “It (China) will give priority to developing communications satellites for Pakistan and to cooperating on the construction of the Pakistan Space Centre and Egypt’s Space City,” the policy paper said.It did not share further details involving the space centre.Pakistan announced in 2018 that it had plans to establish the Pakistan Space Centre (PSC) to lead the domestic development and manufacturing of satellites, according to a report by the state-owned Associated Press of Pakistan.The PSC will have capability to carry out manufacturing, testing, system level assembly, integration, launch and operations of various types of satellites, the APP report was quoted as saying.The Chinese policy paper mentioned that China has completed “in-orbit delivery of the Pakistan Remote-Sensing Satellite (PRSS-1)” besides delivering satellites for Venezuela, Sudan and Algeria in the last five years.The PRSS 1 spacecraft was built in China by DFH Satellite Company, a subsidiary of the China Academy of Space Technology, for Pakistan’s national space agency, SUPARCO or Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission.The white paper added that China is also conducting satellite navigation cooperation with countries such as Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, South Africa, Algeria, and Thailand.In 2019, China and Pakistan had signed an agreement on space exploration during the visit of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan to China for the 2nd Belt and Road Forum (BRF).Available reports on the Space City in Egypt say it is for making satellites and space research.As part of China’s ambitious space programme, its under-construction space station, Tianhe, is expected to become operational in 2022.Since 2003, China has launched six crewed missions and sent 11 astronauts into space.In recent months, China has returned rock and soil samples to earth from the surface of the moon and landed a six-wheeled robot on Mars; it also landed a craft on the far side of the moon in 2019.Once built, China’s space station will be the only alternative to the two-decade-old, US-led International Space Station (ISS), which may be retired in 2024, Reuters had said in an earlier report.The ISS - from which China is excluded - comprises Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, the US, and 11 member states of the European Space Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-help-pakistan-build-space-centre-satellites-101643376783649.html
28-01-2022||World||Russia says it wants peace but has 'gun on the table': US envoy||Russia says it does not want war but has placed a "gun on the table" in its negotiations with the United States by massing troops on Ukraine's borders, U.S. Ambassador to Moscow John Sullivan said on Friday.In an online briefing from Moscow, Sullivan described the buildup of tens of thousands of Russian troops as "extraordinary" and said it could not be explained as an ordinary military exercise or exercises."It's the equivalent of if you and I were having a discussion or a negotiation. If I put a gun on the table and say that I come in peace, that's threatening," Sullivan told reporters. "And that's what we see now.""We hope that the Russian government is true to its word, and does not plan to, and will not, further invade Ukraine. But the facts suggest that it has the present ability to do that," he said.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Russian radio stations earlier on Friday that Moscow was not seeking war.Sullivan said Washington was now waiting for Russia's response to written documents by the United States and NATO sketching a diplomatic path out of the Ukraine crisis, and urged Russia to withdraw troops from near Ukraine's borders.He said those documents contained ways to calm the crisis with proposals for greater transparency around military drills in Europe, as well as on Ukrainian arms sales."We've addressed the possibility of reciprocal transparency measures with the Russian government, including on offensive weapons systems in Ukraine, as well as measures to increase confidence regarding military exercises and manoeuvres in Europe," Sullivan said.He said he hoped phone conversations or a physical meeting between American and Russian diplomats could then follow, reiterating that diplomacy was the only way forward.Sullivan also said economic sanctions on Russia after an invasion of Ukraine would be just one part of the West's response.Other measures would include export controls and greater defence of allies in Europe, and the United States would also prevent the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany from operating, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-it-wants-peace-but-has-gun-on-the-table-us-envoy-101643372537791.html

In some of the worst-hit areas, people had to wait for days on rooftops of flooded houses before finally being rescued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysian-floods-caused-1-4-billion-in-losses-government-101643371333965.html

WHO is aware of the new finding of Wuhan scientists and is in touch with the World Organization for Animal Health, the Food and Agriculture Organization to respond to this."Animals, particularly wild animals are the source of more than 75% of all emerging infectious diseases in humans, many of which are caused by novel viruses. Coronaviruses are often found in animals, including in bats which have been identified as a natural reservoir of many of these viruses," WHO said.The World Health Organization has said that whether NeoCov coronavirus, reportedly found among bats in South Africa, poses a threat to humans requires further study.

They claimed that this virus has a high death and transmission rate. It is not SARS-CoV-2 but associated with the MERS Coronavirus which could kill 1 in 3 infected people.What is MERS-Coronavirus?MERS Coronavirus is Middles East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. It is a zoonotic virus which means that it is transmitted between animals and people.It was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. According to WHO data, approximately 35% of reported patients with MERS-CoV have died. Typical MERS symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia, gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, are also reported as symptoms, but not very common. Most of the human cases of MERS-CoV infections spread through human to human infections.Florona, Deltacron, Omicron BA.2, NeoCov: ExplainedIn the recent few days, words like Florona, Deltacron have become a part of the Covid terminology, as scientists are engaged in tracking newer variants of SARS-CoV-2. However, Florona and Deltacron are not real variants. While Florona is a combination of flu and coronavirus, Deltacron, a combination of Delta and Omicron, never existed and might be a result of contamination. Omicron BA.2 is a sub-strain of Omicron, the variant which is driving the present surge of the pandemic.Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron are the variants of concern as classified by the WHO.NeoCov is not SARS-CoV-2; it is a separate virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/neocov-what-who-says-on-this-new-coronavirus-variant-found-among-bats-in-wuhan-101643366536512.html
28-01-2022||World||Thailand adopts guidelines for declaring Covid-19 endemic||Thai health authorities approved new guidelines Friday outlining the parameters for declaring the coronavirus pandemic an endemic disease.Official figures show that the country already meets the three criteria, but Ministry of Public Health spokesman Rungrueng Kitphati said it would still be between six months and a year before the government would be able to make the decision to start treating Covid-19 as an illness that is here to stay, like the flu or measles.Among other things, he said data from all of Thailand's provinces need to be checked, and authorities need to be sure that the figures remain at the current levels or improve before it can be declared endemic.The guidelines drawn up by the ministry's National Communicable Disease Committee are made up of three criteria: that there are fewer than 10,000 new cases per day; that the fatality rate is no higher than 0.1% of those who are admitted to the hospital with an infection; and that more than 80% of at-risk people have had at least two vaccinations.Currently, Thailand's daily new cases range between 7,000-9,000, and the fatality rate, which was more than 3% in the beginning of the pandemic, has declined to 0.1%, and more than 80% of at-risk people have been fully vaccinated, Rungrueng said.Thailand joins other countries in preparing to consider the virus endemic, though the World Health Organization has said it's currently too early to consider any immediate shift.The organization does not have clearly defined criteria for declaring Covid-19 an endemic disease, but its experts have previously said it will happen when the virus is more predictable and there are no sustained outbreaks.Speaking last week at a World Economic Forum panel, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases doctor in the US, said Covid-19 could not be considered endemic until it drops to “a level that it doesn’t disrupt society.”Thailand reported 8,078 new cases and 22 deaths on Friday, for a total of 2.4 million confirmed cases and 22,098 deaths since the pandemic started in 2020.To date, it has administered 113.6 million doses of the vaccine and around 48.3 million people, or 70% of its population, are fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-adopts-guidelines-for-declaring-covid-19-endemic-101643365590549.html
28-01-2022||World||EU chief told to look for secret text messages to Pfizer CEO||An official EU watchdog on Friday slammed European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen for keeping secret text messages with Pfizer's CEO about purchasing Covid vaccine doses, saying it "constituted maladministration".The EU ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, issued a formal recommendation telling von der Leyen's office to search for and hand over the texts under a freedom of information request lodged by a journalist.Von der Leyen's Commission spearheaded the pre-purchase of Covid vaccines for the 27 EU countries.More than half the 4.2 billion doses the commission has bought or optioned are sourced from BioNTech-Pfizer, making it by far the biggest supplier to the bloc's inoculation efforts.The commission refuses to divulge key aspects of its contracts with Covid vaccine suppliers, notably on pricing, citing commercial confidentiality.Von der Leyen's active public role in ensuring vaccine access included one-on-one conversations with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, a dual Greek-American.Her commission rebuffed a freedom-of-information request last year for the text messages, refusing to say whether the texts existed -- even though von der Leyen had referred to them herself in a media interview.It argued to the ombudsman's service that it was only obligated to hand over archived documents and that text messages or other forms of instant messages did not qualify, being "short-lived" and unlikely to "contain in principle important information" on its policies, activities or decisions.The ombudsman strongly disagreed, saying in her recommendation "it is clear that text messages fall within the scope of the EU's law on public access to documents" and that EU case-law upholds the duty by EU institutions to retain documentation related to its activities."The case concerns whether, if the messages concern the commission's work and if it holds them, the commission should have granted public access to them. How the commission dealt with this matter did not allow those questions to be answered. The ombudsman considers that this constituted maladministration," it said.The ombudsman said the commission should ask von der Leyen's office to again look for the texts, and if it found them, "the Commission should assess whether public access can be granted to them" in line with EU rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-chief-told-to-look-for-secret-text-messages-to-pfizer-ceo-101643361803123.html

Beijing continues to deny all allegations of abuse.Since September 2018, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet was in talks with Chinese authorities over a possible visit to the province in the northwest part of China.In June last year, the UN rights chief had expressed hope to agree on terms for Xinjiang visit to look into reports of rights abuse against Uyghurs.Media reports said the approval for a UN visit has been granted, for a period, after the conclusion of the Beijing Winter Games. However, reports also add that Bejing has placed a condition that the trip should not be framed as a probe.Addressing the 47th session of the Human Rights Council, Bachelet in June 2021 had said that the United Nations is discussing with China modalities for a visit to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.Along with a visit, Bachelet had said she will also seek "meaningful access" to the province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-allows-un-rights-chief-to-visit-xinjiang-after-winter-olympics-conclude-101643359649129.html
28-01-2022||World||NeoCov: Wuhan scientists warn of deadlier Covid variant. All you need to know||Even as the fast-spreading Omicron strain started waning in parts of the world, another variant of the coronavirus disease – NeoCov – is creating a buzz after scientists from Wuhan in China, where the Covid-19 pandemic originated, flagged concerns that it may have much higher rate of transmission compared to previous strains and could potentially be the deadliest of them all.According to a research paper submitted by scientists in Wuhan, NeoCov is related to the Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS-coronavirus. The paper was published on the bioRxiv website and is yet to be peer reviewed.Discovered in a bat population in South Africa, the virus was known to be spreading only among animals. However, it has now been found that NeoCoV and PDF-2180-CoV use some types of angiotensin-converting enzyme, including bat ACE2 and human ACE2 for entry.Although not a new variant, the MERS-CoV virus is similar to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of symptoms like fever, cough and shortness of breath and was prevalent in the middle-eastern countries in 2012 and 2015. Many people died due to the infection.Also Read | China quietly locks down area near Beijing week ahead of Winter OlympicsBased on the findings, the research said MERS-CoV belongs to the lineage C of Beta-CoV (Merbecoviruses), which poses a great threat considering its high case-fatality rate of approximately 35 per cent.“Our study demonstrates the first case of ACE2 usage in MERS-related viruses, shedding light on a potential bio-safety threat of the human emergence of an ACE2 using “MERS-CoV-2” with both high fatality and transmission rate,” the scientists wrote in the study.“Immunity triggered by prior infection or vaccination of other coronaviruses might be inadequate to protect humans from NeoCoV and PDF-2180-CoV infections because neither SARS-CoV-2 anti-sera nor ten tested anti-MERS-CoV nanobodies can cross-inhibit the infection caused by these two viruses,” the researchers stated.In the Middle East respiratory syndrome, the virus was transferred to humans from infected dromedary camels. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the origins of the virus are not fully understood but based on genome analysis of the virus, it is believed to have originated in bats and later transmitted to camels at some point in the distant past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/neocov-wuhan-scientists-warn-of-deadlier-covid-variant-all-you-need-to-know-101643354985208.html
28-01-2022||World||Canada border deaths: 4 Indian victims were from Gujarat||Canadian law enforcement has formally identified the four Indian nationals who died from exposure to extreme cold near the United States border on January 19 in an apparent human smuggling operation gone wrong.Manitoba Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) has identified them as 39-year-old Jagdishkumar Baldevbhai Patel, his wife 37-year-old Vaishaliben Jagdishkumar Patel, their daughter 11-year-old Vihangi Jagdishkumar Patel, and son, three-year-old Dharmik Jagdishkumar Patel.All of them are from Gujarat. The autopsy conducted confirmed that “based on the circumstances, the death of all the persons have been determined to be consistent with exposure to the outdoor elements”.This information was conveyed to the Indian government on Thursday. Next of kin of the deceased have been informed and the consulate general of India in Toronto is in touch with the family of the deceased and is providing consular support, according to a release from India’s High Commission in Ottawa.Manitoba RCMP has also launched an investigation into how the family reached Canada and ultimately Emerson, a town near the border.In a statement, chief superintendent Rob Hill, Manitoba RCMP’s office in charge of criminal operations, said that the Patel family arrived in Toronto on January 12 and this was their first point of entry into Canada. From Toronto, the family made their way to Manitoba and eventually to Emerson on, or about, January 18.“There was no abandoned vehicle located on the Canadian side of the border - this clearly indicates that someone drove the family to the border and then left the scene,” he said.“With what we know so far of their activities in Canada, along with the arrest that occurred in the United States, we believe this to be a case of human smuggling,” he stressed.Manitoba RCMP is working closely with RCMP liaison officers stationed in New Delhi, India, and Washington, and are in regular contact with the US Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations.He apologised for the initial identification of one of the victims as a male teen and said the error was due to “the frozen state in which the bodies were found and the clothing worn by the family made the initial identification difficult”.The High Commission’s statement noted that on “longer term issues that this tragedy has brought into focus the need to ensure that migration and mobility are made safe and legal and that such tragedies do not recur”.A number of ideas are under discussion between India and Canada in this context, including India’s proposal of a comprehensive Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreement (MMPA) to Canada, so as to “prevent and suppress irregular migration, smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human being and to facilitate sustainable and circular mobility”. The matter remains under consideration with Canada.A special team from India’s consulate in Toronto is camping in Manitoba “to assist ongoing investigations by Canadian agencies and to render any consular services for the victims”, the statement added.The Office of the Medical Examiner is in possession of the deceased persons and will coordinate with Indian officials for the release of the bodies to their next of kin. Thereafter, arrangements will be made for transport of the remains back to India.The bodies of the four victims were found just about 10km from the American border and they may have succumbed due to a human smuggling operation gone wrong.Seven other Indian nationals, linked to the tragic quartet found dead on the Canadian side of the border, were apprehended in the United States. One person, a 47-year-old resident of Florida Steve Shand was arrested by US authorities (though later released on bail) for allegedly “smuggling undocumented foreign nationals”.Last Wednesday morning, Manitoba RCMP received “concerning information” from their counterparts that the US Customs and Border Protection (USCBP) had apprehended a group of individuals who had crossed into the US from Canada, near the town of Emerson in Manitoba.A search began and four hours later, at about 1.30pm, RCMP officers found the bodies of three individuals were located on the Canadian side of the border, close to Emerson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-border-deaths-4-indian-victims-were-from-gujarat-101643349722521.html
28-01-2022||World||China quietly locks down area near Beijing week ahead of Winter Olympics||Chinese authorities locked down an area neighbouring the capital city of Beijing this week following a handful of reported Covid cases, but made no public announcements about the fresh restrictions with just a week until the Winter Olympics.Around 1.2 million people in Xiong'an New Area -- a new economic zone 100 kilometres southwest of Beijing -- are no longer allowed to enter or leave their residential compounds, local virus prevention staff confirmed to AFP on Friday.While recent lockdowns in China are publicly announced and widely reported by state media, the Xiong'an restrictions appear to have been introduced by stealth with no public announcements -- sparking confusion among some residents of the area."We expect this (lockdown) to last around a week, but the exact timing is uncertain," said virus prevention staff in Xiong County, one of three counties in the area.The restrictions kicked in on Tuesday, they added -- the same day authorities in another district noted five confirmed coronavirus infections had been discovered to date.With the Winter Olympics beginning next week, Chinese authorities have scrambled to eradicate flare-ups in several major cities, including Beijing.Cities such as Xi'an and Anyang have experienced hard lockdowns in recent weeks, with residents confined to their homes until multiple rounds of mass testing are completed and the outbreak suppressed.Some users on China's Twitter-like Weibo were seen asking for further information about restrictions, while others questioned the extent of measures."Is there a need? Why can't we go home if the area is deemed low-risk? Don't make this one-size-fits-all," said a Weibo user this week.Another said Thursday: "I don't think I'll be able to go home for the Lunar New Year."While there have been a number of national-level "New Areas" across China, Xiong'an stands out with its location personally designated by President Xi Jinping, according to state media.China, where the coronavirus first emerged, has upheld a strict "zero-Covid" strategy involving targeted lockdowns, tight border controls and mass testing.Its case numbers are tiny in comparison to the rest of the world.A month-long lockdown on the megacity of Xi'an was lifted earlier this week after a cluster that grew to more than 2,100 cases -- China's largest outbreak in months -- was largely stamped out.But stubborn flare-ups have persisted, including in Beijing and the nearby port city of Tianjin.China reported 39 domestic Covid cases on Friday.The Winter Olympics will be held in a strict "closed loop" bubble that separates everyone involved in the Games from the wider Chinese population in a bid to reduce the risk of infections leaking out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-quietly-locks-down-area-near-beijing-week-ahead-of-winter-olympics-101643346507982.html

The norms applicable to passengers flying from India to Canada will be those implemented overall.|#+|Given restrictions due to the Omicron variant of Covid-19, a negative RT-PCR test result prior to boarding will still be necessary but this can now be obtained from an Indian Council of Medical Research-recognised lab.Entry into Canada is restricted to fully vaccinated passengers though both vaccines used in India, Covishield and Covaxin, are now recognised in Canada for travel purposes.Passengers from India will also not be required a get a negative test result from a third country prior to leaving for Canada if they are taking a connecting flight.Passengers arriving in Canada may also be subject to random Covid-19 testing.The travel advisory for India earlier limited pre-departure testing to a single laboratory of the company Genestrings located at Delhi airport. Travellers had to provide a negative test result before they are allowed boarding for any Canadian destination, making the process problematic to those connecting via Delhi as getting the test taken and results received consumed up to eight or nine hours. That test had to be done within 18 hours of scheduled departure.The previous norms also read: “Passengers who travel from India to Canada via an indirect route still need to provide a pre-departure negative Covid-19 molecular test result from a third country before continuing their journey to Canada.”However, Canada still has in place a warning against any non-essential travel abroad due to concerns over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. That, though, is relevant to those departing Canada rather than incoming passengers.The testing norms specific to India were introduced in September when Canada lifted its ban on direct flights between the two countries, which was imposed in April last year amid concerns over the Delta-driven wave in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-removes-india-specific-covid-19-testing-rules-for-travellers-101643347022405.html
28-01-2022||World||Ukraine: Will tensions with Russia dilute the US focus on Indo-Pacific, China?||With the United States (US) focused on the crisis with Russia over Ukraine, and diplomatic talks with Moscow yielding no breakthrough, there is a debate in the wider American strategic community about the possible impact of a conflict in the European theatre on the US role in Indo-Pacific region.Three questions, in particular, have animated both officials and experts. Is the Joe Biden administration’s focus on Russia at a time when China is the real strategic challenge of the present and the future smart? Will the US policy focus on Russia lead to a diversion in geopolitical attention and material resources from Indo-Pacific to Europe, or can Washington multi-task? And what does this mean for other countries in Asia, including India?Battling Russia or China - or Russia and ChinaWhile there is a broad bipartisan consensus in the US Congress against Russia’s actions in Ukraine, Congressman Ro Khanna, a member of the House of Representatives from California, recently said that the US’s interest was in “long-term de-escalation in the region especially with the rise of China”. He supported the threat of US sanctions against Russia, but warned against a conflict. “With the rise of China and the economic and military threat of invading Taiwan, the US cannot afford to embroiled in a draining war and conflict in Ukraine.” US national security interest, Khanna reiterated, lay in not getting “significantly entangled in a conflict that would weaken us vis-a-vis China”.Khanna’s comments triggered a backlash against him on Twitter from those who advocate the exercise of more coercive options against Russia. But key former US officials acknowledged that the Congressman had a point.When asked if tensions with Russia risked diverting the US’s geopolitical focus from the China challenge, Elbridge A Colby, a former assistant secretary of defence for strategy and force development, said, “Yes, without question.” Colby, who helped draft the US’s National Defence Strategy in 2018 - a key document that recognised the re-emergence of long term strategic inter-state competition as the US’s primary challenge – warned, “We need to keep the focus on Asia even as crisis flares in Europe. Asia is far more important, and China a much greater threat than Russia. We don’t have the military capacity and likely lack the diplomatic capital and geo-economic leverage to focus on Asia while sustaining our traditional posture in Europe - let alone doubling down. Indeed, doubling down in Europe now would be a historic mistake, and one we will likely rue in the future.”But there is a counter-view that sending a strong message to Russia over Ukraine is essential to sending a message to China too, since what is at stake in Ukraine are broader principles of state sovereignty. A weak US response, in fact, may embolden Beijing.At a press briefing earlier this week, the US state department spokesperson Ned Price said, “In some ways, this is, as important as Ukraine is, even bigger than the question of a conflict, a Russia-produced conflict, between Russia and Ukraine. This is what about what should be the inviolable rules of the so-called rules-based international order.” Alluding to China, without specifically naming it, Price added, “You hear us talk about the rules-based international order not only in the case of Europe and what Russia is doing to undermine it, but in other regions too, notably the Indo-Pacific, where we have similar concerns about what certain countries have also sought to do to undermine, to erode that rules-based international order.” Price claimed this was why the implications of what Russia was doing went beyond Ukraine.Colby, who has recently authored The Strategy of Denial: American Defense in an Age of Great Power Conflict, disagreed. “I don’t buy this, fundamentally. Look, obviously Beijing is watching to learn more about how the Biden administration does things. But much more important is the reality that we face real constraints on our power.” Colby said that what advocates of a hawkish approach in Ukraine missed the fact that US did not have enough military power to go around. “They seem to think it’s all just about our willpower. But willpower without strength is feckless. So what would actually probably most embolden Beijing is doubling down in Europe, since that will mean that we’re not going to strengthen our position in Asia.”Then, there is the question of whether China and Russia can be seen separately or as a part of a common nexus of US adversaries. Those who support a strong US position against Russia point to the deep, and deepening, Moscow-Beijing nexus and argue that US has to contend with both. Indeed, in a call on Wednesday with US secretary of state Antony J Blinken, his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, spoke about taking into account Russia’s “legitimate security interests”. Others, however, suggest that the US will have to identify whether its core contradiction is with Moscow or Beijing, stay focused on that adversary, and find creative diplomatic ways to split the China-Russia nexus and play on Moscow’s fears of Beijing encroaching on its sphere of influence in central Asia.But these choices aren’t easy, especially when no US administration can be seen as allowing Russia to undermine the entire post-Cold War architecture in Europe - which is what Putin has sought in his treaty proposals by asking Nato and the US to limit their engagement, presence, posture, and activities in eastern Europe.What it means for Indo-Pacific and IndiaIrrespective of whether the US should have escalated tensions with Russia over Ukraine, or whether the it could have adopted any other course given that it is Russia that has stepped up the ante in recent months, the fact is that US-Russia tensions have deepened; there is a strong possibility of Russian action in Ukraine; and both sides are preparing for a prolonged geopolitical and economic confrontation.How will this alter Washington’s mood?Ashley Tellis, the Tata chair for Strategic Studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a former US administration official, and among the foremost strategic experts on Asia in Washington DC, believes that these renewed tensions will indeed lead to a shift in focus for the US national security establishment - and have two implications.“One, the US gets easily distracted. In this case, thinking about the Indo-Pacific is far ahead of the practical implementation. For all the accentuated rhetoric, the administration’s engagement and investment in Indo-Pacific is still relatively modest and involves pursuing low-hanging fruit, such as investing in the Quad or holding summit-level meetings. There is a big deficit in terms of both the military investments in the Indo-Pacific strategy and, more visibly, the trade dimension, at a time when the regional economies are still deeply integrated with China.” A military crisis with Russia, Tellis argued, will end up weakening US capacity in the Indo-Pacific and lead to greater resource allocation in Europe.The second implication is with regard to India, and how it emerges out of the crisis. “There are already anxieties in the Congress about India, including vis-à-vis its relationship with Russia. If Delhi feels compelled to be mildly sympathetic to Russia, or even excessively neutral, it will not find a receptive audience for its position in Washington. India is admittedly in a hard place,” said Tellis.Unlike Australia and Japan, the other members of the Quad, who are US allies, India is a partner, prides itself on its “strategic autonomy”, and has a robust relationship with Russia. India has maintained a studied silence on the escalating confrontation, with policymakers hoping that that the crisis gets defused, given their desire to sustain India’s close links with both Washington and Moscow. But if the crisis escalates, New Delhi’s position on the issue may well play into the debate in the US on whether India merits a sanctions waiver for its acquisition of the S-400 missile system from Russia - which would otherwise apply under the Countering America’s Adversaries through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), a US Congress law passed in 2017 to deter countries from engaging with Moscow.Most observers of India-US ties in Washington DC believe that an executive waiver of sanctions is likely for three reasons. One, Delhi is banking on the fact that the US recognises that India’s security imperatives vis-a-vis China - a shared concern - requires it to engage with Russia - a long-standing defence partner. Two, sanctions will set back India-US ties by conveying a message that Washington is not reliable and strengthen the sceptics within the Indian system who have viewed deepening ties with caution - both within India’s defence and intelligence set-ups, the memory of US’s hostility towards India during the Cold War is alive and Pentagon’s continued ties with Rawalpindi are viewed with suspicion. And three, it will potentially reverse the deepening defence engagement between India and the US, with implications for the US defence industry, and ironically, enhance Indian dependence on Russia, even as Delhi has sought to diversify its defence relationships in recent years. None of these outcomes would suit the US, which has made substantial investments in the India relationship in the past three decades.But an outright conflict in Europe will make it difficult for the administration to justify a sanctions waiver when the mood on the Hill is particularly hostile to Moscow. A major sanctions bill against Russia, brought by chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, Robert Menendez, and backed by the White House, is in the offing if Moscow does invade Ukraine. Delhi has also lost a degree of goodwill on the Hill due to what it is widely perceived to be an erosion in its democratic record - this doesn’t necessarily play out in direct ways in policymaking but does make asking for a concession more difficult. The balance is still pretty strongly tilted towards a sanctions waiver, but till it is done, it is not done.Can the US multi-task?Despite US’s new dilemmas due to Russia’s actions, there remains a view in DC that the administration knows that across military, economic, technological, strategic, and political spheres, China is US’s greatest challenge. All national security documents, messaging, and appointments in the administration over the past year have reflected this policy conclusion.Indeed, even as the attention is on the Russia front, the China challenge has not been forgotten. Just in the past week, President Biden has held a bilateral meeting (virtually) with Japan’s new Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, where both reiterated their commitment to a shared vision for the region. There have been indications that the next Quad summit is scheduled to held in Japan this summer. The US has conducted strong naval drills in East Asia as a message to Beijing not to engage in adventurism on Taiwan. The state department held a briefing to reiterate its opposition to China’s illegal and coercive activities in the South China Sea. And the China director of the National Security Council outlined the administration’s five-point strategy to compete with Beijing over the past year of Biden’s presidency.Jeff Smith, research fellow, South Asia, at Heritage Foundation and author of Cold Peace: China-India Rivalry in the 21st Century, said that since the Barack Obama administration’s infamous “Pivot to Asia”, several consecutive US administrations had sought to prioritise the Indo-Pacific and shift resources and attention from legacy theatres such as Europe and West Asia to the “super theatre” of Indo-Pacific. “Of course, America’s adversaries get a vote too and Russia’s provocative moves in and around Ukraine are indeed drawing US attention back to the Eurasian landmass when the US government would rather be focusing on the China challenge.”But Smith said he was sceptical that the ongoing Ukraine crisis would have “more than a marginal impact on America’s posture or strategy” in the Indo-Pacific. “The US government is accustomed to, and capable of, managing instability in multiple theatres simultaneously. To date, there are no indications that the US government is pursuing a major deployment of redistribution of resources, manpower and platforms to the European theatre.” Smith pointed out that the US had already ruled out sending troops to Ukraine, and suggested that the envisioned contingencies involving additional deployment Nato’s eastern flank were not on a scale consequential to US’s Indo-Pacific posture.Frank O’Donnell, the deputy director of the South Asia programme at Stimson Centre, agreed and said that as serious as the Ukraine crisis was, it would not divert American attention from China. “The administration’s deep engagement with Asian allies and partners, and comparably more limited interactions with European counterparts prior to the crisis, is a significant indication of where it sees its geopolitical priorities.”As the world watches what happens in Kiev, and Washington figures out a way to tame Moscow’s ambitions and compete with Beijing, developments in the next few weeks will have implications in capitals as far as Canberra, Tokyo, and of course, New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-will-tensions-with-russia-dilute-the-us-focus-on-indo-pacific-china-101643346242881.html
28-01-2022||World||No decision on CAATSA vis-a-vis India yet: US||The United States is continuing to talk to India about the risks of sanctions for its acquisition of the S-400 missile system from Russia under the Countering America’s Adversaries through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), but hasn’t made a determination “with regard to this transaction”, the state department said on Thursday.Speaking at a regular press briefing, the state department spokesperson Ned Price, was asked whether, given US’s renewed tensions with Russia, India’s purchase of the missile system will affect the India-US bilateral relationship.He said, “In many ways, this doesn’t change the concerns that we have with the S-400 system. I think it shines a spotlight on the destabilising role that Russia is playing not only in the region, but potentially beyond as well. When it comes to CAATSA sanctions, you’ve heard me say before we haven’t made a determination with regard to this transaction, but it’s something we continue to discuss with the Government of India, given the risk of sanctions for this particular transaction under CAATSA.”Price added that whether it was India or any other country, the US continued to “urge all countries to avoid major new transactions for Russian weapon systems”. When asked if the US had a timeline on the decision on CAATSA, Price said, “I don’t have a timeline to offer, but these are issues that we continue to discuss with our partners in India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-decision-on-caatsa-vis-a-vis-india-yet-us-101643344022250.html
28-01-2022||World||'Major gas pipeline at stake if...': US, Germany warn Russia amid Ukraine row||The United States and Germany on Thursday warned Russia that a major gas pipeline was at stake if it invades Ukraine, as Washington voiced hope for a diplomatic way out despite frigid statements from Moscow.A day after the United States and its allies formally responded to security demands issued by Russia, top officials in Moscow said their chief concerns were not addressed but notably did not rule out new talks.The United States has warned Russia of swift and severe consequences if it invades Ukraine after Moscow amassed tens of thousands of troops on the border with its Western-leaning neighbor.Following talk of divisions within Europe, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told parliament that her government was "working on a strong package of sanctions" alongside allies that would include Nord Stream 2.The pipeline, which Germany has defiantly built despite criticism by the United States and Eastern Europeans, will more than double supplies of Russian natural gas to Europe's largest economy.In Washington, a top official voiced confidence that an invasion would stop Germany from activating the multibillion-dollar project, which was completed in September but still requires testing and regulatory approval."If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward," said Victoria Nuland, the undersecretary of state for political affairs."I think the statements coming out of Berlin even today are very, very strong," she told reporters.The White House announced that Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will visit on February 7 and discuss the crisis with President Joe Biden.Stepping up the diplomatic offensive, the United States called a public meeting Monday at the UN Security Council on Russia's "threatening behavior," hoping to bring condemnation even though Moscow can veto any resolutions.Biden also spoke Thursday by telephone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and said the United States was considering economic support after $650 million in military assistance over the past year.Biden "reaffirmed the readiness of the United States along with its allies and partners to respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine," a White House statement said.But Biden, in a recognition of the dangers of the moment, repeated his warning that Ukraine could indeed face a Russian invasion next month."President Biden said that there is a distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February," National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne told AFP.NATO has put 8,500 troops on standby over the Ukraine crisis, in scenes reminiscent of the Cold War with the Soviet Union.'Only one decider'Russia denies any plans to invade but last month demanded wide-ranging security guarantees from the West, including that Ukraine never be allowed to join the US-led NATO military alliance.Washington on Wednesday delivered a reply in coordination with NATO allies, saying Ukraine had the right to determine its own allies but offering Russia talks on missile placements and other mutual concerns.In a first reaction, the Kremlin was unimpressed but cautious."It cannot be said that our views were taken into account," President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters."Let's not rush into assessments; it takes time to analyze."Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow's chief concern -- the potential for Ukraine to join NATO -- had been ignored, but that it would be possible to move forward on other issues."There is a response which gives hope for the start of a serious conversation on secondary questions," said Lavrov, who is expected to hold new talks soon with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken."There's only one decider in Moscow and that is President Putin," Nuland said for her part."We hope he will see here a real opportunity for a legacy of security and arms control rather than a legacy of war," she said."The ball is in their court."'Ukraine in the middle'On the streets of Kyiv, there were concerns that Ukraine had been forgotten amid high-level talks between Moscow, NATO and Washington."The United States is provoking Russia and Russia is provoking the United States. And somewhere in the middle is Ukraine," said Dmytro Sylenko, a 23-year-old businessman."Honestly, I don't care who is provoking whom, what matters to me is that there is peace," he told AFP.Russia, which has a fraught historical relationship with Ukraine, has fueled an insurgency in the former Soviet republic's east that has killed more than 13,000 people since 2014.That year Russia also seized Crimea after the overthrow of a pro-Russian government in Kyiv.In a separate bid to defuse tensions, senior Russian and Ukrainian officials held a marathon eight hours of talks Wednesday in Paris and agreed to meet again in two weeks in Berlin.Zelensky's office in a statement praised the "constructive nature" of the meeting, which recommitted to a fragile ceasefire in eastern Ukraine between government forces and pro-Moscow separatists.Adding to tensions, a 21-year-old Ukrainian national guard conscript opened fire at an aerospace factory Thursday, killing five people, although there was no indication of a link to the Russia standoff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/major-gas-pipeline-at-stake-if-us-germany-warn-russia-101643334355200.html

It began administering vaccines to children aged 5-11 from early this month.TGA said the country's vaccination advisory group will soon give more information on when the 16-17 age group will be eligible to receive their booster doses.Omicron has spiralled Australia's total infections to around 2.4 million, with about 2 million detected in the last four weeks, though its less lethal impact and a booster rollout gathering pace has resulted in a lower death rate.A total of 3,402 deaths have been registered in the country since the pandemic began, far lower than numbers seen in many comparable countries.Australia reported fewer COVID-19 deaths https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-reports-fewer-covid-19-deaths-hospitalisations-steady-2022-01-27 on Thursday, a day after recording a pandemic high of 87 deaths, while hospital cases remained steady, raising hopes the country's worst outbreak may have peaked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-australia-gives-green-signal-to-boosters-for-16-17-age-group-101643330785471.html
28-01-2022||World||Patient without Covid shot denied heart transplant, family says 'need to have a choice'||A Boston hospital is defending itself after a man's family claimed he was denied a new heart for refusing to be vaccinated against Covid-19, saying most transplant programs around the country set similar requirements to improve patients' chances of survival.The family of DJ Ferguson said in a crowdfunding appeal this week that officials at Brigham and Women's Hospital told the 31-year-old father of two that he was ineligible for the procedure because he hasn't been vaccinated against the coronavirus.“We are literally in a corner right now. This is extremely time sensitive,” the family said in its fundraising appeal, which has raised tens of thousands of dollars.“This is not just a political issue. People need to have a choice!”DJ's mother, Tracey Ferguson, insists that her son isn't against vaccinations, noting he's had other immunisations in the past.But the trained nurse said Wednesday that he's been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation — an irregular and often rapid heart rhythm — and that he has concerns about the side effects of the Covid-19 vaccine.“DJ is an informed patient,” Tracey Ferguson said in a brief interview at her home in Mendon, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of Boston.“He wants to be assured by his doctors that his condition would not be worse or fatal with this Covid vaccine.”Brigham and Women's Hospital declined to comment on DJ Ferguson's case, citing patient privacy laws. But it pointed to a response that it posted on its website in which it said the Covid-19 vaccine is one of several immunizations required by most US transplant programs, including a flu shot and hepatitis B vaccines.The hospital said research has shown that transplant recipients are at higher risk than non-transplant patients of dying from Covid-19, and that its policies are in line with the recommendations of the American Society of Transplantation and other health organizations.Patients also must meet other health and lifestyle criteria to receive donated organs, and it's unknown if DJ Ferguson did or would have met them.Brigham & Womens Hospital also stressed that no patient is placed on an organ waitlist without meeting those criteria, and rejected the notion that a transplant candidate could be considered “first on the list” for an organ — a claim Ferguson's family made in its fundraising post.“There are currently more than 100,000 candidates on waitlists for organ transplantation and a shortage of available organs — around half of people on waiting lists will not receive an organ within five years,” the hospital said.Hospitals in other states have faced similar criticism for denying transplants to patients who weren't vaccinated against Covid-19.In Colorado last year, a woman suffering from late-stage kidney disease said she was denied a transplant by her hospital because she was unvaccinated. Leilani Lutali, a born-again Christian, said she opposed immunisation because of the role that fetal cell lines play in some vaccines' development.There is a scarcity of donor organs, so transplant centers only place patients on the waiting list whom they deem the most likely to survive with a new organ.“A donor heart is a precious and scarce gift which must be cared for well,” said Dr. Howard Eisen, medical director for the advanced heart failure program at Penn State University in Hershey, Pennsylvania. “Our goal is to preserve patient survival and good outcomes post-transplant.”The United Network for Organ Sharing, the nonprofit that manages the country's organ transplant system, doesn't track how many patients refusing to get a Covid-19 vaccine have been denied transplants, said Anne Paschke, an organisation spokesperson.She said patients who are denied organ transplants still have the right to go elsewhere, though individual hospitals ultimately decide which patients to add to the national waitlist.According to the online fundraiser, DJ Ferguson was hospitalised in late November for a heart ailment that caused his lungs to fill with blood and fluid.He was then transferred to Brigham and Women's, where doctors inserted an emergency heart pump that the family says is only meant to be a temporary stopgap.“It's devastating,” Tracey Ferguson said. “No one ever wants to see their child go through something like this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/patient-without-covid-shot-denied-heart-transplant-family-says-need-to-have-a-choice-101643329364773.html
28-01-2022||World||US Supreme Court to get its first Black woman judge, says Joe Biden||President Joe Biden said Thursday he will nominate a Black woman to the US Supreme Court for the first time in history, filling the vacancy left by retiring Justice Stephen Breyer."I've made no decision except (the) person I will nominate will be someone with extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity," Biden said in an address from the White House."And that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court."Biden, speaking at a podium alongside Breyer, also indicated that he would seek a speedy nomination process, promising to name his candidate by the end of February.The exit of Breyer, who is 83, gives Biden a likely smooth opportunity to name a replacement to the lifelong seat on the Supreme Court while his Democratic Party retains control of the Senate.The Supreme Court is currently split between six conservatives and three liberals. Biden will now be able to nominate another liberal-leaning jurist to the court, maintaining the balance.Breyer had been under pressure from liberals to leave in time for Biden to get his nominee through the Senate before November's midterm elections, when Republicans are in a strong position to win majorities in Congress and would then control the approval process.As president, Donald Trump had the rare opportunity to put no fewer than three new justices on the court, fundamentally shifting its political leaning for potentially years to come.Biden's one pick so far will have nowhere near that level of impact. However, the Democrat will be glad of a successful confirmation process, delivering a much needed morale boost to his party ahead of the midterms.As an immediate reminder of the tensions that Supreme Court confirmations often provoke, Republican senior Senator Mitch McConnell warned Biden "not to outsource this important decision to the radical left.""To the degree that President Biden received a mandate, it was to govern from the middle," McConnell said.In his resignation letter, published Thursday, Breyer underlined the coordinated plan to ensure that the succession moves with minimal upheaval, confirming that he will stay on the court through the packed current term -- but not before his replacement is ready."I intend this decision to take effect when the court rises for the summer recess this year (typically late June or early July) assuming that by then my successor has been nominated and confirmed," he wrote.Campaign pledgeBiden promised to put an African-American woman on the court back when he was campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination.The vow was part of his vital outreach to the Black community, which became a crucial component in ultimately defeating a crowded field of Democratic rivals and then unseating Trump.Biden put the first Black and Asian woman, Kamala Harris, on the ticket as his vice president, and since taking office has also pushed hard to place more women and ethnic minorities as senior judges.Biden said that in the search for Breyer's replacement, he would be asking Harris to help, describing her as "an exceptional lawyer" and noting she was a former member of the Senate judiciary committee -- a body he himself led while serving as a senator.Among the leading candidates to replace Breyer are Ketanji Brown Jackson, a US Court of Appeals judge, and Leondra Kruger of the California Supreme Court.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden had "already started reviewing potential candidates" and the nomination process should "happen as expeditiously as possible."Of the 115 justices who served on the Supreme Court, only five have been women, including three today -- Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett. Only two have been Black men, one of whom is current Justice Clarence Thomas.Breyer is the oldest justice on the court and was nominated in 1994 by then Democratic president Bill Clinton.Praising Breyer, Biden highlighted his bipartisan spirit, saying he "patiently sought common ground" and was "a model public servant in a time of great division in this country."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-to-get-its-first-black-woman-judge-says-joe-biden-101643329905372.html

One died instantly, and the other Grant finished off with a knife, according to court documents.He was sentenced to death in 2005.He filed numerous appeals during his imprisonment to have his sentence overturned, citing intellectual deficiencies in particular. In an online petition, his defenders claimed that he suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome and brain trauma caused by violent abuse in his childhood from his alcoholic father.His last appeal, concerning the method of execution used by the southern US state of Oklahoma, was rejected Wednesday by the US Supreme Court.Grant received an injection of three lethal substances at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester.The deadly cocktail is suspected of causing excruciating pain for the condemned, which is forbidden by the US Constitution. In late October, an inmate suffered from convulsions and vomited several times after the first injection.Nothing of the sort occurred during Grant's execution.The number of executions carried out annually in the United States has been declining in recent years.Capital punishment has been abolished in 23 US states, while three others -- California, Oregon and Pennsylvania -- have observed a moratorium on its use.A series of botched executions in Oklahoma led to a temporary moratorium on capital punishment in the state in 2015, but the moratorium was lifted in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-first-execution-of-2022-is-man-who-robbed-hotel-for-girlfriend-s-bail-money-101643328209686.html
28-01-2022||World||North Korea confirms latest weapons tests as Kim visits 'important' munitions factory||North Korea conducted tests of an upgraded long-range cruise missile and a warhead of a tactical guided missile this week, as leader Kim Jong Un visited a munitions factory producing a "major weapon system," state media KCNA said on Friday.Tension has been simmering over North Korea's series of six weapons tests in 2022, among the largest number of missile launches it has made in a month, which triggered condemnation and a new sanctions push from the United States.An update to a long-range cruise missile system was tested on Tuesday, and another test was held to confirm the power of a conventional warhead for a surface-to-surface tactical guided missile on Thursday, KCNA said.Kim did not attend the tests, but during a visit to the munitions factory, he lauded "leaping progress in producing major weapons" to implement the ruling Workers' Party's decisions made at a meeting last month, a separate dispatch said."The factory holds a very important position and duty in modernising the country's armed forces and realising the national defence development strategy," Kim said.KCNA did not specify the weapons or the factory's location. Kim called for bolstering national defences to tackle an unstable international situation at that party gathering.Last week, North Korea said it would bolster its defences against the United States and consider resuming "all temporally-suspended activities", hinting at lifting a self-declared moratorium on testing nuclear bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).At the factory, Kim called for "an all-out drive" to produce "powerful cutting-edge arms," and its workers touted his devotion to "smashing ... the challenges of the U.S. imperialists and their vassal forces" seeking to violate their right to self-defence, calling it "the harshest-ever adversity."Pyongyang has defended missile launches as its sovereign right to self-defence and accused Washington and Seoul of applying "hostile policy" and double standards https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-fires-unidentified-projectile-into-sea-off-east-coast-skorea-2021-09-27 over weapons tests.No ICBMs or nuclear weapons have been tested in North Korea since 2017 but a spate of shorter-range missile launches began amid stalled denuclearisation talks following a failed summit with the United States in 2019.'POWERFUL WARHEADS'In Tuesday's test, two long-range cruise missiles flew 1,800 km (1,118.5 miles) for 9,137 seconds and hit a target island off the east coast, showing practical combat performance, KCNA said.The two tactical guided missiles tested on Thursday also precisely struck the target and proved the explosive power of their warhead as designed, it said.The country "will keep developing powerful warheads capable of performing combat function and mission," KCNA added.KCNA Photos dated on Tuesday showed a long-range missile launched from a transporter-erector-launcher, gushing flame, before sparking a fire on an island. Another set of images from Thursday showed a shorter-range missile rising into the sky above a cloud of dust and then hitting an island.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said it detected both tests, and the short-range missiles fired from the eastern coastal city of Hamhung travelled for about 190 km (118 miles) to an altitude of 20 km (12.4 miles).This month alone, North Korea has also tested tactical guided missiles, two "hypersonic missiles" capable of high speed and manoeuvring after lift-off, and a railway-borne missile system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-confirms-latest-weapons-tests-as-kim-visits-important-munitions-factory-101643327528723.html
28-01-2022||World||4 Indians found dead near US-Canada border was a family from Gujarat||TORONTO: The four Indian nationals who died from exposure to extreme cold on the Canadian side of the border with the United States on January 19 were members of a family from Gujarat, the Indian High Commission in Ottawa said in a statement on Thursday, citing information received from Canadian law enforcement.A special team from India’s Consulate in Toronto is camping in Manitoba “to assist ongoing investigations by Canadian agencies and to render any consular services for the victims,” the statement added.Manitoba Royal Canadian Mounted Police or RCMP has identified them as 39-year-old Jagdish Baldevbhai Patel, his wife 37-year-old Vaishaliben Jagdishkumar Patel, their daughter 11-year-old Vihangi Jagdishkumar Patel, and son, three-year-old Dharmik Jagdishkumar Patel.The high commission said the autopsy has confirmed that “based on the circumstances, the death of all the persons have been determined to be consistent with exposure to the outdoor elements.”The next of kin of the deceased have been informed and the Consulate General of India in Toronto is in touch with the family of the deceased and is providing consular support, according to a release from India’s High Commission in Ottawa.The statement said a number of ideas are under discussion between India and Canada on the longer term issues that this tragedy has brought into focus and the need to ensure that migration and mobility are made safe and legal and that such tragedies do not recur.These include India’s proposal of a comprehensive Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreement or MMPA to Canada to “prevent and suppress irregular migration, smuggling of migrants and human trafficking and to facilitate sustainable and circular mobility. The matter remains under consideration with Canada.The Office of the Medical Examiner is in possession of the deceased persons and will coordinate with Indian officials for the release of the bodies to their next of kind. Thereafter, arrangements will be made for the transport of the remains back to India.The bodies of the four victims were found just about 10 km from the American border and they may have succumbed due to a human smuggling operation gone wrong.Seven other Indian nationals, linked to the tragic quartet found dead on the Canadian side of the border, were apprehended in the United States. One person, a 47-year-old resident of Florida Steve Shand was arrested by US authorities (though later released on bail) for allegedly “smuggling undocumented foreign nationals.”Last Wednesday morning, Manitoba RCMP received “concerning information” from their counterparts that the US Customs and Border Protection or USCBP had apprehended a group of individuals who had crossed into the US from Canada, near the town of Emerson in Manitoba.A search began and four hours later, at about 1.30 pm, RCMP officers found the bodies of three individuals were located on the Canadian side of the border, close to Emerson.
28-01-2022||India||DCGI approves trials for internasal booster dose||India’s drugs regulator on Friday approved advanced clinical trials for Bharat Biotech’s intranasal Covid-19 vaccine candidate (BBV154), including as a booster dose for those who have been earlier jabbed with either Covaxin or Covishield, according to people familiar with the development.The trials for the adenovirus vectored vaccine, to be used as a spray to the nose, will be conducted at nine sites across the country with almost 900 participants in all.The trial sites identified are All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi and Patna (Bihar), Aatman Hopsital, Ahmedabad (Gujarat), Oyster and Pearl Hospitals, Pune, and Acharya Vinobha Bhave Rural Hospital, Wardha (Maharashtra), PGIMS, Rohtak (Haryana), and Prakhar Hospital, Kanpur, and Rana Hospital, Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh), and Jeevan Rekha Hospital, Belagavi (Karnataka).The approval letter, issued to the Hyderabad-based company by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI, VG Somani, laid down certain conditions for conducting the trials in the country. HT has seen the approval letter.The phase 3 trials will be conducted as randomised open label multi-center study to compare immunogenicity and safety of BBV154 with Covaxin.“Firm should submit the safety data of sufficient duration post second dose. Firm is required to constitute a data safety and monitoring board to review the safety data. The formulation intended to be used in clinical trials shall be manufactured using validated procedures under good manufacturing practices conditions and shall have ongoing stability programme…,” reads the approval letter.Another condition for approval is that the company will be using only Kasauli (Himachal Pradesh) based central drugs laboratory certified batches in the clinical trials. The company in a statement confirmed the development.“BBV154 (Nasal covid vaccine) has received approval for phase 3 clinical trials. The trials will evaluate BBV154 nasal vaccine for both the 2 dose primary schedule and booster dose schedule. Intra nasal vaccines are easier to administer in mass immunization campaigns and help reduce / stop transmission,” read the statement.Suchitra Ella, joint managing director, Bharat Biotech, tweeted, “Covid vaccines are headed for a booster dose( 3rd dose). BBV 154 will be administered as nasal drops instead of a JAB, pain free!!”Scientists around the world are racing to develop a viable and effective nasal vaccine, which could offer superior protection by creating immunity in the nasal passageway, where the Sars-CoV-2 first takes hold during an infection. Known as mucosal immunity, experts have likened such a protection to “placing guards outside the gates to stop the coronavirus”, as Yale professor Akiko Iwasaki explained while speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in December.Bharat Biotech in a statement added that such vaccines are helpful because they are non-invasive (needle-free), easy to administer and do not require trained health care workers; and are scalable as far as manufacturing is concerned.In September, 2020, Bharat Biotech had inked a licensing agreement with Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis for a novel chimp- adenovirus, single dose intranasal vaccine for Covid-19.In January, last year, the company applied to the central drugs regulator to allow it to start clinical trials in humans.
28-01-2022||India||Health minister reviews Covid situation in southern states||Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Friday held a virtual meeting with officials from the southern states and three union territories to review the public health measures for Covid-19 and the progress of the vaccination campaign, according to a statement. The minister urged the regions to utilise before March 31 funds released by the Centre as part of the emergency Covid relief package, which is meant to help states strengthen their health infrastructure. The health minister also urged the states to provide relevant data on time so that sturdy and efficient Covid policies can be drawn up.“It is important to have a sturdy and resilient health infrastructure and the ECRP-II package under which the funds have been provided to states and UTS needs to be utilised before 31st March, 2022… While some states have expedited effective utilisation of the approved funds for health infra creation, other states may also review the physical and financial progress under ECRP-II and expedite the progress,” said Mandaviya in a statement.The states and union territories that participated in the review were Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Puducherry, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep.The health minister reiterated that the five-fold strategy of ‘Test-Track-Treat-Vaccinate and Adherence to COVID Appropriate Behaviour’ was key for Covid management.States and UTs were advised to keep a close watch on emerging clusters and hotspots; and states with a lower share of RTPCR in Covid-19 testing were advised to review the testing ratio. Adequate and timely testing will help in prompt identification of the infected cases and prevention of a sudden surge, he said.The states were also asked to focus on expediting vaccination coverage.The directive came at a time when the third nationwide wave of Covid-19 has been raging, although there are now signs that it may be levelling off in some regions. India recorded 233,779 new cases on Friday, 6.8% down from the 250,762 cases recorded a day before, HT’s tally of cases showed.
28-01-2022||India||Data a must for quota in promotion, says SC||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday turned down the Union government’s plea to dilute the requirement of collecting quantifiable data by the Centre and states to determine the representation of people belonging to Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) while implementing reservation in promotion.A three-judge bench, headed by justice L Nageswara Rao, declared that the government shall have to collect empirical data with respect to each cadre of the public employment, emphasising that adequacy of representation cannot be gauged either on the basis of data on representation of SCs/STs with reference to the entire service or in proportion of their population. “Before providing for reservation in promotions to a cadre, the state is obligated to collect quantifiable data regarding inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs. Collection of information regarding inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs cannot be with reference to the entire service or class/group but it should be relatable to the grade/category of posts to which promotion is sought,” held the bench, which also comprised justices Sanjiv Khanna and BR Gavai. A cadre should represent a grade or category of posts to which promotion is sought, it said. The court further ruled that there should be a periodic review of the data collected to determine inadequacy of representation for the purpose of providing reservation in promotions, leaving it to the Centre and states to decide what should be a “reasonable” time gap for such an exercise. The top court was hearing a clutch of petitions arising out of judgments from 11 different high courts, which had delivered rulings on various pertinent reservation policies in the last 10 years. Some of the states from where these judgments arose included Maharashtra, Bihar, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Tripura, Madhya Pradesh, and Punjab. Meanwhile, declaring cadre as a unit for the purpose of collecting quantifiable data in relation to promotional posts, the court on Friday negated a 2019 judgment by the two-judge bench, which upheld the validity of a reservation law in Karnataka , and the method of taking a sample or the entire service as the unit to determine adequacy of representation for SCs/STs. The three-judge bench held that the 2019 judgment in BK Pavitra-II case was contrary to the law laid down by Constitution bench judgments in M Nagaraj (2006) and Jarnail Singh (2018). In 2006, a Constitution bench ruling in the M Nagaraj case made it incumbent upon the state to collect quantifiable data showing inadequacy of representation of a section of people in public employment in addition to maintaining overall administrative efficiency. The aspect of quantifiable data was endorsed by another Constitution bench in its 2018 ruling in the Jarnail Singh case which also mandated the exclusion of the “creamy layer” before providing for reservation in promotions. Lending credence to the two Constitution bench judgments, the court further declined the Centre’s request to lay down judicial yardsticks for determining inadequate representation of SCs/STs, stating that it should be left to the discretion of the state since such determination depends upon myriad factors which a court cannot envisage.“Laying down of criteria for determining the inadequacy of representation would result in curtailing the discretion given to the state governments. In addition, the prevailing local conditions, which may require to be factored in, might not be uniform,” highlighted the court, adding that the validity of laws or policies made by state governments to provide reservation in promotions shall be decided on a case-to-case basis to ascertain whether the inadequacy of representation is supported by quantifiable data. Another submission by attorney general KK Venugopal on behalf of the Union government regarding proportionate representation as the test of adequacy failed to cut ice with the bench. “The attempt of the learned Attorney General to impress upon this court that the proportion of SCs/STs in the population of India should be taken as the test for determining whether they are adequately represented in promotional posts, did not yield results,” noted the bench.In its judgment, the court also clarified that the Nagaraj judgment would have a prospective effect in order to “avoid chaos and confusion” that could ensue from unsettling seniority of thousands of employees who availed reservation in promotions without there being strict compliance of the conditions prescribed in this judgment.That judgment was delivered in 2006, interpreting Article 16(4-A) of the Constitution (which introduced the provision of reservation in matters of promotion with consequential seniority) that came into force in 1995. Between 1995 and 2006, thousands of employees in central government and state services had been promoted without complying with the conditions laid down in this verdict. “Making principles laid down in Nagaraj effective from the year 1995 would be detrimental to the interests of a number of civil servants and would have an effect of unsettling the seniority of individuals over a long period of time. It is necessary that the judgment of Nagaraj should be declared to have prospective effect,” held the court. The bench refused to express any opinion on discontinuing reservation, as was pressed by some petitioners representing general category candidates. “We are not inclined to express any view on discontinuation of reservations in totality, which is completely within the domain of the legislature and the executive,” said the court, adding it is in favour of a periodic review of the data on inadequacy of representation. “Collection of quantifiable data for determining the inadequacy of representation of SCs/STs is a basic requirement for providing reservation in promotions, as laid down by this court in Nagaraj. The unit for the purpose of collection of data is a cadre, according to Nagaraj and Jarnail Singh. For the purpose of collection of quantifiable data for providing reservation in promotions, the entire service cannot be taken to be a unit and treated as a cadre, as already stated,” concluded the court in its judgment.After laying down the principles of law, the court said that it would consider examining individual cases arising from the high courts on February 24.During the arguments of the case, the Union government pressed for reservation in promotion proportionate to the population of SCs and STs as per a 1995 judgment by the top court in the RK Sabharwal case. Venugopal argued that it should be left open to the Centre and states to decide on promotional avenues for SCs and STs, contending the condition regarding collection of quantifiable data to show inadequacy of representation of SCs/STs is “vague”. According to Venugopal, there was a roster system in place in every cadre of the government departments to ascertain the posts required to be filled up by SCs/STs, and therefore the prerequisite of quantifiable data, as was laid down by two Constitution bench judgments of the apex court, should not remain – a plea shot down by the bench in its judgment.When asked what should be a time period for the government to revisit the reservation policy after ascertaining the percentage of posts occupied by SCs/STs, the AG said that a periodic review should happen after every 10 years when a census is done. The court, in its judgment, has left it to the Centre and states to determine the time period for review. Representing general category candidates, senior advocates Rajeev Dhavan, Meenakshi Arora, Gopal Sankaranarayan and lawyer Kumar Parimal argued that the reservation cannot be for an indefinite period and that it must stop as soon as the upper ceiling has been reached. Further, they emphasised that reservation in promotion should be cadre-based only after quantifiable data is collected and the creamy layer has been excluded. Additionally, the general category candidates have said that posts meant for SCs/STs cannot be kept vacant indefinitely and should be filled up by other candidates after three years, as laid down in the Nagaraj judgment. 
28-01-2022||India||In talks with India over sanction risk due to S-400 Russia deal: US||Washington: The United States is continuing to talk to India about the risks of sanctions for its acquisition of the S-400 missile system from Russia under the Countering America’s Adversaries through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), but hasn’t made a determination “with regard to this transaction”, the State department said on Thursday.Speaking at a regular press briefing, the State department spokesperson Ned Price was asked whether, given the US’s renewed tensions with Russia, India’s purchase of the missile system will affect the India-US bilateral relationship.He said, “In many ways, this doesn’t change the concerns that we have with the S-400 system. I think it shines a spotlight on the destabilising role that Russia is playing not only in the region, but potentially beyond as well. When it comes to CAATSA sanctions, you’ve heard me say before we haven’t made a determination with regard to this transaction, but it’s something we continue to discuss with the Government of India, given the risk of sanctions for this particular transaction under CAATSA.”Price added that whether it was India or any other country, the US continued to “urge all countries to avoid major new transactions for Russian weapon systems”. When asked if the US had a timeline on the decision on CAATSA, Price said, “I don’t have a timeline to offer, but these are issues that we continue to discuss with our partners in India.”CAATSA came into force in 2017, at a time when the political mood in Washington DC was hostile to Russia for its actions in Ukraine, Syria and alleged interference in the 2016 US presidential elections. The Act seeks to deter countries which engage with Russia, especially in the realm of defence purchases, through punitive measures. Under the Act, sanctions were imposed on Turkey — a NATO ally — for its acquisition of the S-400 system from Russia. India has a long-standing defence relationship with Russia — and has pursued its acquisition of the S-400 missile system. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) has maintained that India’s decisions are guided by its own national security considerations. In November, MEA spokesperson Arindam Baghci said, “India and the US have a comprehensive global strategic partnership and India has a special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia. We also pursue an independent foreign policy. This applies to our defence acquisition and supplies which are guided by our national security interests.” Most observers of the India-US relationship in Washington believe the US is likely to recognise India’s defence imperatives with regard to China, and waive off sanctions. But the renewed tensions over Ukraine have created a strong bipartisan mood in Washington against Russian actions, and added to India’s challenge in balancing ties. New Delhi issued a statement on Friday hoping for a peaceful resolution of the situation in Ukraine. Commenting on the broader challenge for India as US-Russia tensions deepen, Ashley J Tellis, the Tata chair for strategic studies at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and among the foremost experts on Asian geopolitics in the US, said, “There are already anxieties in the Congress about India, including vis a vis its relationship with Russia. If Delhi feels compelled to mildly sympathetic to Russia, or even excessively neutral, it will not find a receptive audience for its position in Washington DC. India is admittedly in a hard place.”

28-01-2022||India||‘Unconstitutional’: Supreme Court sets aside suspension of Maharashtra BJP MLAs||New Delhi/Mumbai: The Supreme Court on Friday scrapped the one-year suspension of 12 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs from Maharashtra assembly, calling the Speaker’s action against the lawmakers “unconstitutional” and “irrational”.The judgment created a political stir in Maharashtra.State parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab said “revoking of the suspension can only be done through a resolution,” indicating that a tussle between the state’s ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi and the judiciary may be on the cards. The minister, however, added that the government will study the detailed order before deciding on revoking the suspension.Also Read | After SC squashes suspension of 12 BJP MLAs from Maha assembly, Sena’s Raut says ‘speaker will decide’The BJP, meanwhile, said that the apex court’s ruling is a “tight slap” in the face of the “arrogant” MVA government.The court also observed that Parliament and Legislative assemblies have become more intransigent places with jeering and personal attacks replacing erudite and constructive debate.A three-judge bench headed by justice AM Khanwilkar said that any suspension beyond the concerned session of the House was “illegal” and cannot have a basis in law. “Suspension beyond the session would be bordering on punishing not only the member concerned, but also inevitably impact the legitimate rights of the constituency,”added the bench, also comprising justices Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar.The 12 BJP MLAs were suspended after a commotion erupted in the two-day monsoon session of the Maharashtra assembly on July 5, 2021. The legislators were suspended for a year over the alleged use of abusive language against the presiding officer, Bhaskar Jadhav, and misconduct.The Court noted that while the legislature had inherent power under its rules to suspend any member to ensure proper exercise of the functions of the house but this power is protective and self-defensive and not punitive.“Suspension beyond the remainder period of the ongoing session would not only be grossly irrational measure, but also violative of basic democratic values, owing to unessential deprivation of the member concerned, and more importantly, the constituency would remain unrepresented in the Assembly,” held the bench as it set aside the suspension and declared that the 12 MLAs would be entitled to all consequential benefits on and after the expiry of the concerned monsoon session of the assembly in July, 2021.Closing the judgment with an epilogue, the bench said, “This case has thrown up an occasion for all concerned to ponder over the need to evolve and adhere to good practices befitting the august body and appropriately denounce and discourage proponents of undemocratic activities in the House, by democratically elected representatives.”The court referred to Rule 53 of Maharashtra legislative assembly rules which gave power to Speaker to suspend a member for a day or in case of repeated misconduct, for the entire session. The bench said, “If the House takes upon itself to discipline its members, it is expected to adopt the same graded (rational and objective standard) approach on the lines predicated in Rule 53.”Such actions by the house would impact the democratic set-up as a whole “by permitting a thin majority government (coalition government) to manipulate numbers of the Opposition party in an undemocratic manner,” the court added. And opposition members will not be able to effectively participate in debates owing to constant fear of being suspended for long terms, the court said. MVA laders questioned the delay of nearly one and a half years to approve 12 names for the state’s legislative council by the governor. “On one hand the ruling was given saying that legislators cannot be kept away from representing the constituencies above six months, but the appointment of 12 members to the Legislative Council has not been done for nearly a year and half. How can there be two laws? This is nothing be double standards,” said Parab.Constitutional expert and law professor Ulhas Bapat said that the government will not be able to overlook the ruling as the order will be binding on them. He said that suspensions fall under Article 194 of the Privileges of Parliament in the Constitution and the basic structure of the Constitution cannot be touched by anyone.Leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis welcomed the verdict calling it a historic decision. “I would like to thank the Supreme Court for its decision. It has rightly pointed out that the government had acted ‘illegally’ and ‘irrationally’. The government feels they are above the Constitution and hence they had suspended the 12 MLAs on a false narrative based on events in the presiding officer’s [Shiv Sena leader Bhaskar Jadhav] chamber that never occurred,” Fadnavis said in Goa.Jayant Patil, Maharashtra NCP chief and cabinet minister, said that the suspension was done in the framework of the law. “The assembly Speaker and legislature office will study the order.The authority to suspend members lies with the Speaker. there have been incidents where members have been suspended for a longer duration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unconstitutional-supreme-court-sets-aside-suspension-of-maharashtra-bjp-mlas-101643391724384.html

The rebels claimed the vessel was carrying “military supplies” and entered Yemeni waters off the coast of Hodeidah “without authorisation”. The Saudi Arabia-led coalition fighting the Houthis described the vessel’s seizure as an act of “armed piracy”, and India and the United Arab Emirates had demanded the release of the crew. “As per the latest information received from the shipping company based in the UAE as well as from other sources, the seven Indian sailors are safe, in good health and are being provided regular meals,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a virtual weekly media briefing.“However, their captors have not been allowing them to communicate with their families,” he said in response to a question on the status of the seven Indian sailors. The Indian government is in touch with multiple sources, including the UN Mission to support the Hudaydah Agreement or UNMHA, to “enquire about the safety and well-being of our sailors as well as to reinforce our message to the Houthis that our sailors should be released at the earliest”, Bagchi said.The civil observer mission, with headquarters at Al-Hudaydah, has facilitated dialogue between Yemeni parties and also looks at ways to ensure the full implementation of the Hudaydah Agreement, including a ceasefire and redeployment of forces.The hostilities occurring more than 3,000 kilometres away have had consequences for India twice this month. Besides the seizure of the Rwabee, two Indians were killed and two more injured in a drone attack by the Houthis on Abu Dhabi on January 17. The attack was carried out in apparent retaliation for the UAE’s role in the coalition fighting the Houthis.The rebels have also threatened to expand their operations against the UAE and Saudi Arabia, are home to nearly six million Indians.Bagchi said external affairs minister S Jaishankar condemned the “terror attack” of January 17 in the strongest terms during a telephone conversation with his UAE counterpart. “Subsequently, the UN Security Council, of which we are currently a member, in a press statement condemned in the strongest terms the heinous terror attack in Abu Dhabi...on January 17. We are closely monitoring developments,” he said.

28-01-2022||India||India ready to engage Pakistan on expanding list of shrines for pilgrims||NEW DELHI: India on Friday said it is ready for discussions with Pakistan on expanding the number of religious shrines that can be visited by pilgrims of both sides and their mode of travel, against the backdrop of a Pakistani proposal for allowing pilgrims to travel by air.The development comes at a time when ties between the two countries are at an all-time low, with trade and most forms of travel suspended since a terror attack at Pulwama in 2019 brought the two countries close to war.The Pakistani mission in New Delhi recently forwarded to the external affairs ministry a proposal from the Pakistan Hindu Council that permission be granted for two chartered flights of the Pakistan International Airlines to carry pilgrims from Lahore and Karachi to India. Currently, pilgrims are only allowed to travel via the Wagah land border and the Kartarpur Corridor.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a virtual weekly media briefing that India is prepared to discuss the expansion of the list of shrines that can visited by pilgrims of both countries under the terms of the bilateral “Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines” of 1974.With Covid-related travel restrictions currently in place, he suggested these talks could be held before the situation normalises.“As you are aware, under the 1974 protocol between India and Pakistan, visits to religious shrines are being facilitated regularly. There is an interest on both sides to expand the agreed list of shrines and mode of travel. It naturally needs to be discussed under the protocol,” he said.“You are also aware that currently restrictions are in place on movement and gatherings in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. As the situation normalises, we expect that this time can be utilised to hold discussions under the bilateral protocol,” he added.India hopes to facilitate the “early exchange of visits to all shrines of interest to pilgrims”, Bagchi remarked. “Let me underline that India has a positive approach on this matter and is willing to engage the Pakistani side,” he said.The protocol currently includes five Muslim shrines on the Indian side and 15 shrines on the Pakistani side, a majority of them gurdwaras.Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, the patron-in-chief of the Pakistan Hindu Council and a lawmaker from Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, had suggested the two proposed chartered flights could carry about 170 Pakistani pilgrims, most of them Muslims, to India to visit Ajmer Sharif, Nizamuddin dargah and other shrines.He said he also suggested that Air India flights could be allowed to carry Indian pilgrims to Pakistan so that they could visit shrines such as the samadhi of Parihans Maharaj at Teri village in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Hinglaj Mata mandir in Balochistan. These flights would be part of what the Pakistani side is describing as a “faith tourism” initiative.Vankwani suggested the first flight from the Pakistani side could operate on January 29, and contended the plan was “postponed for a few days” to obtain the required clearances and also because of the pandemic. “I am hopeful this will happen next week and this programme is intact. We hope to take up to 340 pilgrims to India,” he said.

Minorities facing trouble in any of our neighboring countries prefer to seek refuge in India because India is safe. Let's be grateful to our great nation," Rijiju said in a series of tweets.Participating in the panel discussion from India, former vice president Ansari had expressed his concern over the rising trend of Hindu nationalism.    "In recent years, we have experienced the emergence of trends and practices that dispute the well-established principle of civic nationalism and interpose a new and imaginary practice of cultural nationalism.... It wants to distinguish citizens on the basis of their faith, give vent to intolerance, insinuate otherness, and promote disquiet and insecurity," he had alleged.Countering Ansari, Rijiju said some isolated incidents do take place at individual-community level "but Indian culture is always inclusive. Prime Minister  Narendra Modi ji's mantra is sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas, sabka prayas".Before 2014, communal riots and violence were regular but India is more peaceful now, the Union minister said."Why some people who enjoy the best freedom and privilege in India join the anti-India propaganda peddled by foreign based anti India forces? What's the satisfaction that they acquire by defaming India? At least, people in remote villages without facilities are loyal to motherland," Rijiju said in a dig at Ansari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-ex-vice-prez-ansari-said-is-wrong-law-minister-kiren-rijiju-on-iamc-event-101643382267444.html

Dr Joshi said NeoCov is an old virus closely related to MERS Cov which enters cells via DPP4 receptors. Explaining whether there is an immediate reason to worry, Dr Joshi said NeoCov can use ACE2 receptors of bats but they can't use human ACE2 receptors unless a new mutation occurs.Experts have said NeoCov has only been found in bats and it has never infected a human being. If it ever infects humans, then it might be potential to kill one in three people, as it has a close resemblance to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). There is no such finding that NeoCov may be jumping from bats to humans. Neo Cov demystified 1 NeoCov is an old virus closely related to MERS Cov which enter cells via DPP4 receptors 2.

"Animals, particularly wild animals are the source of more than 75% of all emerging infectious diseases in humans, many of which are caused by novel viruses. Coronaviruses are often found in animals, including in bats which have been identified as a natural reservoir of many of these viruses," WHO said to Russian news agency Tass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-neocov-maharashtra-expert-says-everything-else-is-hype-101643381562768.html

The two brothers established contact with each other through a video call in 2019 because of the efforts of a popular Pakistan-based YouTube channel, Punjabi Lehar, which highlighted their story. Earlier this month, the same YouTube channel facilitated a meeting between the brothers during a visit to the Kartarpur Gurdwara in Pakistan’s Punjab province. Indian nationals are able to visit the Sikh shrine without visas by travelling through a special cross-border corridor.A video of the two brothers embracing while fighting back tears caused waves on both sides of the border. It was at this meeting that Khan, who lives in Phulewala village at Bathinda in India’s Punjab state, learnt he had been christened Habib Khan at the time of his birth. On Friday, the Pakistan high commission in New Delhi granted Khan a visa to visit his brother and other family members across the border.“The story of the two brothers is a powerful illustration of how the historic opening of the visa-free Kartarpur Sahib Corridor in November 2019 by Pakistan is bringing people closer to each other,” the high commission said in a tweet along with a photo of a beaming Khan.Sika Khan met Pakistani chargé d’affaires Aftab Hasan Khan and other officers of the high commission and thanked them for their cooperation.Sika Khan also met with CDA Aftab Hasan Khan and interacted with Mission's officers. He appreciated his interaction and thanked the CDA for the cooperation extended to him. pic.twitter.com/ZS4zSpia9jPunjabi Lehar, which is run by Nasir Dhillon and Lovely Singh, focuses on reuniting families from the two sides of Punjab that were separated at the time of Partition, which resulted in the migration of almost 12 million people – more than 6.5 million from the Indian side and nearly five million from the Pakistani side.Dhillon and Singh learnt about Siddique and his long-lost brother during visit to Bogran village near Faisalabad in Pakistani Punjab in 2019.“Punjabi Lehar is endeavouring to bridge a gap between the people of East and West Punjab, created by the partition of 1947,” says a message on the channel’s YouTube page.“Most of the people have passed away with an unfulfilled ardent desire in their heart to see their birthplace and meet their childhood friends. Punjabi Lehar is attempting to fulfil the desire of remaining Partition-era Punjabis, who will be gone in the next five to seven years.”

On Friday, he said Tiwari has been booked under the Indian Penal Code’s Section 295 A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage reli­gious feelings of any class by insulting religion or reli­gious beliefs).A video of Tiwari’s comment went viral on social media and members of Sanskriti Bachao Manch staged a protest in Bhopal and demanded action against her on Thursday. Later, Bhopal resident Sonu Prajapati filed a complaint against her.Deputy police commissioner Riyaz Iqbal said they filed the case against Tiwari on the complaint of Prajapati. “Now we have asked the manager of the hotel, where the press conference was held to share the video footage so that we can investigate the matter.

The NIA charge-sheeted seven accused in 2010 and another was killed in Jammu and Kashmir. Two accused are still at large and a trial court acquitted as many.The trial court convicted Thadiyantavida Nazeer, who was arrested from a village along the India-Bangladesh border in 2009, and S Shafaz and awarded them double life term in 2013.This was the first case the NIA took over in Kerala. A division bench of Justices K Vinod Chandran and Ziyad Rahman acquitted the two and dismissed an appeal challenging the acquittal of two other accused earlier, Abdul Halim and Abubacker Yousef. “There is no reliable evidence on the preparation or commission of the crime that incriminates the accused beyond a reasonable doubt,” the court observed in a 101-page verdict.The court said the agency failed to discover anything related to the crime. The approver in the case is not a reliable witness and his role in the crime is very suspect and cannot be believed, it added. The court observed the investigators were groping in the dark for almost four years until the third accused confessed about his role after being arrested in another blast case. One of the accused in the case turned approver during the trial and the court found that the case was built on his disclosures.“In the present case, there is no lengthy statement, but the disclosure record confession linking the accused with the crime so unabashedly that none could escape innuendo. This is flagrant violation of Section 25 and 26 of the Evidences Act and tends to impress upon the court the need to convict, even without proof beyond reasonable doubt,” said the court. The agency said the first and third accused carried out “two experimental blasts” on a beach in the city earlier but there was no discovery of material objects from the site.After planting two low-intensity bombs, the accused were said to have informed the district collector and media about them. Two people including a policeman were injured when one of the bombs went off. Initially, the case was investigated by the state police but later handed over to the NIA. The NIA said blasts were carried out by the accused to protest the denial of bail to the accused in a communal riot case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/acquittal-of-kerala-twin-blast-accused-nia-to-move-top-court-101643365744481.html

28-01-2022||India||Quota in promotions: SC rejects plea to do away with quantifiable data collection||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday turned down the Union government’s plea to do away with the requirement of collecting quantifiable data by the Centre and states to determine the representation of people belonging to Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) while implementing reservation in promotion.“State is obligated to collect quantifiable data as per the court’s judgment in M Nagaraj (2006) and Jarnail Singh (2018). Collection of data has to be for each category of posts for the entire service,” ruled a bench led by justice L Nageswara Rao.The bench, which also comprised justice BR Gavai, said the Central government must determine a time period to revisit the reservation policy after ascertaining the percentage of posts occupied by SCs/STs.“Review has to be conducted for inadequacy of representation for SC/STs. The period of review has to be a reasonable period and it is left to the government to decide this period,” said the court.It added that assessment on the inadequacy of representation of the reserved categories in promotional posts should be left to the states.The bench declared as bad in law a 2019 judgment by the Supreme Court in BK Pavitra–II, which upheld the validity of the 2018 Reservation Act that introduced consequential seniority for SC/STs in Karnataka public employment.The top court held that Pavitra-II was decided in breach of the constitution bench judgment in Nagaraj’s case in affirming the state’s policy on consequential seniority on the basis of cadre strength.In 2006, a Constitution bench’s ruling in the M Nagaraj case made it incumbent upon the state to collect quantifiable data showing inadequacy of representation of a section of people in public employment in addition to maintaining overall administrative efficiency. The aspect of quantifiable data was endorsed by another Constitution bench by its 2018 ruling in the Jarnail Singh case which also mandated the exclusion of the “creamy layer” before providing for reservation in promotions.The top court was hearing a batch of petitions arising out of judgments from 11 high courts, which delivered rulings on various pertinent reservation policies in the last 10 years. Some of the states from where these judgments arose included Maharashtra, Bihar, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Tripura, Madhya Pradesh, and Punjab.The Union government pressed for reservation in promotion proportionate to the population of SCs and STs as per a 1995 judgment by the top court in the RK Sabharwal case. Attorney General KK Venugopal argued that it should be left to the Centre and states to decide on promotional avenues for SCs and STs. He added there was a roster system in place in every cadre of the government departments to ascertain the posts required to be filled up by SCs/STs, and therefore the prerequisite of quantifiable data, as was laid down by two Constitution bench judgments of the apex court, should not remain.The roster system, the Centre submitted, was based on the proportionate population of SCs/STs, and had been working quite well in all government departments, and that the condition of collecting quantifiable data on the inadequacy of representation of SCs/STs may not be required at all.About the aspect of overall administrative efficiency, Venugopal said that government employees are promoted only on the basis of their ACRs (annual confidential reports) and that there is no need to lay down any additional criteria.When asked what should be a time period for the government to revisit the reservation policy after ascertaining the percentage of posts occupied by SCs/STs, Venugopal said that a periodic review should happen after every 10 years when a census is done.On the other hand, representing general category candidates, senior advocates Rajeev Dhavan, Meenakshi Arora, Gopal Sankaranarayan, and lawyer Kumar Parimal have contended that the reservation cannot be for an indefinite period and that it must stop as soon as the upper ceiling has been reached.They emphasised that reservation in promotion should be cadre-based only after quantifiable data is collected and the creamy layer has been excluded. Additionally, the general category candidates have said that posts meant for SCs/STs cannot be kept vacant indefinitely and should be filled up by other candidates after three years, as laid down in the M Nagaraj judgment.
28-01-2022||India||Defence export boost: India, Philippines to ink $375mn deal for BrahMos missiles||NEW DELHI: India’s BrahMos Aerospace and the Philippines are set to sign a deal on Friday for the Philippine Marines to acquire three batteries of the BrahMos cruise missile in a deal worth almost $375 million, people familiar with the matter said.The development will be a major shot in the arm for India’s efforts to become an exporter of defence hardware, and could pave the way for more Southeast Asian nations to acquire the missile jointly developed by India and Russia.The people cited above said the deal would be inked at an event to be held at the Philippines’ department of national defense in Quezon City. Philippine defence secretary Delfin Lorenzana will be among those attending the ceremony.Lorenzana said on January 14 he had signed the “notice of award” – or the acceptance of India’s proposal for supplying the missile – for the Philippine Navy’s shore-based anti-ship missile acquisition project.The defence deal will not go down well with China, whose aggressive behaviour in the disputed South China Sea has taken relations with the Philippines to a fresh low. The Philippine Marines intend to use the BrahMos as a shore-based anti-ship missile, and the South China Sea is one of the potential areas where the system could be deployed.The deal includes the delivery of three batteries, training for operators and maintainers and an integrated logistics support (ILS) package. The deal for the BrahMos was conceptualised as far back as 2017, and the office of the Philippines president approved its inclusion in the military’s “Horizon 2 Priority Projects” in 2020.Hindustan Times first reported in December 2019 that the Philippines was set to become the first country to buy the BrahMos missile system. Both sides were keen on signing the deal during a proposed visit by President Rodrigo Duterte early in 2021, but the plan fell through because of widespread disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.The notice of award signed by Lorenzana on December 31, 2021 put the value of the BrahMos deal at $374.962 million. Last month, the Philippines government allocated 2.8 billion pesos ($55.5 million) for initial funding for the weapon system.A team from the Philippine Navy visited the production unit of BrahMos Aerospace in Hyderabad in December as part of the acquisition process.Lorenzana has said the Coastal Defense Regiment of the Philippine Marines will be the primary user of “this modern strategic defense capability of the Armed Forces of the Philippines”.The BrahMos deal is being seen as a game changer as India’s defence exports so far have been items such as avionics, coastal surveillance systems, spares for radars, personal protective items, and offshore patrol vessels.The deal with the Philippines could open the door for further sales of the BrahMos – which has a range of 290 km and can carry a 200-kg warhead – to other Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia, which have been engaged in negotiations for the weapon system for several years.

Calling the resolution illegal, the top court said it was "beyond the powers of the assembly".The MLAs will now be entitled to all consequential benefits after the conclusion of the session in July, last year.The legislators were suspended for a year for allegedly misbehaving with the presiding officer in the Assembly. A batch of petitions were filed challenging the Maharashtra Assembly's resolution on July 5, 2021, suspending the BJP MLAs for a year over alleged disorderly behaviour in the House.Soon after the ruling, senior BJP leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis thanked the Supreme court in a seand said the ruling is another tight slap on the face of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress.“Since the beginning, we were saying that it was completely unconstitutional & gross misuse of power to suspend our MLAs for such a long period to create artificial majority & that too for no valid reason & the Hon SC has upheld our stand,” he said.(With inputs from bureau)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-quashes-indefinite-suspension-of-12-bjp-mlas-from-maharashtra-assembly-101643346483296.html

Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya has asked the National Expert Group to suggest ways on reopening the schools nationwide and work on the modalities, reported news agency ANI citing people familiar with the development."Covid-19 has affected children of all age groups. However, the mortality rate and severity of disease in children are negligible. Health experts believe that it is high time children return to schools," one of the people cited above said, as quoted by ANI.Physical classes have mostly remained shut since the Covid-19 outbreak in March 2020, with some states opening it partially amid widespread apprehensions among parents to send their unvaccinated kids to school. The Centre wants to reopen schools in a staggered manner after the Covid vaccination drive was opened up for children aged 15-17 amid the emergence of the highly contagious Omicron variant, reported ANI."However, it will be up to states to decide whether they are ready to open schools or not," ANI quoted a source as saying.Omicron likely to make vaccine update inevitableIndia rolled out its vaccination drive for healthcare and frontline workers on January 16, 2021, and gradually opened up for all adults. The next phase of vaccinating adolescents in the age group of 15-18 years started from January 3, 2022, a week before additional ‘precaution doses’ for healthcare, frontline workers, and at-risk groups kicked off. More than one crore Covid booster doses for the identified categories of beneficiaries have been administered so far.About 95% of the eligible population has been administered with the first dose of Covid-19, Mandaviya said on Thursday. As of Friday morning, India’s cumulative vaccination figure has crossed the 164.44 crore mark.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-likely-to-issue-advisory-on-reopening-of-schools-soon-report-101643342715265.html

28-01-2022||India||China hands over missing teen||Nine days after he went missing, Miram Taron, a teenager from Arunachal Pradesh was on Thursday handed over to the Indian Army by China’s Peoples’ Liberation Army, Union minister Kiren Rijiju said.Also Read | Missing boy from Arunachal found, China's PLA informs ArmyIn a series of tweets, Rijiju, the BJP MP who represents the Arunachal-West seat, thanked the Indian Army and said that due process, including medical examination of the young man, were ongoing. “The Chinese PLA handed over the young boy from Arunachal Pradesh Shri Miram Taron to Indian Army at Wacha-Damai interaction point in Arunachal Pradesh today,” said the minister for law and justice. “I thank our proud Indian Army for pursuing the case meticulously with PLA and safely securing our young boy back home. Due procedures are being followed including the medical examination,” he added.The Indian Army had earlier sought assistance from its Chinese counterpart after Miram Taron, a 17-year-old from Zido village in Upper Siang district, went missing near the LAC on January 18. Initially, the teen, was believed to have been abducted by the PLA when he and a few others had gone hunting in the bordering region. A tweet by BJP MP from Arunachal-East, Tapir Gao, alleging Taron was abducted from inside Indian territory.But Indian Army clarified on Thursday that it was not the case, and that he “inadvertently strayed and went missing”.“Today Indian Army took over Miram Taron at Border Personnel Meeting point at Damai across Kibithu Sector in Lohit district of Arunachal Pradesh after completing all the formalities.

28-01-2022||India||Marital rape case: Can’t fold hands and just sit back, says Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Thursday said that it cannot fold its hands and sit when people are approaching it with a problem in a particular legislation.The court’s remark came during an ongoing hearing on a batch of petitions seeking to decriminalise marital rape when an NGO argued that criminalising marital rape has a social impact which has to be decided by the legislature, and not by courts due to lack of their competence in the matter.Also Read | Marital rape hearing: Forced sex in marriage ‘abuse’ at best, NGO tells HCA bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and Hari Shankar, while hearing a bunch of pleas seeking to criminalise marital rape, said the argument by the NGO, Men’s Welfare Trust, is “vague” as the bench is examining the legal aspect of the problem and not the social or psychological impact.The court said that it can only “look into” the factors that have gone into the framing of a particular legislation, but ultimately the provision has to be tested on the anvil of the Constitution.“This argument is vague… It is a legal issue before us… Events have happened… Legislatures steps in frames an Act, Rules whatever is required. What goes into the framing of the legislation is something we can look at while looking at a provision or statute. But for us it is that provision that we are examining and testing it against the Constitution. That’s all to it,” justice Shakdher remarked.Also Read | ‘Half-hearted reply an injustice’: Centre asks time in marital rape hearingSaying that one of the petitioners is a live example where she has alleged abuse against her husband but could not proceed due to the exception in the rape law, the court remarked, “…Forget about the PIL, she says that she is not being able to proceed further because of the exception in Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code. So are we to tell her no we can’t examine whether you are right or wrong? We can’t…We need to examine it.”Exception 2 of Section 375 IPC decriminalises marital rape and mandates that sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age, is not rape.The court asserted that it is not saying that its decision will not have an impact, but when it has a matter, the same has to be decided against Article 14 and Article 21 of the Constitution.The bench is currently hearing PILs filed in 2015 by NGO RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association and two individuals who have sought to strike down the exception in the Indian rape laws on the grounds that it discriminated against married women who were sexually assaulted by their husbands.Earlier during the hearing, advocate J Sai Deepak, appearing for the NGO, said that the issue of criminalising marital rape should be kept out of the domain of the courts for the purposes of judicial legislation because the court is not in a position to accommodate or at least share multiple points of view for multiple reasons.“In any case, this is a matter which requires people who undertake gender studies to contribute to it,” he said.Justice Shakdher said, “How many years has this provision been there in the statute? There has to be a perspective and a sense of proportion. What do people do when they say that they are suffering, where do they go? That is in every legislation no? You can’t shut your doors no.”“If the argument has to be accepted, then we must fold our hands and say that this is the job of the legislature….we will do nothing,” the judge added.The matter will continue on Friday.
28-01-2022||India||‘Petty issues’: Conrad Sangma responds to criticism over Covid-19 protocol breach||SHILLONG: Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma, who has been hugely criticised for turning up at the state’s Republic Day function just five days after testing positive for coronavirus, on Thursday said he didn’t violate any Covid-19 protocol after testing positive on January 21.“I as CM have got full responsibility and know what to do. I’ve always followed protocol I’ve been somebody who’s always been careful. I can assure you I have not violated any protocol,” he told reporters soon after chairing a cabinet meeting in the state capital on Thursday.Conrad Sangma did not get into the details of the Covid-19 protocol. The union health ministry’s guidelines say: “Patient under home isolation will stand discharged and end isolation after at least 7 days have passed from testing positive and no fever for 3 successive days and they shall continue wearing masks.”Sangma tweeted on January 21 evening that he has tested positive for Covid-19. “I have tested positive for Covid-19. I am isolating myself for the required time. I have mild symptoms. All those who came into contact with me last few days are requested to observe their symptoms and test if necessary,” he said in a Twitter post.Meghalaya Raj Bhavan announced that governor Satyapal Malik, who tested positive for Covid-19 on January 20, will not attend the Republic Day function and cancelled the ‘At Home’ event.On January 26, Sangma, however, showed up as the chief guest at the state’s Republic Day function.Congress legislature party leader Ampareen Lyngdoh said it was “a big shock” to see Conrad Sangma at the function since he had announced his Covid positive status on January 21. “Public testing positive or those that will test positive in the future will be confused while following these instructions. Urgent clarification from the CM is important now so that protocols in place aren’t disrupted or flawed in this crucial time,” Lyngdoh said.Sangma, who turned 44 on Thursday, was upset about such criticism. He wondered why people were wasting their time on such a frivolous issue.“While we are talking about border issues, while we talk about important aspects like 50 years of statehood, it is really sad to see that some people are finding such petty issues to look at,” Sangma rued. He added: “For anybody to question my integrity and my commitment to the entire issue is quite sad and I think these people have nothing better to do. Over the last few days, I have been extremely responsible, that’s all I have to say.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petty-issues-says-conrad-sangma-on-criticism-that-he-violated-covid-protocol-101643316960008.html
28-01-2022||India||SC asks Centre, state for Tihar reforms deadline||The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Centre and the Delhi government to hold a meeting within a week and suggest timebound steps to plug security lapses at the Tihar jail where prison officials allegedly colluded with former Unitech promoters Sanjay and Ajay Chandra to help them carry out their illegal activities from within the jail.Also Read | SC orders probe into collusion of Tihar jail officials with Ex Unitech ownersAfter going through an affidavit submitted by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) that produced communications exchanged in this regard between the Centre, Delhi government and Tihar authorities, a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah said, “We are not interested in this paperwork. You should come up with corrective measures to ensure such incidents do not happen in future.”On August 26, the Supreme Court ordered shifting of the Chandra brothers to separate jails in Mumbai, and sought a report from Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana. The top cop proposed 23 actionable points to be carried out at Tihar jail.On October 6, the court directed the Centre to suggest corrective steps based on Asthana’s recommendations, which included call blocking, surveillance by CCTVs, changes in service roster of jail employees, and training of staff.Also Read | 28 Tihar officials suspended, 2 sacked, for helping ex-Unitech bossesHowever, unsatisfied with the progress made in the matter, the bench on Thursday directed the Union home secretary to chair a meeting with Delhi chief secretary and DG (Prisons), Tihar within a week where Delhi Police commissioner, who prepared the reform road map, shall be an invitee. “The meeting to be held within one week shall take concrete decision on the report of commissioner of Delhi Police and file a comprehensive affidavit on the manner in which implementation (of the report) is to be carried out,” the bench said, posting the matter after three weeks.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Madhavi Divan, appearing for the Centre, informed the court that the Centre endorsed each of the reforms contained in the report, but since prisons was a state subject, it could not impress upon the Delhi administration to implement the steps. She said that on December 7, Director General (Prisons) wrote to the Centre about steps taken under each of the 23 points suggested by Asthana.The court asked additional solicitor general (ASG) KM Nataraj, representing Delhi Police, on the progress on each step.

Tihar authorities say the jail is not our baby but of Delhi government.” Nobody represented Delhi government.The bench in its order said, “We are of the view that passing of buck between the MHA at the level of DG-Prisons and Delhi government must be dealt with by effective coordination.

We believe it can be destabilising. And we’re concerned by the People’s Republic of China’s attempt to intimidate its neighbours,” Psaki said.“We continue to support dialogue and peaceful resolution of these border disputes,” she said, adding, “We’ll continue to stand with our partners on that.”Referring to the China-India border issue, Wu stressed that the Chinese side believed that the last round of talks were positive and constructive.“…China will work closely with the Indian side to properly handle the border issue through negotiation and consultation,” Wu was quoted as saying by the official China Military Online website.Referring to the joint statement issued after the talks, Wu said the two sides agreed that they should follow the guidance provided by the leaders of the two countries and work for the resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest.“Second, the two sides agreed to consolidate the previous outcomes and take effective efforts to maintain the security and stability on the ground in the western sector including in winter,” Wu said.“Third, they agreed to stay in close contact and maintain dialogue via military and diplomatic channels and work out a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest,” he said, adding that the two sides also agreed that the next round of the Commanders’ talks should be held at the earliest.Indian and Chinese border troops have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border.Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the LAC in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquility in the border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-closely-work-with-india-to-handle-ongoing-border-tension-us-should-not-meddle-china-101643312699667.html
28-01-2022||India||Lok Sabha secretariat launches Digital Sansad app for ease of use, access to proceedings||New Delhi: The Lok Sabha secretariat has launched a new app, Digital Sansad, that will make it easier for people to follow proceedings in Parliament, and also their own lawmakers. In addition, it will also help members of parliament access services such as checking personal updates like status of their notices, House bulletins, etc. As MPs are barred from using laptops inside the House, the app comes handy for parliamentary information for MPs during a debate in the House. In future, the MPs can log in for attendance, give questions for the Question Hour or submit notices for debates or adjournment motions.The Digital Sansad app is available in both android and IOS platform and carries nearly all major content of the interlinked portal of Indian Parliament. A senior official claimed that the Digital Sansad is one of the few apps of a parliament internationally that offer a 360-degree view of legislative activities as well as services for members. It is a brainchild of Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla who has sought to make parliamentary proceedings more accessible to people.In addition to proceedings in the current House, people will also be able to access archival data related to all Lok Sabhas . They will be able to access speeches, debates, etc.“It is the task of a committed legislature to keep its constituents apprised of its routine proceedings. This objective has required the Parliament to keep its communication channels up-to-date with the rapidly changing technological landscape. In keeping with this view, the Parliament too started to expand its digital footprint. Parliament’s official ’Digital Sansad App’ is an initiative in that direction,” added a top functionary who asked not to be named.Aimed to be Indian Parliament digital interface with the younger generation, the app has already seen more than 8000 users from India and countries including the US and Saudi Arabia.The App, planned by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, will help people get all Parliamentary updates. “It becomes easier for citizens to access general information on MPs, on budget speeches since 1947, House discussions from 12th Lok Sabha to 17th Lok Sabha. The App will also contain the live telecast of Sansad proceedings, the major news of the day, etc. Apart from a virtual tour of the Parliament, the 2022 Budget session too can be watched live on the App,” said the functionary.The latest effort fits in with a larger digital plan which has seen a reduction in use of papers in Parliament . “Now members give notices mostly online. We have been able to cut down paper usage in parliament up to 98%. Important documents including the upcoming budget papers’ physical copies will be restricted and they can be accessed online,” said a top functionary.Opposition leaders, however, pointed out that Parliament should have gone completely digital and allowed online meeting of its House panels during the pandemic . Several appeals by Opposition lawmakers to allow digital meetings in past two years were not accepted.
28-01-2022||India||Govt, Oppn begin preparation for Budget session||New Delhi: The government and the Opposition have kicked off their preparations for the upcoming Budget session of Parliament with internal meetings and a series of consultations, after the previous session ended amid acrimony over the suspension of 12 lawmakers and the passage of some bills without debate. Congress president Sonia Gandhi will chair a meeting of the party’s parliamentary strategy group on Friday to will decide the broad plans for the session, including key issues to be raised and the nature of floor coordination with other opposition parties and allies. On January 31, the day the session is slated to begin, Union parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi has called an all-party meeting where the government would lay out its legislative plan, the bills in wants to clear in this session, and seek the Opposition’s support. The Budget session, slotted in two halves between January 31 and April 8, assumes significance coming in the backdrop of the elections in five states -- Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur. The political stakeholders of these polls, such as the BJP, Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, Akali Dal, and Trinamool Congress, might see an opportunity in this session for manoeuvring with an eye on these polls. Parliament’s winter session started with massive protests and daily disruptions after the Upper House suspended 12 Opposition MPs for their conduct on the last day of the monsoon session, and when the government cleared the bill to repeal three contentious farm laws without debate. Lawmakers were later working overtime to partially salvage the lost hours, but both sides continue to blame each other for the disruptions even after the session was called to a close. For the Congress, the larger issues in this session are effective floor coordination with like-minded parties, and rasing raging issues such as price rise, while it also struggles with internal dissent and with key leaders leaving the organisation to join the BJP or other rival parties. The Congress will also take a call in the meeting on what its equation is going to be with the Trinamool Congress after their recent spat over Goa elections, where the Congress refused to enter into a pact over the TMC’s ostensible attempts to emerge as a national force by poaching leaders from the grand old party.The session will start with the President’s address to the joint sitting of both Houses, and the Union Budget will be presented on February 1. The government is expected to push the personal data privacy bill, mediation bill, amendments to the wildlife act, and amendments to the cost and chartered accountants bills, apart from the Budget and the Finance Bill. The government, according to an official, may also bring the much-awaited bill to regulate cryptocurrency in India. The national anti-doping bill and the biological diversity amendment bill may also be cleared during the session.On Thursday, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee held a meeting with party MPs for the budget session. A senior TMC leader said, “She told us to protest against the proposed changes in the IAS rule that gives upper hand to the Centre in the matters of central deputation from a state. We will also question the schedule of the session that coincides with the election in five states. The party will also raise issues related to our state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-oppn-begin-preparation-for-budget-session-101643312099687.html
28-01-2022||India||Kerala high court acquits two in 2006 twin blasts case||In a setback to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the Kerala high court on Thursday acquitted two prime accused in 2006 Kozhikode (north Kerala) twin blasts. A trial court had sentenced the two, Thadiyantavida Nazeer and S Shafaz, to double life imprisonment in 2012.A division bench of Justices Vinod K Chandran and Ziyad Rahman also dismissed the plea of the NIA questioning the acquittal of two other accused, Abdul Haleem and Abubaker Yousef, in the case. Nazeer, once a reported protégé of jailed Muslim cleric Abdul Nassar Madani, later fell out with him and joined the Lakshar-e-Taiba and was the self-styled south Indian commander of the terror outfit. Allegedly involved in many cases, he was arrested from a village along the India-Bangladesh border in 2009.The twin blasts took place in Kozhikode on March 3, 2006 at a private bus stand and the state road transport corporation terminal. After planting two low-intensity bombs, the accused later informed the district collector and media houses about them. Two people, including a policeman, were injured when one of the bombs went off while searching for them. Initially the case was investigated by the state police but later handed over to the NIA. The NIA had charge-sheeted seven people in 2010 and one of the accused was later killed in an encounter with security forces in Jammu and Kashmir. Two accused are still at large.The Special Court for NIA Cases had found both Nazeer and Shafas guilty of the offences under various sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967 (UAPA) and they were sentenced to imprisonment for life.The court found that some of the corroborative evidences against accused were not strong and the prosecution failed to substantiate crime against them.“We do understand the inherent difficulty of an investigation, in a case taken over by the NIA, almost four years after the incident. The Investigating Officers were groping in the dark for almost four years, till the arrest of third accused (A3) in another blast case,” the Court observed.The court said it has dealt with each of the evidence tendered including the approver’s deposition as also the disclosure statements and the evidence of other witnesses to find that the case against A1 to A4 was not proved beyond reasonable doubt.“The Investigators, we cannot but say, did not make a concerted effort to ‘go out in the sun’ to collect independent evidence of whatever version the accused told them....”“In their anxiety to wrap up the case; we say anxiety since we do not think the Officers of the NIA would be ignorant of the law on the subject, they even recorded the confessions made by the accused, clearly inadmissible under Section 25 & 26 of the Evidence Act,” the court ruled.According to the prosecution, nine accused including Nazeer and Shafas were alleged to have conspired, planned and executed the twin blasts, for reason of bail having been denied to the accused in the second Marad incident (communal riot case), in which 136 of the 142 accused remained imprisoned, as undertrials, for about four and a half years.After the lower court verdict, both Nazeer and S Shafaz moved the high court saying that they were implicated by the NIA. Nazeer, undergoing jail in connection with Bengaluru stadium blast in Karnataka, appeared in person in the high court to argue his case.With PTI inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-acquits-two-in-2006-twin-blasts-case-101643311799705.html

The state also reported 11 deaths and added 57 previous undocumented deaths, taking total fatalities to 52,434. “Genome sequencing tests show 94 per cent cases are triggered by Omicron and 6 per cent by Delta variant. Among the new cases, only 3.6 per cent patients need hospitalisation and use of ICU dropped considerably,” said the minister in the state capital. “Unlike the second wave there is no pressure on hospital infrastructure this time. More than 90 per cent of the affected are confined to their homes and people with serious co-morbidities are getting hospitalised,” the minister said, adding that strict action will be taken against private hospitals if they turn away Covid patients. An analysis of the hospital statistics shows that during the peak of the second wave (May 2021), more than 80 per cent of total beds were occupied but this time it is below 30 per cent. Similarly more than 60 per cent of the oxygen beds were occupied during the second wave but this time it is below 20 per cent. “Though Omicron is more infectious, its intensity is low when compared to Delta. We found that many people are taking antibiotics across the counter and this is really bad. Affected people with simple fever can remain at their home and take enough water to check dehydration,” said the minister. Of the 51,739 fresh cases reported on Thursday, Ernakulam logged the highest (9,708), followed by Thiruvananthapuram (7,675) and Kozhikode (5,001). As the cases mounted, the government has asked local bodies to start community kitchen across the state. Since many families are getting affected completely, they face shortage of food forcing the government to start community kitchen, which was a hit during two earlier waves. The health department has also set up Covid war rooms in every district and a minister will be made in-charge to take speedy decisions. It also decided to ramp up Covid first-line treatment centres and seek the help of health volunteers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-detected-in-94-covid-cases-in-keralaminister-101643311620011.html

The cop in question, Baiju Paulose, was investigating the role of Dileep and his aides in a female actor’s abduction and sexual assault, which took place in 2017.The single bench of Justice P S Gopianthan ordered the crime branch that he should not be arrested till then and asked officials to submit details of the three-days of questioning of the actor and other accused. Meanwhile, the prosecution has sought more time from the court to examine digital evidences seized from the house of Dileep and others. He was questioned for over 33 hours from January 23 to 25. The other accused in the case are Dileep’s brother P Anoop, his brother-in-law T N Sooraj, his friends Baiju Chengamanad and K Appu. A fresh case was registered against them following the disclosure of film director Balachandra Kumar. Last month, Kumar had claimed that Dileep was in possession of the woman actor’s assault video and had tried to influence case witnesses. He also claimed to have met the main accused, Pulsar Suni, at Dileep’s residence in 2016. After Kumar’s revelations the Kerala government had approached the Supreme Court to extend the trial for six more months but the same was turned down by the court on Monday. Kumar also claimed that he was privy to a conversation — to eliminate the investigating officer — that allegedly took place at the actor’s house in Aluva in Ernakulam district. But Dileep dismissed the allegations saying Kumar was blackmailing him citing frivolous charges. Later, crime branch had registered a fresh case under Sections 116 (abetment of offence), 118 (concealing design to commit an offence), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). A leading woman actor was waylaid, kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a criminal gang in Kochi while she was returning home after a shooting assignment. Six months after the incident, Dileep was arrested in the case. Prosecution alleged that the attack was planned at the behest of Dileep to settle an old score with the woman.BLURB Prosecution has sought more time from the court to examine digital evidences seized from accused persons’ house||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-defers-actor-dileep-s-bail-plea-till-feb-2-gives-protection-from-arrest-101643311499399.html
28-01-2022||India||Visakhapatnam Steel Plant: 1 year on, privatisation makes no headway||The proposed privatisation of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), better known as Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), has made no headway, a year after the Centre made an announcement to that effect, even as the public sector steel giant, according to its management, has registered record turnover and is all set to make profits this financial year.It was on January 27 last year that the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) gave an in-principle approval for 100 per cent strategic disinvestment of government of India shareholding in the RINL along with management control by way of privatisation.A week later, department of investment and public asset management (DIPAM) secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey tweeted the decision of the CCEA to privatise RINL, as part of the Central government’s efforts to raise ₹1.75 lakh crore through strategic disinvestment of loss-making PSUs.“Former steel minister Dharmendra Pradhan and finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman, in their replies to the queries raised by Andhra Pradesh MPs in parliament, asserted that there is no question of going back on the privatisation of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. But there is little progress in that direction,” a senior official of the RINL said on the condition of anonymity.A few months ago, he said, the Central government had finalised multinational accounting firm Ernest and Young as its consultants to oversee the privatisation process, and prominent solicitors Chandhiok and Mahajan to look after legal issues. “Both the companies were selected through a competitive bidding process, but they are yet to commence the process,” the senior official said.The prime reason cited by the Centre for privatisation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant was the huge loss it was incurring over the years. The steel plant with a capacity of 6.3 million tonnes incurred a loss of ₹3,910 crore during 2019-20 and the revenue from operations was around ₹15,910 crore, according to the results announced by the management.Even as the Centre announced the privatisation process triggering protests by about 17,000 regular employees and workers, the company started earning profits. During 2020-21, the net loss of the company was reduced to ₹789 crore and the company achieved a sales turnover of ₹17,980 crore, a growth of 14 per cent over the previous year, according to the results disclosed by the management.“This was despite the fact that the steel plant was shut down for a couple of months and later with 50 per cent staff due to Covid-19. It only shows how strong the company is and how dedicated the workers are,” Ayodhya Ramu, a senior employee of the company and convener of Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Samithi (Committee to protect Vizag Steel), told HT.This financial year, the RINL achieved best-ever sales value of ₹19,357 crore in the first three quarters, ending December 31, according to the results declared. This is the highest during the nine months of a financial year for the company since its inception.“Going by this growth, we are expected to achieve the sales turnover of ₹28,500 crore by this financial year-end. The company is all set to achieve a net profit of ₹1,000 crore,” Ramu claimed.“The company’s lands and assets are worth over ₹1.50 lakh crore. But the government would not get even 25 per cent of it through privatisation,” he claimed.Ramu said this year alone, the company would be paying ₹5,000 crore to the government in the form of Goods and Services Tax. “Besides, the government would also indirectly get tax money from the employees. Where is the need to privatise it?” he asked.The Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Samithi is planning a series of agitations in the next one month to bring pressure on the Centre to drop the privatisation move. “We commenced our agitation on February 12 last year against the privatisation under this banner. To mark the completion of one year of our agitation, 365 employees would take up day-long hunger strike on February 12,” Ramu said.The committee would take up a signature campaign against the privatisation move. “We shall mobilise one crore signatures of the people across the state and send the same to the Centre. We are planning to storm the BJP offices all over the state on February 13 to register our protest. We have called for a statewide shutdown on February 23,” he said.

Counting of votes will be on February 22. Previously, actor Vijay had allowed his fans to use his picture during poll campaigning when they were contesting as independent candidates. “This time also he has permitted us to contest in the name of Thalapathy Vijay Makkal Iyakkam, use his picture and use the same association flag.We will contest as independent candidates again,” said Bussy Anand, general secretary of the outfit.Vijay, who enjoys a tremendous following in the state, has been hinting at his entry into politics for a decade now. In 2021, his fans entered the fray under the Thalapathy Vijay Makkal Iyakkam in the rural body polls held last October. They won 115 out of the 169 seats from where they contested—a 68% strike rate. Though the number is not big but in their debut election they managed to outdo actor Kamal Hassan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) and Seeman’s Naam Thamizhar Katchi (which emerged as the third largest party in the assembly elections) as they both drew a blank. The ruling DMK swept the rural body polls held in nine newly carved districts. The upcoming urban body polls will again see a fight between the two Dravidian majors-the DMK and AIADMK. Earlier this week, Vijay also received a relief from the Madras high court which expunged scathing remarks made against him by another single judge in the Rolls Royce case where he had sought exemption from paying entry tax. The actor paid the entry tax but had filed another petition seeking adverse comments against him to be expunged, which was granted this Tuesday.BLURB Vijay, who enjoys a tremendous following in the state, has been hinting at his entry into politics for a decade now.

But, fame was never a motivation for Sakine Ramachandraiah, instead devoting himself towards preserving the rich legacy and history of the tribal warlords was.Living in a remote tribal hamlet of Kunavaram of Manuguru block in Bhadradri Kothagudem district, Ramachandraiah, belongs to Doli subsect of Koya tribe.The 62-year-old Adivasi has the unique ability of singing the histories of the tribal warlords eloquently, in a typical style, using a percussion instrument called Dhol.“It is a dying art form of the Koya tribes. Ramachandraiah is perhaps the last Doli artiste who can perform this art. It is a pleasant surprise that the Centre has acknowledged the presence of this rare art and chosen Ramachandraiah for Padma Shri award,” said Jayadher Tirumala Rao, a researcher of tribal art forms, who played a major role in unearthing Ramachandraiah’s hidden talent.According to Rao, Dolis are a sort of priests for the Koya tribes.They attend the tribal rituals like marriages and funerals and perform rituals in the form of songs, carrying narration of their histories. “There are hardly any Dolis left among the Koya tribes now. And Ramachandraiah is the only one sustaining this culture,” he said.Ramachandraiah has mastered the art of singing about the history of the tribals, which are inscribed in the form of signs and pictures on ‘Pagide’ or ‘Dolu gudda’, a conic shaped red-coloured cloth of 6-10 metres in size.“These Pagides are preserved in tree burrows and are opened only on specific occasions. The Dolis narrate the history by looking at these Pagides and playing drum like musical instrument. They go into trance while narrating the genealogy of the tribes. It is a typical pahadi music,” Rao said.Ramachandraiah’s work came into limelight for the first time in 2014, when he narrated the history of Sammakka-Saralakka, two tribal women (mother and daughter) who fought against Kakatiya rulers in 13th century. “It became an instant hit. He has also popularized other ballads such as Boponamma Katha, Godi Kama Roaju Katba, Gooderoju Katha, Chekku Chedialamma Katha, Guli Musalamma katha,” said Rao, whohas recorded and documented Ramachandraiah’s oral narrative of Sammakka Saralamma history.While Ramachandraiah could not be contacted, his son Babu Rao said his father was not even aware of importance of Padma Shri initially. “When he realized that it was a rare honour given by the Centre, he was pleased. He wants the government to take steps to preserve such dying art forms,” Babu Rao said.

What kind of technology you (BBMP) are using? What procedure are you adopting to fill potholes? Why can’t it be for a longer duration by using better technology? Why after every rain these potholes erupt on every road in the city? That shows the quality of the work you are performing,” LiveLaw reported, attributing it to the judges.The observations come at a time when the Karnataka government and the BBMP have been criticised for spending thousands of crores of taxpayers money with no accountability.Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, during the monsoon session of the state legislature in September last year, had said that over ₹ 20,000 crores was spent by the administration on road-related works in Bengaluru over the last five years.The court observations come a day after Karnataka governor Thaawarchand Gehlot, in his Republic Day address on Wednesday, lauded the state government for its work to develop Bengaluru.Gehlot had said that several roads in Bengaluru have been taken up under the Smart City Project.“You cannot get away by saying that when the roads were constructed the load on the roads was less. Now you have to come out with solutions! Some method you have to come out with to ensure that roads bear the load,” the court observed.The next hearing for the case is scheduled for February 7.The Bommai government has been trying to increase allocations to Bengaluru to earn favour in the upcoming BBMP elections, expected to be held later this year.The BJP has been in power at the BBMP since 2010 but there has been no elected council for over one year now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/compliance-report-a-sham-karnataka-hc-pulls-up-bbmp-over-potholes-101643310479834.html

I had no expectations that they would speak to me. I was in the party because of Siddaramaiah,” Ibrahim said.He also said that he had huge financial debts which have accumulated over the last 25 years and had to take this time to leave the party and not get overwhelmed. Meanwhile, Siddaramaiah said that he will speak to Ibrahim and not to the media who were trying to rake up “controversies”. “Ibrahim is a senior leader. Earlier when the Congress government was there, he was a minister. When Siddaramaiah was there, he had removed a sitting MLA and got him (Ibrahim) a ticket. After he lost also, he was given Cabinet status and made planning commission chairman.

28-01-2022||India||Karnataka legislature joint session from Feb 14, Budget in March||Karnataka chief minister (CM) Basavaraj Bommai will present his first Budget in March first week, allowing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) just one year before the state heads for elections in 2023.“Joint session of the state legislature will be held from February 14 to 25 and the Budget session will be held in the first week of March,” Bommai said on Thursday. The sessions will be held at Vidhana Soudha, the seat of state legislature and secretariat in Bengaluru.The development comes a day before Bommai completed six tumultuous months in the top office. Bommai had inherited several challenges from his predecessor, BS Yediyurappa, who was forced to step down in July last year.During the Bommai regime in state, the BJP has witnessed it all, from the already existing divide within leaders to discontentment over Cabinet.The Covid-19 pandemic and consequent lockdowns only added to the saffron party’s burden by impacting the state’s once booming economic outlook and contributing to the apprehensions of job losses and lack of developmental works.The joint session of the legislature is also expected to take up the pending anti-conversion law which has been passed so far only by the Lower House, said an official privy to the developments.Later briefing reporters about the Cabinet meeting, law and parliamentary affairs minister J C Madhuswamy said, the joint session will begin with the governor’s address to members of both legislative assembly and council on the first day.The CM also said that he would release a booklet to highlight the achievements in the last six months.While Bommai faces external challenges as the head of the government, his bigger problems are from within his own party members who have aired their discontentment in public over being overlooked for the Cabinet and lack of funds for works in their respective constituencies.The Congress had also alleged that Bommai made discriminations while allocating the funds. “The very purpose of Congress is to make allegations. Let them recall what they did when they were in power,” he said.As of now, there are four vacant berths in the Cabinet and Bommai is yet to make a decision on the same as he awaits further instructions from the party high command which is focused on assembly elections in at least five states, including Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Goa.“Ours has been a responsive government. We have appropriately addressed any and every problem that we faced.The state will also be formulating more developmental programmes for the welfare of the people,” Bommai said. However, with news of more defections, aggravated dissent and a long list of corruption charges, including the multi-billion dollar Bitcoin scandal, Bommai faces an uphill task in the next one year in office, if he is not removed before it.The chief minister also aspires to be the face of the 2023 assembly elections but recent defeats in his home district (Hanagal bypolls) and a poor show in the December 10 MLC polls will not make things any easier for him. He now faces at least two more crucial tests, including the zilla and taluka panchayat as well the Bengaluru city corporation elections.With Agency Inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-legislature-joint-session-from-feb-14-budget-in-march-101643310361408.html
28-01-2022||India||Air pollution higher in Bengaluru than WHO standards: Report||A new global environment advocacy group report has indicated that all 10 air quality monitoring stations in Bengaluru have recorded pollution that is higher than World Health Organisation (WHO) standards, emphasizing the growing problem of pollution in the country’s technology capital.According to the Greenpeace report, titled ‘Are cities in South India breathing safe air?’, the situation in Bengaluru and other south Indian cities is alarming, and pollution is suspected to have claimed at least 12,000 lives in 2020.In September last year, WHO released a revised Global Air Quality Guidelines, announcing more stringent limits for six pollutant categories —particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO), HT reported. The WHO’s revised guidelines prescribe annual PM2.5 average at 5 ug/m3, bringing it down from 2005 limits set at 10 ug/m3. PM10 annual average is now 15 ug/m3 in comparison to the earlier norm of 20 ug/m3. NO2 levels, which are primarily attributable to vehicular emissions, have been revised to 10 ug/m3, in comparison to 40 ug/m3 in 2005.“The annual average values of PM 2.5 and PM 10 show that at all the locations, the values are higher than WHO revised standards. Apart from that, all the station’s PM 2.5 values are within the NAAQS (national ambient air quality standards of India) standards and eight stations PM 10 values are higher than NAAQS standards,” according to the report.With over 12 million population, Bengaluru has nearly 10 million vehicles that are squeezed in an area of around 800 square kms. The city gained global notoriety when it was adjudged to have the world’s worst traffic, according to a report by the Netherlands-based TomTom index in 2019, emerged top of the list by beating 415 other cities across 57 countries.“Bengaluru takes the top spot this year with drivers in the southern Indian city expecting to spend an average of 71% extra travel time stuck in traffic,” TomTom had said in its report.Bengaluru and Pune were included for the first time in 2019, while Mumbai and New Delhi became part of the study for the first time since 2017. Mumbai was top of the list for two preceding years, while New Delhi fell from second place in 2017 to fourth in 2018.Vehicular emission is the top contributor to air pollution, followed by construction in Bengaluru.“The data shows that lockdown is not a solution to air pollution. Relatively lesser economic activity and vehicles are also putting us in a dangerous position. We have to prioritize the immediate shift to clean energy and clean transport to stop more damage. If we look at Bengaluru’s PM10 data, the annual average in most stations is exceeding not only WHO guidelines, but NAAQS levels too,” Avinash Chanchal, Campaign Manager, Greenpeace India, said in a statement.The findings of the report come at a time when more and more people in cities are taking to private vehicles to mitigate the possibility of contracting Covid-19 in public transport.“In India, cities across the country are breathing polluted air. Air pollution is not limited to north Indian cities. GreenpeaceIndia’s report Airpocalypse IV highlighted that more than 80% of cities/towns had PM10 levels exceeding the 60µg/m3 limits for PM10 prescribed under National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by CPCB in 2018,” the report added.In November last year, the city air quality and pollution tracking service from IQAir, a Switzerland-based climate group that is also a technology partner of the United Nations Environmental Program, showed that there are as many as three cities (Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai) from India on the list of ten cities with the worst air quality indices.There are also concerns that there is a low number of monitoring stations in India that does not capture the true extent of the pollution. According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), State Pollution Control Boards and Pollution Control Committees are monitoring ambient air quality at 804 locations, covering 344 cities/towns in the country, whereas the requirement far exceeds that.The Greenpeace report added that despite the repeated lockdowns on account of the Covid pandemic, the annual average values of PM2.5 and PM10 of all studied ten south Indian cities exceed the WHO revised standards.State pollution control board officials could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-pollution-higher-in-bengaluru-than-who-standards-report-101643310180705.html
28-01-2022||India||Hijab row: NHRC issues notice to state, seeks response in a month||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has sought response of the Karnataka government in connection with the controversy over six students not being allowed to attend classes, at a government pre-university college in Udupi district, since the last one month for wearing a hijab. The Muslim girls have alleged that the institution has barred them from entering classrooms while wearing a hijab sincelast week of December 2021.The first-year students have also alleged that the institution is not allowing them to even meet their classmates on campus. On Wednesday, NHRC issued a notice to the state government and demanded a report within a month. The commission said the incident in Udupi “involves a grave violation of the human rights” of the students. The notice has been issued to the Udupi district magistrate and the principal secretary of the department of higher education. “Facts of the case are disturbing. The allegations made in the complaint are serious in nature involving ‘Right to Education’. The case, therefore, involves a grave violation of human rights of the victim students,” the notice read. The notice was issued based on a complaint lodged by Mohammad Riyazuddin, a resident of Kalaburagi district. Karnataka education minister BC Nagesh refuted the claims made in the complaint, saying the government has not violated any human rights. “We have not taken away any rights of the students. What we have told the students is to attend classes with the uniform code that has been followed so far. The School Development Management Committee has given the uniform code many years ago. 99% of the students in the college are following this rule and only six students don’t want to follow a rule, which they had followed for more than one and a half years,” the minister told reporterson Thursday. Local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Raghupathi Bhat, on Wednesday, reiterated that the students will not be allowed to enter classes with a hijab. Bhat, who is also the chairman of the School Development Management Committee of the Pre-University College, added that students will be allowed to attend classes only in online mode if they insist on wearing a hijab. “We will request the six students and their parents to desist from wearing hijab to the classrooms. If they do not agree, they can attend the classes online and take their examinations,” Bhat said. Discipline is mandatory in an educational institute, he said. “Parents must understand this and ask their children to follow the uniform code. We are not going to budge from our stand under any circumstance.” On Wednesday, the Karnataka government said an expert committee has been set up to resolve the controversy. The government said that all students at the college should adhere to the uniform rule till the committee decides on the issue. “If we yield to their demands here, this will begin in every other college. And then, in retaliation to this, saffron shawls and turbans will make it to the campus,” Bhat said, referring recent protest against hijab by some students backed by right-wing organisations, who wore saffron shawls to the college. “We have requested the community leaders to ensure that harmony is not disrupted in the district. They have assured me to hold a dialogue with the parents of the six students and revert in two days. The college principal will call the parents and request them to retract their stand on hijab,” Bhat added. On Thursday, the protesting students, however, reiterated that wearing a hijab is a right provided by the Constitution of India. “We are not committing any crime. We are not doing any indiscipline. We are just putting on a scarf, which is in the same colour as our college shawl. We are not covering our faces,” said one of the protesting students, requesting anonymity. Bhat said if the parents and students did not agree to remove the hijab, they can take admission in another private college. “Earlier, the agitating students have attended the classes without hijab for a good one and a half years. It’s just a matter of another one month. The classes will get over and examinations will be held. If they are stern on their hijab decision, they may consider attending the classes online. We will allow them to write the examination. Next year they can take admission in any other college of their choice but under no circumstance, we will allow them inside the classroom with hijab,” he said. “Why should we go to a different college? If a government college where the constitutional values should be upheld is doing this, you can imagine what will happen in a private college. Unity in diversity is taught in schools but it is not practised,” said one of the protesting students, requesting anonymity. 
28-01-2022||India||Former bureaucrats oppose proposed IAS rules changes||A group of former civil servants said on Thursday that the proposed amendments to the All India Service (AIS) cadre rules have not been thought through and are being rushed out without adequate federal consultation.The signatories, members of the Constitutional Conduct Group (CCG), issued a statement on Thursday that said, “The proposed set of amendments to the cadre rules of the three AIS are arbitrary, unreasonable and unconstitutional. They interfere with the basic structure of the Constitution of India as a Union of States and can cause irreparable damage to the one institution which Sardar Patel held as being the most critical to the unity of the country.”Also Read | IAS cadre issue: Enforce central deputation rulesThe proposed changes in rules pertain to deputation of civil servants from state cadres to the Centre. The Union government has claimed there is a shortfall in this deputation, which has meant vacancies in key positions in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) as well as the Indian Police Service (IPS). Most states are not meeting their Central Deputation Reserve, or CDR, the Union government has said.Among the amendments proposed is one that says the Centre will arrive at the number of officers on CDR in consultation with states; another proposes that in case of any difference of opinion between the Centre and the state, the latter will have to go with the decision of the former, and within a specified time; a third proposal states that the Centre could pick a specific officer from a state in public interest.The CCG on Thursday said if passed, there is a likelihood that states will consider the state civil services as more amenable to them and may treat AIS officers with suspicion and distrust.It also feared that the rules will allow greater scope for abuse of power by the Union government so that whenever it is unhappy with the state government, it can target AIS officers occupying strategic posts, such as chief secretary, home secretary, director general of police, principal chief conservator of forests, district magistrate, superintendent of police, among others. The Centre may then withdraw such officers from their posts and place them elsewhere, thereby effectively derailing the functioning of the state administrative apparatus, the CCG said.The rules have also been opposed to by at least 11 states, with most arguing that they would kill the federal compact. The 11 states opposing the changes are Rajasthan, Telangana, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Bihar and Karnataka.Also Read | 17 states respond to proposed amendments to IAS cadre rules, 11 not in favourThe CCG in its statement said that the proposed amendment to the Cadre Rules “fundamentally alters” the relationship of the political executive and the bureaucrats, and makes a mockery of the delicate federal balance that the AIS are designed to maintain.“The whole idea of the Centre not having a ‘cadre’ of its own but having to ‘borrow’ the services of an officer for specific periods at key senior management levels is destroyed if the State as a ‘lender’ has no authority on what it lends and on what terms and conditions, but the borrower, on the other hand, exercises superior rights over the lender. This is turning the federal arrangement upside down,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-bureaucrats-oppose-proposed-ias-rules-changes-101643309219576.html
28-01-2022||India||Covid cases plateauing but don’t lower guard: Govt||Coronavirus cases are plateauing in some regions of the country and the Omicron variant of Sars-Cov-2 is now dominant across the country, Union health ministry officials said on Thursday.They added that the Delta variant, which was predominant during the second wave of the pandemic in the country, is still circulating and urged people not to be complacent.Also, weekly case positivity may remain as high as about 18% nationally, officials said, adding that certain states were showing a positive trend of decline in weekly case positivity as well as new cases.“It is not that we are only getting cases of the Omicron variant; which means that the delta outbreak is not yet over, including in the Delhi-NCR region. It must be noted that the clinical severity or hospitalisations that we are seeing, can also be attributable to delta along with the omicron variant,” said SK Singh, director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), which is also the nodal centre for the Indian Sars-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG).Sharing the genome sequencing results for December and January, Singh said that the percentage of omicron shows significant growth in January (this year) as compared to the month of December (last year).In December, we got 1,292 omicron samples, and more than 17,000 delta and its sub-lineage variants. In January, if we see, we got 9,672 Omicron positives, which are roughly 75% of the samples sequenced in the month so far. The delta and AY series data show, it is 3,201 samples of AY series and 1,578 of delta.According to government data, Odisha, West Bengal and Maharashtra are largely reporting cases of the delta variant and its sub-lineages.“As for the sub-lineages of Omicron, namely BA.1 and BA.2, India earlier reported most cases infected with BA.1 among travellers, and the trend that we are getting now is that of gradual increase in cases of BA.2, that is being reported from within community,” Singh added.The country has not reported the third sub-lineage of omicron, BA.3, yet.As for hospitalisations and deaths, Singh said analysis so far showed most cases were of those who were either unvaccinated or were suffering from certain co-morbidities.“If we look at the recent Delhi data, nearly 64% deaths reported are due to the unvaccinated ones and the volume of those having co-morbidities is also significantly large, making this population group extremely high-risk,” said Singh.Experts also said people need to be cautious; adhere strictly to Covid appropriate behavior; and get vaccinated.“Getting a vaccine shot is important as it has been established that vaccines prevent severe disease and death related to Covid-19 to a large extent. There is a population group that is at-risk that needs to be extra careful. Hospitalisation rate may be lower, but there are patients that are landing in hospitals; therefore, all preventive measures needed to be taken strictly along with taking the vaccine,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonary department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.According to government data, 5% of the country’s eligible adult population is yet to take the first Covid-19 vaccine dose while 74% of the eligible population is fully vaccinated, according to the government data.As for Covid-19 spread, the number of districts reporting weekly case positivity of 5% and above during the week ending January 26 went up to 551, as compared to 527 districts reported in the earlier week.Eleven states are currently reporting at least 50,000 active cases; 14 states between 10,000 and 50,000; and 11 states have less than 10,000 cases.Top five states in terms of volume of active cases are Karnataka (2,67,679), Maharashtra (2,68,484), Kerala (1,69,109), Tamil Nadu (1,70,661), and Gujarat (90,726). Barring Maharashtra, all other states are showing an increase in overall case positivity.“We are in touch with these states; disease containment and management related activities are being discussed and action plan drafted accordingly,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare.However, certain states have also reported a decline in weekly positivity, and those include Maharashtra (from 23.7 to 23.3%), Uttar Pradesh (8.7 to 7.3%), Delhi (29.1 to 14.7%), Odisha (16.1 to 13%), Haryana (31 to 27%), and West Bengal (23.8 to 9.5%).There is also a declining trend observed in certain states; wherein not just weekly case positivity has gone down but there is also a decrease in the number of new cases that are being reported, which is a positive trend. These districts include Bengaluru (urban), Chennai, Gurugram, Thane, Lucknow, Mumbai, Khorda, and Gautam Buddh Nagar.“For there to be an overall decline, rural areas also have to be saturated; and that has not happened yet. It will take some time before it can be said that the third wave has ebbed,” said T Jacob John, former head, department of virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore (Tamil Nadu).
28-01-2022||India||India recorded 172% excess rain in Jan: IMD||It’s been a wet January across India: 172% excess rain over the country till January 27, with 183% excess rain over northwest India, 261% excess over central India, 154% over the southern peninsula, and 58% excess over northeast India.The reasons for the large excess were three active western disturbances (WDs), including two that came in quick succession, which affected northwest India between January 5 and 9 and then January 21 and 24.The disturbances originated over the North Atlantic Ocean before December 23 and moved eastwards towards the Indian Himalayas, although, in general, most of the western disturbances which affect India originate over the Caspian and Mediterranean seas.“The WDs between January 5 and 9 and January 21 and 24 brought widespread rains not just to northwest India but to central, east and northeast India also. Even parts of peninsular India including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rayalseema, Tamil Nadu got widespread rains between January 11 and 14 as the system travelled south. It’s uncommon for WDs to have such widespread impact, they were very intense and had features of polar systems because they originated over the North Atlantic Ocean. The WD between January 21 and 24 was so intense that it remained as a well-marked low over the land,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre at IMD.Widespread and heavy rain and snowfall over the hills and plains also led to markedly low day and night temperatures over most parts of the country including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, and Odisha. “Both the rainfall and low temperatures are linked to these WDs that affected northwest India and travelled to central India. There was advection of very cold air from the upper reaches of Himalayas which is leading to below normal day and night temperatures in Mumbai, Pune and other parts of Maharashtra also. There was advection of cold wind from north to south. Additionally, there was a cloud cover which was obstructing sunshine over northwest India leading to record low day temperatures over Delhi,” explained DS Pai, who heads the climate research and services at IMD, Pune.A fresh feeble western disturbance is very likely to affect the Western Himalayan region from January 29 and another western disturbance is likely to affect northwest India from February 2.Under the influence of the fresh western disturbance, light isolated rainfall/snowfall is likely over Jammu-Kashmir-Ladakh-Gilgit-Baltistan-Muzaffarabad from Saturday to Monday. Under the influence of another western disturbance, scattered to fairly widespread rainfall or snowfall is likely over Western Himalayan region and light isolated rainfall over adjoining plains from February 2 to 4.There is likely to be a gradual rise in minimum temperatures over northwest India by 2-3 degree C thereafter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-recorded-172-excess-rain-in-janimd-101643308619073.html
28-01-2022||India||MHA to states/UTs: Impose, lift local curbs based on Covid case positivity and hospitalisation status||The Central government on Thursday extended the Covid-19 guidelines across the country till February 28 and asked states/UTs to lift or impose local curbs on the basis of Covid-19 positivity and hospitalisation. Issuing an order under the Disaster Management Act, union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said the guidelines issued on December 27, 2021, to ensure compliance to the normative framework for taking evidence based Covid-19 containment measures at district/local level will remain in force till end of February. Bhalla separately wrote to the chief secretaries of states/UTs asking them to issue necessary directions to districts and local authorities concerned to take measures for prompt and effective management of Covid-19, strict compliance of various advisories issued by the central health ministry and strict enforcement of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour . “Due to the current Covid wave, led by the new variant – Omicron, there has been a steady increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country and the active cases have increased to over 22 lakhs. Though a majority of active cases are recovering fast and a low percentage of cases are in hospitals, it is still a matter of concern that 407 districts in 34 states and UTs are reporting a positivity rate of more than 10%”, Bhalla’s letter read. Therefore, he added, looking at the current trends of Covid virus, there is a need to exercise caution and vigilance. The home secretary said that “In this background, I would like to reiterate that all the states/UTs must observe all precautions and not let the guard down.” He asked the authorities to continue to take prompt and appropriate action. “Imposition and lifting of local curbs should be dynamic and should be based on case positivity and hospitalization status at the local level”. The ministry has also told the states to focus on the five-fold strategy of Test-Track-Treat-Vaccination and adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour to avoid any surge in Covid-19 cases, especially keeping in view Omicron. The government has already clarified through previous orders that any person violating the guidelines will be “liable to be proceeded against as per the provisions of Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, besides legal action under Section 188 of CrPC, and other legal provisions, as applicable.” India reported 2,86,384 new Covid-19 cases and 573 deaths in the last 24 hours, according to the Union health ministry bulletin on Thursday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-to-states-uts-impose-lift-local-curbs-based-on-covid-case-positivity-and-hospitalisation-status-101643308559206.html
28-01-2022||India||Number Theory | Protests over railway jobs are a grim reminder of the state of India’s job market||The protests over problems with recruitment for railway jobs in the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, may well be India’s first large-scale unemployment riots. The protests have taken place across a large number of places in these two states. News reports suggest that at least 10 million applicants were hoping to get the roughly 40,000 jobs which were on offer. The politics on the protests notwithstanding – opposition parties have attacked the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over both the issue and police’s handling of it – they ought to be treated as a bellwether for the socio-economic unrest which India’s job markets can generate. Here are four charts which put this in perspective.India has among the worst labour market outcomes for young peopleAn international comparison of some of India’s peers and neighbours using World Bank data shows that India has among the worst labour market outcomes for the young (the 15-24-year-old population). This can be seen in persistence of high youth unemployment rates despite a very low labour force participation rate (LPFR) among this cohort. LPFR is defined as the share of economically active population – either working or looking for a job – in the given age group. This number was just 27.1% for the 15-24-year-old population in India, which is significantly lower than other countries. Despite such a low LFPR, youth unemployment rate is among the highest in India. Unemployment rate is defined as the share of unemployed persons in the labour force. A time-series analysis shows that things have become worse on this front in India in the last 15 years. The mismatch between education and employability has made matters worseThe mismatch between educational levels and employability has long been a running refrain in Indian labour markets. Statistics from the 2018-19 Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) (the 2019-20 PLFS includes three quarters of pre-pandemic data and one quarter of the harshest lockdown, which does not reflect either the pre-pandemic situation or the post-pandemic one completely) underline the centrality of this problem, which is likely to have become worse since the pandemic. While enrollment levels, both in school and higher education, have been rising in India, this education has not given any special labour market skills to most young Indians.In fact, one could make the counter-intuitive claim that higher education (of the kind which has been given) has actually harmed the job prospects of the young population because they are averse to taking up blue collar jobs and cannot find the kind of jobs they want. This is best seen in the fact that unemployment rate actually increases with education level. In the 15-29 age group the unemployment rate for the most educated is twice the value for all age groups. The reason there is a large demand for low-end government jobs in India is that their qualification and testing criterion are often set at general educational levels such as a higher secondary or graduate degree.
28-01-2022||India||Covishield, Covaxin get conditional market nod||The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), India’s pharmaceuticals regulator, granted a conditional market authorisation for Covishield and Covaxin, the two coronavirus vaccines widely used in the country, officials said on Thursday.The approval is an upgrade from the emergency use authorisation and largely represents a regulatory endorsement of the safety doses, which are now classified at par with pharmaceutical and biological products that take years of vetting to authorise.Also Read | Panel pitches full market nod for Covaxin, CovishieldThe development will not make a difference on the availability of doses just yet.“The @CDSCO_INDIA_INF has now upgraded the permission for Covaxin and Covishield from restricted use in emergency situations to normal new drug permission in the adult population with certain conditions,” announced the Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Twitter soon after the approval was granted. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), India’s pharmaceuticals regulator, granted a conditional market authorisation for Covishield and Covaxin, the two coronavirus vaccines widely used in the country, officials said on Thursday.The approval is an upgrade from the emergency use authorisation and largely represents a regulatory endorsement of the safety doses, which are now classified at par with pharmaceutical and biological products that take years of vetting to authorise.The development will not make a difference on the availability of doses just yet.“The @CDSCO_INDIA_INF has now upgraded the permission for Covaxin and Covishield from restricted use in emergency situations to normal new drug permission in the adult population with certain conditions,” announced the Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Twitter soon after the approval was granted.|#+|A person aware of the decision said the approval does not mean the vaccines can be sold over-the-counter by pharmacies, in the way that fully approved doses are. “Conditional access does not permit that; in fact, people wanting to take the shot will still have to approach a covid vaccination centre. Pharmacies will not be able to stock it just yet,” said this person, a senior government official, asking not be to named.“Regular market authorisation may be granted later on probably once the entire eligible population is covered; for now, however, the sale and administration of doses will be closely monitored through the government system,” this person added.One of the ways in which the access to these doses will continue to be how it has been is due to the condition that these doses will need to be delivered under the Co-WIN vaccine management system.The health ministry said there authorisation was based on three preconditions: “firm shall submit data of overseas ongoing clinical trials of the product with due analysis on six monthly basis or as and when available, whichever is earlier; the vaccine shall be supplied for programmatic setting and all vaccinations done within the country to be recorded on Co-WIN platform; and Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI), Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) shall continue to be monitored. The firm shall submit the safety data including AEFI and AESI with due analysis on six monthly basis or as and when available, whichever is earlier as per NDCT Rules, 2019.”The vaccine will therefore continue to be supplied only through the vaccination programme, and the conditions on eligibility and timing of doses will continue to be as per the Co-WIN enforced policy. For instance, people under the age of 60 cannot take a booster, or “precaution” dose, unless they are in an at-risk job having completed nine months since their primacy vaccination.As on Thursday, over 1.4 billion doses of Covishield and 229 million doses of Covaxin have been administered.The key change will be for vaccine makers, who were previously required to submit to the drugs regulator rolling data from their clinical trial and adverse events during real-world vaccination follow-ups every 15 days. Now, they need to submit this data every six months. The conditions, however, will apply only for use of these vaccines within India.“Conditional Market Authorisation is a new category of market authorisation that has emerged during the current global pandemic of Covid-19. The approval pathways through this route are fast-tracked with certain conditions to enhance the access to certain pharmaceuticals for meeting the emerging needs of drugs or vaccines,” said the health ministry statement cited above.Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare, explained during the Covid media briefing that the vaccines will still have to be administered under the government programme.“From monitoring point of view, it is pertinent to track each dose that’s being administered through the Co-WIN platform; and both AEFI and AESI data to be submitted after every six months to the national drugs controller,” he said.Commenting on receiving the conditional market authorisation, Adar Poonawalla, chief executive of Serum Institute of India, which makes Covishield, said: “We are delighted to receive the Conditional Market Authorisation for Covishield from the DCGI. With this, our focus should be to reduce the gap between the 2nd and the 3rd dose to six months, as it is done globally. Our objective must be to get the population fully vaccinated to curb the spread of the pandemic.”
28-01-2022||India||Omicron likely to make vaccine update inevitable||The evolution of the Sars-CoV-2 into the Omicron variant appears to represent a turning point long expected by scientists: coronavirus vaccines will need to be updated. The most significant endorsement of this understanding came after a meeting on January 12 when a coalition of medical regulators from 37 countries and regions (including all of EU, UK, US and India) agreed that there was now a need to reconsider the current vaccine design. In a statement after the meeting, the International Coalition of Medical Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA) along with the World Health Organization (WHO) urged the scientific community to begin exploring what are called multivalent or bivalent vaccines, which in other words refers to shots that are designed on the basis of not one but two or more configurations of the virus.The evidenceThere are several studies but they can largely be whittled down to observations in two settings: the lab and the real-world. Lab results from early on in the Omicron outbreak have shown that the antibody response from two shots is almost completely sidestepped by the new variant. A more detailed analysis of why there is such a drop in the ability of antibodies from a primary vaccination course was published this week after peer-review in the journal Cell. Carried out by researchers from La Jolla Institute it found that memory B cells, which churn out antibodies, could recognise only 42% of the heavily mutated virus.And this has been borne out in real world data: in its latest variant surveillance report, the UK Health Security Agency last Friday said protection from symptomatic infection drops to 18-20%. Booster doses helped lift this protection to 65-70%, but even that begins to fall, reaching just under 50% teen weeks after a third shot.The WHO has set 50% as the floor for effectiveness against symptomatic disease for a successful vaccine – a bar that all shots clear when it comes to the ancestral virus that spread of Wuhan. But variants mean that bar has become tougher to reach.What about current doses?They are still extremely effective against severe disease or death. For instance, the UKHSA data showed that even when they had just 18-20% against illness, they offered a much higher 65% protection against needing to visit a hospital. This rose to 92% right after a booster dose of the current vaccine.The LA Jolla study explains why this happens. T cells, which root out the virus from the body after an infection, retain up to 85% of their ability even against the Omicron variant. In other variants, even if current vaccines don’t stop an infection as well, they are significantly more capable in protecting against the worst of Covid-19.What next?Israel is now among the first nations to roll out a second booster shot – a fourth dose – to combat the erosion in protection by the Omicron variant. The ICMRA said repeated boosters are not a feasible approach and vaccine makers should begin work on multivalent or bivalent doses.What strengthens the ICMRA’s position is not only evidence like the waning of boosters even after 10 weeks, but also the signs that Omicron’s further evolution may offer. The mutant is, expectedly, evolving into offshoots like the BA.2. Although it is not a concern yet, it is under investigation and underscores the inevitability of more mutations that could further erode the efficacy of current vaccines.The good news is that vaccine makers have been testing multivalent and bivalent vaccines since last year. Moderna has developed and is testing the mRNA 1273.211 – a combination of its original vaccine and one designed on the Beta variant – and the mRNA 1273.213, which is based on the Beta and Delta variants. Similarly, Pfizer-BioNTech is testing the BNT162b2 (B.1.1.7 + B.1.617.2), which is based on the Alpha and Delta variants. Both companies are also working on Omicron-specific shots.Omicron may finally be too far removed from the evolutionary path that other variants followed, necessitating a new design for vaccines, which till now were almost as good against most variants as they were against the Wuhan-origin virus.

28-01-2022||Today's||What to expect from this year’s Union Budget||When the finance minister (FM) stands up in Parliament to present her second pandemic-era budget on February 1, the lingering effects of the Omicron wave would be in her mind, but she will also have to focus on the economy beyond the pandemic. The perennial dilemma of the budget — between spending to stimulate growth and maintaining fiscal discipline — is more accentuated in a year such as this when economic recovery has been uneven and the fiscal situation, precarious. However, energising medium-term growth drivers is equally important and the budget could pleasantly surprise us if it emphasises this aspect.
28-01-2022||Today's||Budget: A pit stop in the economy’s marathon||What should one expect from the Union budget? The answer can depend on one’s interests. Bond markets will keep a keen watch on the level of the deficit, which, in turn, will determine the central government’s market borrowing. State governments will be hoping that the Centre devolves a greater share of its revenues to them. The poor will hope that their welfare endowments are expanded, or at least, maintained at current levels. Industrialists will hope that they get new incentives such as tax holidays or lower tariffs on items that they use or produce. But where does the interest of the overall economy lie?The forthcoming budget is more important than its predecessor. This is because we now have greater clarity on the pandemic and its possible impact on the economy than we did a year ago. India is inching towards its goal of full vaccination. Every successive wave of the pandemic — if we assume there could be more — has been managed relatively better in terms of disruption of regular economic activities.The challenge is not to worry about what may happen if there is a sudden new wave. It is also not about facing another year of economic contraction. It is more about putting the economy on a sustainable but reasonably high-growth path once again. There is good reason to believe that this will not be an easy task. The International Monetary Fund, for example, slashed India’s potential growth rate (or the rate at which it can sustainably grow in the long-term) by 25 basis points — one basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point — to 6% in October 2021 (to be sure, it expects the economy to grow by 9% both this year and next). So, how can the budget help in this pursuit? Three things are worth paying attention to and they are best described by using the analogy of a long-distance race.One, steroids can help, but they are not enough. Expecting the budget to have a radical effect on the economy via the spending route is like expecting someone to cut a mountain with a chisel. The size of the Union budget has been declining steadily, partly a reflection of the government’s shrinking footprint in the economy. To be sure, the share has increased in the last couple of years, but it is primarily an effect of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) being lower than normal.Even the prevailing talk about the budget giving a boost to capital spending does not entail a big boost to the overall investment spending in the economy. While it is important that the budget does not press too hard on the paddle of fiscal consolidation, it is also unrealistic to hope that an increase in budgetary spending can, in the absence of other interventions, take care of the growth challenge.Two, the promise of building better tracks and training facilities in the future will not help runners in a race they are running at the moment. The Narendra Modi government’s aggressive push for building cutting-edge infrastructure can be considered as something similar. Lack of connectivity, logistical bottlenecks and associated economic costs are often cited as important impediments to the proliferation of large-scale manufacturing in India, especially in the relatively non-developed regions. But the economy’s loss of momentum will also erode its ability to exploit better facilities being built for the future (via destruction of what could be potential domestic demand). The government’s infrastructure push is not wrong (and is actually welcome), but it is also not going to help the problem at hand.Three, it is important to acknowledge that the Indian economy is not a homogenous entity. Continuing with the running analogy, in a relay, where team members show great variation – much like the differences between the capital-intensive formal sector and the labour-intensive, subsistence-level informal sector -- a focus on one runner at the cost of the other will not help. Where the current government as the team manager seems to have erred is that it seems to have started believing that it can win by focusing all its attention on the formal sector. In doing so, it has taken away resources, or made life difficult for the non-attractive and relatively poor performing team member (the informal sector).What should the budget do?The current government has pursued an aggressive policy of economic formalisation, thinking this will automatically boost India’s growth prospects. However, the experience since 2017-18 should disabuse us of such notions.Such an approach, as is evident, makes it a difficult race to win, no matter how good the performance of the manager’s favourite player is. This is where the budget and economic policy, in general, ought to recalibrate its focus.One could, of course, ask, why can’t the manager lose this race (sacrifice short-term growth) and focus on winning future races by dropping the non-performer (the informal sector) from the team? This option, however, if exercised within a democratic framework, will be tantamount to political suicide.The views expressed are personal
