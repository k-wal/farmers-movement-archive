Moreover, a proposal for a new police station in the areas with large student population will also be forwarded soon to the police headquarters,” the SSP added.Ishwar Sharan and Annie Beasant police outposts had a post of a sub inspector as in-charge and four police constables each since several decades. However, the number of population and students has increased in the area multiple times during last many years.It was almost impossible to control such large number of students with few policemen at the two outposts. Police was unaware of the protests launched by students against unemployment late night around ten days back and was seen helpless when youths came out in large numbers to protest against alleged anomalies in RRB examinations. After the protests, ADG (zone) Prem Prakash, IG (range) Rakesh Singh and SSP Ajay Kumar reviewed the security arrangements which revealed that lack of force resulted in poor handling of the situation during protests.On the instructions of senior officials, three sub inspectors and 20 constables have now been deployed at Ishwar Sharan and Annie Beasant police outposts.SSP said with the objective of maintaining peace and security, number of policemen at Colonelganj police station has been deputed on special duty. They will be deployed at different police outposts in the area as per requirements. Proposal for establishment of a new police station at Baghada where students reside in large numbers is also underway, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/post-student-violence-now-more-cops-at-two-key-police-outposts-in-up-s-prayagraj-101643653713594.html

In fact, the state has again reported a double-digit growth in terms of number of road crashes, deaths and persons injured in 2021.The transport department’s latest statistical report on road accidents in Uttar Pradesh reveals that an alarming number of persons, 21,227 to be precise, were killed and 24,897 injured in 37,729 cases of road accidents in the state between January 2021 and December 2021.Compared to 2020, there is an increase of 10.2% in the number of road mishaps, 10.9% in the number deaths and 11.1% in the number of people injured. According to the same report, some 19,149 people died and 22,410 were injured in 34,243 cases of road mishaps in UP in 2020.The report further shows that only 10 of the 75 districts registered a negative growth in the number of deaths caused by road crashes. For a change, the decline was reported to be sharp in Lucknow where the number of deaths declined from 483 in 2020 to 261 in 2021, the decrease being as high as 46%.Other nine districts showing negative growth are Banda (3.6%), Balia (-0.9%), Rampur (-0.8%), Bulandshahr (-2.4%), Hapur (-0.5%), Jaluan (-11.8%), Aligarh (-0.6%), Deoria (-8.8%) and Balrampur (-1.1%).However, all the remaining 65 districts registered positive growth and some of them were as high as more than 50% over the previous year. Among the districts where the increase was found to be very sharp and close to or above 50% were Hamirpur ( 62.7%), Sonbhadra (51%), Siddharthnagar (51%), Shrawasti (50%), Bhadohi (49.5%) and Chitrakoot (49.4%). In absolute terms, the highest number of deaths due to road accidents in 2021 were reported from Kanpur Nagar (598) followed by Agra (549), Prayagraj (535), Unnao (515), Aligarh (503) and Hardoi (502).“This year’s figures pertaining to road accidents and deaths are alarming considering the fact that the Central and the state governments are making big efforts to bring the growth in deaths to single digit,” a senior transport official said.The situation, he said was comparatively better in 2020 that saw 15.48% decline in number of deaths, and barring half a dozen districts, all other districts reported a decline from 2019. “However, the situation was better in 2020 largely because of the negligible or fewer number of vehicles on the roads due to the lockdown in the state in April and May,” the official pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/road-accidents-in-up-mishaps-tell-a-gory-tale-with-21-227-deaths-24-897-injured-in-2021-101643653594510.html
31-01-2022||Mumbai||Administrators to take over local bodies with March term-end||Mumbai: The five-year term of many elected bodies in the state, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is expected to end in the second and third weeks of March, as a result of which administrators will take charge of at least eight municipal corporations and 25 district councils, for six to eight weeks, till the elections are held.The mayor and other office bearers will not be able to take any administrative or financial decisions once the tenure of elected body ends. The municipal commissioners will be vested with the power till fresh elections are held.The delay is due to the demarcation of boundaries where new wards have been added in these local bodies. The State Election Commission (SEC) announced the schedule for 14 municipal corporations to complete the process of forming new wards and demarcating boundaries on January 28; a schedule for a similar exercise in 27 district councils is imminent.Besides BMC, the municipal corporations of Thane, Pune, Ulhasnagar, Nagpur and Nashik are among the 14 bodies.“The schedule for the formation of wards has been announced for the corporations. Simultaneously we are expecting the delimitation of wards for district councils and panchayat samitis to be completed. Elections will be announced once all processes including publishing of the voters’ lists and drawing of lots for reservation are complete. We will have to take classes X and XII exams, local festivals and availability of manpower and security into account while holding the polls. We may consider holding the elections in rural and urban parts separately,” said Kiran Kurundkar, secretary SEC said.“After the finalisation of the wards, the draws for the reservation and publishing of electoral rolls may take another two to three weeks. Once it is completed by March-end, elections are expected to be held in April and May. The five-year terms of eight municipal corporations end between March 3 and 13 while the terms of 25 district councils end on March 20. This means administrators will be appointed to these bodies till the election process is complete,” an SEC official said.The process of finalisation of wards is expected to be completed by the second week of March. Electoral wards in urban or rural local bodies are increased due to an increase in the population of the entire city/district or a part of the city/district The state government projected a rise in the population in 10 years and accordingly chose to increase the number of wards in these corporations and district councils.The SEC, which conducts local body elections, will notify elections to 15 municipal corporations and 27 district councils in April, SEC officials said.A second official of the SEC said that they would have to take the Supreme Court’s decision on political reservation for Other Backward Class (OBC) candidates into consideration. The top court struck down OBC reservation in local body polls till the state conducts fresh empirical survey to ascertain the exact nature of the backwardness and determine the quantum of reservation accordingly.Polls to 15 civic bodies, 27 district councils, 280 panchayat samitis, 209 municipalities are due. Since more than 60% local bodies are facing the polls, these elections are being referred to as “mini assembly polls” as the performance of all political parties will be up for scrutiny.

Reacting to over one crore postcards received from children from across India and abroad, the PM said, “These postcards provide a glimpse of the broad and comprehensive outlook of our generation for the country’s future.” While sharing views from select postcards, the PM specifically mentioned Navya Verma, a Class 8 student of Patanjali Rishikul, Prayagraj. Navya wrote: “Mera Bharat ka ek sapna hai, jahan 2047 mein sabhi ko samman purvak jeevan mile, jahan kisan samradh ho aur desh mein bhrastachar na ho. (I have a dream of India in 2047, where all citizens will lead honourable and peaceful lives, farmers would be prosperous, and the country would be corruption free).” More than 1.5 crore students from all CBSE schools, including Kendriya Vidyalayas, Navodaya Vidyalayas and various state education boards across the country and 250 CBSE schools in 26 countries abroad participated in this postcard writing campaign. Students had to write a postcard drawing the attention of the PM on any of the two topics: ‘Unsung Heroes of Freedom Struggle’ and ‘My Vision for India in 2047’. It was under this campaign that the postcard, written by Navya Verma, was selected among the 75 best ideas from across the country. Modi will felicitate and encourage these select children at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi, soon where Navya will get an opportunity to interact with him, shared Nityanand Singh, principal of Patanjali Rishikul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pm-modi-mentions-sangam-city-girl-s-postcard-in-mann-ki-baat-101643652813997.html

In the previous assembly polls, the voting percentage in Lucknow remained between 55 and 57 per cent.

In the meeting, it was resolved that schools will play an important role in increasing voting percentage in the state capital. In a press release, the Lucknow DM said it was heartening that private schools’ association had come forward to play a constructive role in taking voting percentage to cross 90%. He said the schools had pledged to support voter awareness drive by convincing students to motivate their family members and relatives to exercise their franchise in this election. “This time we are targeting the areas having apartments and multi-storeyed buildings where polling percentage generally remains low,” he added. “Our schools will now play an important role in the ongoing voter awareness drive of the district administration this time by encouraging children to motivate their parents and relatives so that voting percentage goes beyond 90%,” said Jagdish Gandhi, founder manager, City Montessori School, Lucknow.“After a discussion among the managers of private schools, it was unanimously decided that through our students, their parents and people above 18 years of age would be motivated to vote.

31-01-2022||Lucknow||Time to defeat those who opposed Covid vaccine: UP CM Yogi||Taking a dig at the Samajwadi Party (SP) ahead of UP assembly polls, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said the time had come to ensure that those who played with the lives of the common man during the pandemic by spreading misinformation about life saving Covid vaccines lose deposits. He also said that the previous regime promoted riots and their “topi” (cap) was stained with the blood of innocent youths and farmers killed during the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. “Jo log vaccine ka virodh kar rahe the, vaccine ke naam par gumrah kar rahe the, unki jamanat zabt karne ka samay aa gaya hai” (Time has come to ensure that those who were opposing and spreading misinformation about the Covid vaccine lose their deposits),” he said while addressing a gathering in Anwalkheda area in Etmadpur assembly segment of Agra district a couple of hours after SP president Akhilesh Yadav filed his nomination papers from Karhal seat of Mainpuri. Yogi was in Agra for a daylong campaign at three rural assembly seats of Agra district and addressed gathering in Kirawali in Fatehpur Sikri assembly seat followed by a speech at Shamshabad in Fatehabad assembly segment before he concluded after addressing another gathering at Anwalkheda in Etmadpur assembly segment. “The previous SP regime wanted to build a museum in the name of Aurangzeb in Agra but we said a museum can only be built in Chhatrapati Shivaji’s name. Today, the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh is building a museum in Shivaji’s name,” the CM said.“I bow before the land of Fatehpur Sikri in Agra where Gokula Jat was born and gave a tough fight to Mughal ruler Aurangzeb who was a foreign invader. During the SP rule, no respect given to Gokula Jat but the BJP gave full respect and declared a ‘chowk’ and road after him,” Yogi said in Sikri where Jat community is dominant. “In SP regime, there was a riot every third day but now no riots take place as the BJP took tough stand and rioters are now running away. It is only the BJP which is working for villages. See what type of candidates are given tickets by the SP. Their cap is stained with the blood of innocent youths and farmers killed during Muzaffarnagar riots. They are also guilty of firing on ‘kar sevaks’,” said the CM who added that both the SP and the Bahujan Samaj Party harmed Uttar Pradesh. Agra district has nine assembly seats. The BJP had won all these seats in the 2017 assembly polls. Moreover, Yogi applauded the Covid management under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. “The double engine government of the BJP was serving the masses during the corona period but there was none from the SP, the BSP and the Congress to help them as they sat back home when the masses were having a tough time. How can one be friend when one is not there in need? The SP and the BSP are opportunists and need to be taught a lesson,” the CM said.“Development for SP meant for development of Saifai but the BJP gave employment to the youth while ‘Chacha’ and ‘Bhatija’ of the Samajwadi Party (an indirect reference to Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Shivpal Yadav) used to move out to make earnings in the name of jobs, transfers and postings from the masses,” Yogi added. “One can find out that the Samajwadi Party is giving tickets to criminals, mafias and those causing riots but they should understand that after the BJP comes to power again in UP on March 10, the bulldozer against mafia will begin to move again,” he said. Addressing a gathering in Shamshabad (Fatehabad assembly seat), Yogi said the opportunist leaders of the opposition parties did not have any sensitivity towards farmers, women or the youth. “Naam Samajwadi, sonch parivarwaadi, kaam daanga wadi” (Their name is Samajwadi but they worked for their family and caused riots),” the CM said. “More than 99 % have got their first dose of Covid vaccine and they have decided to throw away those who were opposing and spreading misinformation against vaccine. The double engine BJP government gave double dose of ration to the poor. In previous regimes, this ration used to go to mafias when there was rule of ‘chacha bhatija’ and the stomach of the elephant of ‘Behanji’’s party (BSP) is so big that ration of all poor went into it,” Yogi said. “The Samajwadi Party’s development was confined to boundary wall of kabristan (graveyard) but the BJP used the same money in the development of ‘teerth’ and ‘dham’ (pilgrimage)’,” CM said.

They first cordoned off the three storey house. According to CCTV footage seized by the police, one of them stood guard at the entrance while the others went in.The team had fake identity cards hanging around their necks, and their masks for Covid-19 were in place. Once inside, they told the family that they were going to seize the family’s firearm. Soon after, the team ‘seized’ the mobile phones and locked the children in a room.The women were forced to sit in another room and told to handover the key to the iron almirah with a built-in safe. They couldn’t however, open the safe and ultimately had to break it open to access the cash and jewellery.After the group left, Singh’s wife called her husband and file a complaint with the police.“The police are searching for the crooks based on the CCTV footage”, said Lakhisarai SP Sushil Kumar. 
31-01-2022||Mumbai||BJP leaders write letters to Rashmi Thackeray and Sonia Gandhi||Mumbai: Former UP governor Ram Naik and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Chandrashekhar Bawankule have written separate letters to Saamana editor Rashmi Thackeray and Congress president Sonia Gandhi over recent comments made by their party leaders.While Naik has complained about Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana’s executive editor Sanjay Raut for his ‘wrong’ references, Bawankule has demanded removal of Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole from the post for his derogatory remarks on PM.Naik, who is also the former MP from Mumbai, has said that the references given by Raut in his column on January 30, related to the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance and the election fought by them were wrong.“Raut says that Sena’s Wamanrao Mahadik was elected from Parel to the legislative assembly in 1970 in a bypoll after the killing of the communist MLA Krishna Desai. He has said that the party’s Pramod Nawalkar and Chhagan Bhujbal too were elected to the lower house from Girgaum and Mazgaon respectively. In fact, Mahadik was supported by Bharatiya Jana Sangh, (the political arm of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) and many Sangh leaders campaigned for him. In the 1972-assembly election there was an understanding between Sangh and Shiv Sena on two seats- Girgaum and Malabar Hill. Both the parties supported each other, though Jan Sangh’s Jaywantben Mehta could not win from Malabar Hill. Sena’s Nawalkar won from Girgaum. It is true that Bhujbal won the Assembly election in 1985 from Mazgaon, but as an independent,” wrote Naik.Naik has also rebutted Raut’s claim that Shiv Sena did not fight Uttar Pradesh elections in 1993 immediately after the demolition of the Babri Masjid on its symbol. “Raut has said that the 180 Sena candidates who lost their deposits were not the official candidates of the party and they did not fight on the party symbol. The claim is a half-truth as Sena could not get the symbol as it was not an authorised party (in UP) in that election held after Babri demolition. Raut takes credit for Bhujbal’s victory, but misleads people saying the UP polls were not fought on the party symbol. I urge you to publish my letter in Saamana to ensure that the facts are presented before the readers,” he summed up.Raut in his column on Sunday had said that though Sena candidates lost their deposits they neither had contested on the party symbol nor any key party leader, including the then party chief Bal Thackeray, campaigned for them. Raut has written this in response to leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis’s criticism that the Sena never had presence at national level.In another letter, former power minister and BJP’s OBC face Chandrashekhar Bawankule has written a letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi demanding Maharashtra congress chief Nana Patole’s ouster from the post. “Patole has been continuously disturbing social peace by his anti-social rhetoric. He made controversial statements against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and now more recently, he termed Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination as ‘Vadh’, which is the term used for the killing of bad elements. By his statements Patole has been creating unrest in the society leading to intense reaction from the people. We urge you to take a strict action against him by removing him from the post,” the letter dated January 31 has stated.Patole, in his speech on Sunday mentioned assassination of Gandhi as Vadh. Recently, he had said that he can hit or abuse Modi. Last week again he also passed derogatory remarks against Modi. Later he went on clarifying that he was referring to a local goon by the name Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-leaders-write-letters-to-rashmi-thackeray-and-sonia-gandhi-101643651011977.html
31-01-2022||Lucknow||Efforts begin to set up Sainik School in Prayagraj||Students who aspire to pursue their studies in a Sainik School but were unable to do so in absence of any such school in Prayagraj will soon be able to fulfil their wishes. The process for opening a Sainik School in Sangam city has begun, informed state education department officials. In last year’s budget, the central government, in association with the Sainik Schools Society, had approved a plan to open 100 new Sainik Schools in the country against just 33 running in India. These news schools are to be opened under the public-private partnership (PPP) model with an aim to develop the ethos of national spirit, indomitable courage, an unfailing commitment to values of respect for country and society, imbibe the importance of physical fitness and embody the national pride in students, while providing quality educational environment by involving the government/private schools to partner in establishing and aligning their system in line with Sainik Schools’ eco-system. Prayagraj district school inspector of schools (DIoS) RN Vishwakarma, said, “Those, be it organisations or investors, who are interested in opening these schools can visit https:// sainikschool.ncog.gov.in and apply.” Under the scheme, government-aided schools such as Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, Navodaya Vidyalaya Sangathan, autonomous schools, schools being directly run by the Ministry of Defence and Railways, public sector schools and private schools can apply. As per the plan, around 5,000 students can be enrolled in the schools in the 2022-23 session. The schools will start taking admission from class 6. These schools will function like any other 33 Sainik Schools spread across the country. These schools will also get financial support from the government in the form of fees, training grants etc. In return, the government will get the benefit of the already existing infrastructure in reputed private and government schools. The initiative is expected to meet the growing demand for Sainik Schools. These Sainik Schools will also have the option to allow day scholars with early morning to late evenings timings so that day scholars can partake in full-day academic and extra-curricular activities. Teachers of the proposed Sainik School will be provided with teachers’ training under the aegis of Sainik Schools Society. Each Sainik School will be required to excel in an identified sport in accordance with a system of ‘One School– One Sport’ of the ministry of sports and youth affairs. Moreover, NCC vacancies will be allotted based on the existing policy, added officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/efforts-begin-to-set-up-sainik-school-in-prayagraj-101643649751970.html

According to LMC officials, the company has not deposited the money collected as user charges into its account. The municipal commissioner, in the last meeting with the officials of the company, had warned of strict action if they fail to deposit the money in an LMC account. Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia said, “There have been several complaints against the Ecogreen workers for collection of service charges but not giving any receipt against the payment. I have already recommended strict action against anyone indulging in taking money without receipts.” Last year, in September, a fine of ₹2.2 crore was imposed on Ecogreen Energy by LMC for breach of contract and its failure to operate the solid waste treatment plant at its full capacity, causing an environmental hazard. During the inspection, the LMC officials found tons of waste was lying untreated at the Shivri Treatment plant. Earlier too, during the surprise inspection of the plant, not all the machines were found to be in working condition. The company officials were warned of strict action several times, but they chose not to improve their functioning, Bhatia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lmc-warns-ecogreen-for-not-depositing-service-charges-101643649152007.html
31-01-2022||Mumbai||HC calls for report on anda cells in state prisons||Mumbai A convict, even if a hardened criminal, needs to be treated humanely and cannot be put in anda cells on the whims and fancies of the prison authorities, Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) observed on Monday.The HC made the observation while hearing a petition filed by the kin of an inmate, who was kept in an anda cell. The kin had approached HC, complaining that the inmate suffered from severe mental health issues due to solitary confinement and sought his transfer to regular barracks.On January 28, the HC had directed shifting of the inmate to the barracks and sought a report on his mental health and medical condition.The division bench of justice V K Jadhav and justice Sandipkumar More, while hearing the petition of Ruheena Shaikh, was informed by advocate Rupesh Jaiswal that his client was the wife of Imran Shaikh, a convict who was serving his sentence in the Aurangabad Central Prison. Jaiswal submitted that Imran had been kept in the anda cell for two years and four months for breaking prison rules since October 2019.During the hearing on January 24, the bench was informed that in November 2021, when Ruheena visited her husband, she realised that his mental health was deteriorating and he was not able to understand what she was saying. This prompted her to write to the jail authorities in December 2021, requesting them to shift her husband out of solitary confinement. However, she did not get any response and eventually approached the HC. As she was unable to afford a lawyer, the court directed the district legal service authorities to provide her a counsel and advocate Jaiswal was appointed to represent her.In her petition, Ruheena attached a letter written by her husband to the jail superintendent in September 2021, wherein he had stated that he was suffering from hallucinations and had lost all sense of feeling and communication with other humans due to the solitary confinement. The petition stated that though Imran was accused of breaking prison rules he was not given an opportunity to disprove it as well.The court had then directed the transfer of Imran to the barracks and also sought a medical report of Imran’s mental health. The bench had also asked the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) to visit the anda cell and to get details including photographs of the same and submit a report on the living conditions therein on January 31.When the matter was heard on Monday, the bench perused the medical report and the report submitted by the CJM and observed, “He may be a hardened criminal, but what is expected is that he is treated as a human and not given inhuman treatment. Though medical examination report is not very serious, this could result into a psychological problem, there may be a serious impact if this is left to whims and fancies of the authorities.”The court sought the records and the reasons for putting Imran in the anda cell and whether proper procedure was followed while transferring him there and also asked the state to submit details on the procedures for putting an inmate in an anda cell.The court further sought to know about the number of anda cells in state prisons and the duration for which an inmate could be kept there as per the prison manual. The court also sought details about the number of inmates put in anda cells over the past two years.The court then sought to know whether putting an inmate in an anda cell was akin to solitary confinement and directed the state/prison authorities to go through the report of the CJM and file an affidavit in reply and also explain the procedure for putting an inmate in an anda cell. The bench also asked the petitioner to go through the CJM and medical report and make submissions accordingly and posted a hearing of the petition after four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-calls-for-report-on-anda-cells-in-state-prisons-101643649093086.html

31-01-2022||Lucknow||Name Yogi doesn’t make one a saint: Azad takes a jibe at CM||The Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, who looks all set to contest against Yogi Adityanath from Gorakhpur urban seat in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, on Sunday, attacked the UP CM saying, “Someone who goes by the name Yogi does not make him a saint.”Azad, who was addressing a press conference, also hoped that people of Gorakhpur would bless him with their votes.When asked about various social media memes which show him as demon king Ravana, who is being killed by Yogi (Adityanath) as Lord Rama, Azad said, “Deprived have always been killed whenever they raise their voice for equality and justice. Dalits and the socially oppressed are killed. The name of Ravana has been given to me by the media. Names do not matter, as someone who goes by the name Yogi does not make him a saint. A person named Yogi could be a Dhongi, Hitler or even a dictator. My name is the same as that of great freedom fighter Chandrashekhar Azad. This is not a battle of the name rather work. Those who have changed names are going to face defeat.” On being asked about his decision to contest from Gorakhpur, he said, “This is my decision. I believe that people of Gorakhpur will shower their blessing on me. They know that this Ravana is fighting for youngsters, Dalits, elderly, women and farmers, who feel cheated by this government. Azad also commented on the failure of his party to ally with Samajwadi Party (SP). “I tried my best for the alliance, but they (SP) did not want the welfare of the Dalits. They know well if they come to power, Chandrashekhar will not sit silently on the issues of Dalits, deprived, and women. We are the people who walk on the path of equality and justice shown by Kanshi Ram ji.” Azad also raised the issue of a Dalit student, who last year was found murdered on Gorakhpur university campus and whose family had alleged that the girl was raped and murdered. “Her family members still await justice,” Azad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/name-yogi-doesn-t-make-one-a-saint-azad-takes-a-jibe-at-cm-101643648671404.html

31-01-2022||Mumbai||Railways to pilot new signalling system between CSMT-Panvel||Mumbai: In order to increase the frequency of local trains, the Railways plans to introduce Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) system on a pilot basis between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Panvel. The groundwork of the first driverless local trains advanced signalling system is expected to begin in 2023.After a successful pilot, Railways is likely to introduce CBDT between CSMT-Kalyan and Churchgate-Virar. Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC), which will oversee the implementation of the system, is in the final process of floating tender for the project.“The project will be implemented first on the Harbour Line, followed by Central Railway mainline and Western Railway. We are at an advanced stage of processing the tender for the CBTC project,” said Ravi Agarwal, chairman and managing director, MRVC.Once the tender is floated, it would take six to eight months for MRVC to award the tender and the work will begin after that.“After studying different suburban railway line patterns, we have finalized to introduce it on the harbour railway first,” said a senior MRVC official.The driverless system enables signals to be placed inside the motorman cabin. CBTC does not require physical signals to be placed across the railway tracks, helping reduce the distance of trains between two signals and accommodate more trains.Though the system can be operated driverless, railway authorities said that the trains will continue to be operated by motormen. “A motorman will be able to supervise and direct controls as there are trespassing, multiple convergence and crossings along the suburban railway tracks. If the trains are operated without motormen, then they would halt multiple times due to the brake system installed in it. In future, the system can operate without a motorman,” added the senior MRVC official.CBTC is a part of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP) 3 A, which got approval in 2019 and will cost ₹5,928 crore. The system will help increase the frequency of local trains operating every hour from the present 16 to 24. It will also reduce the headway between the trains from four minutes to two and half minutes.CBTC system is presently used in the operation of trains in Spain, London and metro services in India.According to a study conducted by the MRVC on the expansion of the suburban railway system, CBTC will create more than 50 percent extra capacity for train operations.The study states that after Harbour Railway, the CBTC system will be introduced on slow lines on the Western Railway and then the Central Railway. It also suggested that Central and Western railways finalise fifth and sixth railway line alignment (usually used to operate fast railway lines) up to Kalyan and Virar, respectively, to implement CBTC on the fast railway corridor with trains equipped with automatic closing doors and air-conditioners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/railways-to-pilot-new-signalling-system-between-csmtpanvel-101643647595820.html

31-01-2022||Pune||Pune ZP launches app as facilitator between donors and govt projects||PUNE: A new app named ‘MahaAnusha’ that the Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP) has come up with that serves as a facilitator between donors and government projects, was launched on a pilot basis by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday. If successful, the same can be implemented in other districts and municipal corporations, officials said.The Pune ZP will serve as an integrated corporate social responsibility (CSR) matchmaking platform for donors/CSR foundations, funding agencies, NGOs and citizens. The Pune ZP has partnered with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the same, said Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune ZP.Prasad said, “The concept has earlier been introduced by the UNDP in Karnataka by the name ‘Akansha’. This dashboard will give real time access to donors, civil society and the district administration to monitor and implement projects in a collaborative manner to maximise available financial and technical resources and minimise duplication.”Prasad further said that according to the national CSR portal, ministry of corporate affairs, Maharashtra has the highest share of CSR expenditure among all the states at Rs2,846 crore (14%) which is spent on various CSR initiatives. Maharashtra is one the leading states in terms of CSR expenditure with over Rs2,846 crore spent on various development projects, and growing at an average of 15% annually. Most of the CSR spend is across the education, rural development and healthcare categories. In the last two years of Covid-19, the Pune ZP has received more than Rs52 crore in donations most of which have been distributed in an uneven manner. Prasad said, “To align this CSR spend with state governments projects and leverage CSR as a gap fund for Pune, it is envisioned that the ‘MahaAnushaa’ platform will be piloted in Pune. Pune is the hub for the manufacturing and information technology sectors and many companies are headquartered in Hinjewadi, Kharadi, Chakan and other MIDC areas. The Pune ZP intends to tie up with all industrial associations to promote this platform for CSR projects. Based on the gap analysis carried out by various departments of the ZP, projects in health and education such as school and anganwadi upgradation will be uploaded on the portal on priority. During the Covid pandemic, the Pune ZP has efficiently mobilised CSR from more than 65 corporates amounting to ₹52 crore for various projects. We hope that with this new app, we will be able to collect and coordinate more funds which can be used to divert funds for projects that really need them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-zp-launches-app-as-facilitator-between-donors-and-govt-projects-101643647291163.html

31-01-2022||Ranchi||J’khand: CMP soon, says Cong’s new in-charge after RPN exit||Newly appointed All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge of Jharkhand, Avinash Pande, said Monday that a common minimum programme (CMP) and a co-ordination committee would soon be put in place in consultation with the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), the lead partner in the ruling alliance in the state, for better functioning of the government and redressing grievances of party legislators and workers. Speaking to reporters here at the end of his three-day maiden visit after getting Jharkhand assignment following the exit of former AICC in-charge RPN Singh, who joined the BJP last week, Pande said, “In our extensive meetings with the party leaders and legislators, we have reviewed the functioning and performance of all departments, including those which are with our ally. We have also reviewed our manifesto. A CMP is important not only for our coalition government, but also for the public. Onus also lies on the lead partner for having a CMP. We will soon have a CMP in consultation with the CM. Our central leadership will also speak with the CM.”Pande said they would also put in place a co-ordination committee among the allies from the state to district level in light of the complaints by the party legislators and workers that the administration was not responsive to their issues. The AICC in-charge said the state Congress unit was intact and there was no threat to the government. “Party legislators ought to raise their concerns on party forum and not before media. Indiscipline would not be tolerated,” he said. Soon after RPN Singh left the party, at least two legislators had alleged that the former was trying to topple the Hemant Soren goverment in collusion with the BJP. Pande did not meet chief minister Hemant Soren or any senior JMM leader despite being in Ranchi for three days. “I was busy holding consultations with my party leaders and workers. I spoke to CM and shared pleasantries on phone. I have a flight to take. If possible, I will try to meet him before that or else would meet him on my next visit,” he said. Later, JMM principal general secretary Supriya Bhattacharya said the ruling alliance already had a “functional CMP” in place and advised Congress to have coordination within their party. “We are a pre-poll alliance and we already have an in-principle CMP in place. But if there is a need to have a formal CMP, we can discuss that. However, as far as coordination is concerned, our CM is readily available not only for a legislator or top Congress leaders, but even for opposition leaders. On the issue, I would also advise our ally to have better coordination within Congress,” he said. Balmuchu, Bhagat return to Congress Meanwhile, two former state Congress presidents, Pradeep Balmuchu and Shukhdeo Bhagat, returned to the party on Monday in presence of Avinash Pande and co-incharge Umesh Singhar and senior leaders.Balmuchu and Bhagat, both senior tribal leaders, had quit party just ahead of 2019 assembly polls and contested on AJSU Party and BJP tickets, respectively. The two leaders thanked the party leadership for “forgiving their mistake” and vowed to not leave the party again in entire lifetime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jkhand-cmp-soon-says-cong-s-new-in-charge-after-rpnexit-101643647171285.html

31-01-2022||Patna||Bihar Council polls: After RJD snub, Congress to contest all 24 seats||The alliance between the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in Bihar is all but over, at least for now. While ties between the two parties had already come to a breaking point after both fielded their candidates in bypolls for two assembly seats last year, the final blow has been dealt by RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who categorically said on Sunday that his party has no truck with Congress in Bihar and declared that his party had selected candidates for all 23 Legislative Council seats, while leaving Bhagalpur for the Left parties. The 24 seats are likely to go to polls in February or March this year. Responding in kind, Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Ajit Sharma said on Monday his party would field nominees on all 24 seats. “There will be no looking back, until the party high command tells us to follow the other line,” said Sharma, who returned to Patna on Monday after meeting with AICC in-charge for Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, and other senior leaders in Delhi.Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha, who was also in Delhi to meet and discuss the seat sharing issues on the words of RJD chief Lalu Prasad, said the party had launched the selection process for candidates on all seats. “Applications of candidates have started pouring in once the party decided to contest the elections on its own,” he said.A section of Congress in the state hailed the party’s decision to opt out of the coalition led by the RJD in Bihar. “The party took a right decision, but the delay in deciding the course has caused irreparable damage to its electoral base,” said Kishore Jha, a senior AICC member. Former MLC Ajay Kumar Singh said it was illogical to be in alliance of the RJD, which is supporting other parties in the Uttar Pradesh elections. “The Congress should better strive to revitalize its roots instead of relying on the allies. We have a tie-up with the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) in the neighbouring state, which had supported the Trinamool in West Bengal and Samajwadi Party in UP,” said Singh.Leaders of the ruling alliance, however, ridiculed Congress’s delayed decision. “Congress woke up after RJD discarded its proposal. Congress has become irrelevant by supporting the party which is known for institutionalizing corruption and perpetuating nepotism in politics,” said BJP leader and road construction minister Nitin Nabin.

31-01-2022||Lucknow||Private school associations request UP govt to reopen educational institutes||Two associations of private schools have requested the UP government to order reopening of schools, which were closed due to the raging pandemic, without any further delay. President of Unaided Private Schools Association, UP and managing director of St Joseph Group of Institutions Lucknow Anil Agarwal has requested the state government to reopen the schools with immediate effect. He also said they believed that government will take necessary action and allow them to call students for offline classes.Rachit Manas, co-director, Brightland Inter College said, “The government should allow the children of classes 9 to 12 to be called in the school so that they can take the examination.”Saifi Yunus, managing director, Eram Educational Society said, “As per the advice of child psychologists across the country, the government is requested to immediately start offline classes.”Separately, Association of Private Schools, Uttar Pradesh has written a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath urging him to reopen schools in the state, which have been closed for the past one month, from February 7. President of the association, Atul Kumar cited the views of Dr Praveen Kumar, pediatrician of Lady Harding Medical College, New Delhi, published in a prominent Hindi daily, wherein he had said though the parents are scared to send their children to schools, they are also concerned about their children’s decreasing activities. “In such a situation, sending children to schools is the best alternative, so parents should not be afraid and send their wards to school. Moreover, the closure of schools is affecting the overall development of children,” he said.He said seeing the falling graph of Covid cases in the country, it may be said that the peak is now over. Kumar said the pre-schools association has also expressed concern as more than 70% of students were not taking interest in online classes. The children have become cranky after staying away from schools for so long. The little ones are not able to get practical knowledge of sitting, standing, taking lunch etc. “The online classes are not able to establish communication with the students. In view of the above scenario, the government must open schools all over the state from February 7 the association has said in their letter to chief minister,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/private-school-associations-request-up-govt-to-reopen-educational-institutes-101643646571487.html

The bench had further stated that the authorities could not deprive eligible applicants of the same on technical grounds.On Monday, the government pleader informed the bench that steps were taken to contact the eligible applicants to help them with the online claim procedure. However, some of them were not traceable. The GP added that some physical applications were already pending before BMC and they would be decided in a week’s time and the compensation amount would be disbursed. The bench was told that the online process was faster and easier.However, advocate Sumedha Rao for the NGO refuted the claims of the GP and said that none of the applicants had been contacted by the authorities for online applications. She added that as per SC directions, the state was bound to disburse the amount within 30 days from the date of application, which was not happening.After hearing the submissions the bench directed the state and BMC to file affidavits in reply to the plea and noted, “As and by way of the interim measure, we direct that applications, which have not been filed online should continue to be processed as if they are online applications and assistance be extended to the next of kin of victim of SARS-Cov for uploading documents and an earnest endeavour should be made that assistance is extended at the earliest.”The bench further said, “If he or she (applicant) is in position to file an online application, they may do so, but if not, then do not keep on insisting. If you want any information about applicants, ask the advocate for the petitioner for the same. We should not fight over it, so that unfortunate people get compensation and we work in coordination.” The PIL has been posted for further hearing on February 14.Advocates Sumedha Rao and Rumana Bagdadi for the NGO on January 24 had informed the bench that as per a Supreme Court (SC) decision, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) had formulated guidelines for the state to disburse ex-gratia compensation of ₹50,000 to dependents of Covid victims through the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). Certification of eligible victims was to be decided as per guidelines issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and the Indian Centre for Medical Research (ICMR).The advocates while elaborating on the role of the NGO had submitted that claim forms were distributed in several chawls and slum areas following which nearly 56 people, who are economically backward, had filed claims before the Collector’s office. This was done before the state government had started an online portal for claims and payments. Advocate Rao had added that due to technical glitches in uploading documents on the online portal, claims should be granted based on the forms submitted physically.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/allow-physical-applications-for-covid-ex-gratia-hc-tells-state-101643646155778.html
31-01-2022||Pune||In hope of strong support: Pune’s industry captains lay out their budget expectations||PUNE: After two consecutive years of the Covid-19 pandemic have adversely affected the economy, industry in Pune has various expectations from the budget to be presented on Tuesday by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.Prashant Girbane, director-general, MCCIA“The budget should support real growth of 8.5 to 9% or more. We are not yet completely out of the pandemic so there is still need to provide fiscal space, however fiscal deficit should reduce from about 6.8% of the GDP this year to about 5.8% of the GDP next year. The allocation for capital expenditure, that creates jobs and boosts consumption, should increase from Rs5.5 trillion to about Rs6.5 to Rs7 trillion. There is need to emphasise on some of the announcements made in previous budgets such as the national infrastructure pipeline, national asset monetisation plan, and labour reforms. The budget should also hint at new policy interventions, including clarity on crypto currencies. The FM should highlight the need for the GST council to include alcohol and petroleum products in GST. There is need for special emphasis on MSMEs that are not yet completely out of the woods. Continuation of the ECLGS scheme, though with lower allocation and boosting support through other schemes like technology up-gradation and quality assurance will help. Reduction in custom duty on metals that are used as raw materials will help MSMEs.” Nishant Agarwal, founder, Proctur“The ed-tech sector has adopted new technology and approaches. However online classes were hampered by inadequate internet connections, digital devices, or computer systems. The ed-tech ecosystem anticipates that the government will make government services available to both applicants and ed-tech companies. The budget is projected to place a greater emphasis on improving internet connectivity infrastructure across the country. Also, one of the most critical areas which required improvement is the GST treatment of print vs digital educational products. Online educational content has the potential to improve educational access and quality. From this year’s budget, there is a hope that the GST will be cut, allowing more individuals to invest in digital education.”Vishal Gokhale, managing director, Gokhale Constructions“It has been a longstanding demand of the real estate sector either to reduce or remove GST applicable for under construction flats. We hope that the FM and GST council considers this in the coming budget. In the past few years, the demand for bigger homes has increased thus an increase in home loan tax benefit will be beneficial for both the home buyer as well as the real estate sector since it is expected to boost the sale of properties.”Anil Pharande, president, Credai-Pune Metro“Credai advocates cheaper home loans, tax benefits for investments in housing, and longer loan repayment cycles to boost housing demand and enable more people to buy their dream homes which will contribute to achieving the government’s policy of ‘housing for all by 2022’. We recommend amendments in Section 80IBA of affordable housing, which along with home buyers will also benefit the construction sector. We are also expecting additional support from the government to control the rising input costs besides streamlining faster approvals for projects, introducing credit input on GST, and increasing availability for funding, streamlining and faster approvals for projects which Bharat B Phatak, personal finance expert“The government wants higher tax collections to continue. Looking at the number of income tax returns filed and GST registrations, it seems that collections will be higher due to better compliance and data transparency. At this time, the government should not raise tax rates. Stock markets are worried about equity capital gains’ tax increase.”Dishan Kamdar, vice-chancellor, Flame University“We hope that the budgetary allocation to the overall education sector will see an increase this year, as the last two years have severely impacted both institutions and students, with a shift to the online mode. A fund allocation for advancement in the technology infrastructure to help enable institutes to invest in the latest technology tools, software, and high-speed connectivity will surely deliver a seamless, high-quality learning experience to their students. The government could also develop an education loan scheme for ease in accessibility, disbursement and repayment terms which will support students from the lesser privileged strata and the deeper pockets of the country to benefit from.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/in-hope-of-strong-support-pune-s-industry-captains-lay-out-their-budget-expectations-101643646154530.html
31-01-2022||Mumbai||Students respond to Hindustani Bhau’s call, protest offline exams for classes 10, 12||Mumbai Groups of students gathered in Mumbai and three other cities to mark their protest against offline board examinations for classes 10 and 12. They said that as they studied online the entire year, it is only fair to conduct the exams online too, as most students are not prepared for the offline mode. Responding to a call by Vikas Fhatak, alias ‘Hindustani Bhau’, a former contestant on the reality TV show Big Boss, the students gathered to protest. Fhatak is known for his use of abusive language on social media. The protest turned violent in Nagpur, where window panes of buses were damaged. Home Minister Dilip Walse-Patil asked the police to probe who was behind the organised protests that took the government as well as police machinery by surprise. He asked them to probe whether there was an organised attempt to incite students.In Mumbai, students gathered at Dharavi, the assembly constituency of state education minister Varsha Gaikwad in the afternoon, where Fhatak addressed the crowd. He also released a video on social media platforms, where he demanded the cancellation of board exams and school fee waiver.He also threatened that if the demands are not met, similar protests will be staged across the state.Meanwhile, students gathered at Aurangabad and Osmanabad with similar demands on Monday afternoon. Students said that they had gathered because ‘Hindustani Bhau’ asked them to do so. In Nagpur, the protest turned violent as a group of students pelted stones and damaged a school bus. Meanwhile, state school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said that they want to know if students were incited by someone and will request the home minister to investigate. She also asked students not to violate Covid rules and risk their health. She further said she has invited the students for talks.Bachhu Kadu, minister of state for school education, said that some students taking to the streets don’t mean all of them feel the same. They will have to look into the demands as there are students who are well prepared for exams and want them to be held offline. “It was an impromptu protest by students. We would have called them for discussion if we were told about it in advance. We need to consider all the aspects before taking the decision as we are working in the interest of students. Today some are demanding online examinations and others want them to be cancelled. Tomorrow they will oppose physical classes. This is not the way to function. We have also received demands where students want time for studies and some oppose the average mark system. Everything will be considered before taking a decision,” Kadu said.Gaikwad said that it is improper to protest in such huge numbers during Covid. “They are immature. There should be no politics over students’ future…I will speak to the home minister and will request him to find out who is behind all this,” the school education minister said, adding that they have been discussing the issue of holding examinations with all the concerned people including experts, schools management and parents. “I am ready to discuss the issue even more and ready to consider their suggestions,” she added.However, Bhai Jagtap, Mumbai Congress chief, smelled a conspiracy. “The students protested outside Varsha Gaikwad’s office reportedly because a social media influencer Hindustani Bhau uploaded an Instagram post... the police have detained him. This post sparked off trouble in the state and hence, this is a serious matter. The police will trace the roots of this issue, but prima facie, this seems to be a conspiracy,” said Jagtap.Earlier, Fhathak had been the face of controversy over his abusive language. In August last year, he shared a video asking his supporters to beat up people who disrespect Hindu gods. After this, his account on Instagram was suspended.On an earlier occasion, he was arrested by the Shivaji Park police in Mumbai for violating Covid restrictions. He posted on his Twitter account that he would stage a protest all by himself at Shivaji Park demanding the cancellation of all the exams and was arrested after reaching the spot in an ambulance, which he used to hoodwink the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/students-respond-to-hindustani-bhau-s-call-protest-offline-exams-for-classes-10-12-101643645910916.html

A huge stage was set in front of the RTO license window and a big LED screen with sound system was installed. A special music band was arranged. Sofas and chairs were kept for the guests and RTO staffers, and the programme was scheduled in the evening. With all these preparations going on since the morning however, people coming for their RTO work were getting disturbed and after complaints from citizens, the celebrations had to be toned down by the RTO administration.Sagar Abnawe, one of the citizens, said, “Creating trouble for the public and conducting such huge programmes inside government offices is not right. The benches for the public were kept aside and we were forced to stand in one corner of the office to get our work done.”Another citizen Shweta Rathi said, “At a time when Covid-19 cases are on the rise in Pune city and the state government has issued strict guidelines for conducting programmes and other functions, grand celebrations were underway at the RTO office which is not right and can lead to further spreading of the virus as many people were flouting Covid norms.”After the public expressed their displeasure, RTO officials pared down the mega arrangements that had been made for the function. The open jeep decorated with flowers as well as the chairs and sofas were removed from the site and all those gathered including the public were urged to wear face masks and follow Covid-19 norms.When contacted, Pune regional transport officer Ajit Shinde maintained, “A sendoff programme for one of our RTO inspectors has been organised within the office premises and we are going to hold the program following all Covid-19 norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sendoff-celebrations-for-pune-rto-inspector-toned-down-after-complaints-from-public-101643645371041.html

Currently, 2215 of 37,576 beds remained occupied.Meanwhile, 57,686 samples were tested for the viral disease during the day.The latest surge in Covid cases was witnessed in Mumbai in the third week of December and peaked in early January. Mumbai had logged 20,971 Covid -19 cases on January 7, 2022, the highest in a day since the pandemic broke out in March 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-logs-less-than-1-000-new-covid-19-cases-positivity-rate-at-210-101643644445688.html
31-01-2022||Pune||Pune hospital research claims Omicron not affecting internal organs like Delta variant||PUNE Research conducted by Pune’s Sassoon General Hospital on the difference in symptoms between those infected with the Omicron variant of Covid-19 and the Delta variant, claims that new variant does not affect internal organs like the Delta variant did.Symptoms were observed in about 150 adults who were admitted after December 20, 2021 until now.Doctors observing patients infected with the Omicron variant found that although the symptoms are mild, they are different from those reported during the second wave last year The study found that most commonly reported symptoms are similar to those associated with a viral flu. Dr Rohidas Borse, head of Medicine at BJ Medical College and Sassoon General hospital said, “We have observed close to 150 Omicron infected Covid-19 patients. The stark difference in symptoms which did not exist the last time is severe body ache, severe headache, chills and also throat pain in some patients. Although the throat pain might last for only three days and lead to difficulty in swallowing food, the rest of the symptoms, especially the cough, could last for about a week or so. These symptoms did not exist in the last wave, which was dominant with the Delta variant. Although in this wave we do see that most patients complain of a runny nose which during the last wave was a dry nose.” He further added, “In the last wave we did see that the virus infected other organs like kidney, heart and liver, and so even though the virus had left the system the impact of the infection would force the patient to remain admitted for more than a month sometimes. If a kidney is damaged then the patient cannot be discharged immediately. However, this time the other internal organs are not damaged.” In Omicron while fever lasts for about a week or so, in Delta the fever was not persistent at all and would re-appear in some patients. He further added, “Based on the difference in symptoms as of now we can say that those who require ventilators or an ICU are likely to be infected with the Delta variant, which is still in the community, at about 30-40%. Like the previous wave we can see that those who have comorbidities are most likely to be infected and also the working population is being infected more this time. However, it is also true that most Omicron infections are reported among those who are either partially or fully vaccinated, but the vaccines have helped to reduce complications.”|||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-hospital-research-claims-omicron-not-affecting-internal-organs-like-delta-variant-101643643630760.html

31-01-2022||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh, his family laundered ₹10.42 crore in last 10 years: PMLA court||Mumbai: In the last 10 years, former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and his family members have integrated ₹10.42 crore unaccounted cash into the banking channel via Delhi-based shell company operators, the special PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) court has said while taking cognisance of the supplementary chargesheet filed by Enforcement Directorate (ED).Special PMLA judge Rahul Rokade said the investigation showed that since 2011, Deshmukh has laundered ₹10.42 crore unaccounted cash in the (educational) trust in the form of donations through shell companies of Delhi-based Jain brothers.The investigation further revealed that Deshmukh received illegal gratification of ₹4.70 crores in cash collected through now-dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze from orchestra bar owners from December 2020 to February 2021, the court said.“Anil Deshmukh, in connivance with his son Hrishikesh Deshmukh, transferred illegal gratification through hawala channels to Jain brothers i.e. Surendra Kumar Jain and Virendra Kumar Jain, who are accused in the earlier chargesheet along with Vaze. Thereafter, Surendra Kumar Jain and Virendra Kumar Jain transferred the said amount in the bank account of Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, Nagpur in the garb of donation to the trust run by the Deshmukh family. Surendra Kumar Jain and Virendra Kumar Jain infused the said illegal money into the banking channel and upon layering the same through various shell companies, transferred ₹1.71 crore in the bank account of Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, Nagpur in the garb of donation in February 2021 and March 2021,” PMLA court observed.“Deshmukh also laundered his unaccounted cash to the tune of ₹1.12 crore using the above modus into the trust. Deshmukh has actively integrated his unaccounted cash into the banking channel since the year 2011. He has laundered his unaccounted cash to the tune of ₹10.42 crores in the trust through Delhi-based shell companies through the Jain brothers,” judge Rokade noted.The special court further said that Hrishikesh Deshmukh assisted his father Anil Deshmukh to launder ₹1.71 crore out of the tainted money collected from bar owners and projected the same as a donation to the trust.He was also instrumental in infusing bogus share capital in companies that ran on dummy directors and were giving capital to them to purchase lands, it said, adding that Hrishikesh was an active participant in the laundering of the proceeds of crime as defined under PMLA.As to the role of Salil Deshmukh, the judge said he was instrumental in raising bogus share capital in Zodiac Dealcom Private Limited.“He was also instrumental in infusing bogus share capital in M/s Flourish Properties Pvt. Ltd., which was controlled using dummy directors, and using the said capitals to purchase lands in the name of M/s. Premier Port Links Pvt. Ltd. He acquired shares of M/s. Premier Port Links Pvt. Ltd. for a meagre amount of ₹17.95 lakh and became 50 percent owner over assets amounting to ₹5.34 crore of the said company. Thus, he is directly involved in the offence of money laundering and assisted his father and brother in money laundering as defined under section 3 of PMLA,” the PMLA court said.The special court also issued a process against all the accused named by the agency in the supplementary charge sheet.In addition to Deshmukh and his sons, chartered accountant Bhavik Panjwani and eight shell companies have been named as accused in the supplementary chargesheet filed by ED on December 29, 2021.Deshmukh was arrested on November 2, 2021, by the agency after questioning him for several hours.

NCP city unit president Prashant Jagtap said, “Citizens had given a clear majority to the BJP, putting their faith in the party. However, the BJP failed them on every front. Now, we are sure voters will reject them.”The Pune Municipal Corporation on Monday announced the ward names on its website. As a part of draft, which is unlikely to see any significant change after March 2, when state election commission will declare the final map of delimitated wards. Before that, there will be a public hearing to be completed by February 28. In its notification the State Election Commission has stated that the draft delimitation map with boundaries of each electoral panel for the PMC would be published on February 1. Citizens are invited to file suggestions and objections by February 14. As per the draft plan, there are 57 wards which will elect 3 members each and one ward will elect two members, taking the overall strength to 173 elected members. Among the 173 members, more than 100 members are coming from Vadgaonsheri, Hadapsar, Purandar and Khadakwasla assembly constituencies. The Vadgaonsheri and Hadapsar is dominated by NCP with seating MLAs also from the same party. The Purandar legislator is from Congress although the urban areas under that constituency areas are dominated by NCP and Shiv Sena. Khadkwasla constituency however has BJP and NCP clouts. During 2019 assembly elections, NCP candidate lost election hardly by 1,000 votes. BJP leader Hemant Rasane said, “BJP had representation everywhere. All eight MLA s were from BJP. Even the MP is from BJP. The party even scored more votes from suburban areas. We would win more seats than the previous election.”The BJP with 98 members currently rule the PMC having annual budget of ₹6,700 crore. The NCP, however, has been making all out efforts to regain the control over civic body where it once enjoyed power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ward-names-out-most-corporators-to-come-from-periphery-areas-101643642369849.html

Shelar, on behalf of the suspended legislators, moved the apex court, which termed the suspension irrational and unconstitutional. In response to the order, the state government has said that the state legislature will study the judgement if the apex court has overstepped while giving the ruling over the decision of the sovereign house.“The legislature has the power to suspend members, similarly on the lines of the suspension done by Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. It is well within the power of the Assembly,” Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/suspended-bjp-mla-ashish-shelar-seeks-entry-in-state-legislature-after-sc-order-101643641830145.html

31-01-2022||Pune||PMC, PCMC likely to get an administrator due to delayed civic elections||PUNE With the State Election Commission’s (SEC) notification making it clear that the panel structure for Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporations will be finalised by March 2, the elections for Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad corporation are likely to be announced by mid March and the voting may take place by April.In such a scenario, when the term of the civic body ends, the state government may appoint an administrator for a few days for both the corporations. Already, the municipal commissioner has taken charge as an administrator at Aurangabad and some other civic bodies on the directives of the state government as the term of these corporations ended, though elections could not be held due to Covid.Besides Covid, the state government also decided to wait for a decision from Supreme Court over OBC quota which was scrapped for local bodies.As Pune Municipal Corproration’s (PMC) tenure ends in the first week of March, the state government may ask for appointment of an administrator instead of offering extension to all the elected members.One of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader requesting anonymity, “It is good that the elections are delayed. Usually, elections are held two months before ending the tenure of the civic body though model code of conduct does not allow us take up fresh work. Due to Covid-19 pandemic this year, we could not spend our budget entirely. If we get these two months grace period, it is good for us.”Once the elections are announced, corporators cannot inaugurate or announce fresh work while municipal administration handles the routine work. Appointment of an administrator in that case will not affect any political party, said the BJP corporator on anonymity.Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) senior leader on anonymity said, “If the ruling party corporators are not in action for a few weeks due to the power of the administrator, it will be good as they won’t be able to influence voters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-pcmc-likely-to-get-an-administrator-due-to-delayed-civic-elections-101643641170155.html
31-01-2022||Pune||Students protest against Class 10 &12 offline exams||PUNE State authorities were caught off guard with sudden eruption of protests on Monday when thousands of students hit the streets in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and other parts of Maharashtra demanding cancellation of offline exams.The protest further added confusion among parents, Class 10 and Class 12 students who expressed that last moment changes will disturb them. The protest erupted after a video by one Vikas Phatak aka ‘Hindustani Bhau’ went viral urging students to agitate. Students gathered in large numbers outside the home of State Education Minister, Varsha Gaikwad in Mumbai.Gaikwad said she will interact with protesters on Tuesday to discuss the exam issue.Members of the parents’ association from the city expressed similar views and added that the board and education minister should soon end this confusion after state board sent a proposal for considering the dates to be deferred and Gaikwad also promising to look into the same despite the dates for Class 10 and 12 offline exams been already been announced.In some families, parents want offline examinations while students prefer online examinations. One such family is that of Sunil Chaudhari. His son is in Class 10. “I believe that offline examination is crucial and important for these children. However, these students have been continuing the online mode of education for the last one-and-a-half-years. And so, I think, before the examination, the schools should start offline classes for at least three months so that students can clarify their doubts and come back to the habit of writing again,” said Chaudhari.Shreesh Chaudhari, a Class 10 student said, “I prefer online exams because considering the rise in Covid cases. We haven’t received our 2nd vaccine dose, which puts us at an even greater risk. This whole year we have attended school online, offline classes were hardly held for 10-20 days.”Amruta Kulkarni, a student of Class 12 said, “We have seen the confusion last year around board exams. If similar thing happens this time, it will be very difficult to focus on the preparation.”However, board officials have emphasised that the offline examination is the only solution. “We are not equipped to take online examinations of students across Maharashtra. Many areas are in remote locations where online exam centres and internet connectivity is an issue. In such a scenario, offline examination is the only way ahead,” said a board official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-protest-against-class-10-12-offline-exams-101643639849932.html

31-01-2022||Mumbai||NeoCoV scare: Should we be worried about this new variant?||Mumbai: A team of researchers from the Wuhan University and Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing have alerted people about NeoCoV, a new type of coronavirus detected in bats. In a paper published on the preprint repository bioRxiv, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, the researchers have stated that NeoCoV is a close relative of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and should be closely monitored as its mutated form can likely have the potential to infect humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that further studies are required to ascertain NeoCoV’s threat to humans. On Sunday, Maharashtra’s health minister Rajesh Tope also sounded an alarm about the new variant, even as the world is yet to identify a confirmed human case. ‘NO REASON TO PANIC’ Vellore-based virologist Dr T Jacob John informed that there’s no need to panic since bats and humans do not have a natural contact. “We should definitely monitor new variants, be guarded, but we should not panic unnecessarily. Bats and humans do not have a natural contact, and it is only in rare, extraordinary situations that such contact may happen,” said Dr John.According to him, the Nipah virus, which had caused the 2018 outbreak in Kerala and the 1999 outbreaks in Malaysia and Singapore, has spread through the bats. “Researchers have confirmed three possible scenarios of the spread of Nipah- through contact of bat saliva on a half-eaten fruit by a bat and through the palm toddy containers where bats are found. In another situation, researchers have found that the Nipah virus jumped from bats to pigs and then to human beings,” he said, adding that it’s premature to assume that such transmission has occurred in the case of NeoCoV. IS IT HYPE? SARS-CoV-2 is known to bind with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in human beings. But in their study, the researchers from China found that NeoCoV and another closely related virus PDF-2180-CoV used bat ACE2 as their functional receptor. “This unexpected ACE2 usage of these MERS-CoV close relatives highlights a latent biosafety risk, considering a combination of two potentially damaging features of high fatality observed for MERS-CoV and the high transmission rate noted for SARS-CoV-2,” the study pointed. “Furthermore, our studies show that the current COVID-19 vaccinations are inadequate to protect humans from any eventuality of the infections caused by these viruses.” “NeoCoV is an old virus closely related to MERS-CoV which enters cells via DPP4 receptors (a type of receptor protein),” state’s Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said on social media. “NeoCoV can use ACE2 receptors of bats but they can’t use human ACE2 receptors unless a new mutation occurs. Everything else is hype,” he said. Infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava said that it’s best to leave the discussions till a human case has been found. “Till then, we should undoubtedly be cautious, but there is nothing to worry about,” he said. “We know very little about NeoCoV at the moment, except that the researchers from China have found it in bats. We don’t know if it has the capacity to jump onto humans or spread around the world. It’s just too soon to make assumptions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/neocov-scare-should-we-be-worried-about-this-new-variant-101643637029608.html
31-01-2022||Mumbai||Goa Assembly elections: Shiv Sena withdraws its Panaji candidate in support of Utpal Parrikar||Mumbai: Abiding by its statement, the Shiv Sena on Monday announced that it has dropped its candidate from Panaji ahead of the Goa Assembly elections to extend the party’s support to Utpal Parrikar, son of former Goa chief minister, Manohar Parrikar. Utpal is contesting from the seat as an independent candidate. Sena, in a message to former ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said that it is “keeping its word” and that it was “more than elections”.“We’re keeping our word. Shiv Sena is withdrawing its candidate Shailendra Velingkar from Panaji. Not just that, our workers will fully support Utpal Parrikar. We believe that the battle for Panaji is just about the election, but also about the purification of Goa politics (sic),” Raut said in a tweet tagging Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray, who is involved in the planning for Goa polls.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had earlier said that if Parrikar contests solo, and does not withdraw his candidature till the last day, the party will withdraw its candidate from the seat and support him. Sena had given the ticket to Shailendra Velingkar, son of Goa Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Subhash Velingkar. Shailendra had joined Sena earlier this month.Raut’s tweet also included a picture of Parrikar’s quote, targeting BJP for giving a ticket to Atanasio Babush Monserrate from Panaji, which was being presented by Manohar Parrikar. “You will give ticket to the person with criminal antecedent in the constituency represented by late Manohar Parrikar? (sic)”After being denied a ticket from Panaji, Utpal resigned from the BJP on January 21 and announced his candidature as an independent to mark his electoral debut. BJP, meanwhile, had said that Parrikar was given two other options to contest. On January 29, Devendra Fadnavis, BJP’s poll in charge for Goa, said that the party did not deny him a ticket, but he rejected two options.Shiv Sena is contesting the Goa polls in an alliance with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Sanjay Raut said that the party Aaditya Thackeray will campaign in Goa, including in Sinquerim (Sakhali) Assembly constituency from where Goa CM Pramod Sawant would contest. So far, the party has not decided if senior party leaders will campaign for Parrikar.“Aaditya Thackeray will campaign in Goa, including in Sakhali. The people of Goa are unhappy with the incumbent CM; there are several issues of corruption against him so I don’t think he will get elected again. He (Aaditya) will also campaign in Vasco, Pernem, Mapusa, Mandrem, the constituencies that are close to the Maharashtra border. Other Sena leaders will also campaign in Goa,” Raut said.

It only changes chief ministers or the names of places," he said.Talking about corruption, he said Uttarakhand is the only state in the country where a Covid testing scam took place."On February 14, when the state casts its vote, the BJP's arrogance will be broken," he said.He also appealed to people of Haldwani to vote for Sumit Hridayesh, the son of sitting Congress MLA from the seat and senior party leader Indira Hridayesh who died last year.Former Rajasthan deputy CM Sachin pilot also held a door-to-door campaign in Paltan Bazar in Dehradun to drum up support for the party.Campaigning is likely to pick up in Uttarakhand from February 2 when AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will release the party's manifesto here besides addressing a virtual rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/bjp-govt-took-away-poor-people-s-money-to-fill-coffers-congress-101643632382053.html

31-01-2022||Noida||Noida reports 364 new Covid cases, least since January 4||Gautam Budh Nagar on Sunday reported 364 new Covid-19 cases, taking the active caseload to 3,173 in the district, according to the state health bulletin. This is the lowest daily count since January 4 when the district had reported 140 cases.On Sunday, Gautam Budh Nagar also reported one death due to Covid-19, taking the district’s toll to 480, which included 13 deaths reported in the district this month so far. The test positivity rate also reduced to 8.84% on Sunday from 10% two days ago. Over 3,500 tests are being done daily in the district now, officials from the district health department said, adding that the reduced positivity rate shows that the infection rate has reduced considerably in the district. According to the officials, the patient who died on Sunday was a 45-year-old male suffering from comorbidities such as tuberculosis (TB), chronic liver disease and hypertension. “He was admitted to the Noida Covid Hospital on January 26 and died on January 28 due to cardiopulmonary arrest,” said a senior health official. This is the third death due to Covid-19 involving TB patients in the district this month. Experts say that during the third wave there has been an increase in the number of TB patients getting affected by Covid-19. “Covid impacts the lungs severely and cough is one of the most common symptoms. It is also a common symptom for TB, especially if the cough lasts for more than two weeks. Since TB patients are already immunocompromised, there are higher chances of getting infected. So, it is important for such patients to remain cautious,” said Dr DK Gupta, chairman, Felix hospital. Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, Government Institute of Medical Sciences, Greater Noida, said that irregular treatment regime for TB patients for over a year now may also be a reason for increased infections. “With the entire health care system being occupied with Covid management, treatment and regular medicine distribution for tuberculosis patients have been somewhat neglected. This has been the case for several other chronic diseases as well, but for TB treatment to work, regularity is important. So, it is possible that such patients are more compromised,” Gupta said. With regards to the Covid-19 vaccine, the district has administered about 3,671,000 doses so far which include 2,132,000 first doses, 1,511,000 second doses and over 28,000 precautionary doses. Over 75,000 children in the 15-18 age group have also been vaccinated, the data shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-reports-364-new-covid-cases-least-since-january-4-101643630009024.html
31-01-2022||Noida||Noida: BJP deploys senior leaders to counter SP-RLD strategy in Jewar||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has deployed senior leaders in Jewar to counter the Samajwadi Party (SP) –Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) alliance’s strategy of using the King Mihir Bhoj issue during campaigning to unite Gurjar voters in the Jewar assembly segment.SP-RLD alliance candidate Avtar Singh Bhadana, a Gurjar himself, is taking on incumbent MLA and BJP candidate Dhirendra Singh, who belongs to the Rajput community, in what political experts believe is going to be a tough fight in the constituency.In September 2021, a row was triggered after the caste name of Gurjar was removed from the plaque beneath the statue of King Mihir Bhoj that was erected at a college in Dadri, about 20km away from Jewar. The 15-foot statue of the ninth-century ruler was unveiled by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on September 22, 2021.Soon after the event, Gurjars started a series of protests after their caste name was dropped from the plaque. Later, the community formed a group to fight for the inclusion of the caste on the plaque and also decided to vote against BJP in these assembly polls.Bhadana and his supporters are raising this issue at village meetings to mobilise Gurjar voters in his favour, sources said.There are at least 50,000 Gurjar voters, of a total around 3.2 lakh (320,000) voters in Jewar. The Rajput community has about 70,000 voters and the BJP is anticipating a tough fight from the SP-RLD candidate. Bhadana supporters, meanwhile, are also banking on 20,000 Muslim voters and the 24,000 Jat voters to win the seat.To counter this crisis and win over Gurjar voters, the BJP has deployed two senior leaders-- Member of Parliament for Rajya Sabha Surendra Nagar and UP transport minister Ashok Kataria--to reach out to those who are upset with the BJP regarding the King Mihir Bhoj issue.According to party workers, BJP has asked the two leaders, both Gurjars with considerable influence over the community, to visit Gurjar-dominated villages in all constituencies, including Jewar. Nagar, who is also vice-president of UP’s BJP unit, visited many Gurjar-dominated villages last week , including Bironda, Murshadpur and Sikandrabad, to appeal to people to vote for Dhirendra Singh in Jewar.“We are telling people that this election is not to elect an MLA or chief minister, but to work together to make UP the most prosperous state of the country. The BJP government has worked for all communities without dividing people on caste or religious lines like other parties. We are telling people why they need to join hands and vote for the betterment of the state. The Opposition’s effort to divide people on petty or caste issues will not work,” said Nagar, who is in charge of “effective voter communication” in all western UP seats, including Gautam Budh Nagar, Bulandshahr and Meerut.The BJP has also asked Faridabad MP Krishan Pal Gurjar, union minister for state for heavy industries, to hold small meetings and influence Gurjar voters, party workers said.Meanwhile, Avtar Singh Bhadana said the BJP’s effort will not work because people are “fed up with the party”.“The BJP has not worked for the people and divided people on the lines of caste and religion. People will teach them a lesson in this election no matter what they do now,” said Bhadana.Political experts say the contest in Jewar is a direct fight between the BJP and the SP-RLD combine.“There is a direct contest between BJP and SP-RLD in Jewar, and other candidates from Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party are fighting for third position. Now it is to be seen whether people will vote above caste lines,” said Bipin Sharma, a political analyst and senior journalist.

31-01-2022||Pune||Monday Musings: The politics of wine in Maharashtra||PUNE During the winter of 2005, when the Grape Growers Association held its annual general meeting at Gultekdi in Pune, none in the media had expected that they will get a big story out of the event. The National Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar was delivering the speech, and by five minutes he was to finish it, not much had transpired.Finally, before he concluded the speech, Pawar said if the grape growers have to raise their income, they should grow the variety that can be sent to wineries. His next comment: And the wine made of it should be allowed to be sold in grocery shop – “Let wine flow like cola”. When the news appeared in media, it stirred up a storm as opposition including Shiv Sena, which was then the main position party with Ramdas Kadam being the leader of the opposition, launched a caustic attack against Pawar and his party. It was a different matter that Kadam owned a bar at Kandivali in Mumbai, and, after latest government decision, allegations are made by BJP’s Kirit Somaiya that the new policy will benefit Shiv Sena leaders like Sanjay Raut as his family has stakes in the wine business owned by prominent industrialist. Raut has refuted the charges though. More than 15 years later when the state government has allowed the wine to be sold in supermarkets and walk-in stores across Maharashtra, we know that its seeds were sown in 2005.These shops, once the new policy is implemented, will be able to sell wine at a flat annual licensing fee of ₹ 5,000. The decision has predictably invited criticism from opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has called the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s move to turn Maharashtra into a “liquor capital.”Whether one supports the government decision or not, wine has always been close to those in power. Its formal introduction into government policy was made 21 years ago when the Congress-NCP government was then headed by Vilasrao Deshmukh who introduced the Maharashtra State Grape Processing Policy 2001. Wary of being politically incorrect, the Vilasrao Deshmukh government at that time avoided using wine into its title and instead restricted it to grapes, which the farmers related with more.The policy was introduced to give a fillip to the nascent industry growing around the Pune-Nashik belt. The policy offered a tax holiday for the wine produced in Maharashtra for two decades that ended this month. It also offered a slew of other concessions to the wine sector, including no stamp duty and registration and land at concessional rates. While the policy helped wine production in Maharashtra from 712 kL in 2002-03 to over 20 million litres in 2008-09, with the number of wineries jumping to over 75 in the same period.Those were the heydays of wine production in Maharashtra as many among those connected to political leaders saw wine as a vehicle to add value to their crop. After all, the reasoning went that wine grapes fetched only ₹25 a kilogram, while wine was selling for ₹300 per bottle, and if there was no excise duty involved, one would be able to make a tidy profit.If Vijay Mallya’s father Vittal Mallya collaborated with Dr Rossi to start producing Cinzano vermouths at Baramati, his son as the chairman of UB Group, too saw the same logic when he strived to launch wine tourism in Baramati, Pawar’s pocket borough, through Four Season winery in 2007-08. The winery had a 51 per cent stake of United Spirits and 49 per cent of local grape growers backed by Pawar.In neighbouring Akluj village in Solapur district, the two Mohite-Patil brothers – NCP leader Vijaysinh Mohite Patil’s sons Ranjitsinh and Arjunsinh who are currently with BJP - joined hands with Delhi’s Sekhri brothers and an Italian family to produce Fratelli. But it was Sham Chougule of Indage who pioneered the first genuine wine and set up a winery at Narayangaon although Sula wine from Nashik became the country’s top brand as the founder Rajeev Samant understood the Indian market better.However, the falling demand due to global recession and higher taxes in key markets played havoc in 2009-10 and 2010-11 as it led to a glut in the wine market, eventually resulting in Maharashtra’s big bang wine story going sour. The market flooded with an oversupply of wine amid demand not picking up forced many wineries to stop producing wine in 2009-10. Another reason that adversely affected the market was farmers were encouraged to cultivate wine grapes like table grapes which increased their yield. However, wine requires the opposite approach, with relentless pruning and discarding of grapes to focus only on the best. Most of the vineyards ended up producing poor wine, which would have no chance in the export market and even falls short in the developing domestic.Today, if the country has over 110 wineries, around 75 of them are in Maharashtra although only 40 to 45 are operational currently. Of these, just around 15 to 20 units are into direct marketing, while the rest are involved in contract manufacturing.If the MVA wants to promote wine to help grape cultivators, the BJP too has its share in it even as it is opposing the latest decision currently.In a bid to promote wines made in the 40-odd vineyards and wineries in Nashik district in north Maharashtra, the Maharashtra government, then headed by Devendra Fadnavis, had organised its first wine festival — ‘India Grape Harvest, Wine Festival’ during February 2018. The festival, aimed at promoting agro and wine tourism, was an initiative of the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC), a government subsidiary that works for tourism development in the state.Despite all promotional measures, wine consumption in the state during the financial year for 2020-21 was just around 70 lakh litres. The beer consumption on the other hand stood at 30 crore litres, country liquor 32 crore litres and Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) at 20 crore litres. The wineries hope that with the government allowing the sale of wine at departmental stores, its consumption will increase.

This is not based on newspaper reports. There are preventive measures laid down," Jaisingh said.The contempt petition was filed by former Rajya Sabha MP Mohammad Adeeb stating that Haryana authorities have failed to comply with the directions issued by the Supreme Court in the case, where it had issued a slew of directions in 2018 to control and prevent the increasing number of hate crimes, including mob violence and lynching.The contempt plea had said that in the few recent months, there has been a constant rise in incidents revolving around the Friday prayers offered by Muslims at the behest of certain "identifiable hooligans", who portray themselves falsely in the name of religion and seek to create an atmosphere of hatred and prejudice against one community across the city.The contempt petition had sought action against the Chief Secretary and the Director-General of Police of State of Haryana, Sanjeev Kaushal IAS and PK Agrawal IPS respectively.Later, Surjit Singh Yadav, Vice President of Hindu Sena, filed an application opposing the contempt action against officers of the Haryana government for their alleged inaction against the disruptions of namaz prayers in Gurugram.Yadav, filing intervention also sought directions on refreshment from offering namaz on public property in the Districts of Gurugram, Haryana."That the judgement rendered by this Court in the case of Tehseen S. Poonawalla is law of the land and each and every citizen in respective caste and religion have to follow. Therefore, in grab of offering namaz prayer, they cannot create a situation which sets out a platform for others to lodge a protest," the application had stated.It had added, "Indian society is a society of multi-religious people and therefore, members of each community have to follow the principle of self-restraint to maintain law and order situation. The Applicant has experienced that the assembly of a large number of people at one place to show religious supremacy creates a situation for law and order problems. Therefore, the Petitioner and his associate must impose upon themselves self restrain from encroaching public land or public property for offering namaz prayer."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/namaz-case-sc-agrees-to-hear-plea-for-contempt-action-against-haryana-officials-101643621547008.html

No surprises then that in Delhi-NCR, there are weddings aplenty scheduled on the date. On the popularity of the date, astrologer Sarita Mishra explains, “February 5 is the abhuj muhurta. Shubh muhurta is considered to have special significance in the scriptures. On such dates, there is no need to see the muhurta, that is, the entire day is considered best. This is the last abhuj marriage muhurta [for now] as for the next one, we would have to wait for four months.We are expecting 5,000-10,000 marriages in Delhi-NCR on February 5.”To this, Delhi-based pandit Ram Meher adds, “Lag-bhag 10,000-15,000 shaadiyan honi chahiye iss din.

At least 33 people died on Sunday. The positivity rate was 6%.In December, the poll watchdog informed the Calcutta high court that it proposes to hold elections to five municipalities - Asansol, Bidhannagar, Siliguri, Howrah, and Chandannagar - on January 22. It added elections to the remaining 106 civic bodies will be conducted on February 27.Elections to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation were held on December 19. A plea filed in the high court cited the pandemic situation and sought the postponement of the polls to remaining civic bodies. This month, the watchdog issued a fresh notification saying the polls to the five municipalities would be held on February 12 instead of January 22. The commission is yet to announce the dates of the elections to the remaining civic bodies.The daily count of Covid-19 cases shot up over 24,000 and the positivity rate touched 36%. The cases have dropped over the past two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-to-seek-postponement-of-bengal-civic-polls-101643605406702.html
31-01-2022||Patna||Patna’s active workforce getting infected with Covid-19 the most||PATNA: The active workforce in the age group of 25-49 years accounted for 51.5% of Patna’s 2,599 active Covid-19 cases on Thursday, which was almost one-fifth of the active cases in Bihar and the highest among the state’s 38 districts, said officials familiar with the development.The positivity rate of 21% is also on the higher side in this age group, pointing to the fact that the office goers and business professionals are the ones getting infected the most to Covid-19 during the third wave of the pandemic in Patna. The figure goes up further if the 24% positivity rate in the 50-74 years age group is taken into account.Government doctors in Bihar superannuate at the age of 67 years.Interestingly, most symptomatic cases are also from this age group, accounting for 2.8% of the 5% cases reported from Patna during the last 24 hours on Thursday.“The silver lining, however, is that hospitalisation of patients due to complications arising from Omicron, which is now the dominant strain of Covid-19, is down to less than 1% of the cases in the third wave, as compared to 7-12% during the second wave of the pandemic,” said Chandrashekhar Singh, district magistrate of Patna.Between April and May last year, the peak of the second wave of the pandemic, 5,544 patients, infected by the virus, were hospitalised in Patna, Singh added.“The possibility of the active age group getting infected is higher this time since infectivity rate is seven times higher in Omicron, which is the predominant strain of the virus during the present third wave, as compared to the Delta variant in the second wave of the pandemic last year. This age group becomes susceptible of contracting the virus because it is the active people who step out of homes more frequently and come in contact with many people, a large number of whom may be infected but asymptomatic and be carriers of SARS CoV-2. Though infectivity is higher, lethality or the severity of infection, is less in the third wave as compared to the second,” said Dr Umesh Kumar Bhadani, professor and head of anaesthesiology and dean (academics), AIIMS-Patna.“The infection this time is primarily confined to the upper respiratory tract, with common symptoms such as moderate to high fever, cough, back ache and body pain. Moreover, with over 80% of the eligible population (15 years and above) having got the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, it has helped build antibodies, reducing the fatality rate as compared to the second wave,” he added.Though the positivity rate of SARS CoV-2 infection was highest 30% in the 75-99 years age group, Dr Bhadani attributed it to co-morbidity of senior citizens.“Senior citizens, with co-morbidity, have compromised immunity. Most would have contracted the virus in course of going to meet the doctor at the hospital or clinic for the treatment of their primary disease,” said Dr Bhadani.A high 96% Covid-19 cases are now asymptomatic in Patna, as compared to 94% during the third wave of the pandemic, according to the government data.As high as 95.66% of the asymptomatic cases in Patna are now from the office-going active age group from 18-71 years, as compared to 94.33% during the second wave, the government data said.Most of the active cases are from the densely populated urban areas while their number is comparatively less in rural and sparsely populated areas, reveals a block-wise analysis of Patna district.“There are ventilation issues in closed rooms, like school, air-conditioned office, shopping mall, cinema hall, etc. The SARS CoV-2 virus remains suspended in the air for longer duration inside a closed room as compared to an open area. Besides, Covid-19 cases are more in crowded urban areas, having higher population density, as compared to villages, where there are more open areas and better ventilation,” said Mansoon Mohanty, team lead, Patna district resource unit, Care India, which has been partnering the government of Bihar in its health initiatives.Patna’s recovery rate was around 86% as compared to the state’s 96.97%.Lesser inhabited blocks, with far less medical support system, like Daniyawan, Ghoswari, Dhanarua, Bakhtiyarpur, Masaurhi, Belchi, Pandarak and Athmalgola had better recovery percentage than Patna, though in absolute number the cases were far less among the 23 blocks of Patna district.

Rajender Parsad Dangi, divisional wildlife officer, Gurugram, confirmed the development and said that the leopard succumbed to the injuries on Sunday. “When our staff had rescued the leopard, it was unable to move. The leopard suffered a fracture in its left leg and spinal cord due to which it was unable to move. The animal had sustained grave injuries and it was also facing problem in breathing during the treatment,” said Dangi. Officials on Saturday said that the leopard may have met with an accident on the KMP expressway three days ago, but had entered a field to take shelter and could not move further due to the grave injuries. In the past too, leopard deaths have been reported from Gurugram and nearby districts after allegedly being hit by vehicles. In June last year, a two-year-old female leopard was found dead on Pali-Surajkund road near Gurugram with autopsy reports suggesting it may have been hit by a vehicle. This was the seventh leopard death to be reported from this region since 2015. In October 2019, a one and half-year-old female leopard was killed by a truck on NH-48 in Manesar. Activists have been demanding wildlife friendly measures, such as construction of underpasses on highways passing through the Aravallis, which has a good population of leopards. Vaishali Rana, a city-based environmentalist said, “We lost another leopard due to lack of wildlife friendly roads. I have been writing to the department for over two years now to construct wildlife underpasses at key points as Aravallis have a good population of leopards.Due to lack of proper checks, we are losing our wildlife.” In 2017, the Wildlife Institute of India, in a study titled ‘Mapping landuse/landcover Patterns in Aravallis Haryana’ concerning the status of key wildlife species, had mentioned, “Highways passing through the wildlife habitats have adversely affected the fauna in these forests. Fast moving vehicles kill these animals when they move across these road stretches.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/2yrold-leopard-hit-by-speeding-vehicle-on-kmp-expressway-succumbs-to-injuries-101643576844436.html

31-01-2022||Gurugram||Over 28,000 birds found in Sultanpur national park during 2nd statewide bird count||The state wildlife department on Sunday said that more than 28,000 birds of 124 different species were spotted at the Sultanpur national park, during the second statewide bird count. MS Malik, chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Gurugram circle, said besides Sultanpur park, the bird count was carried out at Bhindawas bird sanctuary and Najafgarh Jheel, and other wetlands in the state. Malik said, “A total of 28,026 birds of 126 different species were seen only at the Sultanpur park. The count of birds observed at other sites is still being recorded.” The bird count that began at 9:30am at Sultanpur on Sunday, he said. Malik said, “Information collated from these counts will help us in planning better wildlife management strategies.” Some of the bird species observed at Sultanpur park on Sunday include the Greater spotted eagle, Common kestrel, White-tailed lapwing, Black-tailed godwit, among others, officials of the forest department said. “Over 28,000 birds were spotted at Sultanpur national park during the bird count on Sunday. The focus was on Ramsar sites but the bird count was conducted at all wetlands of the state. Sighting of so many species shows that the habitat is in good shape and this will help us maintain a baseline data,” said Rajesh Chahal, wildlife inspector of Gurugram. In 2020 winter baseline count, 213 species of birds were observed in Gurugram district. In August last year, the Sultanpur national park was notified as a Ramsar site--a wetland of international importance notified by the Union ministry of environment. The Bhindawas wildlife sanctuary was also notified as a Ramsar site, making these two the first such sites in Haryana. Experts said such bird counts are a welcome move as they help create a database which can be used further for enhancing the habitats or wetlands. Pankaj Gupta, a birder with the Delhi Bird Foundation said, “It is good that such statewide bird counts are being conducted as it helps in creating an official database, which can be used in future for the protection and conservation of wetlands. This year, sighting of birds, such as the Great bittern and Penduline tit in wetlands around Sultanpur is interesting as they are being spotted regularly since the past two months, which is not usual for Delhi-NCR.” Nikhil Devasar, founder of Delhi Bird Foundation, said, “Sighting of 124 species of birds in just Sultanpur national park is good news. On an average, over 100 different species are sighted during morning bird walks. This is just the number for the protected area, more birds are definitely there in wetlands outside the boundary of the protected area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/over-28-000-birds-found-in-sultanpur-national-park-during-2nd-statewide-bird-count-101643576184250.html
31-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiwale: From the old age of movies||The ticket seller is sitting outside the cinema theatre. His chair is placed on the cozy, sunlit driveway. Romy, the dog, is lounging lazily beside him. A few men enter the cinema’s gate. The box office windows are closed. They walk straight to the seller, who takes out a sheaf of cinema tickets from his shirt pocket and starts handing them one by one, on the payment of 30 rupees. Soon, half a dozen men step inside the main door for the afternoon show, here in Gurugram’s single-screen Raj Cinema, since the 1950s.Now, somebody will have to start the screening. In most other theatres, that process has been computerised. No staff is specifically employed to operate the projector, or change the film’s many reels during the course of a single show. Of course there might still be a person in the projector room, but their job is to press a few keys on the computer.In this regard, Raj Cinema is old-fashioned. It continues to rely on the services of a projector operator. The reel of the movie have been with the cinema for a long time.“I’ve been working here for many years,” says Vinod Das, a native of Samastipur in Bihar. In his late 20s, he has a friendly but quiet temperament. He agrees to show the working of the projection room, and politely guides his interlocutor to the cinema’s back area — as if escorting a guest to his drawing room.The rear side of the cinema compound is huge, overgrown with bushes and unwieldy trees. Mr Das shows no haste, though he is aware that the handful of spectators in the auditorium must be waiting for the movie to start. “Most of them are regulars, they come daily to pass the time, they like sitting, they are in no hurry,” he says.He passes by a yard littered with discarded furniture. Next, he climbs a twirly staircase, walks through a narrow corridor, and opens a door on the left. This is the projection room. The walls are covered with old calendars and posters of gods. The center pieces are the two gigantic black projectors.With practised gestures, Mr Das starts to fiddle around with one of the projectors. He opens a lid on one side of it, puts his hand inside, and begins to adjust some fixture. “I live in the compound, I cook my own meals.” He now opens the flap of a disc-like thing at the top, and presto — the movie’s reel pops out into his hands, which he expertly feeds into another space in the projector. He continues to carry out a series of operations, making a lot of tik-tak sounds. Finally, the movie begins.This is the moment when Mr Das finally stills his hands, smiling shyly. He seems at peace, as if pleased that things went so smoothly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-from-the-old-age-of-movies-101643576034342.html

The chief minister on Sunday held a meeting with MCG officials at the PWD Guest House, where he suggested that municipal corporation to work in coordination with the GMDA and ensure the mechanised sweeping system is operated and monitored with ease and is utilised effectively, said officials in the know of the matter. Earlier on late Saturday evening, Khattar inspected the MCG control room and the GMDA’s integrated command and control centre to check their functioning and operation of the sweeping machines. The chief minister asked for a detailed report from the MCG regarding the functioning of the machines. Dr Vaishali Sharma, additional commissioner of MCG, said they gave a detailed presentation to the CM on how the mechanised sweeping trucks operate at night in the city. “We briefed him about the routes of the trucks, how the routes were selected and the GPS system used to track the machines. The chief minister asked us to set up a monitoring station at GMDA’s control centre and we will take steps in this direction,” she said. A spokesperson for the district administration said during his visit to the GMDA office on Saturday, Khattar conducted a detailed enquiry into the operation of the CCTV cameras across the city, the functioning of which is monitored by the integrated command and control centre. He also sought detailed explanation about the functioning of vehicle tracking system and other functions. These facilities will be reviewed by the CM after a month, said the spokesperson. During his interaction with senior GMDA officials, Khttar also directed that facial recognition system should be started at the ICCC for keeping a watch on suspicious persons and activities using the CCTV cameras installed across the city. Khattar said such a system has already been made functional in Karnal, which is also his hometown. He also suggested that operations of the city bus service be monitored from the control centre.

The encounters between militants and security forces, including the police, army and the CRPF, started on Saturday evening in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district and central Kashmir’s Budgam district. The officials said the encounters culminated in the wee hours on Sunday with the killing of four militants of JeM at Pulwama and one member of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) at Budgam.“During the past 12 hours, two successful anti-terrorist operations were conducted by the police and security forces in Pulwama and Budgam districts resulting in the elimination of five terrorists linked to proscribed terror outfits JeM and LeT. The killed terrorists include a top JeM commander Zahid Wani and a foreign Pakistani terrorist Kafeel Bhai, alias Chotu,” said inspector general of police, Kashmir, Vijay Kumar.“The elimination of the most wanted terrorists is a big success for us,” he said.This year the security forces have achieved major successes against the militants.“During the current year, so far 21 terrorists, including eight Pakistanis, have been killed in 11 encounters and 13 among them were affiliated to JeM outfit,” Kumar said in a press conference.The police said that they first launched a joint cordon and search operation along with the army’s 55 RR and CRPF’s 182/183 Battalion after getting information regarding the presence of terrorists in village Naira of Pulwama.A police spokesman said that the hiding militants fired indiscriminately on the joint search parties. However, due to darkness and to ensure the safety of the civilians trapped inside the cordon area, the joint parties “exercised maximum restraint”. “After the evacuation of the civilians to safer places, the fire was retaliated leading to an encounter. In the ensuing encounter, four terrorists were killed and their bodies were retrieved from the site of the encounter,” the spokesman said.The four have been identified as members of JeM which include Zahid Ahmad Wani alias Uzair, a top commander from south Kashmir’s Karimabad, Pulwama, Kafeel Bhari, alias Chotu, a resident of Pakistan, Waheed Ahmad Reshi, a resident of Khadermoh, Kakapora in Pulwama, and Inayat Ahmad Mir, a resident of Naira, Pulwama.Zahid Wani was a categorised militant active since May-2017 and was involved in several militant crime cases, including attacks on security forces and civilian atrocities. “He was involved in various attacks on patrolling parties of the army at Below, Rajpora, Tiken, Pulwama, Parigam, Pulwama besides a grenade attack on police station, Pulwama, and firing upon CRPF camp at Rajpora,” the spokesman said.Wani was also “involved in the killing” of a civilian, Azad Ahmad Dar of Kangan Pulwama.“Moreover, the terrorist Zahid Wani was also instrumental in motivating the gullible youth to join terror folds and other criminal activities,” the spokesman said.The police also said that Zahid Wani was one of the masterminds behind various IED attacks in the region.“The killed foreign terrorist Kafeel Bhai was operating in the Pulwama and Shopian belts and involved in a series of terror crime cases. The killed terrorist Waheed Ahmad was active since 2021 while as Inayat Ahmad had joined terror folds recently,” the spokesman said.IGP Vijay Kumar said that Inayat Ahmad was a ‘hybrid terrorist’ as he along with three militants was killed in his own house. “Last year, we were mocked for coining the term ‘hybrid terrorist’. This is the best example that there are many such people who accompany terrorists but their names are not on our lists. Such people get killed in encounters and when we check their devices digitally, we see how much they were involved,” Kumar said.The IGP said that Inayat was given an opportunity to come out and his family also made an announcement from outside but he did not come out. “He was moving around with terrorists and he was killed in his own house. We will file a UAPA case and book his family as well,” Kumar said.The forces recovered arms and ammunition, including an M4 rifle, two AK series rifles and two pistols, from the site of the Pulwama encounter. “As the joint search parties were approaching towards the suspected spot, the hiding terrorist started firing indiscriminately on the search parties which was retaliated leading to an encounter,” the spokesman said.“In the ensuing encounter, the hiding terrorist identified as Bilal Ahmad Khan resident of Chill Brass Khansahab was killed and his body was retrieved from the site of encounter,” he said.As per police records, he was a categorised militant linked to proscribed outfit LeT (TRF) and part of a group involved in several militant crime cases. The police said that arms and ammunition including an AK-56 rifle, two AK Magazines and five AK rounds have been recovered from the site of the Budgam encounter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jem-commander-among-five-militants-killed-in-jammu-and-kashmir-101643575705171.html
31-01-2022||Gurugram||Two held for assaulting man over ‘personal enmity’ in Faridabad||The Faridabad Police on Saturday arrested two accused for allegedly assaulting a man with iron rods outside a dhaba in the Huda market on Thursday.The two accused, identified as Nikki and Arjun, who were in an inebriated state, were arrested for thrashing the victim “over personal enmity”.Police said locals caught hold of Sahil, another accused in the case while he was trying to escape after committing the crime and handed him over to cops on Thursday itself.A video of the incident was shared widely on social media platforms on Friday, following which teams were formed and the arrests made.Police said the three accused met in a gym and became friends. They used to meet every evening and get high on alcohol.Accused Arjun runs a shop and sells supplements to gym goers and used to persuade them to buy products from him. The three were produced before the Faridabad court and were sent to 14-day judicial custody, said police.Narender Kadiyan, the deputy commissioner of police (DCP) (crime) said that the incident took place when Tosim alias Waseem, a resident of Mawai village in Faridabad’s Kheripul, had gone out for dinner with his friends. “An altercation took place between him and the trio, which soon took an ugly turn. The three accused brutally assaulted Tosim, whose friends shied away from rescuing him,” he said.“The three accused were inebriated and started the fight intentionally. One of them took an iron rod used in the tandoor for making rotis and attacked Tosim with it,” Kadiyan said.According to police, Tosim suffered severe injuries and was seen pleading with the accused to leave him alone in the video, but no one in the eatery came to his rescue.Later, a PCR van on duty reached the spot and Tosim was taken to a nearby private hospital, where he is undergoing treatment, police said.A case under Sections 323 (assault), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was lodged at the Old Faridabad police station on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/two-held-for-assaulting-man-over-personal-enmity-in-faridabad-101643575464228.html
31-01-2022||Noida||Noida police arrest two for murdering Dadri resident||Gautam Budh Nagar police on Saturday arrested two people for allegedly murdering a resident of Dadri. Police said the suspects took the victim to Meerut on the pretext of getting him a job but later killed him with the motive of stealing his money.According to police, the deceased, 40-year-old Aslam (identified by his first name), ran a hardware shop in Green Park colony in Dadri. On January 19, his wife Sahina gave a written complaint to Badalpur police saying that Aslam was missing since January 12.“As per the complaint, Aslam called Sahina on January 12 from his shop saying that he is going to look for another job and will come home late. However, he did not return and his mobile was switched off, following which his family members filed a missing complaint,” said Dinesh Kumar, station house officer at Badalpur police station.During investigation, police found CCTV footage from the area near Aslam’s shop and found Aslam leaving the place on a two-wheeler with his acquaintance Vinesh (47), a resident of Chapraula village in Dadri.“When Vinesh was questioned, he said he dropped Aslam in Ghaziabad’s Lal Kuan on January 12 and was not in touch with him since then. Vinesh was let go after questioning. However, after further investigation and electronic surveillance, we suspected Vinesh’s role and called him again for questioning on January 28,” said Kumar.Vinesh confessed to the police that he took Aslam to Meerut on his scooter on the pretext of getting him a high paying job there. On the way, Vinesh also picked his friend Rajesh Kumar (30) from Partapur in Meerut, where he was working as a security guard at an under construction Metro project.“Both the accused knew that Aslam had recently taken a loan of ₹5 lakh from the bank. They knew about his bank account, which was linked to his mobile phone. With the motive of transferring the loan amount to their own accounts, Vinesh and Rajesh hatched a conspiracy to kill Aslam and then use his mobile to transfer the money. On the night of January 12, they killed Aslam and buried his body at an isolated area in Meerut. However, they could not transfer the money from his account,” said the police officer.After interrogating Vinesh, police also picked Rajesh from his residence in Meerut. On Saturday, Aslam’s body was recovered from the spot where the accused had buried his body and handed it over to his family after post mortem. Vinesh and Rajesh have been booked for murder and under relevant sections of the IPC, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-police-arrest-two-for-murdering-dadri-resident-101643575404214.html
31-01-2022||Chandigarh||BJP trying to remove Mahatma Gandhi’s ideology: Ghulam Ahmed Mir||Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee chief Ghulam Ahmed Mir on Sunday claimed that the BJP was trying to remove Mahatma Gandhi’s ideology. Leading party leaders here to pay tributes to Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi at Gandhi Chowk, Satwari, he recalled the great contributions of Mahatma Gandhi in India’s freedom struggle. “The entire world learns from the philosophy of Gandhi which has awakened the world and taught everyone to live in co-existence. However, some forces in this country were and are against his philosophy. The ideology and philosophy that killed Gandhi have to be defeated to keep this country united and maintain peace and harmony,” he said in an indirect reference to the BJP. “Congress workers and every right-thinking citizen has to strengthen the philosophy of Gandhi to defeat the radical forces,” he added. Mir also regretted that the home ministry’s order regarding observing martyrs’ day on Sunday, “deliberately” omitted the name of Mahatma Gandhi from the list. “It shows the respect of the present government towards Mahatma Gandhi,” he said. Working president of the JKPCC Raman Bhalla said Gandhi was an institution and a philosophy, which can’t be killed, though he was assassinated on this day in 1948 physically. “The philosophy of Gandhi is more relevant today and the philosophy that killed Gandhi has to be defeated and killed to live in peace and harmony in this country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-trying-to-remove-mahatma-gandhi-s-ideology-ghulam-ahmed-mir-101643575344266.html

The area is being developed by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA).Officials said despite repeated reminders to get proper permission from the GMDA before executing their work, the executives did not pay any heed and continued to lay cables, following which the damage was caused.A case was registered at the Palam Vihar police station under Section 120 B (conspiracy) and Section 3 of the PDPP (The Prevention of Damage to Public Property) Act.LK Bhatia, a sub-divisional engineer with the GMDA, said that the agency lodged a complaint on January 10, against the telecom executives identified as Jasbir Singh and Satbir for damaging the greenbelt on the Old Delhi Road.“Singh had laid pipes and cables for a private company without getting permission from the GMDA. He was asked verbally several times to get permission from the department. Again, on the night of January 26, both laid pipes and cables for the telecom company without seeking the required permission for the same,” Bhatia said.Bhatia said a complaint was received by the higher authorities of the GMDA and a junior engineer was directed to take prompt action and remove the cables. Later, an FIR was also lodged against both the accused.GMDA officials said they removed the cables on Sunday from Rani Shower to the CNG pump on the Old Delhi Road.Police said they have registered a case against the duo for damaging government property by digging land in the greenbelt without getting valid permission from the GMDA.“The suspects were encroaching government land and despite repeated warnings, they continued to lay underground cables,” said Jitender Kumar, the station house officer (SHO) at the Palam Vihar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-two-of-private-company-booked-for-damage-to-greenbelt-101643575166032.html

31-01-2022||Noida||Owaisi targets SP, BJP during election campaign in Ghaziabad||Lashing out at the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP), All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday said that leaders of both the parties are playing “politics of polarisation” and trying to appease a certain section of the society.Owaisi, who was in Ghaziabad to campaign for his party’s two candidates -- Manmohan Jha from Sahibabad and Mehtab (uses single name) from Loni -- said this while talking to reporters later in the day. The AIMIM has announced an alliance -- Bhagidari Parivartan Morcha -- with former UP minister Babu Singh Kushwaha’s Jan Adhikaar Party, and other small parties, which claim to have a support base among the backward classes, Dalits and minority communities. Owaisi has said that the alliance will contest 100 seats in the upcoming seven-phase Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. Ghaziabad goes to polls in the first phase on February 10.Owaisi said the Muslim voter base was not the captive of any party, and that his party had emerged as an alternative. “When we contest elections, we fight with all candidates. So, we want support from all corners for our candidates, and would like Panditji (Sahibabad candidate Manmohan Jha) to become an MLA. Yesterday [Saturday], I came to know from the media that the SP has reduced the number of tickets of Muslim candidates by 45%,” Owaisi told reporters at Shaheed Nagar in Sahibabad. Replying to a question about BJP leaders raking up issues of previous riots such as the ones in Muzaffarnagar (2013), Kairana (2014), and Bulandshahr (2018) during their election campaigns, Owaisi said: “This clearly indicates that they are playing politics of polarisation. During their election campaigns, Akhilesh Yadav (SP chief) and chief minister Yogi (Adityanath) are trying to prove who is a bigger Hindu than Prime Minister Narendra Modi.” While Jha is pitted against political heavyweights such as BJP’s sitting MLA Sunil Sharma and SP’s Amarpal Sharma among others, Mehtab has to fight against BJP’s Nand Kishor Gurjar and SP’s Madan Bhaiya, a four-time MLA, among others. When asked whether he will ally with a major political party after the elections, Owaisi ducked the question. “The Bhagidari Parivartan Morcha will be blessed by the people, and our chief minister will be Babu Singh Kushwaha,” he said. Speaking of his plan for the Sahibabad constituency, AIMIM candidate Jha said, “Our party represents every section of the society. If I win, I will try to set up a government hospital in Sahibabad. I will also work to provide water supply to Khoda Colony,” Jha said. Originally from Bihar, Jha presently lives in Shaheed Nagar. Meanwhile, BJP rubbished the charges levelled by the AIMIM chief. “We are doing the politics of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’. We don’t do politics of caste or religion. Our development works have benefitted every section of society, including the minorities,” said Dinesh Singhal, Ghaziabad district president of BJP. SP leaders also said that they have garnered support from every section of society. “We are getting support from every section and class of people. Muslim voters are also with the SP,” said Rashid Malik, district president of SP. Political experts viewed this as the AIMIM‘s attempt to make inroads in western UP. “Owaisi’s alliance will get minorities‘ votes, but it is to be seen how much difference it makes. Owaisi’s party is still trying to make inroads in western UP,” said KK Sharma, associate professor (history) at MM College, Modinagar. 
31-01-2022||Chandigarh||Mohali: Dera Bassi candidates have an edge in terms of educational qualification||While Dera Bassi has the notorious distinction of having the most candidates with criminal cases, it also has something to take pride in – the educational qualification of the candidates in fray for the upcoming assembly elections.Dera BassiOf the three assembly seats in Mohali district, Dera Bassi is the only one where four out of the five candidates fielded by main political parties have an educational qualification of graduation or above. The graduates on this seat include Kuljeet Singh Randhawa of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), NK Sharma of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) who has a science degree from Panjab University (PU), Navjot Singh Saini of Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM) who has completed his graduation and is currently pursuing law from PU, and Congress candidate Deepinder Singh Dhillon, a law graduate. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate Sanjeev Khanna has studied till the intermediate-level (Class-12). MohaliIn Mohali assembly seat, former mayor Kulwant Singh, who has studied only till Class-10, is the least qualified candidate across all seats. After him come former Punjab health minister and Congress candidate Balbir Singh Sidhu and SAD candidate Parvinder Singh Sohana who have studied till the intermediate-level. They are up against BJP’s Sanjeev Vashisht, a B.Tech degree-holder from Bangalore, and SSM candidate Ravneet Singh Brar, who has completed MBA from Amity University.KhararIn the Kharar assembly seat, SAD candidate Ranjit Singh Gill, Congress candidate Vijay Kumar Sharma, Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) candidate Kamaldeep Saini are graduates, while AAP candidate Anmol Gagan Mann and SSM candidate Paramdeep Singh Baidwan have studied till Class-12.So does educational qualification matter?Three-time MLA and former cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, who mentioned in his affidavit that he has studied till the second year of Bachelor of Arts, says that it the political experience that counts. “I could not complete my graduation due to some personal reasons. But what I lack in terms of education, I make up for it with my vast political experience. I have been an MLA for the last 15 years and worked for the development of the city,” he says. BJP candidate Sanjeev Vashisht, a B.Tech holder, begs to differ. “To bring qualitative improvement in the working of the system, there is a need to have qualified candidates. I have decided to contest elections to improve my city as it faces several issues.”Balwinder Singh, a sarpanch of Lakhnaur village, says, “Education is important but many of these leaders can beat even the most-qualified persons with their vast political experience.”
31-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chillai Kalan, Kashmir’s harshest winter period, warmer this year: Experts||Kashmir’s harshest first stage of winter, Chillai Kalan ended on Sunday with the sun playing hide and seek from the partly cloudy sky.The weather observers say that the 40-day Chillai Kalan this year was less severe than the past three years.“This Chillai Kalan was relatively warmer and we didn’t experience extreme sub-zero temperatures particularly in the city. The precipitation was also less. The mild snow layer didn’t sustain on city surfaces leading to dry weather while the skies remained mostly cloudy,” said IMD meteorologist Mohammad Hussain Mir.Kashmir’s winter pans out in three stages starting with Chillai Kalan from December 21 which brings most of the snowfall and sub-zero temperatures during the season followed by 20 more days which are less intense (called Chillai Khurd) and then lastly 10 days of mild cold (Chille Bache).For the past few days, the sun appeared regularly peeking through the partially cloudy skies.Director of J&K’s weather centre of the Indian meteorological department, Sonam Lotus said that weather was partly to generally cloudy at most places of J&K.He said that there was a possibility of light rain and snow on January 31 and February 1 and then on February 3.“Overall, weather is likely to remain partly to generally cloudy next week starting Monday. There is no forecast of any major weather system till the first week of February,” he said.Last year, the winter had prolonged with snowfall starting in November which had damaged apple and saffron crop, uprooted trees and led to the loss of lives of 19 persons, including 10 soldiers, in many snow-related accidents and avalanches. Also, the minimum temperatures had dropped to record levels in Srinagar leading to freezing of water bodies and pipes carrying potable water.On December 19, 2020, the mercury had plunged to record -6.6°C in Srinagar while this winter on December 18, 2021, the weather office recorded -6.0°C in the city. However, after that the temperatures this winter mostly remained below -5.0°C. Many nights, the mercury remained above zero.“Clearly, last winter was harsh as there was very heavy snowfall in January, more than normal. This year the snowfall was less and minimum temperatures in Srinagar were also less. Overall, this Chillai Kalan was warmer and comparatively better than the past few years,” said meteorologist Farooq Ahmad Bhat.The lowest night temperature on Sunday in Kashmir was recorded in the northern ski resort of Gulmarg where mercury dropped to -7.4°C. The resort of Pahalgam in south Kashmir recorded -7.0°C.The mercury settled at -2.3°C in summer capital Srinagar during the night while it was -3-2°C in south Kashmir’s Qazigund, the gateway into Kashmir from Jammu. It was -2.8°C in Kokernag, -4.0°C in Konibal and -2.4°C in Kupwara. The day temperatures on Saturday remained lowest at Gulmarg with 0.8°C and Kupwara recording the highest of 13.8°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chillai-kalan-kashmir-s-harshest-winter-period-warmer-this-year-experts-101643574805194.html
31-01-2022||Noida||Noida: Gas pipeline may delay demolition of twin towers at Emerald Court||An 18-inch wide gas pipeline that passes through Sector 93A may delay the demolition process of twin towers at Supertech’s Emerald Court project due to safety reasons. Officials from Edifice Engineering, which got the job of demolition of the twin towers, Supertech Limited, and the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) held a meeting on Friday and discussed the need to shift the gas pipeline, which is three metres deep from the ground level, officials of Edifice said on Sunday, adding that the pipeline is just 16 metres away from the twin towers. “We had a meeting with GAIL and Supertech to discuss the technical modalities on Friday. We have realised that demolishing the two towers without taking care of gas pipeline is not possible. Therefore, we have decided that we will submit a technical report on how the vibrations of demolition will make damages to gas pipeline in the next 15 days to GAIL. And then the GAIL will tell us how we can handle these vibrations and carry out demolition without any damage to the pipeline,” said Utkarsh Mehta of Edifice Engineering. In its order on August 31, the Supreme Court gave three months to the Supertech group to demolish the towers, and directed the Noida authority and Central Building Research Institute (CBRI) to supervise the demolition work. The Supreme Court ordered the demolition of the twin towers as the structure was built in violation of building norms. Edifice, a Mumbai-based agency, finally on January 16 got the job of demolition of the two towers. The move came after the Supreme Court on January 14 pulled up the realtor for not implementing its earlier order. The apex court had pulled up the realtor for delay in hiring the agency that will demolish the towers. Supertech Limited and GAIL officials could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. 
31-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram: Police, excise officers shut ahata for operating in curfew hours||An ahata (permit room) was found running illegally beyond the permissible operation hours in Sector 56 even after the night curfew (effective in Gurugram from 11pm) came into force during a joint raid conducted by the chief minister’s flying squad and Sector 56 police late Saturday night, said police on Sunday. The police and excise officers were receiving complaints of violation of rules at the ahata for the past few months, following which a special police team was formed to raid ahatas in Sector 56. Ranvijay Sharma, owner of Refill Republic, was booked for violations while Sunil Khair, operation manager, Lalit Kumar, Tej Chand, and other employees of the ahata were arrested from the spot but later released, said police. Sharma said that he was out of town on Saturday and had received a call regarding the violations. “Currently, my outlet is closed due to the raid and the employees were bailed out after verification. We had no plan to organise a party till late; we were about to shut for the day when the officers raided the spot,” he said. Deputy superintendent of police (crime) Inderjeet Yadav said they received information that some 60 -70 people are holding a party at the ahata and were playing loud music, following which they informed Sector 56 police and a raid was conducted. “When we reached, we found around 30 cars parked outside the ahata and a party was going on in full swing,” he said. Yadav said they questioned the employees, who told them that the owner of the ahata had organised the party and they had plans to operate until early morning.A case under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 51 (b) of the Disaster Management Act has been registered against the suspects at Sector 56 police stations on Sunday morning. V K Beniwal, deputy commissioner of excise and taxation, Gurugram (east), said they have started a crackdown on ahatas, which have been illegally serving alcohol and hookah in the city. “As part of the crackdown, a raid was conducted at the ahata in Sector 56 on Saturday night and some people were arrested. A few of the suspects fled the spot on seeing the police teams, but they have been identified,” said Beniwal. “Police and excise officials have formed teams and are conducting surprise checks across the city late at night to check if ahatas are operating illegally,” he said. Police said no liquor vend or ahata is allowed to operate beyond 10pm but still violations are taking place and despite strict warnings, people are not mending their ways. In November last year, the chief minister ’s flying squad and the excise department raided three ahatas running illegally beyond the permissible timings which were serving flavoured hookah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-police-excise-officers-shut-ahata-for-operating-in-curfew-hours-101643574687004.html

31-01-2022||Delhi||Daily cases fall to 3,674 as test positivity rate dips below 6.5%||The Capital saw its lowest daily infection tally since January 2 on Sunday, as the Covid-19 test positivity rate in the city also continued to wind downwards to levels last seen in the early days of the month, according to numbers from the state government’s daily health bulletin.Delhi added 3,674 cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, the fewest in a day since it recorded 3,194 infections on January 2, when the Omicron surge of the pandemic began to expand its footprint in the Capital.Testing dipped only marginally on the day, with Delhi collecting nearly 58,000 samples on Sunday (as against 60,532 a day ago). The test positivity rate, however, continued to dip, falling to its lowest in 29 days.Of the samples collected on Sunday, 6.3% returned positive results, the fewest since 4.6% on January 2.The statistic is a vital metric to understand the spread of an infection in a region. Experts, including the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend a positivity rate below 5% for two weeks, before an outbreak can be considered under control.In Delhi, the peak of recorded cases came on January 12 (28,867) , and that of the test positivity on January 14 (30.64%).Delhi also recorded 30 more fatalities of the infection on Sunday, taking the Covid-19 toll in the city to 25,827.The city’s fifth wave has been marked by a significantly smaller proportion of hospitalisations and deaths compared to its previous waves – a pattern consistent with global surges caused by the Omicron variant of the Sars-Cov-2 virus.The Omicron variant itself has been seen to cause milder symptoms among people it infects, and consequently fewer hospital admissions and deaths.An audit report of Covid deaths prepared by the Delhi government found more signs that this wave of infections has been significantly less damaging for the city.Among the 438 people who died between January 13 and 25, only 94 had Covid-19 as primary cause of death.The number of people admitted to hospitals in Delhi dropped on Sunday as well, with 1,567 occupying hospital beds in the city, down from 1,771 a day ago, and leaving nearly 90% (13,861) vacant. Even at its peak, hospitalisations in the city did not cross the 20% mark during the current surge of infections.Another factor that appears to have played a role in keeping hospitalisation and deaths low in Delhi has been vaccinations, experts added, with all adults inoculated with at least one dose of vaccines, and over 82% completely vaccinated, according to data from the CoWin dashboard.“Positivity rate is continuously going down in Delhi which is similar to Mumbai and Kolkata, where the R0 is already less than 1, which means transmission has nearly halted... Life should come to normal and all commercial activities should be restored as soon as possible including school and colleges,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) decided on Thursday that there will no longer be a weekend curfew, shops can be open on all days, and restaurants, bars and cinema halls can reopen for customers at 50% of their capacity, heeding to calls to at least roll back some curbs after the Covid-19 outbreak in the city appeared to be stable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/daily-cases-fall-to-3-674-as-test-positivity-rate-dips-below-65-101643574106432.html

Addressing a gathering at the residence of SAD’s Patiala Rural constituency candidate Jaspal Singh Bittu Chattha after inducting scores of Congress leaders into the party, Sukhbir said, “Implementing the Delhi model will mean charging the farmers for supply of power for the agriculture sector and doing away with the free agriculture supply scheme launched by the SAD.”It also means supply of power to the domestic and industrial sector at the rate of ₹13 per unit, he claimed. “Kejriwal has always taken a stand against Punjab on all important issues. Be it the issue of sharing of Punjab’s river waters with Haryana and Delhi, closure of thermal plants of the state or registering criminal cases against Punjab’s farmers for burning paddy stubble, Kejriwal has taken a stand against Punjabis in the Supreme Court,” SAD chief said.He also urged the people not to be fooled by the guarantees being given by AAP. “What is the guarantee that the AAP will even stick together as a party. You have seen earlier as how three out of its four MPs and eleven out of its twenty legislators left the party,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabis-will-never-give-chance-to-kejriwal-s-failed-delhi-model-sukhbir-badal-101643574384076.html
31-01-2022||Chandigarh||Inspection at Ludhiana railway station: Problems galore, reveals report||Authorities’ tall claims of having streamlined operations at the Ludhiana station were debunked after the Zonal Railways Users Consultative Committee (ZRUCC) reported gross oversights in its functioning. After carrying out a detailed inspection on January 24, Zonal Railways Users Consultative Committee (ZRUCC) member Vivek Kumar Shukla submitted his report with Railway Board chairperson Vinay Tripathi, and Northern Railways’ general manager Ashutosh Gangal exposing the sad state of affairs at the station. No doctor available in hospital’s emergency In his report, Shukla said that at the time of the inspection, no doctor was available in the emergency ward of the Railway Hospital. An accident patient was seen waiting for the doctor, so that he could be transferred to another hospital as he required immediate treatment. “The patient, who was in immense pain, was made to do paperwork, instead of being treated or transferred,” he wrote, advising the officials to normalise hospital facilities for railway staff and make provision for direct admission to recognised hospitals in case of an accident through Unique Medical Identification (UMID) cards issued by the railways. Gaping holes in security After the Ludhiana Court Complex blast caused ripples across the state, authorities claimed to have scaled up security at the station. However, the report said that the security arrangements were subpar with three unclaimed packages lying near the Government Railway Police (GRP) police station, which were handed over to the GRP, during the inspection.“No unclaimed package should remain in the station area. Moreover, it was observed that there was an illegal passageway near the GRP station, leading towards the platform. The passage should be closed immediately for passengers’ safety,” said the report. Unauthorised vendors, defunct escalators Shukla also rapped the authorities over the construction of illegal shops on the entrance of the station, and the presence of unauthorised vendors at the entry and the exit points of the station. On the day of the inspection, an escalator was found defunct. “This blemishes the image of the railways, and causes inconvenience to senior citizens,” said Shukla. Toilet trouble The report also created a stink over the state of the railways toilets. It said that a flush was non-functional, there was no liquid soap in the washroom, and the staff did not have their identity card. Poor drainage systemThe report also cast the spotlight on poor drainage ay the GRP Thana. The fare display system at a few counters was non-functional. “I will reach out to the railway ministry to expose the operations at the station”, said a senior railway officer.

He also blamed weak decision-making. “There should be certain transparency in the decision-making process but that does not seem to be happening.

31-01-2022||Chandigarh||Swachh Survekshan 2022: Chandigarh MC gets extra month to streamline solid waste mgmt||The Chandigarh municipal corporation has got an additional month to get the city’s solid waste management (SWM) in order, as Swachh Survekshan 2022 (SS22) timelines have been extended.MC has zeroed down on seven key sectors, mainly related to SWM, to improve the city’s ranking in the survey.SS22 timelines were recently shifted by the Union government. As per guidelines, documentation under SS22 was to be earlier done by January 15, but the deadline has now been extended to February 20.Similarly, direct observation has been shifted from February to March, starting March 1. Under this, independent observers are designated by the Union government to assess different parameters under the survekshan.Collection of data from direct observation is based on physical observation of the sanitation status in public places by the survey agency. The agency uses maps and simple handheld device/recording formats to record their observations and findings along with photographs/videos, wherever necessary.A dysfunctional waste processing plant, slow progress in the legacy mining and poor segregation at source had pushed the city beautiful further down the Swachh Survekshan rankings in 2021. Over all, the city was ranked at 66 out of 4,320 cities.SEVEN KEY AREASMC is focusing on 100% door-to-door collection and segregation of waste this time. “We have pushed in 96 extra vehicles and started covering the uncovered areas of Chandigarh. We have already refabricated the vehicles to collect garbage in four categories- dry, wet, sanitary and hazardous in a segregated manner,” said Anindita Mitra, MC commissioner.Slow bio-remediation of legacy waste at the Dadumajra dumping site was another factor for drop in rankings. On site 1, under the Chandigarh Smart City Limited legacy mining project where 5 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of waste is to be removed, MC has set up five belts instead of three to increase the pace of remediation and speed up the work. “We have remediated 2.80 out of 5 LMT and reclaimed 8.5 of 20 acres of land,” said Mitra.In its last meeting, the MC general House also gave its nod to the proposal to clean up site 2, which has 7.67 LMT of legacy waste. “For the second site, we have submitted a proposal to Union government under Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0, of ₹77 crore,” said Mitra.Full processing of dry and wet waste “MC’s dry waste, wet waste and bio-methanation plants are all being upgraded in order to ensure 100% processing of 550 tonnes of waste generated on a daily basis. Similarly, our 3rd MRF centre shall be functional by February 10,” said Mitra.On the sanitation front, particularly with an eye on the direct observation round, all MC toilets (CTs/PTs), have been provided sanitary napkin dispensers and running water as well as QR codes. “We paid major attention to capacity building of safai karamcharis and sanitation workers. We also linked each employee to three welfare schemes like insurance and JSY,” said Mitra.On the crucial citizen engagement, MC is stepping up engaging with residents through Twitter, and other social platforms and murals in several locations.“We are even applying for a WhatsApp business account to enable us to reach each and every citizen of Chandigarh. With major focus on promoting home composting, we have started a city wide campaign of distribution of home composting buckets and training for the same,” said Mitra.

31-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Highly qualified candidates in the fray from Mansa district with state’s lowest literacy rate||Candidates with higher academic qualifications are in the fray from three segments of Mansa, the district with the lowest literacy rate in Punjab. According to the 2011 Census, Mansa has a 62.8% literacy rate against the state average of 76.7%. Female literacy rate was 56.4% and male literacy 62.8% in the district where political parties have fielded medical professionals, a PhD degree holder, engineers and postgraduates from different segments. Five of them are contesting for the first time while three are trying their luck for the second consecutive term. They are promising the electors to make Mansa a vibrant district with better educational avenues and improved employment opportunities. Budhlada, a reserved constituency, has in the fray Ranveer Kaur Mian, 30, of the Congress who is PhD in English and an MBA. She is contesting for the first time. Wife of the Mian village sarpanch, Kaur says she wants to work to provide people more opportunities in the public education sector. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate Budh Ram, 65, has five master’s degrees to his credit. The incumbent MLA remained a school principal and won the 2017 election in a close contest. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) nominee Nishan Singh Hakamwala, 50, a surgeon, practises in Mansa city. Also, Vijay Singla (52), AAP candidate from the semi-urban Mansa seat, is a practicing dentist and a known face in the town. When the Congress swept the 2017 elections, Mansa was the only district where it failed to win any of the three seats. In the last polls, the AAP won two seats of Mansa and Budhlada while SAD won Sardulgarh.Shubhdeep Singh aka Sidhu Moosewala (28), Punjabi singer and Congress nominee from Mansa segment, is appealing for electoral support to ensure the planned development of the district. Moosewala, who has a huge fan following on social media, is an engineering graduate.Dilraj Bhunder, 53, the incumbent MLA from Sardulgarh, has been fielded again by the SAD. He did a bachelor in engineering from Punjabi University in 1992-93.AAP and CPI (M) candidates Gurpreet Singh Banawali and Kulwinder Singh are law graduates and are first-timers. As per his election papers, Banawali is a practicing lawyer whereas Kulwinder mentions his only source of income is ‘agriculture’. The Left leader also holds a postgraduate degree. Once a hotbed of farmer and farm labour union activities, the district, which was carved out in 1992, has been lacking in terms of representation in the successive state governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-highly-qualified-candidates-in-the-fray-from-mansa-district-with-state-s-lowest-literacy-rate-101643573724032.html

The final draft will first be tabled in the DDA meeting and then sent to the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs for approval and later for notification.”The draft MPD-2041 was put out in public on June 9 last year. DDA had to extend the last date for comments on the draft plan by a month, from July to end-August, after several requests citing the pandemic and consequent restrictions.“The public hearing also had to be extended and eventually went on till end-November. There are a lot of discussions that have to be held before each chapter is finalised. It will take at least two more months to give it a final shape,” said a senior DDA official.The 2041 Master Plan for Delhi focuses on the regeneration of old areas (unauthorised colonies, urbanised villages), allowing mixed use development, providing affordable rental housing and small format housing, promoting walkability and non-motorised transport, development of green-blue (green spaces and waterfronts) infrastructure and corridors etc for sustainable development of the city.This time the land-owning agency has introduced new concepts and proposals to make Delhi a 24x7 city by promoting night-time economy and nightlife; increasing economic activities; allowing mixed development, especially in industrial areas; ensuring planned development of urban extensions etc.The land-owning agency had to also extend the public hearing, which started in October, by a few days.The official added, “We have got several suggestions from elected representatives. This includes provision for mixed land use in plotted residential areas, increase in floor area ratio of both residential and commercial buildings, upgradation of physical infrastructure, increase in building heights, relaxation in parking norms, etc. We are examining all the suggestions/objections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-master-plan-2041-dda-to-take-2-months-to-notify-draft-plan-101643573156872.html

Addressing a press conference in Amritsar with the party’s chief ministerial candidate Bhagwant Mann, Kejriwal said the AAP government would follow the principles and ideals of Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh and fulfill their dreams. “To remember their sacrifices, we announced in Delhi on January 26 that their portraits will be put in place of the CM’s and other leaders in all government offices. We will do the same in Punjab too,” he added. The AAP supremo said he drew a great deal of inspiration from the life of Baba Saheb who despite being born into a poor family wrote India’s Constitution and gave democratic rights to the people of this country.Mann said, “It is sad when people say the British were better than today’s politicians. Corrupt political leaders have ruined the vision and sacrifices of the country’s martyrs and freedom fighters. Sikh outfits protest over issue of Bhullar’s release Members of various Sikh organisations staged a demonstration against Kejriwal near his press conference venue over the issue of permanent release of 1993 Delhi bomb blast convict Davinderpal Singh Bhullar. Carrying black flags and banners, they held Kejriwal responsible for Bhullar’s continued imprisonment.

The university presently functions from three temporary campuses at Dharamshala, Shahpur and Dehra. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur during his recent tour to Delhi had called upon Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan. With the election to the Vidhan Sabha slated this year-end and the delay in setting up Central University bound to be one of the issues against his government, the chief minister asked Pradhan to expedite the construction work of the university. “The minister assured us that the construction plan for the university will be ready by March-end,” the CM said. The Central University was split into two campuses - “Dhauladhar” campus that was set up in Dharamshala, while “Beas” campus was to come up in Dehra. “There has been more politics than work on the Central University. Had they agreed to what Congress had proposed, the university would have been ready by now,” said former urban development minister Sudhir Sharma The university authorities had taken up the issue with the state forest department after which objections regarding the construction work on non-forest land allotted for the campus were removed. The Union environment and forest minister had raised almost six objections in the case referred to the FCA regarding the construction work on non-forest land. The first objection was related to the geological suitability of the proposed land for the construction work which has been removed.There were also objections related to road connectivity and electricity, drinking water and sewerage, which were being resolved. Though Dehra land has already been transferred in the name of CUHP, the forest clearance for 90% of Dharamshala land is still awaited. Only 50-acre of non-forest land at Dharamshala has been transferred to the university so far. Announced in 2007, CUHP became functional with the assumption of charge by the first vice-chancellor on January 20, 2010. However, the project was mired in politicking causing a delay in setting up its campus. The then BJP government proposed two campuses for CUHP with a major portion at Dehra. About 66 hectares of land were given for the CUHP campus at Dharamshala and 300 hectares in Dehra. However, in 2012, the Congress government was thrown out of power, it reversed the proposal identifying around 380 acres of additional land at Indrunag near Dharamsala for the institution. The ministry rejected the site as it found the land unfit for construction due to its location in the active sliding zone, forcing the government to repeat the exercise to find suitable land. New land was identified at Jadrangal, about 15 km from Dharamshala, and the fresh proposal was sent to the Centre. However, the BJP was voted to power in 2017 and the foundation stone of CUHP was laid at Dehra and Dharamshala in February this year.

Police said that the organisers and SP leaders allegedly brought in more than the permitted number of people to the events in a violation of the poll code issued by the Election Commission of India (ECI).The Election Commission of India on January 22 extended its ban on political rallies and roadshows in the five election-bound states, including Uttar Pradesh, till January 31 as the country continues to grapple with another wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Commission, however, had decided to relax some of the guidelines for candidates who will be contesting in the first phase on February 10 and second phase to be held on February 14. Candidates in Uttar Pradesh constituencies that vote in the first phase were allowed physical meetings in designated open spaces with a maximum of 500 persons or 50% of the capacity of the ground, but only from January 28 to February 8. UP will vote in seven phases from February 10 to March 7. Ghaziabad goes to polls in the first phase on February 10.According to police, one FIR was filed against Aslam Chaudhary, SP candidate from Dhaulana, and 500 to 600 of his supporters, while the second FIR was filed SP’s district president Rashid Malik, city president Rahul Chaudhary and vice-president Himanshu Parashar, besides 2,000 supporters.The joint press briefing held by Yadav and Chaudhary at a banquet hall in Ghaziabad on Saturday afternoon drew a large crowd.“The organisers of the party were permitted to have 150 people in attendance at the banquet hall, but several more party supporters entered the premises after flouting guidelines. The SP candidate was booked as he came with hundreds of his supporters and led a vehicle rally to the banquet hall. The two FIRs were lodged for violating the campaign guidelines as well as breaching prohibitory orders,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural).Both the FIRs were lodged under sections 171F (undue influence or personation at an election), 188 (violation of prohibitory orders), 269 and 270 (acts likely to cause spread of infection) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Masuri police station in Ghaziabad.The SP office bearers said that police had a mala fide intention.“There were only 12 persons inside the banquet hall besides media personnel who were called to attend the joint press conference. A crowd gathered on its own outside the banquet hall--they were not associated with the party. The FIRs are a deliberate attempt by police to pressurise us,” said Malik, the SP district president.Besides Yadav and Chaudhary, all five candidates of the SP-RLD alliance in Ghaziabad, the SP office-bearers as well as SP candidate Aslam Chaudhary were present during the joint press conference on Saturday.Aslam Chaudhary could not be reached for his comments.Police, however, refuted the charge and said that the FIRs were lodged in accordance with the law and denied any bias as claimed by the SP office-bearers.The SP-RLD alliance is contesting from all five assembly seats of Loni (RLD), Muradnagar (SP), Sahibabad (SP), Ghaziabad (SP) and Modinagar (RLD) in the district. A part of the Dhaulana assembly segment falls in Ghaziabad and the SP has fielded Aslam Chaudhary, the sitting MLA as its candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-sp-leaders-2-000-supporters-booked-for-poll-code-breach-101643572948644.html

With an estimated expenditure of ₹1,725.19 crore, and a revenue estimate of ₹1,448 crore, Chandigarh MC is set to face a budget deficit of ₹278 crore, and that too, if the grant-in-aide demanded from the UT administration comes through. The budget proposal will come up for approval in the MC General House on February 1. The MC is hoping for a grant-in-aid of ₹957 crore from the administration, which itself has sought ₹550 crore from the Centre to provide to the civic body. Even if the MC gets ₹550 crore as grant-in-aid, it would start the new fiscal with a deficit of at least ₹705 crore. It estimates to end the current fiscal with a deficit of ₹148 crore.In the current fiscal year, only ₹500 crore grant-in-aid was sanctioned. While the MC has shown an overall buoyancy in its own receipts, from ₹444.61 crore in current fiscal to ₹616 crore estimate for 2022-2023, it will be largely on the back of collections from its petrol pumps and commercial property tax.Its other receipts from sources such as water tariff, residential property tax and estate receipts are largely stagnant.Poor spending on capital worksThe MC is likely to constrict its spending on development works in the coming fiscal as in the budget proposal, the estimates for capital expenditure has been reduced in comparison to current fiscal.The budget estimates 2021-2022 had pegged the capital expenditure at ₹448 crore. But this year, the MC is proposing to spend only ₹401 crore on development works.But staggeringly, the revised estimates for 2021-2022 under capital head are ₹170 crore only, that means, even though the MC had proposed to spend ₹448 crore on development works, it could spend only ₹170 crore in the current fiscal. ₹1323.77 crore are the budget estimates are under the revenue head for the coming fiscal.Last year, the MC had prepared ₹1,646 crore budget. The MC had demanded ₹1,202 crore as grant-in-aid, assuring to earn ₹469 crore from its own but as per revised estimates for current fiscal, it would earn ₹444 crore only.

Also, counsellors can be empanelled, monetary assistance to be provided by the Institute can be fixed and the rights can be proportioned,” he said, adding that patents also contribute towards enhancing the quality of research and improving the ranking of the institution.Other steps to improve rankingMeanwhile, PEC has also constituted a panel to simplify administrative processes (including accounts) for sponsored research projects and consultancy. The committee has also been asked to give its recommendations on incentivising good publications.Moreover, PEC has decided that PhD scholars will be registered only after receiving satisfactory progress monitoring report of the previous semester. In the last year’s Union education ministry’s National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), PEC settled at the 70th position against 68th in 2020 among the engineering institutes of the country.

The victim, Sukhwinder Singh, 40, of Gorsian Hakamrai village of Ladhowal, worked as a guard at Rajgarh Estate Township. He was on his way to work on his bike, when the assailants shot at him. The victim’s neighbour, Harpal Singh, who rushed him to the civil hospital, said Sukhwinder Singh had double shifts on Saturday night and Sunday morning. “After his night shift Sukhwinder came home to freshen up and pack his tiffin. He was on his way to join duty at 6.30am, when two men on a red Royal Enfield bike fired at him.” The accused fired at least six shots at Sukhwinder Singh, of which three hit the mark, casing him to fall off the bike. Assuming that he had died, the accused fled. Around 10 minutes later, an acquaintance spotted Sukhwinder Singh lying in a pool of blood, and alerted his family, who rushed him to a clinic, from where he was taken to the civil hospital. Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) station house officer Rajinderpal Singh said, “Sukhwinder Singh suffered two bullet injuries on his right shoulder, and one bullet injury on his lower back. The accused had been tailing him, and opened fire on him on the Malakpur Bet- Noorpur Bet Road.” While the family remains clueless about who may have wanted to kill Sukhwinder Singh, the SHO suspects that a personal rivalry could be behind the attack. The police have also scanned CCTVs near the spot. However, due to the thick fog, nothing was captured on camera. A case has been registered against two unidentified accused under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and the Arms Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2-men-rain-bullets-on-security-guard-in-ludhiana-101643572883982.html

31-01-2022||Lucknow||Lucknow: ‘Provide life-saving equipment to sanitation workers’||Lucknow Corporators from different wards of the state capital have raised the demand of providing life-saving equipment to workers cleaning sewer and nullah. Jal Sansthan cleans sewers and Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) cleans nullah of the city every year before the rainy season. The corporators allege that the company responsible for cleaning the sewers does not provide life-saving equipment to workers who enter sewer chambers to clean them. This can cause fatal accidents as there have been deaths of sanitation workers in the past. Leader of opposition in LMC House, Sayyed Yawar Hussain Reshu said, “Sanitation workers are usually very poor, un-educated, and unaware of their rights. They earn their livelihood by exposing themselves to extreme risk. So, it’s the duty of the government to provide proper safety kits to every sanitation worker. The safety kit must include gloves, gum boots, oxygen cylinders and safety belts. But no contractor provides the safety kit to these workers.” He said, “According to the report of the National Commission for Safai Workers, as many as 631 people have died in the country while cleaning sewers and septic tanks in the last 10 years.” Jugal Kishore Valmiki, leader of sanitation workers said, “There is a need for giving safety gears, proper equipment, adequate protection to sewer workers who enter manholes. The contractors should make sure that the manhole covers are opened and ventilated at least for an hour before the workers are allowed to get in. A first-aid kit should always be maintained by the employer.” He said, “There have been cases of deaths of sewer workers in Lucknow which is not good for a cultured society, that’s why we have demanded an end to this practice of manual cleaning of manholes or nullahs.” Meanwhile, mayor Sanyukta Bhatia said, “The LMC and the Jal Sansthan have started using jetting machines to clean sewer overflow in the city after identifying through geographic information system (GIS) mapping. This is a big move towards mechanical cleaning; besides that I have already directed the officials to ensure that no worker enters the sewer or nullah without protective equipment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-provide-life-saving-equipment-to-sanitation-workers-101643572524237.html

31-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Congress begins discussions on CM face, seeks suggestions on Shakti app||Congress chief Sonia Gandhi has started discussions with party leaders and workers to pick its chief ministerial face in poll-bound Punjab, where it is seeking to retain power, party sources said on Sunday. Gandhi is seeking responses from Congress leaders and workers through the party’s Shakti app, they said. The opinion of common people on the issue will also be sought in a day or two, the sources said. This comes days after former Congress president Rahul Gandhi announced at a virtual rally on January 27 that the party would go with a chief ministerial face in the Punjab elections. Over the past several weeks, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu have, directly or indirectly, made a case for themselves to be declared as the party’s chief ministerial candidate. The Congress is putting its weight behind Channi, who belongs to the Scheduled Caste community. SCs and STs have been a traditional vote bank of the Congress, but they drifted away from the party following the emergence of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and some other small groups. The Congress is now seeking to consolidate the SC vote bank, which comprises almost one-third of Punjab’s population, by choosing Channi to replace former chief minister Amarinder Singh. A three-time MLA from Chamkaur Sahib, Channi is the first Dalit chief minister of Punjab. The Congress has fielded him from two seats --- Chamkaur Sahib and Bhadaur --- in the state assembly polls that will be held on February 20. He is the only party candidate to be fielded from two seats. The Congress has followed the ‘one family, one seat’ formula in allocating tickets to its candidates in Punjab. The Congress is pitted against the AAP, the SAD-BSP and the BJP that has joined hands with Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa’s Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-congress-begins-discussions-on-cm-face-seeks-suggestions-on-shakti-app-101643572344151.html

The results also proved that the support for the BJP had not eroded to a large extent. The BJP secured the top spot in the Nagar Panchayat poll results last week, while the MVA allies together won 57% of the total seats. A similar trend was seen in the Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti polls held in October 2021, where the BJP got the first position but with the tally of MVA partners put together, the coalition was ahead by a huge margin. The three parties, however, contested separately at most of the places. Among the MVA partners, the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) gained most seats in the Nagar Panchayat elections, while the Congress saw a drop in its 2017 tally. The three ruling parties won 1,021 seats in these local body polls against the BJP’s 419 seats. The polls for 1,802 seats in 106 Nagar Panchayats, 105 seats in the two District Councils, and 210 seats in 15 Panchayat Samitis were conducted in two phases on December 21, 2021, and January 19. The Nagar Panchayats govern smaller towns in semi-urban areas. In the Zilla Parishad elections, of the 85 seats, the BJP won 22, while the Congress, NCP and Sena bagged 19, 15 and 12 seats, respectively (total 46). The BJP’s tally dropped from 31 to 22 seats, while the three partners improved their tally by 10 to 46 seats. In Panchayat Samitis that govern tehsils, the Congress emerged first by winning 36 seats, while the BJP could get 33. The NCP and the Sena obtained 18 and 23 seats respectively from the total 144 seats. NCP’s gain In the Nagar Panchayat polls, though the NCP retained its second spot it had got in 2017, it gained over 50 seats. The tally rose to 381 from 330. The party not only won seats in western Maharashtra, its stronghold, but also made gains in districts of north Maharashtra. The party which has strong leaders, including Eknath Khadse and Rohit R Pawar, bagged 55 seats in four districts of the region. In Konkan districts too, the NCP won seats in Raigad and Ratnagiri. NCP chief spokesperson and minister Nawab Malik said, “We are number one in the state; even ahead of the BJP.” He further said, “The party’s tally is close to 450. In many places, we did not contest on the symbol, for instance, Patan [in Satara]. Mainly our gains have come from Konkan, Marathwada and parts of north Maharashtra.” In many local bodies, the MVA constituents contested separately, yet they managed to win and keep the BJP out of power. Political analysts said the NCP has gained the most after coming to power, followed by the Sena. The Congress’ performance has been a mixed bag, they added. Hemant Desai, a Mumbai-based political analyst, said the NCP, which has a strong rural presence, coupled with organisational ability and strong leadership, has gained a lot electorally in the last two years. “The NCP has been working like clockwork from the top to the grassroots level. This has been underscored in the results of local body polls. It has gained the most since it came to power, followed by the Sena. The Congress had complained about fund allocations, but its performance has been mix,” he said. Sena’s surge The Uddhav Thackeray-led party came last among the four parties even though it made good progress as compared to the 2017 polls. From 201 Nagar Panchayat seats, it increased its tally by 95 - a jump of 47%. Anil Desai, Sena secretary and Rajya Sabha MP, said the party’s tally is going to be around 305-310 Nagar Panchayat members, and they are in touch with many Independents to form a panel to control the local body. The boss, however, was not pleased with the party’s efforts, which he made clear while addressing Sena workers and leaders on January 23. Thackeray said the party leaders, ministers do not take any elections seriously, except those to the Lok Sabha and the Assembly. He asked them to emulate leaders from their alliance partners. He directed them that henceforth, all elections should be contested with the intent to win. Sena leader and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said the MVA partners’ tally should not be viewed individually. He said though the BJP has bagged the highest number of seats in the Nagar Panchayat polls, it will remain in the opposition. “We view the number collectively as we are running the state government... They might have got more seats, but the BJP is Maharashtra’s number one opposition party and it will remain so for years to come,” he said. Sena leader and urban development minister Eknath Shinde said the MVA has succeeded together. “Though the Sena is known to be an urban party, it has got good results in the rural areas as well. If you look at individual parties, the BJP may be seen with the most seats, but if viewed collectively, the MVA has the highest seats.” The Sena increased the tally in Pune, Satara, Sangli, Nashik, Dhule, and Nandurbar districts. The party, however, saw a loss in some districts of Marathwada, which is one of its strongholds. Desai said the Sena has its CM, so a jump of 95-100 seats is not spectacular. Congress’ decline? The Congress saw a drop of 82 seats in the Nagar Panchayat polls from its tally in 2017. The party lost a chunk of its seats in Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, and Raigad districts of the Konkan region along with Nashik, Nandurbar, and Jalgaon in north Maharashtra. Desai said the leadership issues had plagued the party’s success in the Assembly and Lok Sabha polls. “The Congress’ decline started after 2014. The central leadership needs to pay more attention to the state unit. There is no coordination in the local units. All key leaders, including Prithviraj Chavan, Ashok Chavan, Nana Patole and Balasaheb Thorat, are restricted to their regions and districts,” he said. Atul Londhe, Congress spokesperson, said the performance analysis needed to be based on the strength of legislators. “The results show the MVA constituents, which have 56 (Sena), 54 (NCP), and 44 (Congress) legislators respectively, have got over 1,000 seats in the panchayat elections. The BJP with 105 MLAs has got only 419.” Alliance and future polls In the upcoming municipal corporation elections, the alliance partners are expected to go solo in most cities. “Contesting local elections on our own gives an opportunity to our grassroots workers to assess the response of people,” an NCP leader said. Key corporations, including Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik and Aurangabad, are expected to go to polls in a couple of months. Despite the recent results showing a collective might of the MVA, the three parties have not entered into any formal alliance for any civic body election so far. A Sena leader said, “So far, there is no agreement on any alliance for the municipal polls. But if it works out, we intend to have it for Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, and Navi Mumbai.” The Congress has spoken openly on going independently in the local polls, including Mumbai.

31-01-2022||Lucknow||Shiv Sena Badhapur candidate’s nomination cancelled||Shiv Sena candidate Danvati’s candidature from Badhapur constituency of Bijnor was cancelled on Saturday.Danvati had filed her nomination from Badhapur constituency on Friday, which was the last date of filing nominations for the second phase of voting on February 14.After scrutiny on Saturday, her nomination was cancelled.Shiv Sena’s Bijnor district in charge Veer Singh accused the administration of cancelling her nomination under pressure. Singh said that Danvati belongs to Pal community which has 35,000 votes in the constituency. The community was annoyed with BJP for doing nothing for their welfare. They were supposed to vote in favour of Danvati, which would have meant a direct loss of votes to BJP candidate Sushant Singh.The sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of Nageena Shailendra Kumar, however, refuted the charges. He said Danvati’s nomination was cancelled on technical basis.“She filed nomination as an independent candidate and was required to fill the detail of 10 proposers in her form. However, names and details of only six proposers were filled in the form that is why her nomination was cancelled,” the SDM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/shiv-sena-badhapur-candidate-s-nomination-cancelled-101643570065557.html
31-01-2022||Other||Shiv Sena alleges ‘illegal’ rejection of nominations in UP||BJP govt is scared of our Hindutva plank, says Sanjay Raut  Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh of pressuring the local administration to “illegally” reject the nominations of Shiv Sena candidates, party Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday said their nominees were also being threatened to withdraw from the fray. Raut said the Sena candidates in six seats, including Noida and Bijnor, had their nominations rejected “illegally” to disqualify them from contesting the polls. “I have the record. They filed the nominations in time and the documents were in order. Despite this, their nominations were rejected. The District Magistrate is not willing to conduct a hearing (against this). This means they are under pressure. (The BJP) is running scared of the Sena,” said Raut, adding he would approach the Election Commission of India. “Elections should be fair and fearless. Some of our candidates have been threatened to withdraw. They are scared of us because of Hindutva. (They are) neo-Hindutvawadis… The Sena is getting a good response in parts of Uttar Pradesh, and hence, someone is afraid of us,” he alleged, stating that the BJP may be apprehensive that the Sena may cut into its Hindutva vote bank. Raut said even though a candidate had filed his form before 3 pm, the District Magistrate had rejected his nomination. However, nomination forms of BJP candidates with similar lacunae had been accepted. “The (Union) Home Minister (Amit Shah speaks about kanoon ka raj (rule of law), but this is andha kanoon (lawlessness),” he said. In Bijnor, the reason for the rejection of the nomination was the same as the objection raised by the Sena over the candidature of Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant. The polling authorities heard Sawant’s side and settled the issue in his favour. However, the Sena candidates in Uttar Pradesh were not being given an opportunity to be heard. “Miscellaneous reasons have been given for rejecting the nominations of Sena candidates,” said Vinay Shukla, who is the party’s in-charge for north India. He added that these reasons included a column in the form being blank, a form having both, a thumb impression and signature, and missing documents and details in the affidavit. “Other parties like the Samajwadi Party have also faced this,” said Shukla, adding that however, they had backup candidates unlike the Sena, which was new to the politics of UP. Some of the candidates whose nominations were rejected were Raj Kumar Agarwal in Noida and former MLA Guddu Pandit in Bulandshahr. The Sena had declared six candidates for the first phase of polling in UP (February 10) and seven in the second phase (February 14). The Sena plans to field a minimum of 60-70 candidates, said Shukla. However, officials in Noida said the scrutiny of nominations is a transparent process conducted by returning officers in the presence of independent election observers. “The nomination of this candidate was cancelled because form 26 of the affidavit was not completely filled. The election rules clearly state that for the candidature to be valid every column in form 26 has to be filled. It was checked and a notice was also issued to the candidate to fill all columns and submit the forms by 11 am on the day of the scrutiny. However, they were unable to do so in time,” said Aalok Kumar Gupta, returning officer for the Noida constituency. While the Sena is active in Maharashtra politics and parts of Goa, it holds hardly any ground in UP. It had last won one seat in the 1991 UP Assembly elections: Pawan Kumar Pandey from Akbarpur constituency. This is the only victory that the Sena has notched outside Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shiv-sena-alleges-illegal-rejection-of-nominations-in-up-101643570005703.html
31-01-2022||Delhi||Amid extreme weather, a shorter construction window for infra work in Delhi||From intermittent ban on construction due to rising pollution to record rain and cold conditions deterring work, many experts and engineers associated with infrastructure projects in the city claim that various environmental and climatic factors have resulted in a shorter window for construction work in the Capital.Also Read | Rain likely to cloud Delhi’s warm mornings this week, says IMDExperts have suggested a complete revamp in planning, including prioritising certain components of projects during summer months, incorporation of delays due to climatic factors in the tender, and use of latest technologies, to adapt to the changes.Road surfacing work in the Capital, including for the tunnel project at Pragati Maidan, have been affected in January as the cold is not conducive for the use of bituminous construction material which is the key ingredient laying coaltar-asphalt roads. Prior to this, during November-December last year, construction bans were in place for days on end as the air deteriorated in the Capital. The operation of stone crushers and hot mix plants too were stopped during this period, effectively washing out construction work during the winter months. Brief but intense spells of rain also resulted in inundation of project sites and leading to minor delays in the previous months.Sarvagya Srivastava, former chief of Delhi PWD, confirmed that disruptions due to environmental factors has increased: “The bans impact movement of material and manpower and the construction sector has been most severely affected in last two years. There has been a big setback in the last couple of years and the whole sector is in turmoil.”Srivastava said that the order of construction work cannot be easily changed to prioritise certain works but said use of new technologies will be needed in the future. “We will have to look for new materials and technologies, adopt more mechanised construction and use pre-fabricated parts,” he added.On January 27, HT reported that cold conditions were acting has the last hurdle in completion of Pragati maidan tunnel project and six underpasses in the region.A senior official PWD said that most hot mix plants are now located outside the Delhi boundaries. “The asphalt hot mixture is hearted up to 300°C, and now one needs to factor in its cooling down during transportation. Quick cooling leads to early settling of layers and that can lead to damage. The night temperature in last week has been 7-8°C. The surfacing has to be put on hold till weather conditions improve,” said the official.“Construction companies used to set up smaller hot mix plants near project sites but amid increasing environmental concerns in the last few years, these were moved away,” the official added.An engineer from the North Delhi Municipal Corporation said that the road laying cannot be carried out during peak winter but exemptions in day-time operations are being sought in some cases. “Besides fund shortage, this is certainly a problem faced by all agencies,” official added.Earlier, the construction ban was in force from November 16 to December 20 last year, owing to the poor air quality in the Capital.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) had banned construction and demolition (C&D) activities in Delhi and the NCR due to high pollution on November 16 last year, and the Supreme Court reaffirmed the ban on November 24.The Supreme Court-approved graded response action plan (GRAP) for pollution mandates that construction activities need to be stopped when the air quality index (AQI) passes a certain level.Dr S Velmurugan, chief scientist, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), said that road owning agencies need to change their strategies to finish projects on time. “The road owning agencies like PWD and civic bodies should make their priorities clear. If they want to stick to hot-mix technology, then that work should be prioritised so as to carry it out during the summer months. They can also upgrade to use of cold mix technology which has been demonstrated by CRRI on many national and state highways. The cost of this approach may be a bit higher but one has to understand that delays also cause cost escalations,” he said.Dr Velmurugan added that the site management practices have to be improved to minimise dust pollution to a level that such projects are exempt from the construction ban.Some of the key projects where climatic factors have been repeatedly cited for delays are Pragati Maidan integrated transit corridor projects, Ashram underpass and flyover extension project, Benito-Juarez underpass, half underpasses near Wazirabad on Outer Ring Road and Kishanganj underpass, among others.Delhi also witnessed an intense monsoon that continued well into late October, with the city recording 1,512.4mm of rainfall till December 29 -- the second highest ever on record. The short but intense spells of rainfall in the monsoon season led to flooding of several project sites and under construction underpasses.Netra Sharma, who heads All SDMC contractors association, said, “On top of pollution-related bans, the erratic monsoon also led to delays in several projects. No road laying work or major project involving digging work could be carried out during rainy season. There are frequent disruptions in projects after July, till the end of winter. The construction window is getting increasingly shorter and government should consider targeted and time bound bans instead of blanket bans on construction,” he added.Pankaj Bajaj, the president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (NCR chapter), said that the effective period for construction in Delhi NCR is only about 8-9 months in a year. “The loss of 3 to 4 months annually is partly addressable. We can allow construction to continue with strict dust control measures during the affected period. Also, it is not right to put a blanket ban on construction every time pollution increases. Many construction activities, like say plumbing work or installing lifts, are pollution free. They can be allowed to go on. Even for activities like mixing concrete can be done off site, or they can use prefabricated materials. In such cases, the construction site is nothing but an assembly zone while actual manufacturing happens somewhere else.I hope the authorities desist from issuing blanket bans and actually allow all the non polluting activities.”Prof Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, said the project planning at tender stage should include climatic factors. “Project planning should take into consideration construction bans, climatic conditions, and prioritisation of certain aspects of projects in summer months. Under current conditions, everyone takes it for granted that a project will be completed in certain number of months without factoring in these delays or plans to avoid these period,” he said.Prof Ram added that technology used in colder European countries should be considered.Retaining workers a challengeOfficials claim that retention of workers amid intermittent construction bans is also a challenge. “We try to keep a section of labourers engaged by deploying them in dust control activities but contractors cannot be expected to keep paying workers during longer ban periods. We need a permanent mechanism to deal with this,” said a senior official from South MCD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/amid-extreme-weather-a-shorter-construction-window-for-infra-work-in-delhi-101643569885383.html

31-01-2022||Chandigarh||Khattar government starts process to compensate deceased farmers’ kin||Haryana government has initiated the process to give compensation to the families of state’s deceased farmers, who had lost their lives during the year-long agitation against three farm laws, which were later repealed by the Union government.BJP MLA from Rai Mohan Lal Badoli, along with other BJP leaders, on Sunday disbursed financial compensation of ₹5 lakh each to eight families of the deceased farmers in Sonepat district. “I have visited the houses of eight deceased farmers’ families and extended them a financial help of ₹5 lakh each on the behalf of the Haryana government and expressed grief over the demise of their loves ones in the farm stir. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar was also pained about the demise of farmers and he is committed to providing the help to these families in future, if required,” the Rai MLA added.He has provided financial assistance to the families of Rajesh, Dilbagh, Kulbir Singh, Ajay Moor, Umid Singh, Rajender Pannu, Manoj Sharma and Dharmpal Malik in Sonepat district.Father of Ajay Moor, Ishwar Singh, a resident of Baroda village, said the government should also give a job to his daughter-in-law so that she can run the family. Samyukta Kisan Morcha leader Inderjit Singh said they were expecting that the state government will provide more compensation to the deceased farmers’ families than the Punjab government, but it paid the same amount.“The Punjab government had also provided jobs to next of kin of the deceased farmers besides ₹5 lakh. The Haryana government should either increase the compensation amount or give job to one member of the deceased farmers’ families. We will discuss this issue in the Samyukta Kisan Morcha’s meeting. The state government has withdrawn nearly 82 out of 250 FIRs registered during the farm stir and it should initiate the process to take back other FIRs too,” he added.Two farm leaders, pleading anonymity, said the Union government officials had assured the SKM leaders during the final talks that the BJP-JJP government in Haryana won’t give jobs to next-of-kin of the deceased, but it would increase the compensation amount. On ‘Betrayal Day’, SKM leader Suresh Koth said, “No action has been taken by the Union and state governments of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh on the promise of immediate withdrawal of cases registered during the farm agitation. On the issue of MSP, the government has neither announced formation of a committee nor has it given any information about the nature of the committee and its mandate. We also demand withdrawal of the Land Acquisition Act 2013 amended by the Haryana government and Recovery of Damages to Public and Private Property act.” “Despite a conspiracy being acknowledged in the SIT report, Union minister of state Ajay Mishra Teni is yet to be removed from the cabinet. The UP Police have implicated farmers in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri incident,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/khattar-government-starts-process-to-compensate-deceased-farmers-kin-101643569705282.html
31-01-2022||Delhi||In 2015 repeat, Delhi to present ‘Swaraj Budget’ in March-end this year||After the “Deshbhakti Budget” last year, the Delhi government is going to present a “Swaraj Budget” a second time, for the 2022-23 financial year, said state officials aware of the matter. The Budget is likely to be presented in March this year, said officials. When the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came to power with an absolute majority in 2015, winning 67 of 70 assembly seats in Delhi, the Arvind Kejriwal-led government picked ‘swaraj’ or self-rule as the theme of its maiden budget (2015-16). At the time, a significant section of the finances was allocated for the government’s flagship water and power subsidy schemes, which remain in force, and it also proposed the creation of a “Swaraj Fund”, for which ₹253 crore was earmarked. The AAP government had decided to create 30,000 ‘mohallas’ across the city, each of which was supposed to decide on how to spend the Swaraj Fund in their localities. The process continued till about 2018, but was later merged with the local area development fund given to MLAs. The “swaraj” theme will be repeated for the Budget this year, but with a separate approach, said officials aware of the matter. The government has also sought suggestions from residents of the city on ideas or projects it should incorporate in this year’s document. The idea of engaging residents of the Capital in the budget-making process this year and a return to the AAP’s maiden budget theme is significant as Delhi heads into elections for the three municipal corporations, all of which are currently governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). A government spokesperson said that the state has received at least 1,000 suggestions with the final date for comments over two weeks away (February 15). “This year, Delhi will have a participatory budget. Several responses concerning the areas of education, health and economic growth, all of which the government devotes a major share of its budget to every year, have also come in. The suggestions aim to overcome on-ground problems faced by the residents,” a government spokesperson said. Officials said that some have suggested that the government should develop “Mohalla Libraries” on the lines of the “Mohalla Clinics”. Such libraries can help students who live in densely populated areas without the space or privacy to study, said one of the suggestions. Another resident called for cheaper parking for electric vehicles (EVs), saying it may incentivise people to adopt greener modes of transport. Other responses suggested the concept of small-scale community solar power plants, localised sewage treatment plants, use of treated water to irrigate parks, and e-waste collection from doorsteps.The government last year presented the “Deshbhakti Budget” for Delhi to mark 75 years of India’s independence. The Delhi government introduced a slew of initiatives along that theme, including a “Deshbhakti Curriculum” for school students, installing 500 high-mast Tricolours across the city, planning a musical play in honour of the architect of the Constitution, Dr BR Ambedkar (the play was postponed due to the city’s fifth wave of infections), as well as ordering the removal of all photos of politicians in government offices and keeping only those of nation builders like the revolutionary freedom fighter Bhagat Singh and Ambedkar. While Ambedkar is hailed as a Dalit icon, the iconic Bhagat Singh has particular resonance in Punjab, a state where he Aam Aadmi Party is seen as a strong contender in the next month’s assembly polls.The deshbhakti curriculum is divided into four cohorts – classes kindergarten to 2, 3-5, 6-8 and 9-12 and was officially launched on Bhagat Singh’s birthday. “All schools introduced a Deshbhakti period every day for classes K-8 and twice a week for grades 9-12. All the discussions and reflections in Deshbhakti Curriculum are based on real life situations and examples with which students can easily relate. A book titled ‘Humare Deshbhakt Krantikari’ with stories of 100 freedom fighters for students of class 6-12 was also launched under the programme. The method of instruction is through activities, discussions and reflection-based enquiry. Only teacher’s handbooks are being provided; no textbooks are being given to students. Through classroom discussions, the focus is on honing intellectual, mental, emotional, and social abilities of children. No formal examinations or grading system will be followed for the Deshbhakti curriculum. Emphasis is on observing and assessing the development of the values, behaviours and actions through reflections and observations,” a government spokesperson said. As for the project on installing national flags, 80 of the 500 Tricolours have been installed across Delhi so far. The rest will be installed in about two or three months, said officials.. 
31-01-2022||Chandigarh||‘Day of Betrayal’: Haryana farm unions to hold protests today||On a call of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), farmer union leaders from Haryana will hold protests at all district headquarters on Monday to observe the ‘Day of Betrayal’ against the central government for not fulfilling promises made to morcha leaders.The SKM, an umbrella body of farmer unions, has given the call to observe January 31 as ‘Day of Betrayal’ across the country against the Union government for ‘backtracking’ from the promises made to the SKM leaders last month.The decision to hold protests and submit a memorandum addressed to the Union government was taken in the review meeting of the SKM leaders held on January 15. According to the farmer leaders of 40 unions of Haryana, who held a meeting at Rohtak, they have decided to join the protests at the district headquarters in the state on January 31 and burn effigies of the Union and state leaders. Earlier, there were reports that BKU (Charuni) was reluctant to participate in the protests but now members of the union at the district level have issued instructions to their supporters to join the protests. Farm union leaders in Haryana are also holding meetings with farmers, requesting them to join the protest in large numbers to make it successful to get justice for the victims of violence in Lakhimpur Kheri of Uttar Pradesh last year. Messages are being circulated to the farmers on social media platforms as well. “January 31 will be observed as Day of Betrayal as the government has turned back from its promises and justice has not been done with the farmers who were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri violence,” said BKU (Charuni) Karnal leader Jagdip Singh Aulakh. He said that they were bound to follow the directions of the SKM leaders and they will follow whatever decision was taken by the top leadership.Haryana BKU (Tikait) president Ratan Mann said the farmers will hold protests at the district headquarters and a memorandum addressed to the President of India will be submitted to the deputy commissioners, seeking the President’s intervention as the “Union government did not fulfil any of the promises made to the farm leaders in the letter on December 9, 2021, including formation of a committee on the issue of MSP , withdrawal of cases registered against farmers and compensation to families of those who lost their lives during the yearlong agitation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/day-of-betrayal-haryana-farm-unions-to-hold-protests-today-101643569583928.html

31-01-2022||Chandigarh||DMCH Ludhiana organises awareness event to mark World Leprosy Day||The Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) on Sunday marked the World Leprosy Day by organising an event —the theme for which was ‘Unity for Dignity’—aimed to raise awareness about the disease among public. DMCH managing society secretary Prem Kumar said the department of dermatology at DMCH has state of the art facilities and provides the highest level of skin care facilities.Department of dermatology head Dr Sunil Gupta said, “The bacteria causing leprosy grows very slowly and it may take up to 20 years to develop signs of the infection. The disease can affect the nerves, skin, eyes, and lining of the nose.”Stressing on the importance of early diagnosis, he added that if untreated, leprosy can lead to paralysis of hands and feet. Associate professor Dr Jaspriya Sandhu echoed the same, saying early diagnosis and timely management of the disease can prevent leprosy.“Leprosy does not pass from one person to another while shaking hands or hugging, sitting next to each other or sharing food,” she added.Fellow associate professor Dr Sukhjot Kaur highlighted the signs and symptoms including discoloured patches on the skin, usually flat that may be numb and look faded, painless ulcers on the soles of feet, numbness of affected areas of the skin, painless swelling or lumps on the face or earlobes, loss of eyebrows or eyelashes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dmch-ludhiana-organises-awareness-event-to-mark-world-leprosy-day-101643569106852.html
31-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi govt to plant 14 varieties of grass at Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary||If a pilot project of planting 14 types of grass in the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary that aims to restore its ecological landscape is a success, the Delhi government may consider including grasses in its annual greening targets.Grasses are already returning in parts of the sanctuary where human footprint has reduced, according to a senior forest official in the south division. “We are already seeing grasslands return in places where boundary walls were strengthened, but plantation work of shrubs and grasses will begin in areas near the check dams, as there is already high silt and water availability,” said the official. “Open spaces need to be filled by shrubs and grasses, which form an equally important part of a forest, and grasses will be able to grow in places where trees will simply not be able to grow.” Although there are no immediate plans for a policy change that incorporates grasses in the greening target, it will be looked at following this pilot project, another forest official said. “It is possible in the future that greening agencies will be asked to plant grasses along with saplings and shrubs, especially along pavements,” the official said, requesting anonymity. Delhi’s green cover has been increasing over the past decade and now stands at 23.06% (342.2 sq km) of its land area, according to the latest India State of Forest Report. It was 21.9% in 2019 (324 sq km). Focusing on grasses and the creation of grasslands will be the next step in reviving the ecological landscape in the sanctuary, which has recorded the presence of ungulates such as the spotted deers, nilgais, black bucks and hog deers as part of an ongoing census, said Sohail Madan, centre manager, Bombay Natural History Society at Asola. “Around 14 different types of grasses have been identified, each of which are important in their own way for the ecology,” Madan said. “Not only will they sustain the browsers and grazers, but will also make it easier for reptiles and smaller mammals to thrive. The grasses to be planted include Buffel grass, Johnson grass, Mauritian grass, Daabh, Crowfoot grass, Kash, Munj, Needle grass, Lemon grass, Dhoob, Vertiver and Rat tail grass, among others. Grasses not only support herbivores, but increase microbial activity, which is important for a number of ecosystem processes, according to Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist in-charge at the Yamuna Biodiversity Park. Grasslands are crucial in open forests, providing enrichment to the soil and a food source to grazers, said Pradip Krishen, an environmentalist and author of the book Trees of Delhi. “In a dense forest, grasses will not grow too easily, as they will not receive enough sunlight, but in open forest and open expanses of the Aravallis, grasslands are important for all sizes of mammals, rodents and reptiles,” Krishen said. “Different areas need to be studied carefully before determining the type of grass that can grow there and this can be replicated in other places of the sanctuary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-plant-14-varieties-of-grass-at-asola-bhatti-wildlife-sanctuary-101643568745325.html

31-01-2022||Lucknow||For oppn, development meant family progress: Nadda||Agra Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda alleged on Sunday that ‘development’ for opposition parties meant development of their family members while the BJP regime led by Yogi Adityanath worked for all sections of society in Uttar Pradesh. The BJP was the party which delivered what it promised, claimed Nadda. Nadda first reached Shikohabad area of Firozabad district and walked for about a kilometre to campaign for the party candidate. Party supporters and candidates for assembly seats of Firozabad flanked the party president. Nadda later reached Hathras and campaigned for BJP candidate Anjula Singh Mahour. “The BJP has been only party which delivered what it promised since the days of the Jan Sangh. We have ensured development for all but for the opposition, development meant development of family members,” said Nadda who blamed Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav for praising Jinnah who divided the nation. “The Samajwadi Party leader is promising free electricity but the masses are aware that there was no power supply when he was chief minister. Such false promises are not going to work,” said Nadda. “Yogi Adityanath ended lawlessness in the state and criminals either fled or were jailed. Half of the candidates of opposition parties are on bail and the other half in jail,” he said. Nadda also cited the welfare schemes implemented by the double engine government in Uttar Pradesh. Union minister Smriti Irani was in Agra to campaign for party candidates from Agra North and Agra South assembly constituencies. “The BJP is winning the state assembly election yet again and will return to power. The masses are convinced that the BJP is the party which can carry out development and has fulfilled promises it made, including that of Ram Temple in Ayodhya,” claimed Smriti Irani and added that the BJP regime in UP ensured that criminals left the state and those who had moved away after being threatened were returning. “It was BJP workers who were out in the field to help the masses during the pandemic while SP leader Akhilesh Yadav even mocked the vaccine that saved many lives in the nation,” alleged Irani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/for-oppn-development-meant-family-progress-nadda-101643568563949.html
31-01-2022||Mumbai||War of words continues between MVA and BJP over wine sale decision in Maharashtra||The slanging match between the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continues over the decision to allow sale of wine in supermarkets, with the latter reiterating its allegation linking Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s business interest with it. On Sunday, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya said Raut’s family members entered into a partnership with a company named Magpie DFS private limited, which was involved in wine distribution last year. Raut responded, saying there is nothing wrong if someone is in a legitimate business and BJP leaders will have to go underground if he starts revealing their businesses. “On April 16, 2021, Raut became involved in a partnership with Ashok Garg. Raut’s two daughters were made directors of the company. On January 12, 2022, the company’s name and its business were also changed. With such deep financial interests, no wonder the MVA allies see no wrong in the wine sale decision which aims to make Maharashtra a ‘Madya Rashtra (liquor state),” Somaiya said. Raut said the BJP has started low level politics which will backfire. “Is it a crime if my daughters are directors in a company? What business are the children of BJP leaders involved in? Does Somaiya’s children sell peanuts or is Amit Shah’s son selling dhokla?” Nationalist Congress Party chief spokesperson and minister Nawab Malik too questioned whether the BJP leaders will shut down the distilleries and wineries owned by them. On Saturday, Vivekanand Gupta, secretary, Mumbai BJP, said Raut’s two daughters are directors in Magpie DFS private limited. The company is a subsidiary of Magpie Global which is into the supply and distribution of beverages, liquor, wine, and champagne.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/war-of-words-continues-between-mva-and-bjp-over-wine-sale-decision-in-maharashtra-101643568504168.html

31-01-2022||Delhi||Rain likely to cloud Delhi’s warm mornings this week, says IMD||The Capital spent a warm and sunny Sunday, as the maximum temperature settled at 22.2 degrees Celsius, even as the weather office predicted that an active western disturbance is likely to bring widespread rainfall to the northern plains and snowfall in the hills between February 2 and 4The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said it forecasts a drop in the mercury in Delhi on February 3 and 4.As per the IMD, while Delhi is expected to record a maximum temperature of 23 degrees in the next three days, it could hover between 19 and 20 degrees Celsius on February 3 and 4 as wind speeds touch 30-40 km/hr.RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD, says peak rainfall activity will occur on February 3rd for Delhi, with a yellow alert currently in place for the Capital.“Due to the approaching intense western disturbance, minimum temperatures are gradually going to rise over northwest India. The impact of the WD will be felt mainly in the hills and northern areas but on February 3 we can expect light rain in Delhi and parts of Uttar Pradesh as well. The system will move eastwards bringing rain to Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal also. Thereafter there will be a fall in minimum temperatures but it’s very difficult to say if there will be cold wave conditions again. Till the first half of February cold wave conditions can still arise,” said Jenamani.“We could see light showers across the city on February 3, while a drizzle is expected in parts of Delhi on February 4. Unlike the past western disturbances in January which brought moderate rainfall both times, the intensity of this will be slightly lower. However, we can still expect gusty conditions,” he added.Delhi meanwhile saw a slight increase in the minimum temperature on Sunday, climbing to 7.5 °C – one degree below the normal mark, up from 5.4°C on Saturday.Mungeshpur saw the coldest morning, with a temperature of 19.9°C, while Narela was the coldest, with the mercury dropping to 6.5°C.In its forecast, the weather office said the minimum temperature is likely to hover around the 8-degree mark over the next two days, and could touch 11 degrees by February 3.This spell of warmer weather has also meant Delhi’s air quality has remained in the ‘poor’ category, not deteriorating too much over the last one week. The capital recorded an overall air quality index (AQI) of 278 (poor) as per Central Pollution Control Board’s daily 4 pm bulletin on Sunday, a slight increase from Saturday’s reading of 251 (poor).Agencies forecast air quality to remain in the ‘poor’ category for the next three days as well, before an improvement occurs due to rain.“The AQI today indicates ‘poor’ air quality and it is likely to remain the same for the next three days (31st, 1st and 2nd) as the prevailing weather conditions are unlikely to change significantly. On 3rd, rainfall is likely to occur along with gusty winds which is expected to improve AQI through wet deposition and strong dispersion,” said Safar, a government air forecasting body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rain-likely-to-cloud-delhi-s-warm-mornings-this-week-says-imd-101643568324102.html

31-01-2022||Delhi||In Jewar resettlement town, new homes, life bring new challenges||Smoking a hookah on a sunny January morning in front of his brand new home, Vijay Pal Chauhan (65) is still not happy.“In our village, I was always surrounded by people. But in this township, I spend most of my time alone. I am not used to living like this,” said Chauhan, who has been recently displaced from Rohi, one of the seven villages acquired by the government for a new international airport in Greater Noida.In November, he shifted to the sprawling 48-acre resettlement township on the outskirts of Jewar, where villagers from Nagla Ganeshi, Nagla Sharif Khan, Nagla Phool Khan, Nagla Chhittar, Kishorepur, Rohi, and Dayanatpur Kheda have been relocated. Adult members of families whose land was acquired were allotted plots of various sizes through an online draw of lots, depending on the size of their houses in the acquired villages.Developed by the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida), the township will house over 3,500 families from the acquired villages. Over 600 families have moved in, some with their buffaloes as well as new cars bought with compensation money.But most villagers say they are struggling to navigate life in what the government refers to as a model township. What troubles them most is not just the lack of promised amenities such as a community centre, school or health centre, but the “loss of a rural lifestyle, livelihood, neighbourhood bonds, and community feelings” in their new location.“My neighbours, whose families lived next to ours for a hundred years, are no longer my neighbours. Even my three sons have got plots in three different parts. All of us lived together in our house in the village; now we live separately,” said Chauhan. “The shift to this place has disintegrated my family.”Sushila Devi, his sister-in-law, said she has not met most women of her village for over two months though many have shifted here. “It looks like they have changed, or maybe they no longer have time for me,” she said. “Even my own daughters-in-law now live separately.”The family’s tractor is parked outside the house. “It is a useless machine now as we have no land to till, but I do not have the heart to sell it,” said Chauhan.While most villagers in Rohi sold off their cattle as there was no provision in the new township to house cattle sheds, some like Chauhan chose to bring them anyway. He has turned a 50-metre plot one of his sons was allotted into what he calls a pashuwada. “I know it is not allowed, but buffaloes have always been a part of our family of farmers,” he said, pointing to two buffaloes and a cow tethered outside the shed.A few hundred metres away is Pocket 5, where families from Dayanatpur Kheda village have resettled. Nitin Kumar’s is among the families who have shifted here. Like Chauhan’s, a tractor stands outside Kumar’s new house.“We sold all our agricultural instruments such as harrows, tillers, ploughs, but did not sell the tractor, which was a symbol of pride for us in the village,” said Kumar, who is studying in a local college. “Most people, including youngsters, were engaged in agriculture, which was their primary source of income. There is no commercial space here, so we cannot even start a business.”His family spent about ₹30 lakh building the new house. “We also bought some agricultural land in Khurja district, 40 km from here, as land gives us a sense of security. Our family is living off the compensation money of ₹1 crore. At this rate, we will soon run out of money.”His uncle, Hoshiyar Singh, who got a plot next to his in the township, said that while youngsters are coping well after the relocation, life for the elderly has turned upside down.“A village has its own rhythm of life. You get up early, go to the fields, tend to your animals, spend time at the chaupal, but here all of us stay home with nothing to do,” said Singh. “This place is a concrete jungle. Imagine what it must be like for villagers who lived all their lives surrounded by trees and agricultural fields.”A few children are playing cricket in the park outside his house. “That park is our everything — our chaupal, our playground, our only piece of greenery, ” said Singh. “Displacement has brought a new social order in the village. All the villages had mohallas based on their castes, but here they all are living together, so far in harmony.”While the township is yet to get the promised school, community centre, crematorium, graveyard and health centre, the roads are paved and every residental pocket has its own park. Most houses are yet to get water and electricity connections though, and depend on generators. There is no shopping complex, but a few villagers have opened hole-in-the-wall grocery stores and pharmacies.Gabbar Khan is sitting outside his house in Pocket 7 in the township, where he lives with his wife and five children. The pocket houses families from Nagla Chhittar, a village dominated by the minority community, most of whom were landless farm labour. The poverty is reflected in the houses in this part of the township, where, unlike Pocket 1, which has large houses and new cars, most houses are small, single-storey structures.“I sold my goats as I had no place to keep them here. They were my source of livelihood. I used to sell their milk. Besides, in the village, my family also found work in the agricultural fields as labourers. Now we have no work. We had no land, so we got no compensation apart from this plot and little money against the small brick house I had in the village,” said Khan, who has set up an egg stall outside his house in the new township.His neighbour Shaira interjects: “My buffaloes used to provide us with 15kg of milk every day. Now, I buy 1kg packaged milk every day to make tea. I cannot afford to buy enough milk even for my children. I am going to somehow buy a buffalo and keep it right there, whether it is allowed or not.”But what worries Shri Pal Singh(70), a retired principal in Dayanatpur Kheda, is the lack of a crematorium. People, he said, have to travel about 10 km to cremate the dead near their razed villages. “Even our mail comes to our old addresses, where our houses are now just mounds of rubble. People here are facing many problems that no social impact study might have taken into account.”Surendra Singh, divisional commissioner (Meerut), who is also the rehabilitation and resettlement commissioner for the airport project, said the government is sorting out the issues.“We have bought land for both the crematorium and graveyard near the township and they will soon be ready. The tender for the school has been issued, and the one for the community centre will be issued after the elections. The township will have every facility promised in the resettlement and rehabilitation scheme.”But Chauhan in Pocket 1 is not quite sure it will change anything. “Officials promised that they would replicate our villager here. But it is not possible. Our villages are gone for good, and so are our joys and pleasures of village life.”

31-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: ECI to review ban on physical rallies, roadshows today||The Election Commission of India (ECI) will on Monday review the Covid situation in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh to take a decision over the ban it imposed on physical rallies, roadshows and “padyatras” in view of the surge in Covid cases while announcing the poll schedule for five states, including UP, on January 8. While assessing the Covid situation on January 22, the ECI had given certain relaxations to political parties, including organising meetings at designated open spaces, indoor meetings as well as door-to-door campaign. With UP registering a decline in fresh Covid cases as active Covid cases in the state came down to 55,574 on Sunday (January 30) from the peak on January 17 when 1,06,616 active cases were reported, the poll panel is likely to give more relaxation to the political parties in organising election campaign on Monday. The filing of nomination papers for the first phase of assembly election on 58 seats in 11 districts and 55 assembly segments in 9 districts of west UP in the second phase has culminated while filing of papers for the third phase poll on 59 seats in 16 districts and for the fourth phase on 60 seats in 9 districts is continuing after the ECI issued notifications for these phases. In the first phase on February 10, polling will be held on 58 assembly constituencies located in 11 districts, including Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Hapur, Gautam Buddh Nagar (Noida), Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Mathura and Agra. In the second phase, polling on 55 assembly seats in 9 districts, including Saharanpur, Bijnor, Amroha, Moradabad, Sambhal, Rampur, Bareilly, Buduan and Shahjahanpur will be on February 14. Polling for the third phase on 59 seats in Hathras, Kasganj, Etah, Firozabad, Farrukhabad, Mainpuri, Etawah, Kannauj, Auriya, Kanpur Nagar, Kanpur Dehat, Jalaun, Hamirpur, Mahoba, Jhansi and Lalitpur districts will be held on February 20 while polling on 60 assembly seats in Pilibhit, Kheri, Sitapur, Hardoi, Lucknow, Unnao, Rae Bareli, Fatehpur and Banda will be held in the fourth phase on February 23. Collectively, the 45 districts going to poll in four phases have 41,751 active Covid cases of the total 55,574 active cases in the state which is around 75.12% of the Covid caseload in UP making the task of permitting the political parties to hold rallies, roadshows and “padyatras” challenging for the poll panel. With 8,100 fresh Covid-19 cases across UP in the last 24 hours, the tally of active cases in the state is 55,574. The state is also witnessing an increase in Covid deaths. Within 30 days starting January 1, Uttar Pradesh reported a total 274 deaths, majority of which have been reported in the districts located in west UP and the state capital. “The state has ramped up Covid vaccination. Among eligible beneficiaries above 18 years of age in Uttar Pradesh, 14,66,76,992 first doses of Covid vaccine have been administered so far, which is 99.49% of the eligible population. Among the beneficiaries, 10,14,97,070 people have got their second dose which is 68.85% of the eligible population. In the age group of 15-18 years, 90,99,722 people have been given first dose while a precautionary dose has been given to 12,53,210 people, including health workers, frontline workers and people above 60 years with comorbidities,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, UP. The recovery rate that was 93.8% on January 22 increased to 95.9% on Sunday, said a health department officer. Uttar Pradesh chief electoral officer Ajay Kumar Shukla said, “The political parties and candidates have been directed to comply with the Covid appropriate behaviour, guidelines as well as model code of conduct during election campaign and filing of nomination papers.” 
31-01-2022||World||US Prez Joe Biden issues an infrastructure 'roadmap' to help spend $1 trillion||President Joe Biden urged US governors on Monday to ramp up their construction plans as his administration rolled out a guidebook for accessing the nearly $1 trillion made available by the bipartisan infrastructure deal.Biden welcomed governors to the White House on Monday as part of the winter meeting of the National Governors Association, and he cajoled them on the importance of infrastructure.“You know how to build roads and bridges,” the Democratic president told them. “Well, we got a hell of a lot to build.”Mitch Landrieu, a senior White House adviser who is supervising the infrastructure spending, said the goal of the 461-page book is to ensure that all communities have the details on how to qualify for funding, no matter their size or politics.“It's an absolute road map," said Landrieu, a former mayor of New Orleans.The book is meant to level the playing field by making it easier for smaller cities, tribal leaders, nonprofits and faith-based groups to compete for money that usually only lobbyists know how to access. The infrastructure deal is unique in its scope as it goes beyond roads and bridges to include such initiatives as broadband internet, replacement of lead water pipes and resilience against climate change.Administration officials assembled the book quickly as the infrastructure package became law on Nov. 15. Copies are available online at build.gov, though the administration is working with associations and direct contacts to make sure it reaches government officials in communities of all sizes. Landrieu said he has already spoken with 43 governors and more than 250 mayors as part of the push.The infrastructure package includes 375 distinct programs, of which 125 are new. And while the guidebook is more than twice the size of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel “The Great Gatsby,” it's considerably shorter and easier to navigate than the infrastructure law, which stretched for more than 1,000 pages.About 60% of the funds are available through formula and 40% through competitive applications. Not all the infrastructure money is able to go out as the federal government is operating on a continuing resolution that runs through Feb. 18, instead of an annual budget. Still, not all of the money will go out immediately as the programs are generally operating on a five- to seven-year timeline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-issues-an-infrastructure-roadmap-to-help-spend-1-trillion-101643652141171.html
31-01-2022||World||Ukraine: At United Nations, India calls for immediate de-escalation of tensions||In its continued attempt to balance its close strategic ties with both the United States (US) and Russia, India has called for an immediate de-escalation of tensions related to Ukraine.India reiterated its support for a peaceful resolution of the issue for long-term peace and stability, appealed for quiet and constructive diplomacy, supported the ongoing diplomatic talks between various stakeholders (US, European countries, Ukraine and Russia) under various formats, asked all sides to avoid steps that may increase tension, called for the implementation of existing agreements, and prioritised the safety of over 20,000 Indians in Ukraine.India’s permanent representative to the United Nations (UN), T S Tirumurti, articulated New Delhi’s most detailed position on the issue so far, building up on a ministry of external affairs (MEA) statement on Friday, at a meeting of the UN Security Council (UNSC) in New York on Monday. The council witnessed a stormy confrontation between the US and Russia.Earlier, India was among the three countries that abstained from a vote on whether the Council should take up the situation in Ukraine as a possible threat to international peace and security. But with 10 of the 15 members voting in favor of the agenda - only Russia and China opposed it - the UNSC saw a discussion on the geopolitical crisis that has created the most serious rift between the US and Russia in years.The US had requested an open Council meeting, citing the threat posed by what it alleges is Russia’s military build-up along the Ukrainian border. India was joined in its abstention by Kenya and Gabon. Russia subsequently thanked the countries which opposed or abstained from the vote to discuss the proposal.Tirumurti said India had been closely following evolving developments related to Ukraine, including talks between the US and Russia and under the Normandy Format in Paris (the format includes Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia). “India’s interest is in finding a solution that can provide for immediate de-escalation of tensions, taking into account the legitimate security interests of all countries and aimed towards securing long-term peace and stability in the region and beyond.”He reiterated that India believed the issues could only be resolved through diplomatic dialogue. “We welcome the efforts under way, including under the Minsk Agreement and Normandy Format…we also welcome the unconditional observance of the July 2020 ceasefire…we also welcome their agreement to meet in Berlin in two weeks.”The Minsk agreement of 2014 and 2015 outlines steps to end the conflict in Ukraine through a political settlement. Moscow has blamed Kiev for not implementing the agreement, while Kiev has placed the blame on Moscow’s interference and its support for separatists in the eastern region.India “urged all parties to continue to engage through all diplomatic channels and keep working towards the full implementation of the Minsk package”.Tirumurti said that “quiet and constructive diplomacy” was the need of the hour. “Any steps that increase tensions may best be avoided by all sides.”He added that 20,000 Indian nationals, including students, lived in Ukraine, including in its bordering areas, and their safety was India’s priority.The debate at the Council however saw a blame game between the US and Russia on who exactly was escalating tensions.The US permanent representative to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, reiterated America’s allegations that Russia had amassed 100,000 troops along the Ukrainian border; it had sent additional troops to Belarus; it had launched cyber attacks and disinformation campaigns; and its actions show an intent to further invade Ukraine, in what was an attack on the principle of state sovereignty under the UN charter.The Russian permanent representative to the UN, Vassily Alekseevich Nebenzia, argued that Russian troops were in Russian territory; accused the US of making allegations without proof and creating hysteria when there was no threat; cited American claims in the run to the 2003 Iraq war in the Security Council about weapons of mass destruction as evidence of the US’s track record; reiterated the Russian claim that it had no intention of invading Ukraine; and blamed western powers of encouraging Kiev to sabotage the Minsk agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-at-un-india-calls-for-immediate-de-escalation-of-tensions-101643651252134.html

The sanctions also hit the KT Services and Logistics Company, which operates a major port in Myanmar's economic hub of Yangon, and its CEO as well as the procurement department of the country's defense ministry.“The United States will continue to work with our international partners to address human rights abuses and press the regime to cease the violence, release all those unjustly detained, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and restore Burma’s path to democracy,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-myanmar-judiciary-officials-on-feb-1-coup-anniversary-101643650531032.html

The 2008 Constitution required him to seek the president’s permission at the council’s meeting to formally extend the state of emergency. To mark the one-year anniversary of taking office, Min Aung Hlaing will deliver a public speech at 8 a.m. local time on Tuesday. He’s expected to face a spiraling economy in the second year of his reign, given international pressures.More than 1,500 civilians were killed and nearly 12,000 others were arrested by the junta since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. The U.S. on Monday issued fresh sanctions against seven people and two entities linked to the junta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-extends-state-of-emergency-as-coup-anniversary-nears-101643647345686.html
31-01-2022||World||‘Time to look ourselves in mirror’: Johnson vows to overhaul top team after ‘partygate’ criticism||Boris Johnson pledged an overhaul of his top team in government after an interim report into rule-breaking parties during lockdown found “failures of leadership and judgment” and criticized “excessive” drinking.“I get it, and I will fix it,” the UK prime minister told parliament on Monday. He apologized “for the things we simply didn’t get right” and said it was time to “look ourselves in the mirror and learn.”London’s Metropolitan Police is investigating 12 gatherings in Downing Street on eight dates, according to the report published by Sue Gray. The outcome of the police probe will prove a moment of extreme danger for Johnson, as many Tory lawmakers are waiting for its findings before deciding whether to topple their leader.Johnson pledged to make changes to the way Downing Street and the Cabinet Office were run, including by creating an “office of the prime minister” with a permanent secretary to lead Number 10.Johnson also vowed to say more in the coming days on “improving the operations of Number 10”, hinting at potential staffing changes. He will address Conservative MPs privately later on Monday.In her 12-page interim report, Gray said some of the gatherings “should not have been allowed to take place” while “other events should not have been allowed to develop as they did.”“Against the backdrop of the pandemic, when the government was asking citizens to accept far-reaching restrictions on their lives, some of the behavior surrounding these gatherings is difficult to justify,” she said in a damning set of conclusions that she described as “general limited findings.”While the probe represents a moment of political peril for the prime minister, Johnson himself escaped direct censure for now. Gray stressed she was unable to provide a “meaningful report” outlining the “extensive factual information I have been able to gather” due to the Metropolitan Police starting their own investigation last week. The police asked Gray last week to make only “minimal reference” to the gatherings they are investigating, thought to be the most damaging allegations. Gray said she had decided not to publish “factual accounts” of the four events she was allowed to report on, as it would affect the overall balance of her findings.Events subject to the police probe include a gathering in the Downing Street garden in May 2020 which Johnson has said he attended, and an event to apparently celebrate the premier’s birthday the following month.The prime minister is trying to draw a line under the steady drip-drip of allegations, dubbed “Partygate” by the U.K. media. They have undermined his leadership in recent months, leading some lawmakers within his own ruling Conservatives to talk openly about ousting the prime minister and causing his party to plunge in the polls.‘Excessive’ DrinkingIn her partial report, Gray said “at least some of the gatherings” represented “a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.” She said “too little thought” was given to the conditions faced by people across the U.K. under lockdown.There were “failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of Number 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times,” she said.Gray also criticized the “excessive consumption of alcohol” in government buildings, saying steps must be taken to ensure every department has a “clear and robust policy” to cover drinking in the workplace.She said some staff had wanted to raise concerns about behaviors at work “but at times felt unable to do so” and also warned there were too many people working in Johnson’s Downing Street office.“There is significant learning to be drawn from these events which must be addressed immediately across government,” Gray concluded. “This does not need to wait for the police investigations to be concluded.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/-look-ourselves-in-mirror-johnson-vows-to-overhaul-top-team-after-partygate-criticism-101643645193926.html

"I am feeling fine – and I’ll continue to work remotely this week while following public health guidelines," Trudeau wrote on Twitter.This morning, I tested positive for COVID-19. I’m feeling fine – and I’ll continue to work remotely this week while following public health guidelines. Everyone, please get vaccinated and get boosted.The development came amid reports that he was "shifted to a secret location" after a large-scale protest opposing Covid vaccine mandates converged on Parliament Hill.On Saturday, thousands of protesters with trucks converged in the capital city of Ottawa, calling for an end to Covid-19 vaccine mandates and other public health restrictions.The demonstration had started as a protest against a vaccine requirement for cross-border drivers, but developed into a demonstration against the Trudeau government with a strong anti-vaccination streak.Canada has one of the world's highest rates of vaccination against the Covid-19 — shots which are primarily designed to keep those who become infected from falling seriously ill. In January, the leader got his third dose of vaccine as booster shot. Canada has recorded more than 2.9 million cases of Covid-19 and more than 33,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-trudeau-in-hiding-over-vaccine-stir-says-he-s-covid-19-positive-101643641150329.html

31-01-2022||World||In a first, UAE to lift tax-free status, brings new rules on corporate earning||The United Arab Emirates plans to introduce a federal tax on corporate earnings for the first time next year, in its latest step toward dismantling a levy-free regime that helped make it a magnet for businesses from across the world.The government’s set to introduce a 9% federal corporate tax on business profits from June 2023, state-run WAM news agency said Monday. Corporate tax won’t apply on personal income from employment, real estate and other investments, and incentives for free-zone companies that don’t do business with the mainland will continue.“Introducing a CT regime reaffirms the UAE’s commitment to meeting international standards for tax transparency and preventing harmful tax practices,” the UAE ministry of finance said on its website.UAE Faces Risk of Inclusion on Global Watchlist Over Dirty MoneyThe move comes despite rising competition from neighboring Saudi Arabia, which has been offering new incentives to encourage international firms to shift their Middle East headquarters to the kingdom. Amid a gradual introduction of taxes that’s made the UAE a more expensive place to live than it once was, the government took several significant steps during the pandemic to encourage the foreigners who make up most of its population to stay for the long haul. In 2020, the government abolished the need for companies to have Emirati shareholders -- a major shake-up of foreign-ownership laws -- and last year it unveiled plans to offer citizenship to a select group of foreigners.This month, the UAE switched to a Saturday-Sunday weekend to synchronize better with the global economy. It wasn’t immediately clear how the latest measures fit into that broader trend or whether they might prompt some companies to relocate to Saudi Arabia or elsewhere. Saudi Arabia Eyes 7,000 Global Firms as Dubai Rivalry Heats UpEarlier measures had already dented the UAE’s status as a tariff-free haven for both businesses and individuals. The Gulf oil exporter introduced a 5% value-added tax in 2018 and later imposed a 5% customs duty on imports. It already taxes banks and insurance companies operating outside of the country’s vast network of free zones as much as 20% on their profits. The oil and gas sector of OPEC’s third-biggest producer is also taxed under a separate scheme. “This was the logical next step although it came much earlier than many of us had expected,” said David Daly, a partner at Gulf Tax Accounting Group. “There is quite a bit of detail that needs to come out still but for large companies operating in the UAE, corporate taxes were expected and now they know the rate.”  The new rules, and the relatively low tax threshold of 375,000 dirhams ($102,100) in annual profits, will require thousands of companies to pay tax for the first time and will likely hit net incomes, according to Tarek Fadlallah, head of Nomura Asset Management’s Middle East unit. “The introduction of corporate tax will apply from June 2023 so there is an adjustment period for listed companies to prepare,” he said. “But this will necessarily impact net profit forecasts going forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-first-uae-to-lift-tax-free-status-bring-new-rules-on-corporate-earning-101643634252259.html

I urge you to reject any diplomatic credentials presented to you by Masood Khan and reject any effort by the Government of Pakistan to install this jihadist as Pakistan’s Ambassador to the United States,” the Pennsylvania wrote in the letter.He said the Imran Khan government’s “nomination of a bona fide terrorist sympathiser working to undermine our interests in the region – as well as the security of our Indian allies – can only be described as a breathtaking lack of judgment at best, and a demonstration of Islamabad’s unmitigated contempt for the United States at worst.”Perry said Khan has praised both terrorists and foreign terrorist organisations, including Hizbul Mujahideen. “He has encouraged young men to emulate jihadists like Burhan Wani, a former commander of Hizbul Mujahideen who dedicated his life to a holy war against India.”Khan has also on the United States to free would-be mass murderer Aafia Siddiqui. “In 2010, Siddiqui was convicted of attempting to murder American troops. Since then, jihadists have regularly clamored for her release – to include the perpetrator behind the anti-Semitic hostage crisis in Colleyville, Texas earlier this month,” the letter read.

Security Council Resolutions, but analysts say land-attack cruise missiles can be no less a threat than ballistic missiles.HWASONG-12North Korea first launched the Hwasong-12 IRBM in April 2017, in a test that “pinwheeled” out of control and was considered a failure by U.S. and South Korean officials.Two more test flights that month also ended in apparent failure, with the missiles exploding seconds after launch or breaking up in flight.The first successful flight was in May 2017, and North Korea went on to launch two more Hwasong-12s that year, flying them over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.In Sunday's test, North Korea said it fired the missile on an elevated trajectory "in consideration of the safety of neighbouring countries."The test "confirmed the accuracy, safety, and operational effectiveness of the produced Hwasong-12 type weapon system," KCNA said. South Korea reported the missile reached an altitude of about 2,000 km (1,243 miles) and flew to a distance of 800 km.The Hwasong-12 has an estimated range of 4,500 km (2,800 miles), which would put the U.S. territory of Guam and the far western tip of Alaska's Aleutian Islands chain within reach, according to the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.It can carry a "large-size heavy nuclear warhead," according to state media, and in 2017 North Korea threatened to use it to target Guam with "enveloping fire."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-hypersonics-to-workhorse-weapons-northa-korea-showcases-missile-diversity-101643602398847.html
31-01-2022||World||North Korea confirms test of Hwasong-12 missile capable of striking Guam||North Korea confirmed it had fired a Hwasong-12 "mid-range ballistic missile", state media reported Monday, the first time it has tested a weapon that powerful since 2017.Seoul's military said it had detected the launch Sunday of an intermediate-range ballistic missile -- Pyongyang's seventh weapons test in January.North Korea has never test-fired this many missiles in a calendar month before and last week threatened to abandon a nearly five-year-long self-imposed moratorium on testing long-range and nuclear weapons, blaming US "hostile" policy for forcing its hand."The evaluation test-fire of Hwasong 12-type ground-to-ground intermediate- and long-range ballistic missile was conducted Sunday," the official Korean Central News Agency said.The test "confirmed the accuracy, security and effectiveness of the operation of the Hwasong 12-type weapon system under production," KCNA added.KCNA said the test was carried out using the "highest-angle launch system" to ensure the safety of neighboring countries, and that the warhead carried a camera that took photos while it was in space.With peace talks with Washington stalled, North Korea has doubled down on leader Kim Jong Un's vow to modernise the regime's armed forces, flexing Pyongyang's military muscles despite biting international sanctions.South Korea said Sunday that North Korea appeared to be following a "similar pattern" to 2017 -- when tensions were last at breaking point on the peninsula -- warning Pyongyang could soon restart nuclear and intercontinental missile tests.The last time Pyongyang tested an intermediate-range missile was the Hwasong-12 in 2017, which analysts said at the time was powerful enough to put the US territory of Guam in range.The string of launches in 2022 comes at a delicate time in the region, with Kim's sole major ally China set to host the Winter Olympics next month and South Korea gearing up for a presidential election in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-confirms-test-of-hwasong-12-missile-capable-of-striking-guam-101643594566297.html

"To our knowledge, this content advisory is the first of its kind by a major podcast platform."Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan also expressed their concern to Spotify about Covid-19 misinformation on its platform and are committed to continuing to work with the company, a spokesperson for their Archewell foundation said on Sunday.The advisory will direct listeners to a Covid-19 hub that contains facts and information from medical and health experts, as well as links to trusted sources.The move comes after singer-songwriters Neil Young and Joni Mitchell announced they are removing their music from Spotify in protest that the popular streaming service has allowed the airing of misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines.Young objected to his music being played on the same platform as Joe Rogan's top-rated podcast "The Joe Rogan Experience." A prominent vaccine skeptic, Rogan has stirred controversy with his views on the pandemic, government mandates and vaccines to control the spread of the coronavirus.Earlier this month, 270 scientists and medical professionals signed a letter urging Spotify to take action against Rogan, accusing him of spreading falsehoods on the podcast.In a tweet on Saturday best-selling author Brene Brown -- host of the Spotify-exclusive podcasts "Unlocking Us" and "Dare to Lead" -- said she would "not be releasing any podcasts until further notice."Brown could not immediately be reached for comment.Spotify is also publishing platform rules for its creators, according to Ek's post."We know we have a critical role to play in supporting creator expression while balancing it with the safety of our users," he wrote. "In that role, it is important to me that we don’t take on the position of being content censor while also making sure that there are rules in place and consequences for those who violate them."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spotify-to-add-content-advisory-to-podcasts-discussing-covid19-101643593961675.html
31-01-2022||World||US Navy veteran's release ‘non-negotiable’ for Taliban's legitimacy: Biden||US President Joe Biden on Sunday called on the Taliban to release US Navy veteran Mark Frerichs, who has been held captive for two years. Biden said in a statement Frerichs’s release was non-negotiable before the Taliban can expect any consideration of its aspirations for legitimacy.Frerichs, a native of Illinois, was helping with construction projects in Afghanistan when he was taken captive. Biden assured all the Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained overseas that his administration will continue to work steadfastly until every American being unjustly held against their wish returns home.“A civil engineer, he spent a decade helping the people of Afghanistan. He has done nothing wrong," Biden said in a statement.The statement added, “Threatening the safety of Americans or any innocent civilians is always unacceptable, and hostage-taking is an act of particular cruelty and cowardice. The Taliban must immediately release Mark before it can expect any consideration of its aspirations for legitimacy. This is not negotiable.”Over 100 ex-Afghan and international forces killed, UN saysState Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement that the US has raised Frerichs's case in every meeting with the Taliban."[W]e have been clear that the legitimacy the Taliban seek is impossible to consider while they hold a US citizen hostage. His release is among our core, non-negotiable priorities. We will continue to send a clear message to Taliban leadership: immediately and safely release Mark and disavow the practice of hostage-taking," Price said.The Sunni Pashtun group took control of Afghanistan in August last year but is yet to receive recognition from the international community given its history of human rights violations. Afghanistan is facing a grave humanitarian crisis following the ouster of the Western-back government, compounded by suspension of foreign aid, the freezing of Afghan government assets, and international sanctions on the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-veteran-s-release-non-negotiable-for-taliban-s-legitimacy-biden-101643588187263.html

It comes during Yemen's years-long war and the collapse of Iran's nuclear deal with world powers.The UAE's state-run WAM news agency reported the interception, saying that “the attack did not result in any losses, as the remnants of the ballistic missile fell outside the populated areas.”It wasn't immediately clear where the missile remnants fell. The country's civilian air traffic control agency said there was no immediate effect on air travel in the UAE, home to the long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad.Already, the country's top prosecutor has threatened that people who film or post images of such an incident would face criminal charges in the UAE, an autocratic federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. That makes reporting on such incidents even more complicated for journalists.Houthi military spokesman Yehia Sarei wrote on Twitter that the rebels would make an announcement about an attack in the coming hours that reached into “the depths of the UAE."He did not elaborate and there was nothing immediately reported on the Houthis' Al-Masirah satellite news channel.Israeli President Isaac Herzog is in the country on a state visit. The ceremonial leader met Sunday with Abu Dhabi's powerful crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.It wasn't immediately clear how the missile attack would affect the rest of Herzog's trip. Israeli officials could not be immediately reached for comment.Last week, a similar attack saw both Emirati and US forces fire interceptor missiles to bring down a Houthi attack. The week before that saw a Houthi drone-and-missile attack strike an Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. fuel depot, killing three people and wounding six others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-intercepts-yemen-missile-as-israeli-president-visits-101643586245337.html
31-01-2022||World||Thousands stage protest in Ottawa against Canada’s vaccine mandates||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family were taken to an undisclosed location as thousands of demonstrators protesting Covid-19 vaccine mandates gathered in Ottawa, the country’s capital, on Saturday.The prime minister’s office updated Trudeau’s itinerary to say he was somewhere in the National Capital Region, when usually he is at Rideau Cottage in Ottawa. Trudeau recently went into isolation, and has been working remotely, after one of his children tested positive for Covid-19. The so-called “Freedom Convoy” started out as a rally of truckers against a vaccine mandates for cross-border drivers, but turned into a demonstration against government overreach, including vaccine passports and lockdowns, during the pandemic. Many arrived in the capital from various part of the country and laid siege to Parliament Hill, the seat of power.The group has organised itself under the name Canadian Unity, managing to raise more than CAN$8.4 million. “We are taking our fight to the doorsteps of our Federal Government and demanding that they cease all mandates against its people,” a declaration on the website said. The protestors have threatened to camp in Ottawa till their demands are met.Trudeau on Thursday, ahead of the demonstrations, described the protesters as belonging to a “fringe minority”.Much of the capital was shut down due to the arrival of the protesters. However, Ottawa police service said on Saturday night that there “have been no incidents of violence or injuries reported,” adding that “many streets in the downtown core are closed or impassable to vehicles.”Concerns were raised over the possible presence of extremist elements in the group after at least one Nazi flag was seen, and protesters danced at and desecrated sites like the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and National War Memorial.This drew a sharp reaction from minister of national defence Anita Anand, who said that these were “sacred sites” for the country and the “behaviour” seen was “beyond reprehensible” in a post on Twitter.Even though more than a quarter of Canadian truckers are of Indian origin - mainly immigrants from Punjab - their presence at the protests was muted, barring some videos and photographs of their joining the participants, including serving food.The Ottawa Sikh Society (OSS) said the Gurdwara Sahib would be closed over the weekend after several social media posts said truckers could find food and shelter at the gurdwara. It said on Facebook that posts suggesting that the gurdwara “will accommodate truckers’ convoy” were “false and unauthorised”, and OSS was “not associated with this protest in any shape or form”.The Canadian Truckers’ Alliance (CTA) has already disassociated itself from the protest and has said nearly 90% of its approximately 300,000 members were vaccinated.Referring to the vaccine mandate on truckers shuttling between Canada and the United States, which went into force on January 15, the CTA said, “The only way to cross the border, in a commercial truck or any other vehicle, is to get vaccinated. As an industry we must adapt and comply with this mandate and the vast majority have.”In a statement on Saturday, it added, “To those in the trucking industry that have chosen to participate in this protest regarding cross-border mandates, we ask that you engage in a peaceful demonstration today then leave the City of Ottawa to avoid any issues to the welfare and safety of the citizens of Ottawa.”While the protests will continue, authorities could face challenges as the work week commences, particularly as the House of Commons is scheduled to convene on Monday.
31-01-2022||India||HT This Day: February 02, 2003 -- Kalpana Chawla, 6 other astronauts die||The US space shuttle Columbia, with India-born Kalpana Chawla among a seven-member crew, disintegrated in flames over Texas 16 minutes before it was to land on Saturday morning at the end of a 16-day mission. Officials in Washington said that there was no immediate indication of terrorism. A senior U.S. official said there was no threat made against the flight and that the shuttle was out of range of a surface-to-air missile. Columbia was at an altitude of 200,700 feet over north-central Texas at around 8 am central time (7:30 pm IST), travelling at 12,500 mph when the NASA mission control lost voice and radar contact. The spacecraft had reentered the atmosphere and according to video images, was descending at a severe trajectory. In north Texas, people reported hearing a “big bang” around the same time, some saying it was like a “sonic boom”. Television footage showed a bright light followed by smoke plumes streaking diagonally through the sky Debris appeared to break off into separate balls of light as it continued downward. Janet Smith-Bozart, who was driving near Dallas, described the shuttle’s descent. “I thought at first it might be a meteor coming into the atmosphere and then I realised it was much too big and much too slow for that,” she said. “Essentially the entire thing just broke apart and the whole thing just disappeared. ... Eventually it just sort of faded and there was no more contrail or anything.” NASA declared an emergency and sent search teams to the Dallas-Fort Worth area where much of the debris had landed, and warned residents not to touch the “hazardous” debris. Six Americans were on board, including commander Rick Husband and Chawla, both of whom were the only ones with space flight experience. Columbia’s crew had completed 80 plus scientific research experiments during their time in orbit. Security had been extraordinarily tight for Columbia’s 16-day scientific research mission because of the presence of Ilan Ramon, the first Israeli astronaut. It was the 113th flight in the shuttle programme’s 22 years and the 28th flight for Columbia, NASA oldest shuttle. In 42 years of U.S. human space flight, there had never been an accident during the descent to Earth or landing. On Jan.28, 1986, space shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthis-day-february-02-2003-kalpana-chawla-6-other-astronauts-die-101643651253282.html

31-01-2022||India||HT This Day: February 01, 2010 — AGELESS At 36, Leander Paes wins Australian Open — his 11th Grand Slam title||By 36, most tennis players retire. Their bodies give up. But not Leander Adrian Paes, who seems to be entering an exalted zone where he is still pulling off big wins with incredible regularity.“Honestly, I am winning for I have reached a stage where I just don’t have to prove anything any more. That allows me to have fun out there without any pressure. The best tennis happens when one plays free, without the mental load of always having to win,” Paes told Hindustan Times over the telephone from Melbourne after claiming his 11th Grand Slam title on Sunday.Paes has figured in 21 Slam doubles finals so far and is not stopping anytime soon. “Earlier, I would have 10 shots planned in my head. Now, I keep it simple. It took a long time to devise a method to win. Now, I have the formula. Actually, over the last two to three years, I am playing far better doubles than earlier in my career because I am actually more economical in my shot-making,” he said.After over two decades of competitive tennis, the biggest factor for the player is nursing his body.“Recovery has become the crucial thing now. Off days between matches are all about yoga, meditation and massages along with the right mix of fluid intake and diet.“It helps that I never smoked or indulged in alcohol,” he added.But for the man who left home at the age of 13 to sculpt his tennis destiny, it is getting lonely out there.“The week after week of travel is tough. I miss my family and especially my daughter Aiyana. But as long as I am enjoying it out on court, I will go on,” he said.Surely, the fact that his estranged former partner Mahesh Bhupathi had more Slam titles than him rankled at some level? With this win, Paes has leveled the score.“What people don’t seem to figure is that after you have won a number of titles, they just become numbers.“After that you only care about the enjoyable ones like my last one,” he said laughing, without mentioning that he is referring to his victory over Bhupathi and partner at the US Open last year.Paes is hardly resting on his laurels.“The Commonwealth and Asian Games are priorities for me. I play my best when the pride of the tricolour is at stake,” he said.Ever since tennis was included in the Asian Games in 1958, India have won 17 medals. Paes has played a part in garnering nine of them since he debuted in 1990.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-february-01-2010-ageless-at-36-leander-paes-wins-australian-open-his-11th-grand-slam-title-101643648191093.html

The teenager, who was handed over to Indian Army by China’s Peoples’ Liberation Army (PLA) on January 27, met his parents at an event held at Tuting in Upper Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh. “Indian Army handed over Miram Taron, 17-year-old boy earlier brought back to India from Chinese PLA custody, to his parents at Tuting, Arunachal Pradesh on 31 Jan. He was given an emotional and rousing welcome by parents and locals,” mentioned a tweet by Spear Corps of Indian Army. Taron, a native of Zido village in Upper Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh, went missing from near the LAC on January 18. Initially, the teen, was believed to have been allegedly abducted by the PLA when he and a friend had gone on a hunting trip. A tweet by BJP MP from Arunachal-East, Tapir Gao, alleging that Taron was abducted from inside Indian territory, gave rise to those theories. But Indian Army clarified on January 27, the day he was handed over by PLA, that it was not the case and that he had “inadvertently strayed and went missing”.

31-01-2022||India||SC refuses to hear petition to pull down movie against Gandhiji||The Supreme Court on Monday directed a petitioner seeking a ban on the screening of the movie “Why I killed Gandhi” to approach the high court even as the Court called such portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi as “unfortunate”.Refusing to entertain the petition filed by a young political activist Sikander Behl, a bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and JK Maheshwari said, “A writ petition under Article 32 (in the Supreme Court) may only be filed on infringement of fundamental right. No fundamental right of the petitioner appears to have been violated.”Behl’s petition sought an order to remove all contents from the movie that was launched on an OTT platform on Sunday, coinciding with the death anniversary of the Father of the Nation. His lawyer Anuj Bhandari told the Court that it was a clear violation of Article 21 as the feelings of an entire country had been hurt by the portrayal of Gandhi, revered as a national icon, by calling him ‘napunsak’ (translated as impotent) and the one responsible for atrocities against Hindus in Pakistan.“A joke is being made on Gandhiji and a national icon is being defamed in this manner and this content is all over the internet,” Bhandari said.The bench remarked, “That is most unfortunate.” However, it questioned Bhandari on why a petition was directly filed in the Supreme Court instead of the high court. Bhandari said, “The content being shown extends throughout the country. I have also raised the issue of regulating content of OTT as currently the movies streamed on such platforms are not censored by the Central Board of Film Certification.”The Court further added in its order, “It appears petitioner as a citizen may have a serious cause of concern. The petitioner is at liberty to approach the high court under Article 226.” The Court told the petitioner that since the petition has made the ministry of information and broadcasting along with the film producer as respondents, there was no harm in approaching the high court.At the time of filing of the petition, only the trailer of the movie lasting a little over two minutes was out. Relying on the same, the petition said, “In the movie’s trailer, an attempt has been made to blame Mahatma Gandhi for the partition of India and atrocities against Hindus in Pakistan, and thereby an attempt has been made to justify the killing of the Mahatma.” Bhandari said, “This movie will be seen by children as well. We are allowing a national icon known as Bapu to be defamed in this manner. An order from the top court will be sufficient to curb this content.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-to-hear-petition-to-pull-down-movie-against-gandhiji-101643642550032.html
31-01-2022||India||TRS MPs shun President Kovind’s address in Parliament||Telangana Rashtra Samithi Members of Parliament abstained from President Ramnath Kovind’s address to the joint session of Parliament on the first day of the Budget Session which began on Monday.The TRS MPs, who attended the six-hours-long meeting of the TRS parliamentary party at the camp office of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday night, decided to keep away from the Presidential address in protest against the alleged indifferent attitude of the Centre towards Telangana’s projects.The MPs, including nine Lok Sabha members and five Rajya Sabha members, left for New Delhi on Monday evening to attend the parliament session from Tuesday, when Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman would present the annual budget, a senior TRS leader familiar with the development said.At the parliamentary party meeting, KCR asked his party MPs to raise their voice in both the Houses, if Telangana does not get its due in the budgetary allocations to various sectors.“The chief minister gave us a comprehensive note of around 20 issues pertaining to Telangana to be raised in Parliament during the budget session. He has already written several letters to the Centre on various issues concerning the state,” TRS MP from Chevella, G Ranjith Reddy said.He pointed out that during the Winter Session, the TRS MPs had registered their protest over the faulty agriculture procurement policy of the Centre. “We shall watch out for Tuesday’s Union budget and if the allocations to the state are not satisfactory, we shall raise our voice in the House,” Reddy said.The TRS chief asked the MPs to put up a tough fight against the Centre both inside and outside Parliament, so that the injustice to Telangana should be thoroughly exposed.Issues like pending promises made in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act such as setting up of a Tribal University, Bayyaram steel factory and railway coach factory at Kazipet etc will be raised, apart from the release of pending funds due as per the recommendations of the 14th and 15th Finance Commissions, the MP said.The chief minister also asked the TRS MPs to coordinate with like-minded political parties in their fight against common issues like sale of public sector undertakings (PSUs).

Therefore, it would not be possible to hold a separate discussion. In any case, the matter is under the court’s jurisdiction right now," Joshi said."Whatever was needed to be said on the issue, was already done by information and technology minister Ashwani Vaishnaw on the floor of the House during the Monsoon Session last year," he added.When asked about Opposition MPs seeking to move a breach of Privilege Motion against the IT Minister, Joshi said "They can go ahead. It is up to the Lok Sabha Speaker to admit it or not, but there seems to be no merit in this."The Pegasus snooping issue was reignited recently after a New York Times report said India bought the spyware as part of a $2 billion defence deal with Israel in 2017.Several opposition parties have accused the government of perjury on the issue and lying in Parliament and to the Supreme Court.MPs from the Congress and Left parties have issued a privilege motion against Vaishnaw for "deliberately misleading the House on the Pegasus issue".Speaking on the all-party meeting, Joshi said floor leaders of 25 parties attended the meeting. He said defence minister and deputy leader of the Lok Sabha Rajnath Singh, who represented the government at the meeting, sought cooperation from all parties for smooth functioning of the House during the Budget Session.The Budget session of Parliament began on Monday and is scheduled to conclude on April 8 with a recess in-between from February 12 to March 13.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-pralhad-joshi-says-no-scope-for-discussion-on-pegasus-row-101643638802990.html

31-01-2022||India||Private investment critical for agriculture, states Economic Survey||The Budget-eve Economic Survey tabled by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament on Monday has called for a “focused and targeted approach” towards capital investment in the agriculture sector to boost farm incomes, flagging swinging levels of private investment as a concern. “There is a direct correlation between capital investments in agriculture and its growth rate,” the survey states. According to the annual report card on the economy, the farm sector has witnessed “wide fluctuations in private investment in agriculture”, while public investment has remained stable between 2-3%. Private corporate investments need to be crowded in by offering an appropriate policy framework, the Survey said. In December 2021, the Union government in a rare climb-down struck down three farm-sector legislation after nearly 13 months of protests by tens of thousands farmers in key states, such as Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. The three laws were the cornerstone of the Modi government’s reforms in the farm sector, which employs nearly half the population. The scrapped laws designed to free up restrictions in farm trade and allow traders to stockpile large quantities of farm produce for future trade. They also sought to lay down a national framework for contract farming. Farmers are still demanding a legal guarantee for minimum support prices for a string of commodities. The agricultural sector has been least impacted by the pandemic and is expected to grow a robust 3.9% in 2021-22 after growing 3.6% in the previous year. Recognising that there exists a direct correlation between capital investments in agriculture and its growth rate, the Survey called for higher public and private investment in the farm sector. “Higher access to concessional institutional credit to farmers and greater participation of private corporate sector, whose investment rates are currently as low as 2 to 3 per cent in agriculture, may help in improving private investment in agriculture.” The share of the agriculture in total gross value added or GVA of the economy has for long been around 18%. The share of the agriculture and allied sector in total GVA, however, improved to 20.2% in the year 2020-21 and 18.8% in 2021-22. According to the fourth advance estimates for 2020-21, the country’s total food grain output is estimated to be a record 308.65 million tonnes, or 11.15 million tonnes higher than 2019-20. The production of rice, wheat and coarse cereals has increased at compound annual growth rates of 2.7%, 2.9% and 4.8% respectively during 2015-16 to 2020-21, or last six years. India has the fiscal legroom to boost spending to achieve record growth, likely wresting the title of the world’s fasted growing economy from China, the Budget-eve Economic Survey said. Overall, the economy will expand 8%-8.5% in the year starting April after likely growing 9.2% in the current fiscal year, the annual economic document said. The document, unveiled a day ahead of the presentation of the Union Budget, said the government had the fiscal legroom to boost investment and spending. Growth will be propelled by “widespread vaccine coverage, gains from supply-side reforms and easing of regulations, robust export growth, and availability of fiscal space to ramp up capital spending.”

Details here||Delhi's Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport on Monday implemented the ‘one hand-bag’ rule that would allow passengers on domestic flights to carry only one piece of baggage inside cabins. The rule, however, has a few exceptions as listed by the Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) in its advisory.Delhi airport officials said the order comes following an advisory from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and BCAS received earlier this month that called for permitting only one piece of hand baggage per passenger as 'cabin luggage'.Passengers with more bags will be stopped at the entry gate of the airport to avoid inconvenience during security check.The advisory comes in the backdrop of the CISF's request to BCAS to ensure that the one-bag rule is enforced by all stakeholders and airlines as passengers carrying two-three hand baggage create congestion at security check-points and increase security screening time that results in inconvenience to passengers.Exceptions to the rule:The 'one hand-bag' rule has been implemented with a few exclusions. These include – women’s handbags, overcoats or wraps, a rug or blanket, camera or pair of binoculars, reading material and laptop bag.Any gift items purchased from duty-free shops, an umbrella or a walking stick, an infant's feed for consumption during the flight and infant's carrying basket (if the infant is carried), collapsible wheelchair and/or pair of crutches or braces for passenger's use if dependent are also allowed in addition to the hand baggage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-airport-enforces-one-hand-bag-rule-on-domestic-flights-with-few-exceptions-details-here-101643630483642.html

Also, we are allowing direct flights from UK. Passengers coming from UK will have to undergo RT-PCR test on arrival,” said Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal. The Bengal government had earlier suspended direct flights from UK to Kolkata airport due to a rise in Omicron cases. Flights from Delhi and Mumbai were being allowed only on three days when the third wave of Covid-19 had hit. Banerjee also said that schools (classes VII–XII), colleges and universities will reopen from February 3. Community schools would be held for students of classes V to VII. All government and private offices, which were functioning with 50% workforce, will now work with 75% workforce. Restaurants, bars, cinema halls, theatres and swimming pools may also run with 75% capacity. Earlier they were running with 50% workforce and capacity. Entertainment parks, protected area such as wildlife sanctuaries, national parks and tiger reserves have also been allowed to reopen. The night curfew had been relaxed for one hour from 11 pm to 5 am instead of 10pm. Cultural and political programs may be organised in stadiums with 75% capacity. Political rallies on roads may be held with a maximum of 200 people. The daily count of Covid-19 cases had shot up to more than 24,000 in mid-January, but it has dropped over the past two weeks. On Sunday, 3,427 fresh cases were reported. At least 33 people died.

31-01-2022||India||Apple iOS 15.4’s rare approach: Arise, Face ID with mask and Universal Control||Your Apple iPhone will soon unlock even if you are wearing a mask. Soon, if you wish to wait for the final release of the iOS 15.4 software sometime in the next couple of weeks. But right now, if you feel brave enough to try the public beta version of iOS 15, which is now available. Yet, iOS 15.4 will be bringing a lot of new features and functionality, to the extent that you wouldn’t normally associate with periodical updates. This is what is on the menu. Universal control if you have an iPad, all third-party apps taking advantage of the 120Hz ProMotion display, custom email domains in iCloud, the Emoji 14 bundle, adding notes to iCloud Keychain passwords, updates to Shortcuts app automations, scan text in notes and reminders app, in addition to the Face ID upgrade that now works well with face masks. The way Face ID, the facial recognition feature in iPhones, works is that it uses the TrueDepth camera that’s looking at you to match your face against the face that you saved when setting up facial recognition on your new iPhone. It’ll deploy infrared project thousands of invisible dots on the face of the person trying to unlock the iPhone to analyze and match the facial features as well as depth. Till now, anything blocking the sight of your full face, would mean Face ID wouldn’t complete the authentication. The update with iOS 15.4 will be that if you are wearing a face mask, Face ID would understand that and instead of relying on mapping your entire face, it will instead rely on the new periocular method to focus on your eyes and the area around it. The only limitation here would be that this option is expected to work on the iPhone 12 series and newer iPhones – that is Apple A14 Bionic and newer processors. Incidentally, the iPad Pro will not get this versatility, just yet. Apple has always claimed that the error rate for Face ID accidentally unlocking the iPhone to an incorrect match is 1 in 1,000,000. We do not know yet if this will change once the Face ID with a mask feature is finally rolled out. That said, the feature itself is still in the testing stage (albeit close to the final stages) and there may be tweaks and improvements in the upcoming iOS 15.4 beta versions, before the final software is made available. Third party apps on your iPhone 13 Pro models will start to look a lot better if the support for 120Hz refresh rate is rolled out as expected. Tasks such as scrolling, viewing media and transitions will look a lot smoother. The Universal Control feature, which is part of the iPad OS 15.4 beta for the iPad family, will introduce the much-awaited multitasking upgrade. You’ll be able to keep your Mac (any Mac, be it a MacBook or iMac, as long as it is running macOS Monterey 12.3 beta) and an iPad next to each other and use the two as extensions of each other. The Mac keyboard and mouse, for instance, can control the interface of the iPad too. Moving apps will be simpler and faster, while file transfers will be instant. Universal Control has been delayed for a while now, and considering how this is a rather unique solution, it isn’t a surprise that Apple took its time in polishing the performance.

"Pegasus is being done from the Raj Bhavan," she said.According to a report, Banerjee said the governor, who has been the sharpest critic of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader, is "threatening the chief secretary and director-general of police”. "I have been forced to block governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Twitter. Everyday he was issuing tweets targeting and threatening government officials as if we're his bonded labourers," Banerjee said, while addressing a press conference in Kolkata.Soon after, the governor took to Twitter and said under article 159 of the Constitution, “Mandated… to ensure none in the state “blocks” Constitutional Norms and Rules of Law and those in authority bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India”.He further wrote that under Article 167, it is the constitutional “duty” of the chief minister to furnish such information relating to the administration of the affairs of the state and proposals for legislation as the governor may call for. “Why “block” information to Guv now for two years ?” he added.WB Guv : Under Article 167 it is Constitution “duty” of the Chief Minister to furnish such information relating to the administration of the affairs of the State and proposals for legislation as the Governor may call for. Why “block” information to Guv now for two years ? pic.twitter.com/aOlEN5YZGbThe chief minister said she had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi several times, seeking the removal of Dhankhar, however, "no action has been taken so far".Banerjee shares an acrimonious relationship with the governor. Both leaders have criticised each other over multiple platforms in the past.Earlier in the day, TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay said he had requested President Ram Nath Kovind to remove Jagdeep Dhankhar from the state. Bandyopadhyay said Vice President Venkaiah Naidu was also present when he made the appeal.On Sunday, in a fresh attack on Banerjee, Dhankhar said democracy survives on rule of law and not the rule of an 'individual' and that the Bengal CM was refusing to sit for talks with him. "Democracy survives on rule of law, not the rule of an individual. I hope she (West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee) looks into it. She is mandated by the Constitution to sit for a dialogue with the governor," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-blocks-bengal-guv-on-twitter-says-dhankhar-threatening-senior-officers-101643628117764.html
31-01-2022||India||No link between MNREGA demand and migrant labour: Economic Survey||There’s no clear relationship between movement of migrant labour and employment as well as demand for jobs under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural National Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA), the Budget-eve Economic Survey said. The pandemic-induced lockdowns and disruptions had pushed millions of migrant workers and day-wagers into a survival battle, as they fled urban economic hubs in large numbers back to home states. Bihar and Jharkhand account for the largest number of migrants. “Intuitively”, the survey stated, “one may expect that higher MGNREGS demand may be directly related to the movement of migrant labour i.e. source states would be more impacted.” However, the Survey said demand for employment at an aggregate level under MGNREGA still seemed to be above the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. For many migrant “source states” such as West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar, MGNREGA employment in most months of 2021 had been lower than the corresponding levels in 2020, the annual economic report card said. In contrast, the demand for MGNREGS employment has been higher for migrant recipient states like Punjab, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for most months in 2021 over 2020, the Survey states. “There are still other states that do not neatly fit into this categorization.” The Survey therefore concludes that the “relationship between MGNREGS employment and movement of migrant labour during the last two years cannot be conclusively determined”. It said further research was needed into this. On overall employment trends, the survey said while unemployment rose sharply during the lockdown imposed by the pandemic, the unemployment rate fell as the economy opened up. While the unemployment rate gradually dipped during this period to reach 9.3 per cent in Q4 of 2020-21, the unemployment rate for males as well as females, aged 15 & above, recovered to the pre-pandemic levels. Both the LFPR and WPR for males as well as females, aged 15 & above, reached almost their pre-pandemic levels during the last quarter of 2020-21, said the Economic Survey. The urban unemployment rate rose to 20.8% in India in the first quarter of 2020-21, the Survey said. However, as Covid-related restrictions eased and economic sectors opened up, all three labour market indicators -- labour force participation rate (LFPR), worker population ratio (WPR) and unemployment rates (UR) -- showed a “swift recovery”. The Survey said allocation to MGNREGS in FY 2021-22 rose to ₹73,000 crore from ₹61,500 crore in FY 2020-21. Allocation for FY 2021-22 has been enhanced to ₹98000 crore so far. In FY 2021-22 over 8.70 crore individuals and 6.10 crore households were provided work so far. “The problem still is on a net basis, job creation has lagged and a comparison with pre-pandemic levels don’t help because employment has been a big problem since 2016 onwards, when growth began tapering off,” Devi Prasad, a former labour economist with Gokhale Institute of Economics.

The commission allowed physical public meetings in designated open spaces with a maximum of 1,000 people or 50% of the capacity of the venue or the prescribed limit permitted locally, whichever is lowest, from February 1.The number of people allowed to go for door-to-door campaigns has also been increased. “Instead of 10 persons, now 20 persons, excluding security personnel, will be allowed for door-to-door campaigns,” the ECI said in a statement. For indoor meetings, the ECI has allowed a maximum of 500 people, instead of the existing 300, or 50% of the capacity of a hall or the prescribed limit set by local authorities.“All the state chief secretaries informed the commission about reports of Covid-19 infections either plateauing out or tapering as on date. They also said that the positivity rate is showing a decline with the number of hospitalisation cases also registering a declining trend. The State officers however said that Covid protocol precautions need to be continued to be observed so that no undue spurt takes place due to intense public contact because of heightened political activity,” the statement said.The ECI, which earlier banned all election gatherings until January 15 to check the Covid-19 spread, asked political parties to ensure the compliance of the Covid appropriate behaviour, guidelines, and Model Code of Conduct.Elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa, and Manipur are being held from February 10 and the results will be declared on March 10.Other containment measures include curbs on the number of vehicles accompanying a candidate for the submission of nominations. The vehicles have been restricted to two. The ECI said chambers of returning officers should have sufficient space for nominations, scrutiny, and symbol allocation while following social distancing norms. It has allowed 1,250 voters in each polling station instead of the usual 1,500. The number was capped at 1,000 for the previous rounds of state elections. There will also be mandatory sanitisation of polling stations and thermal checking of voters.The ECI is also running a pilot project to live track the overcrowding of voters at poll booths to ensure safety norms are followed. Covid patients and those under quarantined will be allowed to vote in the last hour of polling under the supervision of health authorities. The ECI has written to chief secretaries of poll-bound states to expedite vaccination, increase the number of polling stations, and for reducing the number of people at polling booths. It faced criticism during the eight-phase West Bengal elections last year for prolonged polls and ignoring demands to club the last three phases in view of the rise in Covid-19 cases. A police complaint was filed against the election watchdog for culpable homicide by the widow of a Trinamool Congress candidate who died of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-shadow-on-polls-ec-extends-ban-on-roadshows-till-february-11-101643628629436.html
31-01-2022||India||Centre suspends transmission of Malayalam news channel MediaOne||The Information and Broadcasting Ministry on Monday suspended the transmission of Malayalam news channel ‘MediaOne’ citing “security reasons”. The channel, controlled by the Jamat-e-Islami, went off air on Monday noon. Its editor Pramod Raman came on air in the afternoon announcing the decision of the ministry and said a legal team had been asked to collect more details. “The ministry says the ban was due to security reasons. We are yet to get details. We hope justice will prevail and we will be able to start our transmission soon,” he said. Many journalists’ organisations and the opposition Congress slammed the move. “It is an undemocratic move. The channel was also not given reasons for suspending transmission. This is a violation of natural justice. All democratic forces should condemn it,” said opposition leader V D Satheesan. This is the second time MediaOne has been barred. In March 2020, the Centre imposed a ban on the channel for 48 hours on charges of violating Cable Television Networks Act 1998, while reporting on riots in north-east Delhi. But people who are aware of the latest development said security clearance was denied after the channel failed to renew its licence granted 10 years ago. According to the I&B norms, uplinking and downlinking need to get security clearance from the Home Ministry, the official said. The I&B Ministry is yet to release a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-suspends-transmission-of-malayalam-news-channel-mediaone-101643627788762.html
31-01-2022||India||Swabhiman Anchal: A Maoist bastion in Odisha reclaimed through development||MALKANGIRI: Huddled outside her asbestos-roofed house along with a few other women in Sindhiput village of Jodambo grampanchayat deep inside the Swabhiman Anchal of Malkangiri district, Jasoda Alang, a 38-year-old OBC woman, is excited over the panchayat polls scheduled on February 24, a first, where they will use their constitutional right freely.The village became famous in February 2011 when Maoists abducted erstwhile Malkangiri district collector R Vineel Krishna and a junior engineer, and kept them hostage for 8 days. The two were released after Odisha government ensured release of Ganti Prasadam, wife of CPI (Maoist) central committee member Ramakrishna. A year later, Maoists triggered an IED blast that killed commandant of BSF and three other jawans of the central paramilitary force ahead of 2012 panchayat polls.Now, Alang, like several other villagers in the heart of Maoist bastion of Swabhiman Anchal, then known as cut-off area, is getting ready for panchayat polls. “The Maoists ruled our area for 40 years and once they gave a call for boycott, there was no other choice. But this time we would go out and vote in groups as per our choice,” said Alang. The 172 villages of Swabhiman Anchal in an area of 372 sq km is separated from the mainland Odisha by the Balimela reservoir built in the early 60s and had fallen off the development map for four decades. However, it changed when the Odisha government built a 910 metre long bridge over river Gurupriya, one of the rivulets that feed into mammoth Balimela reservoir, connecting mainland Malkangiri with the isolated villages in July 2018. And, because of that bridge, Sindhiput now has 30 km road, untarred at some places, and is two hours away from Gurupriya, which earlier was a half a day journey. Construction of road to this village is important as it lies in Jodambo grampanchayat considered to be the headquarter of Maoists of Andhra-Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee.“If things go as per plan, in another two-and-a-half years, all the 172 villages in the region would be connected with all-weather roads making Swabhiman Anchal probably the first Maoist fortress in India to come under complete control of any government,” said a senior state government official. Swabhiman Anchal: A Maoist heartland The cut-off Swabhiman Anchal, having a population of 31,000 people, became a Maoist citadel after the Naxal movement started in Andhra Pradesh in 1967 in the densely forested Andhra-Odisha border region. As an earth-cum-rock dam was built at Chitrakonda area of Malkangiri between 1962 and 1977 to generate 510 megawatt of hydroelectricity from the water released by Machhkund Power House in Koraput district, the reservoir and its backwaters created a 65 km long water channel submerging hills, forests and hundreds of villages. More than 170 villages that did not drown, were physically separated and came to be known as cut-off area and then Swabhiman Anchal in 2018. As the Swabhiman Anchal was geographically nearer to Andhra Pradesh, Maoists made the area their base, making it impregnable for government officials. Malkangiri became a major theatre of violence after 2008 when police of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh launched operations against them. Between 2008 and 2021, the district recorded 342 Maoist incidences with 101 civilian and 77 security personnel getting killed in the spiral of violence. The Maoists suffered casualties too after the Greyhound police in October 2016 killed 30 Maoists including several top commanders at Ramaguda village of Swabhiman Anchal. The long spiral of violence severely hampered the development of the region so much that NITI Aayog’s National Multidimensional Poverty Index report released last year, said at least 58.71 % of the district’s 6 lakh population lived below poverty line. In Swabhiman Anchal region, it was worse as no government official barring a few health workers could enter the area fearing Maoist reprisal. There were no functional schools while a skeletal health system existed. No institutional deliveries took place. The literacy rate stood at 10%. As there were no all-weather roads, villages were linked by mud roads, which become difficult to reach during rainy season.Though a motor launch service exists to ferry people from eastern bank of the reservoir to the western side, the boats took anything between 3-6 hours and operated at the mercy of the rebels. Officially isolated and forced to remain remote, these villages did not come under administrative lens till the bridge over river Gurupriya was constructed in July 2018. “Owing to its physical isolation and strategic location at the tri-junction of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Swabhiman Anchal with its hilly terrain, numerous creeks and forests was the swathe tailor-made for rebels and melt away to obscurity. No wonder the entire top brass of AOBSZC including Ramakrishna, late member of CPI(Maoist) central committee made the area their base for a long time. For all purposes, it was a liberated zone long before Bastar in Chhatisgarh became one,” said Deepak Kumar Nayak, a research associate of Delhi-based think-tank, Institute for Conflict Management. Reclaiming the red bastionIn 1986, the government started working on a 910 metre long bridge over river Gurupriya, which was finally built at a cost of over ₹187 crore, from initial estimate of ₹8 crore. Since 1986, the government floated tenders for the bridge 11 times, but Maoists managed to scare the contractors away. While construction of the 910 metre long bridge was a major achievement in reclaiming the Maoist bastion, the real challenge before the state government was how to make roads to the last village at the end of Swabhiman Anchal, a good 50 km away from the bridge, as well as provide mobile connectivity. In September 2020, Airtel started mobile telecom services in four villages. “In Swabhiman Anchal, two biggest problems were the threat of Maoist violence and the terrain. There were only hillocks and creeks and we had to build roads through them. Without roads, there was no way we could develop the area,” said Malkangiri district collector Vishal Singh. To keep the Maoists at bay, security personnel were deployed in several camps deep inside the region to provide protection for road construction.The Gurupriya bridge built in July 2018 was the first step to reclaim the lost space but officials also wanted to come up with short routes to build the road from one village to another through numerous hillocks. A junior engineer then hit upon the idea of making the cattle walk on the hillocks. “The cattle while grazing always take the easy path. So we mounted on horses and followed the herd of cattle grazing on the hill slopes while local people who we had won over flanked us on both sides,” said Prashant Behera, a junior engineer who knows the region like the back of his hand.However, the biggest obstacle was building a road through the hillocks in Hantalguda area, another Maoist fortress. The Maoists engineered a protest of over 2000 villagers and gheraoed the men constructing the road believing that roads would lead the police to cannabis plantations, their major sources of livelihood. As the standoff continued, one night, BSF men armed with the IWI X95 assault rifles that can fire over 750 round a minute, were airdropped in Hantalguda and a temporary camp was established with lightning speed. Before the protests could escalate, the BSF jawans started air domination exercise instilling a sense of security among the road contractors. “The deployment of BSF jawans was crucial for the roads as they sanitised the area with clinical efficiency,” said Rajesh Pandit, deputy inspector general of police (south western range).The relative safety has ensured that the state government could build 188.85 km road of a targeted 391.32 km in Swabhiman Anchal in around three years despite Covid pandemic and the tricky terrain. In Hantalguda, Sabai Khara, a 50-year-old Paraja tribal woman said she could never think that an ambulance could reach her village. “Many people used to die of malaria earlier and in case of any accident, there was no way we could take the victim to the hospital in Chitrakonda. Now I can easily go to Chitrakonda on an autorickshaw or riding pillion on motorcycle,” said Khara. Former Malkangiri district collector Manish Agrawal, who oversaw construction of the roads till November 2020, said the administration had to keep on building roads in the face of obstacles and provide all government facilities in the areas where roads have been built. “We wanted to make the people believe that the government would not fail them,” said Agrawal. The state government through Socio-economic Transformation and Upliftment(SETU) scheme for the villages of Swabhiman Anchal provided electricity, drinking water and schools. So far, ₹160 crore has been sanctioned under SETU programme and more funds are likely to be sanctioned. A mega water supply scheme is on anvil through which water from Balimela reservoir would be drawn, filtered and supplied to homes through pipes. The biggest turning point in the government’s effort to reclaim the red bastion came on January 25, 2020 when people of Tikarpada, Janturai and Jodambo villages took on the Maoists who wanted that the road construction be stopped. The rebels sent two of their cadres asking villagers to stop the road construction when they came face-to-face with hundreds of angry women. One Maoist was killed while another received serious injuries. A few hours later, over 200 Maoists came and attacked the villagers, but the villagers rained down arrows on them. While retreating, the Maoists burnt down some houses in Jodambo village including that of Mukta Hantala’s properties. “They burnt down an almirah, one of the wooden doors, paddy stocks and several important documents including my NFSA card. But next time any Maoist comes to our village, he would not go back alive,” said a local villager, Hantal. For this, the officials also made a small concession to the people who planted cannabis on the hill slopes by not booking them in NDPS cases. For over a decade, Malkangiri and Koraput districts have become major nurseries of cannabis that find their way to rest of the country through a network of agents. “There was no other livelihood option available to them and immediately booking them in NDPS cases would have turned them towards the rebels. But if our forces seized any cannabis from a vehicle passing through the area, we did not give any leeway,” said a police official. To bring back governance on the rails in the region, the district administration started conducting review meeting of all departments on first Monday of every month. “All the 18 line department officers now visit the Swabhiman Anchal every week for which a data sheet has been developed to track and monitor the visit of officials. Presence of teachers, health workers and doctors are being monitored every month in the review meeting,” said Malkangiri district collector Vishal Singh. While development goes on, there has been a steady erosion in the Maoist base with surrender of Maoist commanders and militias as well as record seizure of explosives in the area since 2018. According to officials, in 2020, the BSF seized huge ammunition left over by fleeing Maoists. At least 5 Maoist cadres including a woman divisional committee member have been killed in the last 3 years bringing down the Maoist morale. The panchayat polls in February would be the first time when ballot boxes and polling officials would travel by vehicles and not transported through choppers. Officials in Malkangiri said, of the 9 grampanchayats in Swabhiman Anchal, the government has managed to reach 8, barring Jantri grampanchayat, located 50 km north of Gurupriya bridge.Nayak of Institute for Conflict Management said the development measures in the erstwhile Maoist bastion coupled with a weakening Maoist leadership has brought Swabhiman Anchal back from the brink. “Quick development is key to win back the trust of people. In that respect, Swabhiman Anchal may serve as a model for the rest of the country on how to develop a Maoist citadel. For the time being, it looks difficult for Maoists in the region to challenge the might of the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swabhiman-anchal-a-story-of-reclaiming-maoist-bastion-through-development-101643626891114.html

31-01-2022||India||CBI seeks sanction to investigate union agriculture and power secretaries||NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has sought sanction to investigate senior IAS officers including Union agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal, power secretary Alok Kumar and Aparna U, currently posted as mission director, National Health Mission in Uttar Pradesh, in connection with its probe into alleged irregularities in the investment of Employees’ Provident Fund of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) in the scam-hit Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL), people familiar with the development said. The CBI’s request to investigate the three IAS officers has nothing to do with their current tenures. The people cited above said the sanction against Agarwal, who was at the forefront of the government’s move to implement three farm laws (now repealed), Kumar and Aparna was sought in December 2021 from the UP government as the case pertains to alleged irregularities in the state. Section 17A was brought in by the government through an amendment in July 2018 to bring additional layer of due diligence after several bureaucrats complained that they were not able to take bona fide decisions due to the fear of probe agencies. It makes it mandatory for a police officer to seek previous approval for conducting any “enquiry” or “inquiry” or “investigation” into any corruption-related offence. One of the officers cited above said the CBI approached the UP government in December 2021 seeking permission to investigate Agarwal, Kumar and Aparna apart from a few other state government officials. Last year, the Centre formed the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for seeking prior permission to investigate public servants under 17A, saying that the anti-graft probe officers must first verify whether a prima facie (at first sight) offence is made out against a public servant and only then make a request for a formal probe. Between 2017 and 2019, Uttar Pradesh Power Sector Employees Trust, formed in 2006 to handle the state-run power company’s provident fund contributions, invested ₹4,122.5 crore in multiple short-term fixed deposits of the scam-hit Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL), run by jailed brothers – Dheeraj and Kapil Wadhawan. Of this amount, only ₹1,854.3 crore could be recovered from the company. The Yogi Adityananth- government handed over the probe to the CBI in November 2019. The central agency filed a First Information Report (FIR) in the matter in June 2020. Sanjay Agarwal, a 1984-batch IAS officer, was the chairman of UPPCL as well as the Uttar Pradesh Power Sector Employees Trust between 2013 and May 2017. He is learnt to have signed on the decision to invest the PF money of the trust in the debt-ridden DHFL. Kumar, a 1988-batch IAS officer of Uttar Pradesh cadre, was Chairman of UPPCL from May 2017 till 2019. Aparna was managing director in the department during this period. It is alleged that the officials of UPPCL conspired to get the provident funds deposited in the schemes of DHFL circumventing the rules which did not encourage such investments. DHFL is already facing multiple probes by various agencies including the CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED) for siphoning off billions of public funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-seeks-sanction-to-investigate-union-agriculture-and-power-secretaries-101643621126808.html

31-01-2022||India||‘Bigger than Watergate scandal’: Shiv Sena on Pegasus spying row||MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Monday remarked that the alleged snooping using the controversial Pegasus spyware was bigger than the Watergate scandal that had rocked the US in the 1970s. Shiv Sena mouthpiece, Saamana, said that the Modi government allegedly lied in Parliament about purchasing the Pegasus spyware from Israel, which was reported by The New York Times last week. Referring to the Watergate scandal in the US involving President Richard Nixon, the editorial said that the American president eventually had to resign following the spying disclosures.The Israeli spyware Pegasus and a missile system were the “centrepieces” of a roughly $2 billion deal of sophisticated weapons and intelligence gear between India and Israel in 2017, according to the report in The New York Times.A massive controversy erupted last year when the Israel-based NSO Group hit the headlines with the alleged use of its Pegasus software by some governments to spy on journalists, human rights defenders, politicians, and others in many countries, including India, triggering concerns over issues relating to privacy.“The New York Times exposed the lies of Modi government. It revealed that in 2017, the Modi government bought Pegasus from Israel for ₹15,000- 20,000 crore. This is taxpayers’ money,” the Saamana editorial said. It said that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had to apologise to the nation for a small mistake and go through a police investigation. It also added, “President [Richard] Nixon had to resign due to the Watergate scandal. The truth will prevail.”The state BJP leaders said that as a policy, the state unit does not respond to criticism in Saamana.In an attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Sena mouthpiece complained that on his whim, the Amar Jawan Jyoti was snuffed out, the historic Parliament building is being shut for a new complex, public-sector undertakings are being divested, and airports are being sold. “Now because he is scared, people are being spied on by using taxpayers’ money. This is destruction of democracy,” the editorial remarked.Targeting the government’ denial to have a joint parliamentary committee probe, the editorial added that had there been a JPC probe into the matter last year, it would have been a bigger expose than The New York Times story. It added that many countries use Pegasus spyware, but those nations do not have democracy. “Has democracy, Parliament, and Supreme Court been set aside in India? Modi govt should declare it because Modi has lied in Parliament and the Supreme Court about Pegasus”.

Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) member Muthuvel filmed the video on January 17 while the girl was battling for her life at a hospital. Muthuvel’s mobile phone has been sent to a forensic lab in Chennai for examination on the court’s directions.The BJP sought a CBI probe into the matter and last week, the party’s chief, J P Nadda, constituted a committee to look into the suicide.The Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary Congregation, which runs the 160-year-old school in Thanjavur, has denied the charge of conversion saying they provide secular education for all as per the Indian Constitution.BJP leaders welcomed the high court’s order. “The fight shall continue till justice is delivered,” tweeted BJP leader B L Santosh. On Sunday, BJP state chief K Annamalai, who led a delegation that visited the girl’s family, called Tamil Nadu’s intelligence department incompetent and questioned whether it gave “a true briefing to the chief minister” about the case.A National Commission for Protection of Child Rights team is also in Thanjavur in connection with the case.A judicial magistrate recorded the girl’s statement three days before she died on January 19. In the statement, a copy of which HT has seen, the girl blamed her 74-year-old hostel warden for torturing her, hitting her, and scolding her to do work and audit hostel accounts.Thanjavur district’s education officer looked into the matter and noted in a report that no complaint of any religious conversion was made against the girl’s school for a decade. The report said more Hindu students studied at the school than Christians and Muslims.TV channels last week released a longer version of the video clip Muthuvel purportedly recorded showing the girl only blaming the warden. She is heard saying she could not focus on her studies. Amid reports that a distress call was made to Childline two years ago as the girl’s stepmother allegedly harassed her, police were also probing her situation at home too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-girl-s-death-by-suicide-hc-transfers-case-to-cbi-101643618906880.html
31-01-2022||India||Budget Session: President Kovind hails schemes, fight against pandemic||NEW DELHI: President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday listed the government’s achievements amid the Covid-19 crisis, especially steps to fight the pandemic and to aid farmers and women, and called for more hard work to build a modern India by the centenary of independence in 2047. In his address to a joint session of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha at the start of Parliament’s Budget Session, Kovind began by paying tribute to the nation’s freedom fighters on the 75th anniversary of India’s independence and said the government is laying the foundation for the next 25 years with the mantra of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Aur Sabka Prayas” to make the country more self-reliant. “Today, the country’s achievements and successes are as limitless as the country’s potential and possibilities. These achievements are not of one institution or establishment, these are the collective achievements of more than a billion citizens of our country. These are the fruits of the labour and sweat of billion-plus people,” he said, speaking in Hindi. “These achievements are milestones in the long journey to achieve our ambitious goals, and are our motivations to move forward. In 2047, the country will celebrate its centenary of independence. We have to work hard for building a grand, modern and developed India of that era...We all have a stake, and an equal stake in this journey,” he said. The president’s speech at the start of the Budget Session usually highlights the government’s achievements over the past year and outlines targets and plans for the future. Noting that this is the third successive year that India and the world have been affected by Covid-19, Kovind lauded the Central and state governments, frontline workers, nurses, doctors, scientists and entrepreneurs for working as a team to help the country cope with the pandemic. The government’s commitment to fighting the Coronavirus is reflected in the country’s massive vaccination programme, whereby 150 crore doses of vaccines had been administered in less than a year, he said. India is now among the countries with the most vaccine doses administered and this has increased morale and protection among citizens, he added. Some 90% of adult citizens had been given one dose of vaccine, and 70% of the eligible had received both doses. Teenagers aged 15-18 years have been included in the vaccination programme and frontline workers and senior citizens with co-morbidities are being given a “precautionary” dose, the president said. Eight Covid-19 vaccines had been authorised for emergency use by the government, and three “made in India” jabs had been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), helping India to play a role around the world in overcoming the pandemic, Kovind said. He added while the government has taken on the immediate challenges in the fight against Covid-19, it is also developing solutions for the future, such as the Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission with an outlay of ₹64,000 crore that will prepare India for future crises. He said more than 80,000 health and wellness centres and hundreds of thousands of Ayushman Bharat cards have helped the medical treatment of the poor, and affordable medicines are being supplied through more than 8,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras. Products of Indian pharmaceutical firms are reaching more than 180 countries and the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for this sector will expand opportunities and boost research, Kovind said. He said while several countries witnessed a scarcity of food grains during the worst pandemic in 100 years, the Indian government provided free rations to poor households every month under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, the world’s largest food distribution programme with an outlay of ₹2,60,000 crore, reaching 80 crore beneficiaries for 19 months. This scheme has now been extended till March 2022. He said the government also operates the PM-Sva-Nidhi scheme for protecting the livelihood of the poor amid the pandemic and has provided more than ₹2,900 crore to 28 lakh street vendors under this programme. Kovind noted that farmers produced more than 30 crore tonnes of food grains and 33 crore tonnes of horticulture produce during 2020-21, despite the pandemic, and said the government is working to “empower the farmers and the rural economy”. The government made “record procurement to match the record production”, and procured 4,330,000 metric tonnes of wheat during the Rabi season, benefiting about five million farmers, he added. “Our agriculture exports have reached a record level due to the efforts of the government. Agricultural exports registered a growth of more than 25% in 2020-21, and reached nearly ₹3 lakh crore,” Kovind said. “In order to ensure remunerative prices to farmers for their crops, it is necessary that their products reach the right market. In this direction, the government has endeavoured to open new avenues of prosperity for the farmers by launching Kisan Rail Seva,” he said. The Indian Railways operated more 1,900 Kisan Rail trains on more than 150 routes to transport about 600,000 tonnes of perishable agricultural produce amid the pandemic, he added. The interests of small farmers, who make up 80% of the farming community, are “central to our government”, and ₹1,80,000 crore has been provided to more than 11 crore farmer families under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi, Kovind said. Small farmers have benefited from changes in the crop insurance scheme, and more than ₹1,00,000 crore has been given as compensation to about eight crore farmers, he added. Kovind noted the role played by women in giving an impetus to the rural economy, and said banks had given ₹65,000 crore to more than 2.8 million women’s self-help groups during 2021-22, a four-fold increase from the amount extended during 2014-15. The government has trained thousands of members of self-help groups and made them partners for delivering banking services to rural homes, he added. “Women’s empowerment is one of the top priorities of my government...Entrepreneurship and skills of the mothers and sisters of our country have been promoted through the ‘Mudra’ scheme. The ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ initiative has yielded many positive results, and there has been an encouraging improvement in the number of girls enrolled in schools,” he said, adding that the government has introduced a bill to increase the minimum age of marriage for women from 18 to 21.“The government has made a beginning to liberate the society from the manifestly arbitrary practice of triple talaq by making it a criminal offence. Restrictions on Muslim women from performing the Haj only with Mehram have been removed. While about three crore students from minority communities were provided scholarships prior to 2014, my government has provided scholarships to 4.5 crore to such students since 2014. This has led to a significant reduction in the school dropout rate of Muslim girls and an increase in their enrolment,” he said. Kovind quoted BR Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution: “My ideal would be a society based on liberty, equality, and fraternity...Democracy is not merely a form of government…It is essentially an attitude of respect and reverence towards one’s fellow men”. He added the government considers these ideals as its motto. “My government believes in the mantra of Antyodaya, which encompasses social justice, equality, respect and equal opportunities. Therefore, in the policies of the government, top priority is being given to villages, the poor, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and backward communities,” he said. He quoted saint Thiruvalluvar: “Karkka kasaddar karpawai katrapin, Nirkka adarkka taga (What a person has learnt is reflected in his conduct)”. Kovind said the government is implementing a new national education policy to “give shape to the resolve and potential of Aatmanirbhar Bharat”. Kovind said local languages ​​are being promoted through this policy and emphasis is being laid on conducting important entrance examinations for undergraduate courses in Indian languages. This year, 19 engineering colleges in 10 states will start teaching in six Indian languages, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-session-president-kovind-hails-schemes-fight-against-pandemic-101643613746894.html

Taking to Twitter, Tharoor said that ‘O Mitron’ is far more dangerous than Omicron, with “no milder variant of this virus”.The Lok Sabha member said that ‘O Mitron’ has resulted in increased polarisation, promotion of hatred and assault on the Indian constitution.“Far more dangerous than #Omicron is “O Mitron”!” tweeted Tharoor. “We are measuring the consequences of the latter every day in increased polarisation, promotion of hatred & bigotry, insidious assaults on the Constitution & the weakening of our democracy. There is no “milder variant” of this virus.”The Congress party has been on the offensive over the Pegasus issue, accusing the central government of snooping on citizens using military-grade spyware. The Pegasus row, which is being monitored by a Supreme Court-appointed panel, has gained momentum after a New York Times report claimed that the Indian and Israeli governments “had agreed on the sale of a package of sophisticated weapons and intelligence gear worth roughly $2 billion — with Pegasus and a missile system as the centerpieces”.Tharoor's tweet came when President Ram Nath Kovind was listing the achievements of the central government during the joint sitting of parliament. The President said that the government considers the ideals of Dr BR Ambedkar as its guiding principle, adding that “democracy is not just a form of the government, democracy's base is a sense of respect for people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-dangerous-than-omicron-tharoor-s-o-mitron-wordplay-with-virus-variant-101643609103043.html
31-01-2022||India||Pegasus row: CPI lawmaker files privilege motion against Ashwini Vaishnaw||NEW DELHI: Communist Party of India (CPI) Member of Parliament Binoy Viswam has filed a privilege motion against Union information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw for allegedly misleading the House with his statements over the alleged use of Pegasus in light of a New York Times report saying India purchased the Israeli-origin spyware in 2017.This comes as Congress’s Lok Sabha floor leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Sunday seeking a privilege motion against Vaishnaw for “deliberately misleading the House on the Pegasus issue”. The Opposition has attacked the government over the alleged spyware use following the New York Times report.In his notice, Viswam said despite the government’s “repeated attempts at hiding the truth, numerous pieces of evidence have been made public” regarding its purchase of the spyware. “The New York Times report is the latest on the list. As a matter concerning grave allegations of snooping that violate Constitutional rights and safeguards, the Minister’s deliberate attempt to mislead the Members of Parliament constitutes a breach of privilege,” Viswam said in the notice, a copy of which HT has seen.A privilege motion is initiated after the Speaker or the Chairman gives approval for it in their respective Houses. Over the past few years, many demands for privilege motions have been rejected.During Parliament’s Monsoon Session last year, Vaishnaw made a suo motu statement in both Houses and said there was “no substance” to previous media reports regarding the use of Pegasus. He also assured Parliament that illegal spying is impossible in the country. Vaishnaw said the reports were nothing but an “attempt to malign Indian democracy and its well-established institutions”. Union home minister Amit Shah slammed those “amplifying” the reports about Pegasus for “humiliating India”.Vaishnaw said a “highly sensational story” made several “over the top allegations” but there is “no substance behind them”. His statement came minutes before he was named as one of those who were targeted, according to an investigation by a consortium of media houses. The phone-hacking software Pegasus was allegedly used to target potentially thousands of people around the world.HT reached out to Vaishnaw’s office for comments on Viswam’s notice but did not receive a response immediately.The Congress on Saturday cited the New York Times report and hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party government saying it has “hijacked democracy” and misled the Supreme Court. It urged the court to take suo motu cognisance of the matter and initiate appropriate penal proceedings against the government for attempting to “deliberately and knowingly deceive” it.The New York Times reported Pegasus and a missile system were the “centerpieces” of a roughly $2 billion deal for sophisticated weapons and intelligence gear.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has accused the government of treason by allegedly “tapping” phones of Opposition leaders, people belonging to the armed forces, and the judiciary using Pegasus.“The Modi Government bought Pegasus to spy on our primary democratic institutions, politicians and public. Government functionaries, opposition leaders, armed forces, judiciary all were targeted by these phone tappings. This is treason,” Gandhi said on Twitter. The New York Times report came ahead of Parliament’s Budget Session, which began on Monday.The first half of the session from January 31 to February 11 includes the President’s speech, the presentation of the Budget, and a debate on both. The Finance Bill, the Appropriation Bills, and demand for grants for various ministries will be cleared in the second half expected from March 14 to April 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpimpfiles-privilege-motion-against-vaishnaw-for-misleading-house-over-pegasus-use-101643613026876.html

31-01-2022||India||India State of Forest Report 2021: FSI DG answers some key questions||NEW DELHI: Forests “outside recorded forest area” that account for 28% of India’s forest cover are mostly plantations of horticulture, pulpwood species as well as rural and urban greens, Anoop Singh, director general of Forest Survey of India (FSI), has said in a frequently-asked-questions (FAQs) note drafted by him to address various concerns raised on the India State of Forest Report 2021. He has also explained that most of the increase in forest cover of 0.22% between 2019 to 2021 has been outside recorded forests which is mainly plantations and orchards. The FSI is planning to assess forest cover based on higher resolution data for better specificity but availability of cloud free satellite imagery, trained manpower and technology remain concerns. Q. Why can’t we count plantations and forests separately? A. In Chapter 2 (Table 2.6) the forest cover figures are divided as ‘Inside Recorded Forest Area’ and ‘Outside Recorded Forest Area’. Those inside RFA are basically natural forests and plantations. Forest cover outside RFA are mango orchards, coconut plantations, block plantations of agroforestry and are automatically separated out and are clearly given. In ISFR 2021, it can be seen that 72 % of forest cover figures given in the report pertain to recorded forest area and only 28 % of forest cover is outside the forest area. Actually, most of the critics have not seen this Table and have commented based on their pre-conceived notion. The areas of the tea, coffee etc. are available with the respective Boards and Horticulture Department or from Revenue records, where these details are recorded. Now, coming to assessment inside the Recorded Forest area. We need to understand that the assessment of forest cover is done on the basis of interpretation of satellite data, which basically identifies the umbrella shaped canopies from the sky. Species identification at a pan-India level, on an imagery with spatial resolution of 23.5 m is always a challenge. Q. Does that mean the extent of forest cover outside recorded forest area is mostly plantations? Do we have any estimate of how much of our old growth forest cover is intact? A. Yes, it is true that the extent of forest cover outside RFA is mostly plantations of horticulture, pulpwood species as well as rural and urban greens. It is not possible to differentiate the old growth from the new growth from the satellite imagery. If you are wanting to know about the original forest, which has been totally untouched it may be very difficult. Since forests in the entire country were managed under Management Plans, called Working Plans, we need to see the Working Plan of each Division for the past 100 years to determine the untouched areas and then map them. Probably the forests under the ‘Conservation Working Circle’ maybe the ones left untouched. This exercise, if done, will be very time-intensive exercise and tough. Q. What are the trends in India’s forest over the last decade or before? A. After switching over fully to digital interpretation of satellite imagery, with Minimum Mappable Unit of 1 ha from earlier 25 ha, small patches like block plantations outside Recorded Forest Area also got included gradually resulting in steady increase in forest cover. Satellite imagery of LISS-3 sensor of 23.5m spatial resolution has been used. Q. What are the areas of concern as evident from the findings of the ISFR 2021? A. The first concern is marginal change inside the recorded forest area. This needs to be analysed and compared with areas planted under various schemes of the Central and State Governments and re-strategise. Are we reaching saturation inside Recorded Forest Area or are we losing areas or are the plantations less successful? I do not need to raise any alarm, but serious thought and analysis is required. Second concern is the increase in forest fires over the years. If we analyse the last three fire seasons, then from November 2020 – June 2021, number of fires incidents were 3,45,989, as compared to 1,24,473 in 2019-20 and 2,10,286 in 2018-19. While FSI is giving weekly pre-fire alerts based on weather conditions, fuel load and a host of other factors, as well sending actual fire alerts after the fire has started by SMS and e-mail to the entire chain of command in the forest department; more strategies need to be devised for quick reaction to the fire alerts. Third concern would be the decreasing trend in the forest cover in the North Eastern states – even if the decrease is a very small fraction of the total forest cover. Studies need to be conducted on the cause of this steady reduction and suitable course correction in policy is desirable. Q. How did the FSI begin forest cover mapping? A. This organisation was started as Pre-Investment Survey of Forest Resources (PISFR) in 1965 as a Food and Agriculture Organisation- United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) project with twin objectives to investigate availability of raw material in unexplored forest areas of the country to establish wood-based industries and also to create centre for national forest survey for providing continuous and reliable information about forest resource. The project ended in 1968 but survey and mapping continued with modern methods including aerial photographs. FSI came into being in 1981 and visual mapping using aerial photos and forest inventory was continued. In 1986, a mandate of biennial assessment was added to FSI for giving the State of Forest Report by monitoring the forest resources; first report was published in 1987. The 2021 report is the 17th version of the report. Q. What are the most important findings of the ISFR 2021? A. • Total Forest and Tree cover - 8,09,537 sq km (24.62% of the geographical area of the country), which includes 21.71% of forest cover and 2.91% of tree cover. • Increase of 1,540 sq km (0.22%) of forest cover, 721 sq km (0.76%) of tree cover • In 1540 sq km increase, 1509 sq km outside Recorded Forest Area and 31 sq km inside recorded forest area • Top five states showing increase in forest cover are Andhra Pradesh (647 sq km), Telangana (632 sq km), Odisha (537 sq km), Karnataka (155 sq km) and Jharkhand (110 sq km). • Total carbon stock in forest is 7,204 million tonnes, an increase of 79.4 million tonnes in 2 years. • 72 % of forest cover is inside recorded forest area and 28 % of forest cover outside the recorded forest area Q. There is widespread criticism about the methodology of mapping forest cover by the FSI, which also counts orchards, plantations and city trees to be forests. How will you address these concerns? A. For rapid assessment of forest resources at country level biennially, the only method available is use of remote sensing technology. Currently FSI is carrying out interpretation of satellite data at 23.5 m resolution with a Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of 1 ha at a scale of 1:50,000. After data browsing, procurement and analysis, ground truthing of the change polygons is done and states are involved in this. The entire cycle takes two years. We are in the process of experimenting with data of higher resolution, however there may be many problems like availability of cloud-free satellite imagery for the October – March period over the entire country, availability of trained manpower, machine and software. Time requirement will also increase manifold as soon as we go for higher resolution. Hence further decision in this regard will be taken after analysing all pros and cons. Q. Experts have said the FSI doesn’t share its satellite imagery maps. Researchers are charged to avail these. Any plans to make them open access? A. The interpreted maps of FSI are available to everyone, though there are nominal charges for the data and maps. Whosoever demands the data, the same is provided after paying the nominal charges. The funds received from the sale of forest cover maps are deposited through Bharatkosh to Government of India funds. The satellite imagery used by FSI for the purpose of the forest cover mapping is procured on payment basis from NRSC. Government agencies are using these map layers free of cost for the Decision Support System for Forest clearance of FC Act proposals. This system is designed and implemented by FSI. Now we are considering providing the Forest cover maps through Web Map Service to make the analysis of researchers and agencies easier. Q. With India’s ambiguous definition of forests don’t you think the international community will also raise doubts about our carbon sink commitments? A technical assessment by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2019 had also recommended India delineate areas under orchards, and bamboo and palm cultivation for an accurate assessment of carbon stocks of forests. A. India’ definition of forests is not at all ambiguous. The definition of forest cover has clearly been defined in all the India State of Forest Report (ISFR) and in all the international communications of India. The forest cover is defined as ‘all land, more than one hectare in area, with a tree canopy density of more than 10 percent irrespective of ownership and legal status. Such land may not necessarily be a recorded forest area. It also includes orchards, bamboo and palm’. For the international communications, the forest can be defined by any county depending upon the capacities and capabilities of the country and is as follows (as per Decision 19/CP9 - Kyoto Protocol definition), Forest - Forest is defined structurally on the basis of • Crown cover percentage: Tree crown cover - 10 to 30 % (India 10%) • Minimum area of stand : area between 0.05 and 1 ha (India 1.0 ha), and • Minimum height of trees: Potential to reach a minimum height at maturity in situ of 2 to 5 m (India 2m) India’s definition of forest has been taken on the basis of above three criteria only and very well accepted by UNFCCC and FAO for their reporting/communications. UNFCCC has never raised any questions on Forest and Tree Cover of India. Neither any comments were made on our carbon sink commitments. The technical assessment by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2019 had never made any comments for accurate assessment of carbon stock of areas under orchards, bamboo and palm cultivation. Instead, the UNFCCC commented that India should consider delineating separately the orchard, bamboo and palm areas. In the Global Forest Resource Assessment 2020, FAO has acknowledged the technical support from FSI and has always valued the assessment of FSI. Q. Many critics have mentioned that biodiversity and people oriented studies in tribal areas have not been made a part of the ISFR. A. FSI has a mandate for reporting on the status of forest. With the limited resources, time and manpower, this mandate is of priority. Besides this we try to add a few additional information on issues of technology or public interest, like the decadal analysis in tiger conservation areas in this report. In 2011, a study on Production and Consumption studies was published, in 2013 on Trees in Agroforestry and Forest Types in 2015.

31-01-2022||India||Karnataka to send team to Maharashtra to study wine selling in supermarkets||The Karnataka government will send a team to Maharashtra to study the model it adopted for sale of wine. Karnataka’s excise minister K Gopalaiah said on Sunday that his government will decide the implementation of the model based on the report of the committees.Last Tuesday, Maharashtra gave a nod to allow sale of wine in supermarkets and walk-in stores at a flat annual licensing fee of ₹5,000. According to the state cabinet, the decision is aimed to ensure a more accessible marketing channel for Indian wineries.Speaking about it, Gopalaiah told news agency ANI, “It is newly introduced. We will send a committee to study it and will make a decision based on their report."Underlining that it is not necessary that the Karnataka government will adopt the same model just because Maharashtra has, he said, "We will have to see if it helps the government and also that it does not affect businesses."Vice president of the Federation of Wine Merchants of Karnataka, Karunakar Hegde told ANI that the grape wine production in the state is not as high as Maharashtra's. "There are more wine growers in Maharashtra. In Karnataka, there are a maximum of around 5 per cent wine traders. There are very few wineries here," he said.Hegde, however, said that converting the swine business to an open market won't be good, adding that there will be no control.The Maharashtra government’s decision had led to a war of words between the Shiv Sena-led three-party alliance which is in power in the state and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The BJP has linked the decision to Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s business. On Sunday, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya said Raut’s family members entered into a partnership with a company named Magpie DFS private limited, which was involved in wine distribution last year.Raut responded, saying there is nothing wrong if someone is in a legitimate business and BJP leaders will have to go underground if he starts revealing their businesses.On Thursday, former chief minister and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is converting Maharashtra into ‘Madya Rashtra’ or a nation of liquor. The Congress, which is part of the ruling dispensation in Maharashtra, responded saying that the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh had taken a similar decision that covered not just wine made from grapes, mead, fruits and flowers, but all kinds of liquor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-to-send-team-to-maharashtra-to-study-wine-selling-in-supermarkets-101643599186321.html

But to my utter surprise, when I clicked over the differently coloured portions, given to our state of J&K, the larger portion was showing the data of Pakistan and the smaller one was showing the data of China.”He called it a “serious International issue” that the government should have noticed and corrected. He added it is “grievous for the citizens of our country” and urged Modi to probe into this matter and intimate the people about the “major mistake”.Sen also sent copies of his letter to the Union ministries of home, external affairs, and health.There was no immediate response from the WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-writes-to-modi-over-who-dashboard-showing-j-k-arunachal-parts-of-pakistan-china-101643599285022.html

Delhi’s air quality was in the poor category on Monday morning. Data from Central Pollution Control Board showed that the hourly air quality index (AQI) at 7 am stood at 300. On Sunday, the average 24-hour AQI was 278, which is in the higher-end of the poor category.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.The weather office predicted that an active western disturbance is likely to bring widespread rainfall to the northern plains and snowfall in the hills between February 2 and 4.“Due to the approaching intense western disturbance, minimum temperatures are gradually going to rise over northwest India. The impact of the WD will be felt mainly in the hills and northern areas but on February 3 we can expect light rain in Delhi and parts of Uttar Pradesh as well,” said RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-likely-to-see-strong-winds-todayimd-101643599225925.html
31-01-2022||India||Plantations count for 28% forest cover: FSI DG||NEW DELHI: The ‘outside recorded forest area’ accounts for 28% of India’s forest cover, and comprises plantations of horticulture, pulpwood species as well as rural and urban greens, Anoop Singh, director general of Forest Survey of India (FSI) said.Singh has drafted a note to address various concerns being raised on the India State of Forests Report (ISFR) 2021, released on January 13.“In Chapter 2, Table 2.6, the forest cover figures are divided as ‘Inside Recorded Forest Area’ and ‘Outside Recorded Forest Area’. Those inside RFA are basically natural forests and plantations. Forest cover outside RFA includes mango orchards, coconut plantations, and block plantations of agro-forestry. They are automatically separated out and are clearly mentioned in the table,” he wrote in the note, emphasising that India has been transparent about the extent of forests. In ISFR 2021, 72 % of forest cover figures pertain to recorded forest area and only 28% of forest cover is outside the forest area, the note said, refuting concerns over the extent of natural forests in the country.“Most of the critics have not seen this table and have commented based on their pre-conceived notion. The areas of tea, coffee etc. are available with the respective boards and horticulture departments or from revenue records, where these details are recorded,” Singh added.According to ISFR 2021, India’s forest cover has increased from 21.67% of the total geographical area in 2019 to 21.71% in 2021. In the period, the country added 1,540 sqkm of forest cover to 713,789 sqkm in 2021, said the ISFR 2021.Out of the 1,540 sqkm increase, 1,509 sqkm is in the “outside RFA” category while only 31 sqkm is “inside RFA”, the report added.In the same period, the country’s total tree cover also increased by 721 sqkm, taking it to 2.91% of total geographical area in 2021 from 2.89% in 2019, the report said, adding that an overall increase of 2,261 sqkm (0.28%) of forest and tree cover has been observed as compared to 2019. The marginal increase in forests inside RFA is an issue of concern, Singh said.“This needs to be analysed and compared with the areas planted under various schemes of the central and state governments to re-strategise. Are we reaching saturation inside recorded forest area or are we losing areas or are the plantations less successful? I do not need to raise any alarm, but a serious thought and analysis is required,” the FSI director general said in the note, shared with select media on Friday. He informed that between November 2020 and June 2021, a total of 345,989 fire incidents have been reported in forests across the country, as compared to 124,473 in 2019-20 and 210,286 in 2018-19, adding it was also “worrying”.Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research, said, “The FAQs have clarified the distinction the methodology makes between recorded forests and plantations, which is useful. However, there is a need to review whether both should collectively be referred to as forest cover or presented as land with green or tree cover. It gives a distorted picture.” Kohli added, "It is also useful for a state of forest report to present how much of the recorded forest area is still under forest cover or has been put to other uses. For instance, forest diversion approvals for industries, dams or highways often come with a condition that the legal status of the land will remain unchanged. Do these areas still get calculated as recorded forest area? This and several other questions would be important to clarify."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plantations-count-for-28-forest-cover-fsi-dg-101643582846452.html

31-01-2022||India||BJP MLA lashes out at colleagues||Problems within the BJP continued to widen as more legislators from the ruling party expressed anger against their ministerial colleagues, fuelling growing rift within the Basavaraj Bommai-led government.MP Renukacharya, the political secretary of the chief minister, on Sunday said half of the cabinet, around 15 ministers, were “unresponsive” and “arrogant” and even fake contracting Covid-19 to avoid legislators.“There are around 15 or more arrogant ministers. I have discussed this with our BJP president several times. Several legislators have expressed their concerns to me that ministers do not receive phone calls or respond to letters. By not responding to even written letters, the ministers are insulting the people of the respective legislator’s constituencies,” the legislator from Honnali said.The statements comes even as the divide within the BJP appears to widen over teething issues including the cabinet expansion, undue importance being given to new entrants and the overlooking of the old guard, several of whom nurse a feeling of neglect as they continue to be overlooked for a position in Bommai’s council of ministers.While the BJP has itself dismissed any rift within the party, legislators have spared no opportunity in demanding to be included in the cabinet and seeking funds for programmes within their respective constituencies as crucial elections approach.“Some ministers feel that the government has formed in the state because of them only. They have ego issues and think that the government cannot exist without them. They are bringing a bad name to the party and the government. That is why I met the CM and state BJP president and requested for immediate dismissal of such Ministers. I also requested that party loyalists be allowed in the cabinet,” Renukacharya was quoted as saying by ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mla-lashes-out-at-colleagues-101643570723939.html
31-01-2022||India||Bengaluru traffic cop suspended for attacking woman||The Bengaluru traffic police official who physically and verbally assaulted a differently-abled woman has been suspended, Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra said on Sunday. “The police official who used foul language and attacked a helpless woman has been suspended and an enquiry has been ordered,” Jananendra said.The orders come days after a video of assistant sub inspector Narayana went viral on social media, adding to the growing outrage against law enforcement officials in Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka.The woman had pelted a stone at the police on January 24, which had caused minor injuries to the official. According to reports, she had protested the towing of vehicles in Bengaluru which has added to friction between public and the police in recent times. In retaliation, the official pushed her to the road, repeatedly kicked her and used foul language, which has not gone down well with the public.The video, posted by several locals of the city and shared on social media platforms like Twitter, attracted sharp criticism against the police, accused of using excessive force on the people.“No matter who it is, the law cannot be taken into their hands, and the police are no exception,” the home minister said.Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Sunday said the towing policy of police will be reviewed after the incident of the woman being assaulted surfaced. “The existing towing system is being reviewed. Earlier, the police department itself used to do it. Now, it has been assigned to private contractors. I too have observed many incidents. The public should follow the rules. But those who enforce the law should conduct themselves courteously with the public. Outrageous behaviour cannot be tolerated. I will hold a meeting tomorrow(Monday) with the Police Commissioner, DGP and Traffic Police officials. We will have a total review of the existing system. Many changes would be brought to make it people-friendly,” Bommai said.The Bengaluru police, in particular, have been blamed on more than one occasion for targeting and harassing people in the streets of India’s IT capital. The police were seen to use force on the common public in the garb of enforcing covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown guidelines while turning a blind eye on violations by politicians and other influential persons, according to multiple political leaders, activists and netizens who have highlighted the issue on social media and other platforms. Barely any action was taken against politicians--both ruling and opposition--when they violated lockdown guidelines or failed to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour since the pandemic, including the Mekedatu Padayatra, swearing-in ceremony for MLCs, weddings attended by senior leaders, religious fairs and other large gatherings in the state.Some of the most targeted persons by traffic police are delivery personnel, goods vehicles and others who are randomly stopped for ‘checking’, and heavy fines are imposed sometimes without any evidence, activists and others allege. Bribery is rampant, too, as officials and their subordinates negotiate with commuters as they are forced to pay up large sums of money to be allowed to leave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-traffic-cop-suspended-for-attacking-woman-101643570603888.html
31-01-2022||India||Bengaluru: Schools, colleges to resume classes from today||Schools and colleges in Bengaluru will resume classes on Monday as the Basavaraj Bommai-led state government continues to ease restrictions over low hospitalisation rates despite a high Covid-19 caseload in the state.The state government has already done away with weekend curfews and the restrictions on movement at night will cease to exist from Monday night along with other curbs on occupancy at commercial establishments like hotels, pubs, bars and other places.However, the restrictions of 50% occupancy continued on cinema halls, malls, swimming pools and a few other spaces. “As a Home Minister and Chief Minister I have provided many facilities for them (movie industry). A suitable decision would be taken after seeking suggestions from the expert committee on their demands,” Bommai said on Sunday.Despite hospitalisation remaining low in the state, there are fears that a significant section of people may not follow Covid appropriate behaviour.Out of the total 44,781 hospital beds set aside for Covid-19 related treatment in Karnataka, around 2,264 are occupied so far, according to real-time data provided by the government.Out of the 2319 beds in intensive care units with oxygen, only 125 are occupied, data shows.However, opposition political parties in Karnataka have questioned the government’s numbers and its decisions on covid-19.“@BJP4Karnataka is patting its own back for successfully managing #Covid19. In reality, it is celebrating the death of lakhs of people,” Siddaramaiah, the leader of the opposition said in a post on Saturday.Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education on Sunday said that it was unfortunate the state’s political opposition were making false allegations on covid management.“It is unfortunate that leaders in responsible positions have chosen to continue the 3rd wave of Congress party’s false allegations on Covid management. While the fatality rate in Karnataka is just 1%, only 1.59% of the infected are requiring hospitalisation in (the) third wave,” Sudhakar said.He added that the main reason for low hospitalisation was that the state had achieved high vaccination coverage. He said that the state had achieved 100% coverage in the first dose and 87.6% in the second dose.“About 51% of the beneficiaries among our HCWs, FLWs & co-morbid senior citizens have received the timely precaution dose. On one hand KPCC President says there is no Covid and its BJP’s creation. On the other hand LOP speaks about covid mgmt. What does Congress stand for?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluruschools-colleges-to-resume-classes-from-today-101643570424194.html
31-01-2022||India||B’luru woman falls due to pothole, run over by truck||A 46-year-old woman died on Sunday after she tried to avoid a pothole in Benglauru’s treacherous roads, adding to the growing number of casualties as a result of apathy by civic authorities in the country’s technology capital.A pick-up truck ran over the woman after she fell off the two-wheeler in which the couple was travelling when trying to avoid the pothole in Byadarahalli in Bengaluru.“The incident took place at 10.30 this morning. But the complaint we have received is that the vehicle hit them from behind which caused the two-wheeler rider to lose balance,” said a police official requesting not to be named.He said the husband, who is currently receiving treatment at a private hospital, was yet to give his statement and police were carrying on their investigation.Though there are conflicting versions of what may have caused the accident, one look at the stretch of the road with jagged edges and unfinished asphalting, adds to the possibility of the two-wheeler going off balance due to the condition of the road.The accident is the latest in a series of similar incidents that are increasing in Bengaluru where non-existent or poor quality of roads has snuffed out several lives over the years.The husband also sustained serious injuries and has been taken to the hospital, according to locals present on the road.The incident comes days after the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) had told the Karnataka High Court that it had filled up all the potholes in its limits which the judges themselves said was unbelievable.“We personally feel that you have not done anything...Don’t say anything which we ourselves feel is wrong,” according to a report by LiveLaw on Thursday.A division bench of Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Suraj Govindraj heard the case that was filed by Vijayan Menon.The BBMP, one of India’s biggest and richest civic bodies, spends thousands of crores in tax payers’ money each year on road-related works.Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, during the monsoon session of the state legislature in September last year, had said over ₹20,000 crore was spent by the administration on road-related works in Bengaluru over the last five years.Bengaluru’s roads are among the most treacherous in the country, claiming several lives each year and being one of the biggest challenges in the lives of over 12 million residents of India’s IT capital.“You cannot get away by saying that when the roads were constructed the load on the roads was less. Now you have to come out with solutions! Some method you have to come out with to ensure that roads bear the load,” the court observed, according to LiveLaw.The case is scheduled to be heard again on February 7.Civic apathy has claimed over 18 lives in Bengaluru in 2020, which is more than all the other big cities in India, combined, according to data from the National Crime Records Bureau.In September last year, a 75-year-old differently abled man lost his life after his two-wheeler hit a pothole in Kamakshipalya locality. The police filed a case of negligent driving on the victim.A seven-year-old Dhavani N from Tumakuru , in a heartfelt message to the chief minister in October last year, offered all of her savings to get potholes fixed after he mother sustained injuries in a road accident caused by poor quality of roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bluru-woman-falls-due-to-pothole-run-over-by-truck-101643570185201.html
31-01-2022||India||K’taka: Panel set up to ease leasing of grazing land||The Karnataka government has formed a sub-committee to survey and check guidelines for leasing out “Gomala” or grazing land in the state which appears to be an attempt to regularise encroachments.The sub-committee that will be headed by Karnataka revenue minister R Ashok and has other cabinet ministers including JC Madhuswamy, Araga Jnanendra, Prabhu Chavan, BC Patil and Byrathi Basavaraj as members, according to a notification issued on Saturday.“There are some contraindications in our rules which were not clear on whether those lands can be granted or not. There has to be consistency across the rules which are allowed and disallowed (to give it to organisations),” a senior Karnataka government official told Hindustan Times requesting not to be named.The official was unable to provide details of total Gomala lands in the state.Interestingly, the decision does not augur well with the bovine-influenced politics being propagated by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai who continues to prioritise cows as an extension of his attempt to “appease” the right wing, analysts said.Several religious institutions have also taken large tracts of grazing lands to protect cows that have made it difficult for the government to find adequate land for setting up Goshalas or cowsheds as promised by Bommai.Chambi Puranik, a Bengaluru-based political analyst, said Bommai continues to rely on gaining favour from his predecessor, BS Yediyurappa, as well as from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“He has an obligation to the RSS. He brought the anti-conversion bill to appease the Hindutva lobby,” Puranik said.The chief minister adopted 11 cows from the Rashtrothana Gau Shala (cow shelter) on his birthday which his office called as the “way for cow protection”.Despite not being originally from the BJP, Bommai has taken a hardline approach on several issues to pander to the right wing, including introducing contentious laws like anti-conversion which includes an attempt to regulate inter-faith marriages which the right wing calls “love jihad” as well as trying to justify increasing acts of moral policing and religious intolerance in the state.There has also been an increase in religious intolerance in Karnataka like moral policing, hate crimes, attacks on minorities among other crimes.There has also been an increase in religious intolerance in Karnataka like moral policing, hate crimes, attacks on minorities among other crimes.“When sentiments are hurt, it is natural that there are actions and reactions. Even the youth should keep in mind these sentiments and act accordingly,” Bommai said on October 13 last year, almost justifying the rising number of vigilante-based crimes across the state, sparking off protests.At least 34 well-known intellectuals from different parts of the state and country on the eve of Republic Day shot off a letter to the chief minister over the rising intolerance.“Over the past few months, the state has witnessed the brutal killing of youths in several districts, rampant ‘hate speeches’, public threats and disruptions of worship by religious minorities, ‘honour killings’, ‘moral policing’, misogynistic statements by legislators, and incidents of hostile and violent encounters between various religious groups. These trends have been encouraged by the callous and un-constitutional statements made by Legislators and the inability of the state machinery to rein-in fringe anti-social groups,” according to the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-panel-set-up-to-ease-leasing-of-grazing-land-101643570003882.html
31-01-2022||India||SC judge renews pitch for public’s access to proceedings in court||Renewing his pitch for more transparency in court proceedings, Supreme Court judge justice DY Chandrachud has said that it will only be possible for the public to understand the nature of judicial work if proceedings are opened for public viewership.A judge is to be judged not only by the number of judgments delivered but also by her conduct inside the courtroom, justice Chandrachud said.Speaking at the virtual launch of a book by professor Balram K Gupta on Saturday, the top court judge said: “Not only is it imperative that justice is done but it should also seem to be done. Justice seems to be done only when judicial proceedings are opened for public viewership.”If judicial proceedings are opened to public, justice Chandrachud said, it will not only provide legitimacy to the institution but also add “to the democratic principle of accountability”.While data on disposal rates and the judgments of cases are easily available in the public domain, the people cannot ascertain the behaviour of a judge inside the courtroom due to a lack of transparency, justice Chandrachud said.“Unless this important indicator of performance evaluation is publicly available, it would be difficult to evaluate the performance of a judge and would pose challenges to judicial accountability,” he said.“A lack of transparency results in distrust and a deep sense of insecurity,” justice Chandrachud said recalling the Dalai Lama. He further said that even though legal journalism has “gained traction”, it has limitations.

31-01-2022||India||Pegasus row: Congress calls for privilege motion against Centre||The Congress’s Lok Sabha floor leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Sunday to seek a privilege motion against Union minister of information technology Ashwini Vaishnaw for “deliberately misleading the House on the Pegasus issue”.Also Read | Fresh plea urges SC to take note of NYT report on PegasusThe notice is the latest escalation of an attack by the Opposition aimed at the Union government over the alleged use of military-grade Israeli-origin spyware Pegasus. The letter comes a day after several opposition parties attacked the government following a report by the New York Times that said India purchased the spyware in 2017.“The government, on the floor of the House, always maintained that it had nothing to do with the Pegasus spyware and it never bought the spyware from the NSO Group,” Chowdhury wrote in the letter, before adding that “in light of the revelations… it appears that the Modi government has misled the parliament and the Supreme Court...”Chowdhury cited affidavits submitted by the government in which, he said, the government claimed to “unequivocally deny any and all of the allegations” on the Pegasus issue.Also Read | Pegasus inquiry: Take note of the NYT reportThe MP’s letter reflects the principal opposition party’s toughened stand on the controversy, which relates to allegations that the mobile phone hacking tool was used against Indian citizens, including political opponents, journalists and members of the judiciary.In the 2021 monsoon session, the Congress-led opposition demanded clarifications from the PM on Pegasus and nearly washed out the session through massive protests and disruption. The Budget session beginning Monday is likely to witness protests over the issue again.In his letter to the Speaker, Chowdhury said: “I demand that a Privilege Motion may be initiated against the Minister of Information Technology for deliberately misleading the House on the Pegasus issue”.A privilege motion is only initiated after the Speaker or the Chairman gives approval in their respective Houses. In the past few years, many allegations and demands for privilege motions against rival lawmakers have not found favour from the chair.Also Read | Best time to ask Israel for advanced Pegasus software: Chidambaram in dig at ModiIn the 2021 monsoon session, Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw gave a suo motu statement in both houses and said there is ‘no substance’ in previous media reports regarding the use of Pegasus. He also assured parliament that illegal spying is impossible in the country.The Congress has announced that the Pegasus issue will come up in parliament. Party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged the Centre has misled both Parliament and the Supreme Court. “The role of the Prime Minister and his responsibility is now directly in question. Kharge Saheb (Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge) has said, we will discuss this other political parties and seek accountability...”Kharge also claimed that the statement by Vaishnaw in Parliament indicated that “there is no purchase, nothing. So, it is their statement. What we will do... take other political parties also in confidence and further action will be taken,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pegasus-row-cong-calls-for-privilege-motion-against-centre-101643569092089.html
31-01-2022||India||Kapu leaders to join forces for more political share in Andhra Pradesh||Leaders of Kapu community, a politically strong caste group in Andhra Pradesh, are planning to come together, setting aside their political affiliations, to form a pressure group with an aim to achieve what they say their legitimate share in political power in the state in the coming years.The Kapu leaders, representing parties like the Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress, Telugu Desam Party and the Jana Sena Party, held a virtual meeting on January 23 and decided to form an “Aikya Vedika” (joint forum), which, they said, would do intense lobbying with their respective parties and strive to achieve due share of seats for the community in the next assembly and parliament elections.A Kapu leader familiar with the development said the meeting was attended by TDP legislator from Visakhapatnam Ganta Srinivasa Rao and former TDP MLA Bonda Umamaheshwara Rao, former Congress minister Vatti Vasanth Kumar, retired IAS officer and former Tamil Nadu chief secretary Rammohan Rao, among others. “The Kapu leaders from ruling YSR Congress party stayed away from the meeting,” he said.This was the second meeting held by the Kapu community in the recent past. In December, too, some Kapu leaders, including retired joint director of Central Bureau of Investigation V V Lakshminarayana and former BJP state president Kanna Lakshminarayana, had a meeting at a star hotel in Hyderabad to discuss the strategy to protect the political interests of the community.“A steering committee will be formed to work out the strategy on achieving political power for Kapus in the next elections. Though it is a long way to travel, the ultimate objective of the effort is to grab power in the coming years,” the Kapu leader said. He said there would be yet another meeting in February to finalise the structure of the Aikya Vedika, which would be a sort of pressure group. It would strive to win as many seats as possible in the next elections.A politically strong community in Andhra Pradesh, Kapus and their affiliated caste groups, such as Balijas, Telagas and Ontaris, constitute 15.2 per cent of the total population in the state. While they are spread all over the state, East and West Godavari districts are considered as strongholds of the Kapus.Traditionally, the Kapus, because of their rivalry with another predominant caste group, Kammas, who account for 4.8 per cent of the total population, had voted for the Congress.However, Kapus made an attempt to come together as a consolidated vote bank in 2008 when prominent Telugu film actor Chiranjeevi floated a new political outfit Praja Rajyam Party. It generated a lot of euphoria in the community.But the Praja Rajyam Party failed to put up an impressive show in the elections. It could win only 18 out of 294 assembly seats and get 17.5 per cent vote share. Chiranjeevi could not sustain the party for long and merged it with the Congress in February 2011.In 2014, Chiranjeevi’s younger brother Pawan Kalyan floated the Jana Sena Party, but he did not contest the elections in AP post-bifurcation of combined AP. He supported the BJP-TDP combine.In 2019 elections, however, Jana Sena contested in alliance with the Left and the Bahujan Samaj Party but failed to make any impact. It could win only one MLA seat with a vote share of only 5.54 per cent.There was a talk that Jana Sena would consolidate the Kapu votes, but the community had no faith on him after seeing his elder brother Chiranjeevi’s failed experiment. Instead, they voted largely in favour of the YSRC led by Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, which won 27 out of 34 seats in East and West Godavari districts. Pawan Kalyan himself lost in the Kapu-dominated constituencies like Bhimavaram and Gajuwaka.“Having seen the experiments of Chiranjeevi and Pawan Kalyan, we have realised that Kapus need to rework their strategies if they have to come to power. The Aikya Vedika is the first step to consolidate the Kapu vote bank. If the community remains united and turns into a pressure group, it can achieve its objective one day or the other,” the Kapu leader said.
31-01-2022||India||Kerala ex-minister targets Lokayukta, faces flak from Oppn||Amid the row over the Kerala government’s plan to dilute the powers of the anti-corruption body Lokayukta through an ordinance, former minister K T Jaleel on Sunday posted a message on social media casting aspersions on Lokayukta Justice Cyriac Joseph, also a former Supreme Court judge. Jaleel was forced to resign from the Pinarayi Vijayan government last year after the Lokayukta found him guilty of nepotism.Without naming him, Jaleel alleged that the Lokayukta “will do anything for money and position” and that the Congress-led UDF is using him as a weapon to stab chief minister Vijayan in the back. In the post, the former minister also alleged that a senior leader of the UDF was saved from a controversial case in 2005 when the Lokayukta was a judge in the Kerala high court and in turn he managed a plum post for his sister-in-law. Jaleel was indirectly referring to the appointment of Jancy James as the vice chancellor of the Mahathma Gandhi University in Kottayam. “It is a tragedy that a weapon meant for Gandhiji is getting into the hands of Godse. If he gets good returns, he will do any job. When three central agencies gave me a clean chit in trumped-up case, he appeared all of a sudden to weaken the government,” Jaleel said in the post, referring to his case. Later he also posted the verdict in the ice cream parlour case -- a sex scandal in which Muslim League leader P K Kuhalikutty’s name allegedly cropped up but later the Supreme Court gave him a clean chit. Last year Jaleel resigned from the Vijayan government after the Lokayukta found him to have lobbied for a relative to be appointed as the general manager of the State Minority Welfare Corporation. Lokayukta found that he diluted some of the qualifications required for the post. Though Jaleel moved the high court and Supreme Court, both refused to entertain his plea. The opposition Congress and BJP slammed Jaleel for targeting constitutional positions. The Congress has sought the CM’s reply to Jaleel’s post. “Justice Cyriac Joseph was appointed Lokayukta by the present government. It is for the CM to reply to such wild allegations,” said opposition leader V D Satheesan. “Frustrated Jaleel is attacking constitutional positions to vent his anger,” said BJP state president K Surendran. The ruling CPI(M) is yet to comment on Jaleel’s post. The Opposition said the move to clip the wings of Lokayukta came in the wake of three complaints against the CM for allegedly abusing his position to grant financial help to three “ineligible persons” from his disaster relief fund. Complaints say the CM misused funds meant for disaster relief and distributed lakhs of rupees to former party MLA K K Ramachandran’s family to clear his debts, gave help to the family of former NCP leader Uzhavoor Vijayan and relief to the family of a gunman who died on escort duty of CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. Similarly higher education minister R Bindhu is also feeling the heat of the Lokayukta. Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala had moved the anti-graft body last month citing two letters she wrote to the governor recommending the re-appointment of Kannur vice- chancellor Gopinath Raveendran. Chennithala said the minister has no right to send such letters to the governor and that it was a clear case of nepotism and misuse of power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-ex-minister-targets-lokayukta-faces-flak-from-oppn-101643569163851.html
31-01-2022||India||Protesters urge Tamil Nadu governor to forward NEET bill to Prez||As governor R N Ravi was paying a tribute to a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi on Chennai’s Marina beach, about 5 kilometres away educational activists went on a hunger strike on Sunday, urging him to forward the NEET exemption Bill, which has been with him since September, to the President for his assent. “The educational development of Tamil Nadu is the result of the three century-old Social Justice Movement, and the sustained struggle by the teacher, student and parent organisations,” said Prince Gajendra Babu, general secretary, State Platform for the Common School System, who led the protest. “The struggle is beyond getting an assent for a Bill,” Babu said. “The struggle is to save the Constitution of India with federal character and parliamentary democracy as its basic structure.”The Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill, 2021 was passed by the DMK-led state government in the state assembly last September to restore Tamil Nadu’s process of medical admissions by considering only Class 12 marks before the Supreme Court made NEET compulsory in 2017. When the organisation filed an RTI application on the status of the Bill, the governor’s office responded last December that “The file is under consideration”. “Is it not the responsibility of the governor to reveal to the people what he is considering on the subject in which he cannot take any decision?” Babu asked. “The silence of the governor is very disturbing.”The state has also been building pressure on the governor over the issue. Despite the differences, chief minister M K Stalin and senior ministers and bureaucrats accompanied Ravi to pay their respects on Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary.Only a day ago, the ruling DMK’s party organ, Murasoli, published a column criticising Ravi saying that ‘this is Tamil Nadu and not Nagaland’ for his views on the state’s two-language policy and NEET. The column pointed out that though there are multiple views on myriad issues, the state stood together to continue its two-language policy and abolish NEET. “The governor should understand it and get consent for the unanimous opinion of the state by properly informing the union government,” the column said, adding that there cannot be a “big brother” attitude. Ravi, who was Nagaland’s interlocutor, was transferred to Tamil Nadu last September and the Congress in the state had questioned then if he would act in the interest of the state or the BJP-led Centre.On the eve of Republic Day, Ravi in a statement stressed that it is unfair to deprive students in Tamil Nadu of knowledge of other Indian languages. “Besides fostering brotherliness and better mutual appreciation, a linguistic intellectual and cultural cross-pollination will enrich all of us and also open several opportunities for our harmonious growth,” the Governor had said. Ravi also spoke in support of NEET saying that before its introduction, the share of students from government schools to government medical colleges was hardly 1%.Meanwhile, the protests are seeking a response from the governor on the NEET Bill by the end of the day failing which Babu says he will individually go on a Satyagraha until a favourable response is received arguing that NEET adversely impacts medical aspirants from rural and poor backgrounds.
31-01-2022||India||Two years on, Kerala battles high Covid caseload||India’s first Covid-19 case -- a China-returned medical student from Thrissur -- was detected in Kerala exactly two years ago on January 30, 2020, but even after two years, the state is still grappling with high virus caseload. In the midst of a third wave, it remains the highest contributor for almost a month and in death rate it is second to Maharashtra. With just 2.8 per cent of India’s population, it reported 14.3 per cent of total cases and 10.6 per cent of deaths, showing the intensity of the pandemic in the state. Once lauded for its Covid control measures, Kerala later turned a pandemic hub and big disparity in death rate puts holes in its tall claims. Among 53,000-odd Covid deaths, more than 20,000 were added from the unaccounted list and 15,000 are still pending to be declared Covid-deaths, statistics show. The state now finds refuge in the union health ministry guidelines to justify the huge disparity. But there is some silver lining also -- a comparison with second and third waves shows ICU and ventilator use dropped by 80 per cent. Experts say though new variant Omicron spreads fast, its severity is much reduced. They attribute it to improved immunity through vaccination, immunity through infection and booster doses to people with co-morbidity. In Kelala, 100 per cent got first dose of vaccine and more than 85 per cent got both jabs. State health minister Veena George said the state is witnessing peak of third wave and cases will flatten in three weeks. “In the first week of January infection rate was 45 per cent, 148 per cent in second week and in third week it rose to 215 per cent. Now infection rate is about 58 per cent,” she said, adding in three weeks cases will come down drastically. She said effective intervention helped contain death rate to an extent and high-power committee on pandemic will meet on Monday to review the situation. But opposition Congress criticised the government, saying other than lengthy statements nothing is happening on the ground. “The government is telling infected not to go to hospitals and many are suffering in their homes. The state is headless now as the CM is in the UAE. He should cut short his visit and rush to the state in view of high caseload,” said senior leader Ramesh Chennithala. Experts said it is too early to lower guard. “We are in the midst of pandemic and our main thrust should be curtailing infection and saving lives. Nobody has any idea when the pandemic will turn endemic. The need of the hour is to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said public health expert Dr Padmanabha Shenoy. “Omicron variant is less severe because it doesn’t affect lungs and cause pneumonia. And it spreads at a time when people have built a strong immunity,” said internal medicine expert Dr N M Arun adding despite it is hyper-mutant and hyper transmissible it seems less severe. But what worries health experts is that in the state with high population density (859 people per sq km) and a large number of elderly population (at least 15% are above 60 years of age), Covid after-effects will be alarming. A study conducted by CADI (Coronary Artery Disease among Indian Asians) showed that Kerala’s diabetes prevalence is 20% against the national average of 8%. Prevalence of high blood pressure is 30-36 per cent in the state compared to 21-30 per cent nationally, shows the study. 
31-01-2022||India||India fighting Covid-19 third wave with great success: PM||New Delhi: India is fighting the pandemic’s third wave with “great success,” with around 4.5 crore children receiving their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine and one crore people being administered a third precautionary dose within a few weeks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his monthly radio broadcast on Sunday.“India is fighting with great success the new wave of corona. It is also a matter of pride that till now about four and a half crore children have been administered the (first) dose of corona vaccine,” the Prime Minister said. “This means that about 60% of youth in the age group of 15 to 18 years have got their vaccines within three to four weeks. This will not only protect our youth but will also help them to continue with their studies.”“Another good thing is that within 20 days, one crore people have taken the precautionary dose as well. This trust of our countrymen on the indigenous vaccine is our great strength,” Modi said in the 85th episode of his Mann ki Baat programme.The decline in the rate of increase in fresh Covid-19 cases is a “very positive sign,” he said. “People should be safe, the pace of economic activities of the country should be maintained — this is the wish of every countryman.”The Prime Minister spoke about the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi observed on January 30, and said the day reminds everyone about the teachings of the Father of the Nation. He also referred to the installation of a digital statue of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose at India Gate.He also talked about the merging of the Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate and the flame at the nearby National War Memorial. “There were tears in the eyes of many countrymen and martyr families on this emotional occasion,” he said. Modi urged people to visit the memorial with their families whenever they get an opportunity.Modi also talked about the “unsung heroes who have done extraordinary deeds in ordinary circumstances” who received the prestigious Padma awards this year. He asked countrymen to discuss the recipients of the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Baal Puraskar at their homes.“These awards are given to the children who have rendered courageous and inspirational work at a young age. We all must highlight about these children in our homes. Our children will also get inspiration from this and the enthusiasm to bring glory to the country will be awakened in them,” he said.The Prime Minister said that more than one crore children have sent him their ‘mann ki baat’ not just from across the country but also from abroad as a part of the ongoing Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsava celebration on the occasion of India’s 75th year of Independence.While discussing a postcard from a girl named Navya from Uttar Pradesh, who had said she wants to see an India free of corruption by 2047, Modi said that corruption is like a “termite” that makes the country hollow.“Why wait for 2047 to get rid of it? All of us countrymen, today’s youth have to do this work together, as soon as possible, and for this it is very important that we give priority to our duties. Where duty is felt, duty is paramount, corruption cannot even think of entering there,” the Prime Minister said.Modi also discussed the role of leaders including Madan Mohan Malviya, Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel and Rabindranath Tagore in the field of education.Modi also mentioned the recently deceased tigress known as Collarwali, who died at the Pench Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh earlier this month after birthing 29 cubs. He mentioned Virat, who made his 13th and final appearance at the Republic Day parade as the horse of the commandant of the elite President’s Bodyguard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-fighting-covid-19-third-wave-with-great-success-pm-101643569043878.html

This is the first time Stalin who is also the president of the DMK party broke his silence on the issue without mentioning it. In his letter to the DMK cadre, Stalin told them to remind people about Tamil Nadu’s unique quality of not allowing sectarian politics. “BJP is showing an urgency to sow the seeds of religious hatred and to incite riots among Tamil Nadu’s people who are living peacefully and harmoniously. Expose their politics,” Stalin said. He said that the AIADMK’s 10-year-rule was filled with struggle and accused the principal opposition party of spreading lies on a daily basis. “Tell people that the two parties are against the interests of the people and have formed an alliance to destroy Tamil Nadu.”Stalin’s letter to the DMK cadre was to encourage them to continue their winning streak in the local body elections to be held on February 19. After winning the assembly elections and forming the government in May, the DMK also swept the rural body polls in nine newly carved districts in Tamil Nadu. The February 19 polls will be a referendum on the Stalin-led 8-month old government. “The activities of the DMK government are based on the ‘Dravidian Model’ of social justice, self-respect, caste-based religious harmony and integrated development. This will be a testament to us in the urban local body elections,” Stalin said. Meanwhile, BJP leaders in Tamil Nadu led by state president K Annamali visited the deceased child’s family in Ariyalur district on Sunday. She was studying in Class 12 in a Christian residential school in Thanjavur. Following the visit, Annamalai spoke to reporters in Ariyalur blaming the DMK-led government and the intelligence department. He also clarified that the BJP is not against any religion. “We are asking for justice only against individuals belonging to a particular community who had done wrong. That’s all.” Annamalai reacted to Stalin’s statement saying that it was the DMK which played politics when a Dalit student S Anitha died by suicide after failing in NEET in 2017. He said that DMK’s ministers and the investigating police were making irresponsible statements while the case is also in the Madurai bench of the Madras high court and reiterated their demand for a CBI probe. “BJP is fighting for justice for this child’s justice based on her video, statements from her parents and villagers. If this issue has become a national-issue now it is due to the incompetence of the intelligence department,” Annamalai, a former IPS officer of the Karnataka cadre, said. “According to me, a big charge is that if they even gave a true briefing to the chief minister.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-girl-s-suicide-stalin-hits-out-at-bjp-asks-dmk-cadre-to-fight-sectarian-politics-101643568983881.html

31-01-2022||India||Fresh plea urges SC to take note of NYT report on Pegasus||A fresh plea has been filed in the Supreme Court, urging it to take note of a New York Times report on the alleged procurement of Israeli spyware Pegasus by the Union government in 2017.The application by advocate ML Sharma has requested the court to order a probe into the 2017 defence deal with Israel.Also Read | Best time to ask Israel for advanced Pegasus software: Chidambaram in dig at ModiThe New York Times report said India bought Pegasus spyware as part of a $2 billion defence deal with Israel in 2017. The media report sparked off a political controversy, with the opposition alleging that the government indulged in illegal snooping that amounted to “treason”.Also Read | Pegasus inquiry: Take note of the NYT reportIn his plea, Sharma said the 2017 deal was not approved by Parliament and, therefore, needs to be cancelled and money be recovered.He urged the top court to issue suitable directions for registering a criminal case and to investigate the impugned Pegasus spyware purchase deal and alleged misuse of public funds in the interest of justice. Sharma’s plea is still to get a date of hearing.Sharma is one of the petitioners in the batch of petitions on the Pegasus row, in which the court had in October 2021 set up a three-member expert committee, to be supervised by a retired judge of the court, RV Raveendran.The bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, had asked the panel to investigate whether the Centre or any state government acquired and used Israeli spyware Pegasus for surveillance of Indian citizens, and to also ascertain details of people targeted.In its order passed on October 27, the court held the Union government cannot get “a free pass every time” by raising the spectre of “national security” when the issues concern the “potential chilling effect” on right to privacy and freedom of speech. It referred to the lack of a “specific denial” by the government and also its reluctance to file a detailed affidavit.The court-appointed panel is yet to submit its report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-plea-urges-sc-to-take-note-of-nyt-report-on-pegasus-101643568203836.html

31-01-2022||India||Nadal comes from 2 sets down to make history with 21st Slam||Rafael Nadal at the Australian Open has been more a tale of heartbreak. On Sunday, it turned into history.The Spaniard wrapped his hands around a 21st Grand Slam title, a feat that puts him in sole position in the list of most Major titles won by a men’s singles tennis player and — statistically, at least — in pole position in the ever-evolving GOAT (greatest of all time) narrative around the sport.Nadal was tied with world No. 1 Novak Djokovic and Swiss legend Roger Federer at 20 Majors as the Big Three of men’s tennis constantly pushed each other to greater heights and jaw-dropping numbers. Nadal has gone one up after beating Russian world No. 2 Daniil Medvedev 2-6, 6-7(5), 6-4, 6-4, 7-5 in a pulsating, momentum-swinging final at Rod Laver Arena that lasted five hours and 24 minutes.“It was one of the most emotional matches in my tennis career,” Nadal said in his on-court interview.The spectacular, come-from-behind triumph made the 35-year-old the third-oldest man in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam title after Ken Rosewall and Federer. It also meant Nadal became only the second man in the Open era to win all the four Grand Slams at least twice. The first? Djokovic, who was primed to get to the magical 21 before the other two exclusive Big Three club members after racing from 18 to 20 in the first three Grand Slams of 2021. Nadal spent half of the year sidelined with a troublesome foot injury even as Federer, 40, underwent another knee surgery.Incidentally, Federer was the first to have a shot at 21 when he reached the Wimbledon final in 2019, losing in a final-set tiebreaker after having two match points against Djokovic. It was the Serb’s turn to have a go next when, on the back of a breathless run of victories last year, he reached the US Open final only to be stopped in his tracks by Medvedev.No such heartbreak for Nadal, who has broken away in his very first crack at the record after going a year-and-a-half without Slam success; his last Major title was the 2020 French Open.It is as surprising as it is remarkable. Nadal came into the 2022 season having not played any competitive tennis in six months and recovering from Covid-19 last month. You couldn’t tell with the way he extracted every ounce from his physical reserves against an opponent 10 years younger to him staring at a two-set deficit in the final. Nadal has, in the past, been more on the wrong side of such duels at Melbourne Park. After his maiden triumph Down Under 13 years ago beating Federer in 2009, Nadal lost four Australian Open finals, twice in five sets to Djokovic (2012) and Federer (2017) and in straight sets to the former in his previous attempt three years ago.In Djokovic’s fort — the Serb has won the Australian Open title a record nine times — and in his least happy hunting Slam, the man from Mallorca has snatched the record away.

31-01-2022||India||BA.2 likely drove 3rd wave in some states||Did the even faster-spreading Omicron variant offshoot BA.2 drive India’s third Covid-19 wave? Data from the global genome sequence repository GISAID seems to suggest so, at least for several states from where genotyping data has been more consistently shared.BA.2 is one of the offshoots of the Omicron variant and has recently been seen displacing its predecessor, the BA.1. The Omicron variant’s earliest lineages B.1.1.529 and BA.1 itself have been significantly more transmissible, having displaced the Delta variant from most parts of the world.For a sub-lineage to spread even faster, the BA.2 is now a variant under investigation.The new evidence on BA.2The first real-world analysis of infection trends split by BA.2 and the other Omicron lineages offers several insights. These findings are based on the latest variant technical briefing by the UK Health Security Agency released over the weekend.First, they corroborate that the BA.2 indeed spreads faster than BA.1 based on two metrics: sequencing data from across England and estimates of secondary infection rates within households. “Whilst growth rates can be overestimates early in the emergence of a variant, the apparent growth advantage is currently substantial,” the report said.The secondary attack rate for BA.2 was 13.4%, compared to 10.3% in the case of BA.1. This gives BA.2 a crude 30% transmission advantage over BA.1, which itself is estimated to be 50% more transmissible than the Delta variant.Second, they find that there is no difference in how resistant BA.2 may or may not be as compared to BA.1, which means vaccines are likely to be equally protective with the newer offshoot. It also cited an unpublished University of Oxford report that found antibodies from vaccinated people neutralised BA.2 and BA.1 to similar degrees.All in all, it appears the BA.2 offshoot does not seem to be more resistant. In case of infection severity, the UKHSA report adds that there is insufficient data to make an assessment just yet.BA.2 in IndiaAccording to genome sequencing data submitted by Indian labs to the GISAID database, more than half of the cases in the last month may be of BA.2, according to an analysis on outbreak.info.This is relevant because nationwide, cases began to spike distinctly from early January.In fact, a more detailed analysis of India data on GISAID by Texas-based molecular biologist Bijaya Dhakal suggests infections in several states has been dominated by BA.2.Among the key states where the trend is clear are Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat.In Uttar Pradesh, a state which goes to elections and where large scale political rallies were held till January 8, the BA.2 became the most dominant variant to be sampled in the first week of the month itself. The state, like many others, has submitted a low number of samples, the data shared by Dhakal in a Twitter thread on Sunday showed, but the trend appeared to be distinct from January 2.Similar findings for Karnataka, where BA.2 has likely replaced Delta, BA.1/BA.1.1, the molecular biologist addedIn Delhi, the BA.1 and BA.1.1 switch to BA.2 appears to have happened at end of December itself, the latest date for which sample details were available. Union and Delhi government officials have separately corroborated this, saying that they had found BA.2 to have increased in proportion.One of the most updated sequencing data is from Gujarat, where too BA.2 became dominant from at least the second week of January, the GISAID data showed.But in Maharashtra, there “is almost a hodgepodge of all three important variants: Delta, Omicron BA.1/BA.1.1 and Omicron BA.2”, Dhakal wrote.Genome sequencing data is subject to some bias because there are not always representative of community spread. But if a variant starts to be detected in an increasing frequency consistently, it is safe to assume it is becoming predominant.In this context, India will likely answer the most significant question regarding BA.2: the offshoot is likely no more virulent (that is, causing more severe disease) than other Omicron lineages. Even though there has been a spike in many parts of the country, death and hospitalisation rates have remained low, consistent with the experience of South Africa and UK.But the GISAID data also highlights significant genome surveillance blindspots, which could hamper India’s outbreak monitoring. For instance, Bihar the third most populated state, has submitted only one sequence to the database since September last year.

Police said that while many of them knew each other only by the names on their social media profiles, they trusted them enough to share passwords.Also Read | Github case: An act to disturb harmony, says courtThe two police forces have arrested 8 people from Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Assam, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh, and at least six others from Bihar, Delhi and other parts of the country have joined the investigation (the police are still probing the extent of their involvement) role. To be sure, the Mumbai and Delhi police are conducting separate investigations. HT spoke to police officers directly involved in the investigations who explained the connection between the people involved.The Clubhouse caseClubhouse is a social audio app with at least two million active users in India. On January 18, Delhi police filed an FIR after a portion of a chat on Clubhouse was shared on social media where the participants were heard making derogatory comments about Muslim women. The following day, the Mumbai police too filed an FIR. On January 21, the Mumbai police arrested Akash Suyal(19), a third-year student from Karnal, Haryana. Police said Suyal was one of the participants of the offensive chat group, with the ID Kira xd. Other participants too joined the chat with made-up names such as Bismillah(in the name of God), Sallos, Aanchal, and K. The investigation has now revealed that Akash Suyal knew Naumaan Jabber, a resident of Jodhpur. Jabber, who was questioned by Delhi police in the same case, revealed that he knew Suyal virtually and, on January 6 created an account @vercase_on_me as a back-up account to his main handle @mr_casanova .“Jabber shared the account details of @vercase_on_me with Suyal. Suyal later changed it to Kira xd. The two knew each other on Clubhouse and trusted each other with the passwords. These misguided young people all believe that they have the same purpose on social media....,” said DCP KPS Malhotra, chief of the Delhi police’s Intelligent Fusion Strategic Operations unit.Akash Suyal was friends with two other suspects. “Suyal was known to Rahul Kapoor, who created the audio chat room. Kapoor has joined the investigation with Delhi police and we have already recorded his statement. Kapoor, a resident of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, also confirmed that he created the chat room on the instruction of a person with the username Sallos. He knew Sallos virtually, but did not know that behind the ID was a 17-year-old class 12 student. Sallos claimed to be a management student. Sallos, Suyal and Kapoor were all connected virtually. Kapoor even handed the moderator keys of the audio group to Sallos. Such was the trust between them,” said a police officer who asked not to be named.Delhi police are yet to make any arrests in the Clubhouse case because DCP Malhotra said police are trying to build a “water-tight case” against the suspects. “We will approach the court and get permission to record voice samples. The whole Clubhouse case is based on a video in which the suspects are heard making derogatory comments. This case is different than the GitHub cases. The voices of the shared clip have to match with these suspects for the case to stand in court,” said DCP Malhotra.Bulli Bai and Sulli DealsThe controversial chat on Clubhouse is the third such case in the last 8 months in which Muslim women were targeted on social media platforms. The first was the Sulli Deals app on GitHub in July and the second one was Bulli Bai app . Both featured doctored photographs of Muslim women along with offensive and derogatory comments. Similar to the Clubhouse investigation, both the Delhi and Mumbai police have filed separate cases.The Mumbai police arrested three suspects in the Bulli Bai case, while the Delhi police arrested one suspect each in the Bulli Bai and the Sulli Deals case. Neeraj Bishnoi (21), a second year B Tech student was arrested in the first case from Jorhat, Assam. Aumkareshwar Thakur (26), a freelance web designer was arrested in the Sulli Deals case from Indore. The two are believed to be the creators of the two apps.The three suspects Mumbai police arrested in the case are Sweta Singh (18), her friend Mayank Rawat (20), both residents of Uttarakhand, and Vishal Kumar Jha (21), an engineering student from Bengaluru. The Mumbai police have said that the three were promoting the Bulli Bai app created by Bishnoi .Sometime in the third week of November, while in Jaipur, where he had gone to attend a wedding in the family, Bishnoi built the Bulli Bai app on GitHub. It took him about three days to come up with the app, according to the investigators. About a month later, after he returned home to Jorhat, Assam, he updated the app. “He needed to promote the app on social media. The first twitter account he used to promote the app was that of his social media friend, Sweta Singh(arrested by Mumbai police). The two were friends for more than a year and met on Twitter. Singh gave Bishnoi access to her account, “She gave the password to Bishnoi. Bishnoi told her he was a citizen of Nepal. They also spoke for hours. He claimed he even consoled her when her father died of Covid-19. Her mother had died of cancer,” said a second investigator who asked not to be named.In his disclosure statement before the police that was submitted in court, Bishnoi has mentioned that he came in contact with the three through “random conversations on Hindu religion/community.”Had Bishnoi not mentioned the involvement of his Twitter friend in the Sulli Deals case, that may never have been solved. After the app generated outrage in July last year, its creator went to the ground. It was only thanks to Bishnoi that the Delhi Police arrested Aumkareshwar Thakur(26), a freelance web designer. ”When Bishnoi was arrested and we started questioning him, he told us about his twitter friend Thakur, who was the creator of Sulli Deals,” DCP Malhotra said.Bishnoi and Thakur too were friends only on social media but came together virtually to build the offensive apps. Police have said that the two were part of Twitter group, Tradmahasabha, where, in January 2020, a plan to defame Muslim women was hatched. Thakur joined the group using one of his handles @gangescion. Bishnoi too was in the group . Bishnoi copied the codes of the Thakur’s Github app to build his own version of the app and called it Bulli deals.On January 9, when Thakur was brought to the ISFO headquarters in Delhi, after being arrested in Indore, it was the first time that he met Bishnoi in person.

The scheme, launched in 2016 to reduce the dependency of rural households on polluting and low-cost fuel sources, not only changed the indoor air pollution landscape in rural India but also catalysed a larger social movement towards women’s empowerment.
31-01-2022||Today's||To tackle air pollution, devise concrete, measurable time-bound targets||Dear Mrs Sitharaman,We don’t need any more studies to underline the importance of clean air for a healthy population or to show that there is a positive correlation between polluted air and negative GDP growth. Recent studies in the United States have also linked high Covid-19 mortality rates to areas where population was exposed to higher particulate matter. India which has the dubious distinction of having 21 out of 30 most polluted cities in the world, we are still not serious about solving air crisis. The National Clean Air Program (NCAP), the only centrally funded scheme that deals with air pollution, is badly formulated and grossly underfunded. After much delay, disbursement of funds started in November 2020. 231 cities with poor air quality, including Delhi, were left out and some of the smaller cities such as Shillong received ₹20 lakh, which is not even enough to buy one air quality monitor. The war against pollution will need be led by the central government because air pollution does not recognise administrative boundaries. Take the case of Delhi. A recent study by the Centre for Science and Environment highlighted that Delhi’s internal contribution to pollution is 31% to the existing PM2.5 levels, the rest originated from the National Capital Region and surrounding areas. Every time Delhi takes stringent measures such as shutting polluting industries and power plants, higher tax for diesel vehicles, the city government loses revenue. However, the air does not get any cleaner because the industries move to neighbouring cities/states and continue to pollute Delhi’s airshed. With Gurgaon, Ghaziabad and Faridabad featuring among the most polluted cities of India, the inaction by governments of NCR districts and Commission for Air Quality Management’s (CAQM) inefficiency in ensuring that states are bound to specific time-bound targets, has nullified Delhi government’s efforts in addressing air quality levels in Delhi and providing its citizens with a better measure of life.Similarly, although industrial pollution within Delhi has gone down from 16% in 2016 to 2.5% in 2019 as a result of measures taken by the Delhi government to either shut down or encourage adoption of cleaner fuels, just a few kilometers from Delhi’s border, industrial clusters in Faridabad, Narela, Sahibabad consisting of most polluting smelters, and tanneries continue to operate with limited regulations resulting in toxic emissions. A regional approach where states only look at air quality within their administrative boundaries is bound to fail, while adopting an airshed approach will go a long way in helping improve air quality levels for the NCR region.We need to take a regional airshed approach, further elaborating the NCR example - a body like CAQM would need to formulate a 10-year plan for the NCR area. This plan should have specific annual targets for each of the cities in the airshed. For example, if Delhi were to reduce its particulate matter by XX micro grams in a year, then Delhi would get additional funds of XX crore. At the same time, if Delhi misses the target, then Delhi would be penalized by XX crore. Unless we have concrete, measurable time-bound targets, we will continue to ruin the lungs of our children. The much-acclaimed China model for pollution mitigation was successful due to region-wise emission-reduction targets evolved for its most polluted regions, where each city was given long and short-term targets to reduce particulate matter concentrations, with best performing cities rewarded with additional budgetary allocations. This is no different than the concept of social bonds as a financial tool that is being used world over to address or mitigate a specific social issue and seek to achieve positive social outcomes.Economic incentives tied to pollution-based targets would allow for both an efficient allocation of NCAP funds for cities where there are active air quality policy implementations and would also additionally incentivise states to reach such targets in a time-bound manner.We should give up our dream of double digit GDP growth or of becoming a superpower if a large percentage of our future generations are growing up in areas with toxic air.Reena Gupta is an adviser with the Delhi governmentThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/to-tackle-air-pollution-devise-concrete-measurable-time-bound-targets-101643634509364.html

31-01-2022||Editorials||Economic survey: What it reveals||Over the years, the economic survey has grown into a slightly self-indulgent exercise, sometimes airing radical ideas that are unlikely to ever be adopted. It has also, perhaps as a result, become unwieldy, spanning two volumes. There’s good news on both fronts in the economic survey for 2021-22, which gives the radical ideas a miss, and restricts itself to one volume. Its core message on the state of the economy is what has been evident in the macro numbers and high-frequency indicators for some time — and something that has also been borne out in projections for the Indian economy from multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This is simply that the Indian economy has put behind it the effects of the pandemic, and that it will grow by 8-8.5% in 2022-23. That number is conservative when compared to IMF’s projection of 9%, but coming on the back of this year’s 9.2% (as reaffirmed by the survey; IMF’s is 9% again), it means that India will continue to remain the fastest-growing major economy in the world.

The leadership under Min Aung Hlaing, head of Myanmar’s military, since has given no sign that it will ease its grip on power, despite earning international opprobrium. Under the military’s extension of emergency, a return to any form of democracy — even the hybrid variety seen during the uneasy sharing of power between Aung San Suu Kyi and the junta — is unlikely before 2023. In the meantime, the military has brutally crushed popular protests, even as Myanmar was ravaged by Covid-19 and the people grappled with soaring inflation and rising food prices. Western threats of sanctions have not moved the junta and the attempt by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to mediate has run aground .
