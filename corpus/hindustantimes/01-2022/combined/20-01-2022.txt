The two women candidates are long-time party workers and, with the latest announcement, the Congress has given all five seats in Ghaziabad to long-time party loyalists and workers. Sangeeta Tyagi, wife of late Congress leader and spokesperson Rajiv Tyagi, who died in August 2020 following a cardiac arrest, will contest from Sahibabad, the party said. The Modinagar ticket was given to Neeraj Kumari Prajapati, a Congress worker for the past several decades. Vouching her candidacy, senior Congress leaders said Prajapati has been a dedicated grassroots level worker of the party for decades. “She is a simple woman who has been associated with the party for years now and is dedicated to the party. Sangeeta Tyagi is a science teacher at a private school in Ghaziabad and she is the wife of late party spokesperson Rajiv Tyagi. The family has been Congress loyalists and workers for long,” said Dolly Sharma, member of All India Congress Committee and spokesperson of UP Congress Committee. She said the two tickets went to women candidates, as promised by Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who had said that 40% tickets this election will be given to women. “Our leader (Priyanka) has also given the slogan, “ladki hu, lad sakti hu (I am a woman, I can fight)”, and she has urged women to come forward and fight for their rights. Whether we win or lose, the idea is to contest and the party has given a platform to women. In the past couple of days, we received a number of resumes from people of other parties as well and they wanted to contest on a Congress ticket. But the party has decided to give tickets only to party workers and loyalists. There was a delay in declaring the names but our candidates and workers will put all their energy into campaigning now,” Sharma said. She said Arvind Sharma will contest from the Dhaulana seat, a part of which falls in Ghaziabad district. “I will file my nomination on Friday and will connect to people virtually and also through door-to-door campaigns as directed by the Election Commission. I will raise local issues which include the need for better educational facilities, health-care facilities and the problems that people faced during the pandemic,” Tyagi said. The Congress has never won from Sahibabad constituency and this time, Tyagi will take on heavyweights Sunil Sharma of the BJP and Amarpal Sharma of the Samajwadi Party, besides others. The Congress party earlier gave tickets to district president Bijender Yadav from Muradnagar, district president (minority wing) Yameen Malik from Loni, and Sushant Goyal, son of late Congress MP Surendra Prakash Goyal , from Ghaziabad. Like the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party has also fielded a woman from Sahibabad, Chhavi Tyagi. The Bharatiya Janata Party has retained its sitting MLA, Dr Manju Shivach, in Modinagar. The Bahujan Samaj Party has fielded Poonam Garg from Modinagar. The last date for filing of nominations is on Friday and voting under the first phase of elections will be held on February 10. Experts said the Congress is banking heavily on its workers and loyalists and this will benefit the party in the long run. “The decision to offer tickets to party workers and loyalists will benefit the Congress in the long run and it will also reassure the party cadre. The organisational setup of any party will get a boost if workers get to rise up within the party,” said KK Sharma, associate professor (history), MM College, Modinagar.

Currently, there are 7,446 active cases in the district, of whom 78 patients are taking treatment in hospitals.According to official records of the district health department, three Covid fatalities have been reported in the past one week. The first death during the current wave was reported on January 15, six months after the last fatality was reported on June 18 last year during the second wave. Of the two deaths which came to the fore on Thursday, one was of a 79-year-old man from Kavi Nagar, who was suffering from bronchogenic carcinoma-- a sub-type of lung cancer-- and died at a private hospital in Ghaziabad on January 17. The other deceased was identified as a 31-year-old man from Adhyatmik Nagar, who was suffering from chronic pulmonary tuberculosis and tested positive for Covid. He died at Santosh Medical College, an L-3 Covid facility treating critical patients, on January 18. Officials said that both the patients were vaccinated and the deaths were the result of comorbid conditions coupled with the Covid infection. Meanwhile, 10,286 samples were collected on Thursday and a total of 2,346 patients were also marked as discharged from home isolation. “Following a day of lower testing, we increased the number of tests conducted in a day. The fresh cases seem to have stabilised now and in the coming days, there maybe a decline in the daily cases. People having comorbid conditions are at a high risk of developing complications if they get infected. So, we are also going ahead with the door-to-door survey to find out beneficiaries who have been left out of the vaccination programme,” said Dr Sunil Tyagi, additional chief medical officer. “In case our teams find anyone un-vaccinated, they will administer the vaccine at home,” he added. Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, the chief medical officer did not respond to calls despite repeated attempts. Experts said cases seem to have stabilised after reaching the peak. “The trend indicates that the cases have reached a peak and will be stable for some days before declining. People, mostly senior citizens, who have not taken the vaccine are at a high risk. Even those who have multiple comorbidities and are fully vaccinated may also be at some risk as the Covid infection may complicate their medical conditions. So, it is vital that all precautions are taken and those who have still not taken the vaccine get the jab on a priority basis,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter).

However, confusion prevailed over the SP-RLD candidate from Mant assembly seat in Mathura. Yogesh Nauwahar, the runner up of 2017 assembly elections had already filed nomination as SP-RLD candidate but when Sanjay Lathar, former MLA and confidant of SP president Akhilesh Yadav, filed his papers on Thursday, there was an impasse because Yogesh Nauwahar from RLD appeared adamant on contesting the election.

He broke into tears at a press conference and later joined the BSP and was declared candidate from Mathura Vrindavan assembly seat.

20-01-2022||Lucknow||Priyanka keeps promise, fields Valmiki from Agra Cantt||AGRA At the fag end of the nomination process, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra kept her promise and gave ticket to a member of the Valmiki community from the reserved seat of Agra Cantt on Thursday. Heads of Valmiki community welcomed the step but said that the candidate selected was not of their choice. On Thursday, the Congress declared candidates from the two remaining assembly seats in Agra district which has nine assembly seats. Sikandar Valmiki is the Congress candidate from Agra Cantt reserved seat while Hemant Chahar is the candidate from the Jat-dominated Fatehpur Sikri seat. Congress leaders in Agra claimed that party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi kept her word to Valmikis when she met community heads in Agra on December 29. “After what happened with Arun Valmiki (who died in police custody in Agra) and with the girl from Hathras, I was wondering what could be done so that the community could fight its own battle against such atrocities,” Priyanka Gandhi had said after the meeting. “I want that the message should be communicated that the Valmiki community can fight its battle and can stand on its own. Therefore, I asked heads of the community to suggest a name of someone from the community who could contest on Congress ticket in the assembly elections,” Gandhi had said and in compliance, a few names were suggested by heads of Valmiki community in Agra but the name declared on Thursday was not among those suggested. However, team Priyanka found it appropriate. “At least Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has kept her promise and given ticket to a member of Valmiki community. He might not be the one suggested by us but any way, Valmiki community has found representation,” said Man Singh who is ‘Takht Chaudhary’ (head) and president of Valmiki Mahapanchayat in Agra. “Of the nine assembly seats in Agra, BJP has not given ticket to any Valmiki but to two from Jatav community who in fact vote for the BSP and not the BJP, unlike the Valmikis who had been supporting the BJP,” lamented Man Singh who feels that even the Congress had neglected Valmiki community after independence when the party dominated the political scene. Jhalloram Valmiki, founder convenor of Valmiki Mahapanchayat also admitted that the Congress leader kept her word. He, however, felt ‘betrayed’ because names suggested by them were not entertained. Nand Kishore Valmiki, a prominent Valmiki leader and ‘prantiya sanyojak’(regional convenor) of ‘Dharam Jagran Samanvaya’, a right wing organization, downplayed the ‘words kept by Priyanka Gandhi” and asked as to why Congress was not giving ticket to Valmikis on seats where it could win. The Valmikis had been more inclined towards the BJP in Agra city where they constitute 40% of dalits – second only to the Jatavs who are believed to be 60% of dalits in Agra (also known as the dalit capital because of their widespread employment in the age-old footwear business of Agra). There are about 1.5 lakh voters from the Valmiki community in Agra. The Valmiki community has a say in all three assembly seats of Agra city besides rural Agra. They are in decisive numbers (50,000 voters) in Agra South and have an impact in Agra North with a strength of 20,000 voters and Agra Cantt (15,000 voters). In rural Agra, there are 20,000 Valmiki voters. Aligarh district also has a sizeable number of Valmiki voters –more in percentage than the Jatavs and have a similar hold in Hathras where rape and murder of a Valmiki girl became a major issue.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had given the deadline till January 2022 for completing the roads works but failed to do so and now the deadline is extended to February 15.Members of the Nationalist Congress Party(NCP), on Thursday, agitated at Shivaji road under the leadership of MP Vandana Chavan and blamed BJP for the poor state of roads in peth areas mainly Shivaji road, Bajirao road, Tilak road and other roads.PMC has dug up these roads for laying the water pipelines under 24x7 water project and even carrying out the drainage works.Recently, Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar and all the department heads visited these roads at the request of standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne.As the roads are dug up it is creating various problems for commuters.When the municipal commissioner visited the sites, earlier they promised to clear the road works by December last year. Later the standing committee chairman promised to complete work by January and now the deadline is extended to February 15.NCP leaders blamed the ruling party and municipal administration for poor management.“Despite having decided that the contractor would do these works from the component of the 24x7 project, PMC is doing it from its budget,” said NCP leaders.Shiv Sena too held an agitation on Wednesday for the same issue.

20-01-2022||Mumbai||BJP wins Bhandara, Gondia district councils, nagar panchayat tally rises to 419||MUMBAI Improving its tally from the results declared on Wednesday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) registered an impressive victory in the Bhandara and Gondia district councils and nine nagar panchayats in Gadchiroli whose results were declared on Thursday. BJP won the Gondia district council and bagged 419 out of 1,802 nagar panchayat seats (the highest) in the election held in two phases in December and January. The three ruling parties – Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress – collectively won 1,021 seats in these local body polls. The nagar panchayats govern smaller towns in semi-urban areas.The state election commission (SEC) declared results for 153 seats in nine nagar panchayats in Gadchiroli, 105 seats in the Bhandara and Gondia district councils, and 210 seats in the panchayat samitis in these two districts on Thursday. The SEC had declared the results for 1,638 seats in 97 nagar panchayats on Wednesday. The polls for the 1,802 seats in 106 nagar panchayats, 105 seats in the two district councils, and 210 seats in 15 panchayat samitis were held in two phases on December 21 and January 19 this year.The BJP won 26 out of 53 seats in the Gondia district council (highest) paving the way to form the body on its own. In the 2016 election, the party had won 17 seats, while NCP and Congress had bagged 20 and 16 seats, each. The NCP and Congress jointly ruled the body for two-and-a-half years, but the split between the two parties led to the NCP joining hands with the BJP. The two parties jointly ruled the body for the remaining term. In adjoining Bhandara, the Congress improved its tally by winning 21 seats against the outgoing 19 seats. It might form the body with the help of its ally NCP, which bagged 13 seats.NCP’s defeat in Gondia is seen as a setback for senior party leader and Rajya Sabha MP Praful Patel. “Had the Congress and NCP fought together, they could have retained the council. But the rift between the leaders from the two parties over the last few years has played in BJP’s favour,” said a NCP leader on condition of anonymity.Of the 210 panchayat samiti seats in the two districts, BJP won 93, NCP bagged 36, while Congress and Shiv Sena won 53 and 5, respectively.Madhav Bhandari, Maharashtra BJP vice-president, said that the discontent against the three parties for their failure, including that of safeguarding the Maratha and OBC reservation, has reflected in the results. “These are sort of general elections as they were held in 31 districts across the state. It is a true reflection of the people’s mindset. We have been able to improve our performance despite being in the opposition. We will improve our performance, by retaining the existing bodies, in the forthcoming local body elections,” he said.However, Nationalist Congress Party leader and state minister Nawab Malik said that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi partners have bagged nearly 755 seats. “Eighty per cent of the voters have voted against the BJP despite which they have been claiming to have won most seats in the nagar panchayat elections. NCP will form bodies in at least 27 nagar panchayats on its own,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-wins-bhandara-gondia-district-councils-nagar-panchayat-tally-rises-to-419-101642701092987.html

As per the new rates, fare for first 1.5 km would be ₹21 and ₹13 for every kilometres thereafter. Of the total around 72,000 registered autos in Pune, only 36,993 auto meter calibration has been completed by the Pune RTO till date. At least 4,420 autos failed RTO meter calibration test. With January 31 as the deadline for meter calibration and many autorickshaws plying without updated meter, passengers from several areas around the city complain of overcharging. “Yesterday, I travelled from Katraj to Dhayari through the bypass highway and the auto driver charged ₹150. When asked about the high fare, he told that it is the new rate and the meter is not yet calibrated to new fares. This has happened to me for the second time and citing ‘faulty meter’ reason, auto drivers charge extra,” said Poonam Shinde, a passenger. The revised fares for three-seater autorickshaws came into effect from November 22 onwards in Baramati as well besides Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. The decision by RTA was taken on the recommendations given by the Khatua committee report as auto unions were also demanding fare hike. “Since December 4 last year, RTO inspectors have been appointed for auto meter calibration checking on seven days and weekends to facilitate autorickshaw drivers to calibrate meters before the deadline. Action will be taken against those overcharging passengers if we get a complaint,” said Sanjeev Bhor, Pune regional transport officer.

However, the decision whether the Congress will contest alone in Mumbai or in an alliance with the MVA will be taken by the party high command.“Patole has denied this and said that he intended it for some local goonda (and not for the Prime Minister)… there is no need to prolong the controversy,” Patil told Hindustan Times while referring to Patole’s comments. Patil said that since taking charge early last year, Patole has been working actively for the party. Though some of his statements have turned out controversial, Patole has taken immediate corrective action, Patil averred.Earlier this week, Patole was captured on camera at Lakhni in Bhandara district saying, “I can beat Modi, I can abuse him.” Though Patole later claimed he was referring to a local goon who was the Prime Minister’s namesake, the BJP launched protests seeking his arrest.Patil said that while the national leadership of the Congress would take a position regarding the Lok Sabha and state assembly elections, the decision about contesting alone or in an alliance with MVA partners in the local body elections would be left to the state and district units.“The Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) and the District Congress Committees (DCC) will take a proper decision in consultation with the higher-ups for the other elections. (The MVA) will not come in the way, we have authorised the local units… but for Mumbai, that decision will have to be taken by a strategy committee constituted by the All India Congress Committee (AICC),” Patil noted.Senior Congress leaders in Mumbai have admitted that they are in a catch-22 situation of sorts when it comes to strategy in Mumbai. The Congress has seen its social and political base gradually eroded in Mumbai and fighting alone may further expose this drift.On the other hand, an alliance with the Shiv Sena and NCP will send across a strong message on opposition unity against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but will also mean conceding more space to allies leading to discontent among the ranks. Newer players on the block like the All India Majlis E Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) will also attack the party for joining hands with the ‘communal’ Shiv Sena. “We are in a trap,” explained a senior Congress leader.Bhai Jagtap, president of the Mumbai Regional Congress Committee (MRCC) has however said that the Congress must contest alone in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-defends-state-unit-chief-patole-over-modi-remarks-101642700971757.html

20-01-2022||Mumbai||ICU, ventilator occupancy rise, hospitalisations fall in 10-day period||Mumbai: Mumbai’s Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and ventilator bed occupancy has gone up in the past 10 days, even as the city’s overall Covid-19 hospitalisations have recorded a dip. The ongoing third wave, driven by the Omicron variant, started in the last week of December, and it is already receding in Mumbai. But the city experienced very high daily cases, with the peak touching 20971 on January 7. Over the past four days, the daily cases have been hovering around 6,000. On January 11, the city had 876 Covid patients in Intensive Care Units and 526 on ventilator support in city hospitals, according to the data collated by the Brihanmumbai Corporation (BMC). On that day, the total ICU beds were 2,728 and ventilator beds were 1,541; the occupancy was 32% and 34%, respectively. On January 20, the number of patients on ICU and ventilator beds was 989 and 584, respectively. The total number of ICU beds on Thursday were 3114, and ventilator beds were 1512 (these are dynamic numbers, as the civic body has the capacity to expand the number of hospital beds); the occupancy was thus 32% and 38%, respectively.Interestingly, the overall hospitalization numbers dropped from 7,283 to 4,857, even as the total hospital beds in the city went up from 22,445 on January 11 to 23,911 on January 20.“There is always a lag of a few weeks between regular hospitalisations and ICU and ventilator admissions,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the Covid-19 task force of Maharashtra. “Those who progress to severe disease require intensive care a few weeks later. Thus, ICU and ventilator admissions are more likely to rise a few days after the peak has passed,” he said.Trends as expectedAccording to Joshi, the city’s current intensive care occupancy is largely among the unvaccinated, senior citizens, people with serious co-morbidities and those who are vaccinated but have failed to mount a good immune response. “While Omicron is the predominant strain in the city, the Delta strain also continues to be in circulation. Doctors are seeing some patients with lung involvements which indicates that the Delta strain is very much there,” he said. The city has recorded an average of six Covid deaths every day this month. With the rise in ICU and ventilator occupancy, an uptick in fatalities is expected. “The deaths are likely to go up in the next few days, as serious patients are increasing,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. “However, a large majority of patients have been in home isolation during this wave, and a smaller number has required hospitalisation, compared to the previous waves,” he said, adding that ward war rooms and doctors have been advised to get people to seek medical advice and early hospitalisation to reduce the fatalities. “People who have co-morbid conditions and age-related risk factors should seek timely medical intervention,” he said. Physician Dr Hemant Gupta said that the ICU admissions have not increased at an alarming rate. “A section of patients with serious underlying ailments and those who are unvaccinated are landing up in the ICU,” said Gupta who consults patients at the state-run St George Hospital. He said that the hospital’s 25-bed ICU facility was fully occupied on Thursday, but only 10 patients were on non-invasive ventilator support. “None of the patients was on mechanical ventilator support that requires intubation,” he said, adding that all ICU patients were stable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/icu-ventilator-occupancy-rise-hospitalisations-fall-in-10-day-period-101642700791842.html

20-01-2022||Pune||Schools unlikely to reopen in Pune on Jan 24||Pune: After the state government gave its nod to reopen schools from January 24, Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol said that the civic administration will not rush into any decision. He cited the increasing number of Covid cases as a matter of concern saying before taking the final call, all stakeholders will be consulted. According to Mohol, a final decision will be taken in the weekly Covid review meet scheduled to be held on Saturday. Though the state government has decided to reopen schools, including pre-primary classes, from Monday, education Minister Varsha Gaikwad said that the government has given the powers to local bodies to take a final decision depending upon the Covid-19 situation in the respective areas. “In Pune, Covid cases have been increasing since last 8-10 days. The number of patients is increasing. I spoke to some paediatricians and they have advised caution for Classes 1-10 as infected kids are showing symptoms such as fever. In this wave around 3,000 kids have been infected and 100 are hospitalised. After considering all these factors, we are unsure whether to immediately reopen schools or not,” said Mohol. According to the mayor, on Saturday, there will be a review meeting in the presence of Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar. “The decision will be taken in that meeting. Before taking any decision, we will discuss the matter with students, parents’ associations and doctors from the task force. increasing caseload in the city is a matter of concern. Our priority will be the health of kids,” he said. The offline classes in schools and colleges had resumed in December as the Covid cases were dropping. However, with a surge in Covid infections in January, the state government had decided to stop offline classes. The Covid situation is varying across the state. “My 12-year-old son suffers from high fever and cough. His Covid test result was negative. The doctor said that it could be some other viral infection. Most of the kids from his group have had such symptoms. Even if schools reopen, he cannot go to school immediately until he recovers. I think it is best to take precautions before rushing into anything,” said Deepali Hatekar, a resident of Kothrud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/schools-unlikely-to-reopen-in-pune-on-jan-24-101642700431981.html
20-01-2022||Mumbai||Omicron variant can turn serious, experts say||Mumbai: City doctors have started encountering cases of Omicron in the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and HT has learnt of at least three cases, including the death of an unvaccinated senior citizen, wherein doctors corroborated the presence of Omicron variant through the S-gene target failure test. Medical experts said that co-morbid conditions dictate how the viral infection manifests. Uncontrolled and unmonitored diseases, active cancer therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy, HIV, active steroid treatment and immunosuppressive treatments pose a greater risk of severe Covid-19. In addition, unvaccinated patients or patients who fail to mount their immune response despite vaccination also face a higher risk of getting a severe disease. To be sure, the number of deaths reported daily by the Brihanmumbai Corporation (BMC) in the past seven days has hovered between six (January 13) and 12 (January 20). In absolute numbers, this is far less than the peak of the second wave, when the average daily deaths reported was 52 in the months of April and May 2021. Epidemiologists said that severe manifestation of the Covid-19 disease — irrespective of which wave, or variant — affects a section of the population that has co-morbidities, insufficient immunity, and/or is unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. However, experts pointed out that Omicron, which is known to largely affect the upper respiratory tract and thus produce milder symptoms compared to the Delta or Delta plus variant that caused damage to the lungs, can still cause severe disease, and in some instances, death.“The Omicron variant can trigger complications depending on the co-morbid condition of the patient,” said Dr Sanjith Saseedharan, head of critical care at the SL Raheja Hospital in Mahim who has encountered two such cases including one death. In both cases, the patients underwent an RT-PCR test which used specific kits to look for the S-gene deletion —while genome sequencing is considered to be the gold standard for identifying variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus, the S-gene target failure is an indirect way to detect the Omicron variant. In the first case, Saseedharan said, a 70-year-old unvaccinated man from Kandivli facing severe breathlessness visited the hospital in the last week of December with a Covid-19 positive report. Medical investigations revealed that he had developed viral myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle triggered by the viral infection. The patient had an existing heart ailment — his heart’s pumping ability was barely 15% of a normal heart. This co-morbidity in addition to his age and unvaccinated status made him vulnerable, the doctor said.“His condition deteriorated rapidly and we had to put him on a ventilator, but he eventually developed a severe pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs) and succumbed three days later,” he said. In another case, Saseedharan said, a 71-year-old fully vaccinated man with multiple co-morbidities including a history of stroke, poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension and asthma, spent 12 days in the hospital including six in the ICU. He developed a fever in the first week of January, and underwent an RT-PCR test, which was positive and indicated the Omicron variant. The man’s family members who also had Covid recovered within four days. “Viral infections can trigger asthma exacerbation. We gave him remdesivir, steroids and anticoagulants and he had to be put on non-invasive ventilator support,” he said adding that the patient recovered gradually. Critical care specialist Dr Kedar Toraskar from Wockhardt Hospital said that a 60-year-old fully vaccinated man with a history of hypertension is currently in the ICU with Covid-19 pneumonia and on oxygen support. His test carried out at the hospital showed the S gene deletion. “He has been in the ICU for five days due to severe breathing issues, but he is now recovering,” said Toraskar. “In a group of patients with severe risk factors, close monitoring is important when it comes to Covid-19. Most importantly, we must not ignore the disease by labelling it as mild,” said Toraskar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/omicron-variant-can-turn-serious-experts-say-101642700373263.html

20-01-2022||Pune||330,797 vehicles ‘bypass’ Pune-Mumbai Expressway toll tax; RTI activist demands probe||Pune: The statistics related to toll tax published by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) on its website has revealed that 330,797 vehicles did not pay the mandatory toll tax on Pune-Mumbai Expressway in December 2021. Right to Information (RTI) activist Vivek Velankar in 2016 had complained to the RTI chief seeking publication of toll earning figures and vehicles paying at the toll booths of Pune-Mumbai Expressway on the official website on a regular basis. Following the complaint, the authorities have been regularly updating the website and releasing earnings and vehicle data on their website. According to the official data, 330,979 vehicles did not pay toll tax on the expressway and the same has been attributed in the category of exempt and violators for December 2021. However, how many of them came under ‘exempt‘ and ‘violated the rule‘ categories have not been clearly stated in the chart. “The information regarding the exempt and violators category has been deliberately suppressed. At the most, police, army, MLAs, MLCs, parliamentarians and ministers are exempted from paying toll tax. It is indeed surprising that the heavy vehicles and multi-axle vehicles are being shown as violators when these vehicles most of the time travel at a very slow speed on the highway. Also, the clear demarcation or categorisation of violator and exempt vehicle has not been done which raises suspicion. The authorities need to come clean on this pertinent issue of exemption and violation as citizens are paying toll tax and the entire process demands accountability,” Velankar claimed. He said that an average of 10,000 vehicles were not paying toll as per the information given by the MSRDC authorities on the website and demanded a probe. Velankar had earlier approached the Bombay High Court through a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking an end to toll tax collection on Pune-Mumbai Expressway. The PIL claimed that the toll collected post August 19, 2019, by the company should be declared as “illegal”. Rajesh Patil, superintending engineer, MSRDC recharge for Pune-Mumbai Expressway, could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts. Messages to his mobile phone number went unanswered.

20-01-2022||Pune||Covid positivity rate at 35%, hospital cases show gradual rise in Pune||Pune: Rise in active Covid cases has also seen more home isolations and hospitalisations since January 1. On January 1, in Pune district hospital isolations stood at 692 which increased to 2,330 whereas home isolations at 2,662 touched 70,768 till January 19. As many patients with mild or no symptoms are advised home quarantine, there is a gradual rise in hospitalisation in the district, according to health officials. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant chief, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health department, said that even though there is a rise in hospitalisations, 95 per cent Covid positive cases are still in home isolation. “All government and private hospitals have vacant Covid beds as of now. In PMC-run Naidu hospital, there are 120 beds vacant and 100 beds are unoccupied in Baner facility. More than 60 per cent beds are vacant in private hospitals. We will acquire more beds if the need arises, but vacant beds are available now. In fact, we have reopened just one Covid care centre (CCC) with 250 beds and have received only 15 admissions,” said Dr Wavare. Along with hospitalisation, the case fatality rate (CFR) on January 18 for Pune city limits was 1.82. The figure was 1.87 on January 12 and 1.90 on December 23, according to the district health department. There has been a gradual rise in weekly positivity rate in the district as well. On December 25, the weekly positivity rate was 2.5. On January 10, it increased to 22.8 and on January 17 it touched 34.2. Dr Kapil Zirpe, member, Pune Covid-19 task force and head of the neurotrauma unit at Ruby Hall Clinic, said that in this wave, the fatalities are less and so are admissions. “Those who require hospital admission are for management for other diseases or comorbidities rather than Covid. Many patients from outside Pune are showing delta variant. However, there is no load on hospitals as of now,” said Dr Zirpe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-positivity-rate-at-35-hospital-cases-show-gradual-rise-in-pune-101642700011745.html

So, students are demanding the university to issue a circular just like last year instructing colleges to inward exam forms.“I am a second-year commerce student and I am unable to pay half of the fee, so my exam form is not yet forwarded by the college. They are saying to pay the full fees and these instructions have been given to all the students in our college,” said Siddharth Chalke, a student.There are several such students from various colleges, who have not yet paid the college fees, and so their exam forms are not been forwarded by the college administration.Whereas now the SPPU examination department has given a deadline till January 25 to all its affiliated colleges from Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar district to inward all the filled-up forms.There are around 6.15 lakh students from various streams who will appear for the exams from more than 350 affiliated colleges to SPPU from Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar districts. With 284 courses in post-graduate and undergraduate, there are 6,862 subjects. While for 1,600 subjects there are two mediums of appearing for the exams with English and Marathi.“We are daily getting many complaints from students about the issue. Students and their families are already suffering through the pandemic, many students come from rural areas and somehow manage to stay in Pune. So, university should immediately interfere in the matter and issue a circular to all the colleges like last year instructing to inward all the exam forms on priority,” said Kamlakar Shete a student and vice-president of Yuvak Kranti Dal, Pune division.“We are regularly taking the review of exam forms by the colleges and no one should stop the forms due to non-payment of college fees. The students and their colleges should properly inward the examination forms to the university as we can carry out the further process early and declare the exam schedule,” said Mahesh Kakade, SPPU examination and evaluation department head.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-demand-sppu-to-interfere-in-exam-form-issue-101642699951565.html
20-01-2022||Mumbai||BMC finalises ward boundaries for 236 seats, elections by March end||Mumbai: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday said that it has finalised the demarcation for 236 electoral wards in the city. A senior BMC official said that they plan to increase three seats across the city in eastern and western suburbs, followed by the island city. The revised ward demarcation will be submitted by Friday. BMC also said the polls are likely to be held by the March end.“The term of the current elected corporators will get over by March 7. Hence, in this case, we have to take a call whether an administrator will have to be appointed for the time being or not,” informed a senior BMC official.The state cabinet, in November 2021, had cleared a proposal to increase the strength of the Mumbai civic body from 227 to 236 members. Following the decision, the urban development department amended the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, to change the composition of the corporation. The state government said that the move was necessary owing to the growth in the city’s population in the past two decades.According to the procedure, once the BMC submits the list of 236 seats to the state election commission, it will scrutinise the proposal and call for suggestions and objections from the general public. Post this, the BMC will conduct a lottery for deciding the reservation status of the administrative wards.Further, owing to COVID-19, in the current upcoming polls, the BMC is also going to increase polling booths from the current 8,500 booths to around 11,000 polling booths.Currently, in the civic house of 227 seats, the Shiv Sena has 97 seats while the Bharatiya Janata Party has 83, Congress 29, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) 8, Samajwadi Party (SP) six seats, All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen two seats and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has one.Meanwhile, earlier the Bombay high court (HC) dismissed a plea filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporators opposing the increase of the number of wards. With nine new wards boundaries of wards will change. BJP had alleged that the move is against the norms as the criteria for increasing the wards is population increase in the constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-finalises-ward-boundaries-for-236-seats-elections-by-march-end-101642699771964.html

20-01-2022||Mumbai||At 46,197, Maharashtra reports slightly higher cases||Mumbai Maharashtra registered 46,197 cases, a marginal rise from 43,697 on Wednesday. However, the number of deaths fell from 49 to 37. Meanwhile, calling on people to overcome vaccine hesitancy and get themselves inoculated against Covid, public health minister Rajesh Tope denied that the number of tests had declined reflecting a fall in positivity numbers.“We have not reduced testing, nor do we have any plans to do so,” said Tope. Maharashtra’s capacity to conduct RT-PCR tests was around 2,00,000 daily, and this was being utilised. Instructions had also been given to increase the number of Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT). People who showed symptoms of Covid purchased RAT self-test kits from chemists and reported themselves to the local authorities in case they tested positive.The positivity in Maharashtra was around 23 per cent, with districts like Nashik, Raigad, Pune and Nanded having a higher rate of positivity. “The numbers have not declined drastically,” he noted, adding that however, despite the higher positivity in some areas, just around four to five per cent of ICU, ventilator, oxygen and isolation beds had been occupied. Around 87 per cent of patients had home quarantined themselves and were being given symptomatic treatment.The health minister said that while the first dose coverage was around 90 per cent, around 70 to 80 lakh people were yet to take this first dose. The second dose coverage was 60 per cent, and these numbers of people who had been vaccinated fully needed to be boosted. Tope noted that some people who were due for their second dose of the vaccine had not come forth to get it. Almost 50 per cent of the over 60 lakh beneficiaries in the 15 to 18 years age group have been vaccinated for Covid.Tope said that the kin of around 1 lakh patients who had lost their lives to Covid had been given an ex-gratia of ₹50,000. The state has seen over 1.41 lakh deaths due to the virus.On Thursday, Pune city topped the Covid caseload with 7,252 cases, followed by Mumbai with 5,708 cases, Pimpri Chinchwad at 3,889 and Nagpur city at 3,203. Pune district (2,972) and cities like Nashik (1,799), Navi Mumbai (1,300) also have a heavy daily caseload.On Thursday, 125 patients with the Omicron variant were reported in Maharashtra, and all of them were from Pune. So far, a total of 2,199 patients infected with Omicron have been reported, and out of these, 1,144 cases have been discharged following a negative RTPCR test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-46-197-maharashtra-reports-slightly-higher-cases-101642699116586.html
20-01-2022||Lucknow||Mexican beetles, an effective way to control carrot grass, says BHU prof||Mexican beetles may effectively control carrot grass, the weed which causes allergy, eczema, redness of skin and asthma in humans as they eat this grass very fast, says Prof Bhupendra Kumar, Department of Zoology, BHU.Led by Prof Kumar, a team of scientists, including research scholar Priya Patel, Arvind Kumar, and Priyanka Yadav, is working on how to control the natural growth of this grass by its natural enemy ‘Mexican beetles’, which work like biocontrol agent in this case.Kumar says Mexican beetles were imported from Mexico in 1984 to control this grass as the weed which travelled from Mexico to India via the USA in the fifties. At present, this grass is found in abundance across India. It grows along the roads as well as on farms. As soon as anyone touches any part of the plant, the toxin Sesquiterpene lactones found in the entire plant causes allergy, asthma, redness of skin in humans. Also, it is not good for livestock and soil. It makes soil barren or infertile.Prof Kumar says this beetle has a long diapause period of about six months, while the grass keeps growing throughout the year.“We are working to reduce the diapause period of these Mexican beetles so that they can remain active throughout the year and keep consuming the grass,” says Prof Kumar.“We are trying to find the molecular pathways, which is responsible for a longer period of diapause in the beetle. Our research is going in the right direction, and we are quite hopeful that we will be able to decrease the diapause period by targeting the physiological pathways in these beetles in near future,” says Prof Kumar. He adds that controlling this weed is the need of the hour as it is growing fast with global warming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mexican-beetles-an-effective-way-to-control-carrot-grass-says-bhu-prof-101642698211886.html

The government reneged on all promises made to each and every section of society. The poor and members of the scheduled castes were deprived of the social welfare schemes being pruned and even closed altogether,” she claimed. Lashing out at Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, she claimed that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener was trying to befool Punjabis with political gimmickry. “It seems that after selling tickets for all constituencies in the state, he has also sold the post of the party’s CM face by indulging in a sham phony survey,” said the leader.She also asked AAP’s chief ministerial nominee Bhagwant Mann to clarify his stand on the river water sharing issue of Punjab with Haryana and Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/channis-kin-minted-crores-through-illegal-sand-mining-alleges-harsimrat-101642693891350.html
20-01-2022||Lucknow||SP may field Brahmin candidate against Yogi||LUCKNOW The Samajwadi Party (SP) may field a Brahmin candidate against chief minister Yogi Adityanath on his home turf – Gorakhpur Sadar seat. It could be Subhavati Shukla, wife of late Upendra Dutt Shukla, who was BJP’s state vice-president. If her candidature goes through, it could corner Yogi Adityanath on his home turf when Bhim Army chief Chandrashekar Azad has announced to contest against him from this seat.Yogi Adityanath is a Thakur (a Hindu upper caste) and Chandrashekhar Azad a Dalit. By fielding a Brahmin, the SP would look to garner Brahmin, Yadav, Muslim votes to itself, said sources.Subhavati, along with her two sons, joined the Samajwadi Party on Thursday evening. Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, at his press conference on Thursday, hinted about her candidature when asked about whom the SP intends to field against Yogi Adityanath. “A lot of aspirants have applied for contesting the seat. And a Brahmin family too has come today to meet me,” said Akhilesh The party had not said anything officially about the Gorakhpur Sadar seat or about Subhavati’s candidature, but on its twitter handle posted a picture of Subhavati along with several persons, stating: “Impressed with SP’s policies the family of late Upendra Nath Shukla, former BJP vice-president and former Gorakhpur Lok Sabha bypoll candidate’s family joined the SP.” Upendra Nath Shukla was a prominent local Brahmin leader from the BJP, who had been at loggerheads with Adityanath.

20-01-2022||Patna||Hospitals asked not to test Covid asymptomatic patients||PATNA In line with the Centre’s guidelines on Covid testing, the Bihar health department has advised medical college hospitals not to test asymptomatic patients before their admission, especially in emergency.The advisory follows a complaint on Tuesday to additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit that some hospitals were not initiating treatment of patients till they got a Covid-19 test done.The complainant claimed that doctors at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC), a government super specialty centre, did not attend to a patient who had suffered a heart attack till his Covid test was done.“We are testing patients for Covid-19 on the rapid antigen detection (RAD) kit before admission. This hardly takes five minutes and the result is available by the time an attendant completes the registration procedure for admission,” said a senior doctor of the IGIC, requesting anonymity.“The idea behind testing patients before their admission is to segregate them in Covid and non-Covid wards. We have a separate 10-bed Covid ward where we admit acute cases of heart attack, heart failure, heart block or arrhythmia,” said the doctor quoted above.“In case of Covid-19 patients, who are stable from their cardiac function point of view and can be managed at home, we send them back [for home isolation] or advise their attendants to admit such patients either to the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) or the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) in Patna if other complications related to Covid-19 arise,” he said.Given the high number of asymptomatic cases, doctors at almost all health facilities continue to test patients for Covid-19 on real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a confirmatory test for Covid-19 that takes a minimum of 6-8 hours for the result, before any invasive or surgical procedure.“We test all patients on RT-PCR before surgery and still get at least a couple of Covid-positive cases every day among those who are asymptomatic. We have cases of patients, who tested negative earlier, to have turned positive before their surgery. In such cases, we either defer the surgery if it is an elective one or in case of emergency, do it in a separate operation theatre for Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Umesh Kumar Bhadani, professor of anesthesiology department and dean (academics) at AIIMS, Patna.“We have even come across cases where patients have tested Covid-positive even after their surgery,” he added.“Everyone has the right to protect oneself,” said Dr Bhadani in response to a query if doctors were insisting on Covid-19 test, even in case of asymptomatic patients, for their personal safety.“We cannot allow Covid-19 asymptomatic patients to become super spreaders,” he said.NMCH medical superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said patients at the hospital were being tested for Covid-19 not at the time of their admission, but before conducting any invasive or surgical procedure.The state reported 3,475 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, down from 5,410 on Sunday, taking the total count of active cases to 26,673. Patna, which had seen a spike in cases, reported 745 new cases down from 999 infections on Wednesday.The state’s test positivity rate also declined from 3.67% on January 14 to 2.30% on Wednesday.

The border outposts, tagged as sensitive, have been entrusted with the task of using illuminating as soon as a drone hovers nearby. “We have been trying technologies on the border to tackle the threat of Pakistani drones. These illuminating bombs, in use for some time, are helping our personnel detect dropping of drugs and arms using drones,” said a senior BSF official, who didn’t wish to be named.He added, “We have provided these light-emitting shells to our jawans at sensitive points and these act as a preventive measure against any unauthorised entry into our territory. These bombs illuminate an area between 200 metre and 300 metre, making it difficult for anti-national smugglers to operate from across the border.”“Our jawans often fire these lightening bombs immediately after hearing the buzzing sounds of flying objects. Until a better technology solution is devised, these illuminating bombs are being used as deterrents, especially in foggy nights,” he added. During the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, illuminating bombs were used by the BSF personnel near Muhawa border outpost after hearing a drone. “The troops heard the humming sound of a flying object coming from Pakistan. They, as per drill, engaged the object and also illuminated the area by firing illuminating bombs. All sister agencies were informed. The troops also heard the sound of a dropping from the flying object. The area was cordoned and in the morning, a search of the area was carried out,” said a BSF spokesperson on Thursday, adding that during the search, packets of heroin weighing 7.25 kg were seized. On January 18, Amritsar sector BSF personnel had recovered a drone about 200metre from the international border. Sources said the drone had fallen in the fields along the barbed wire fence into the Indian side, after it ran out of the power. On January 14, a special task force (STF) of Punjab Police had seized an improvised explosive devise (IED) weighing 5kg and ₹1 lakh on the outskirts of Dhanoa village in Ajnala sub-division, again near the border. Police had said the IED was to be used during assembly polls. Since the election code of conduct has been enforced in the state, the Punjab Police and the BSF have strengthened their security along the border.

Later, Seema Kushwaha met BSP chief Mayawati at her residence in the state capital. Senior Supreme Court lawyer Seema Kushwaha said she is joining the BSP as she is inspired by the ideals and policies of great Dalit personalities as well as Mayawati.She said she will continue to fight for the justice for the weaker sections of the society. “The BSP chief has been fighting for the rights of the Dalits, the deprived and the backward classes. During her four terms as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, she had worked for the development of the state and the welfare of the weaker sections,” Seema Kushwaha said. “When Mayawati was in power, law and order in Uttar Pradesh was good. The life and property of the common people was protected in the state. During her tenure, the state witnessed reduction in crime. We will work to make Mayawati the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh for the fifth term to ensure that rule of law is restored in UP and girls and women feel safe,” Kushwaha said. Kushwaha is also the founder of the Nirbhaya Jyoti Trust and has launched a campaign to ensure justice for the victims of rape.The Nirbhaya rape case had shaken the country in 2012 when a 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was brutally gang-raped and assaulted by six men on a moving bus in Delhi in December 2012 and was thrown out on the road. She succumbed to her injuries at a Singapore hospital on December 29, 2012. It took over seven years to deliver justice to the victim. The four convicts in the Nirbhaya case were hanged to death in Delhi’s Tihar jail on March 20, 2020, after a three-judge Supreme Court bench rejected the final plea by the convicts’ lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uppolls-lawyer-in-nirbhaya-and-hathras-cases-joins-bsp-101642692451376.html

Among the ones left grieving was Usha Gupta, who recalls: “My husband and I were tested Covid positive in April 2021, and were put on oxygen support in the hospital. I saw a lot of young people collapse in front of me, and kept reassuring my husband that I’ll be by his side. But three weeks after hospitalisation, I lost him. He was 93. And after having spent six long decades with a partner, I was suddenly left alone, not knowing how to live life without him.” But the 88-year-old grandma promised herself: “Main himmat nahi harungi”. And her indomitable spirit supported her keen desire to help other Covid positive people through an initiative that’s now called, Pickled With Love. “When I told my three daughters that I want to contribute to Covid relief, and asked them to take a lakh or two from my savings and donate it to someone whose family members are fighting Covid, they refused to take any money from me! Instead, they encouraged me to make pickles, and even ordered for bottles in which I could pack them, and created a logo for the brand,” says this resident of Sarita Vihar, adding, “The profits from selling the pickles go to an NGO that works for infants.” It wasn’t easy to take up this arduous task as age-related issues such as back pain posed quite a challenge for Gupta. Yet she ordered kilos and kilos of raw mangoes, to be salted, oiled and pickled, following the traditional recipes she had learned in her maiden life when she lived in Haridwar, Uttarakhand, in pre independence India. “When I pickled the first few batches of mangoes, in the first month itself we sold about 200 bottles. Since then we have been flooded with orders, including some from abroad. The proceeds from these have helped in procuring meals for about 65,000 homeless people,” she says, adding, “When I hear how many people we have been able to help, I get a satisfaction that I wouldn’t have had, if I had simply given away some cash for charity. These pickles are my way of paying tribute to my husband, who was an engineer and worked with honesty all his life.” Gupta’s granddaughter, Dr Radhika Batra who is a pediatrician in neonatalogy, shares, “When nani figured that nanaji’s case is too far gone, she surrendered the ICU bed for someone younger who had a fighting chance. The bed finally went to a 26-year-old naval officer. I think he made it... There was one girl who lost her mother and sister around the same time. Her father wasn’t eating anything. But when he was offered nani’s home-made mango chutney, he ate roti saying its taste reminded him of what his wife used to make... There are many such tales. People call up from all across the country lauding my nani’s spirit. She certainly has nerves of steel and I’m proud of her. I’m sure nanaji would be too!” As the city fights the third Covid wave, this endearing grandma continues to prepare pickles everyday, and has even taken to devoting her mornings to writing cookbooks. Her latest being a manual on preventing and managing obesity. But ask her about the biggest life lesson she has learnt, and pat comes the reply: “Himmat na haarein, zindagi koi na koi raasta zaroor dikhayegi.”Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covidtales-this-grandma-s-pickles-aid-covid-relief-efforts-101642691611036.html
20-01-2022||Mumbai||At 38:1, Thane education department dealing with excess Pupil Teacher Ratio||The Thane education department is dealing with an excess Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR) at 38:1 whereas as per the Right to Education norms, the pupil teacher ratio in Maharashtra is at 27:1.Thane city, overall, has 10,074 teachers for 3.7 lakh students. Some classrooms have a strength of more than 65 and are managed by a single teacher. According to teachers, this adverse PTR has also had an impact in managing online sessions during the pandemic.“In urban pockets of the State, often such a skewed ratio exists. With a huge chunk of the population residing in a cramped space, the number of schools will not be enough. This often leads to more students for every teacher depending on the type of residential neighbourhood. Civic schools in areas that are densely populated and have slums will have more students while private schools in high rises will have lower,” said Alankar Warghade, teacher and educationalist, Thane.As per Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) in civic schools within Maharashtra, the PTR is at 22:1 and for aided or private schools, it stands at 27:1 in the primary section and 21:1 in the secondary section. As per Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) data, civic schools in the city have 32:1 PTR and private aided and unaided schools have more 69:1 PTR.“In civic schools, we have only a few schools where the number of students exceeds but overall, we have the necessary number of teachers based on the number of students in the classroom. Moreover, the principal also takes classes in civic schools with a high student population,” said Rajesh Kankal, Education officer, TMC. Meanwhile, principals in private schools complain that it often becomes difficult to appoint teachers. “Nowadays, there are very few who have proper training and want to pursue teaching. With so many career options available, we find it difficult to appoint experienced teachers in schools,” said a teacher on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-38-1-thane-education-department-dealing-with-excess-pupil-teacher-ratio-101642690951294.html
20-01-2022||Delhi||IIT Delhi campus: Covid positive students feel at home||The rapid spread of Covid-19 in the city has made its way to the hostels of Indian Institute of Technology Delhi as well. Though quite a few students have gone back to their homes, but there are still some who continue to stay in the hostels. And these students say that the campus is like a home away from home for them because the institute is leaving no stone unturned in taking care of those who are turning Covid positive. Quarantine centre and testing facilitiesStudents who experience symptoms of Covid-19 don’t have to step out of the premises, even to get themselves tested. The institute has created a testing centre as well as an isolation ward for the students on campus. “A friend of mine attended a house party recently and then started experiencing Covid symptoms from the very next day,” says Rohan Sharma, a final year student of textile technology, adding, “My friend was immediately tested at the RT PCR centre in our campus and then an ambulance took her to the isolation ward, which is actually the Gulmohar guest house. If the capacity exceeds there, then the ambulance drops off the patients at another quarantine facility outside the campus. My friend stayed at Gulmohar for seven days and is back now after recovering. It was really nice to see how well she was taken care of.”In room service during quarantineBefore a student is taken to the isolation centre, they are asked to quarantine in their rooms. “During this time, the institute has been providing room service of food and other necessities,” says Abhinav Gupta, a fourth year student of textile and fibre engineering. He adds: “All Covid precautions are being followed. If there is someone who is quarantined in his room, food is delivered right till the doorstep by the college authorities. They pack whatever is cooked in plastic containers, so that those can be discarded later. Also, proper cleanliness is being maintained.” Individual rooms to not mess slotsPrevention is better than cure and the students of IIT Delhi say that their college management is making sure to keep it safe for all of them during this time. “We have all been allotted individual rooms and are not required to share the room with anyone. This helps as it reduces the chance of transmission of the virus. Also, we are supposed to wear a mask at all times, even while using the common washroom. Although I just hope there was someone to make sure that quarantine is not broken, maybe someone could patrol,” adds Gupta.And Saurabh, a final year student of production and industrial engineering, says, “Our mess committee has divided the dining hours into four slots, and assigned two wings per slot. Normally we can go and eat between 8am to 10am, Noon to 2pm, and 7pm to 9pm. But now, to fight the rise in Covid cases, they’ve bifurcated the available eating slots in segments. This works for us all.” Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/iit-delhi-campus-covid-positive-students-feel-at-home-101642690655527.html

Although Maharashtra recorded a state-wide spike of 4,000 cases yesterday, its capital Mumbai has been clocking a diminishing number of new cases each day, with the health bulletin showing 6,032 daily cases on Wednesday, and 6,149 on Tuesday, the day prior.Mumbai also recorded 12 coronavirus deaths today, while the total number of patients who recovered and were discharged from their respective hospitals in the past 24 hours rose to 15,440.Only 550 patients were hospitalised for coronavirus infection during the same time, and the Covid-19 daily update issued today by the municipal corporation of Greater Mumbai showed that only 12.7 per cent of the total available beds in the city's hospitals are currently occupied.As many as 53,203 Covid-19 tests were also done in Mumbai in the last 24 hours, the health bulletin showed.Also Read | Is third Covid-19 wave ebbing in Mumbai? Here’s what experts sayNotably, the diminishing number of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai and the 96 per cent recovery rate have instilled hope that the Maharashtrian capital might finally be marking the flattening of the third wave of the pandemic, that began on December 21. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has, however, said that it is too early to declare that Mumbai is now in the safe zone, with authorities terming the forthcoming week as a ‘wait and watch’ period.Suresh Kakani, the additional municipal commissioner in charge of the BMC’s public health department, told Hindustan Times, “The figures are declining by the day, and this is a very good sign for Mumbai.”“However, this is not the time to let our guards down,” he added. “Citizens must continue to maintain Covid-19-appropriate behaviour, and mask up in public. We will monitor the situation closely for one more week.”At the peak of the third wave, Mumbai had a positivity rate of around 28 per cent.

20-01-2022||Mumbai||Thane Municipal Corporation served legal notice for water crisis of Ghodbunder Road residents||The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has been served a legal notice by two of the residents of Ghodbunder Road in view of the existing water woes in this area. The residents claimed that the corporation has failed to keep its promises to the Bombay High Court.The notice claimed that the civic body had assured the HC in 2017 that it would form a committee to look into the water issues of Ghodbunder residents, following which the court had permitted new constructions on this road that were stopped for over a year due to water woes.The notice issued by Madhu Narayananunni, resident of Kavesar, and Dattatray Ghadage, resident of Manorama Nagar, claims that neither any such committee was formed till date nor was a single meeting held to resolve the water issue. They have asked the TMC to form a committee in the next seven days and conduct a meeting or else they would approach the High Court pointing out this as a contempt of court.A PIL was filed in the High Court three years ago to stop new construction activity on Ghodbunder Road unless the corporation provided them water connections. TMC has assured the court that the city has enough water for these complexes.The notice states, “The court, while disposing of the petition, had asked the civic body to form a committee with concerned officials to discuss the water woes and create public awareness of such a committee. The TMC has formed no such committee and it has also failed to supply adequate water to this suburb. Issuing Commencement Certificate to new constructions will affect the right of the existing tax paying citizen to adequate water.”Despite paying taxes to the corporation, most societies along the tail end of Ghodbunder Road end up paying lakhs of rupees for water tankers.An officer from the water department claimed, “We have not yet received the letter. However, we provide 100MLD of water to the Ghodbunder area, which is sufficient to meet the water requirement of this area.Following the acute water crisis faced by the city in the summer of 2016, Thane resident Mangesh Shellar had filed a PIL in the High Court blaming the water cuts on poor planning by the TMC and the haphazard way in which the civic body granted permission for new constructions along the Ghodbunder Road. Following this PIL, the court had stalled permissions for any new constructions along Ghodbunder Road in 2016. The court has also asked the corporation to file an affidavit stating the water connections and Occupation Certificates given in the last five years. In the affidavit, the corporation stated that the TMC has done water management to meet the population requirement till 2025. The court disposed of the petition in 2017, resuming construction work in the area. However, the disposal was based on certain condition for the civic body to follow.

A surprise candidate from Mansa district’s Budladha Congress’ Ranveer Kaur Mian, 30, makes it a point to refer to her husband’s grandfather Bathinda MP late Hakam Singh Mian at every election meeting. Issues of public interest, at this stage, figure only as an aside in her public utterances.“Our dada ji (grandfather) was killed by terrorists. He suffered several bullet shots in the head and the painful incident is still etched in the memory of Congress supporters of the region. He did a lot for people. I hope that you (voters) will cast vote in support, as I am trying to pursue dada ji’s legacy,” the political greenhorn says at an election meeting. Assisted by her husband, Mian village sarpanch Sarabjeet Singh, Ranveer, a PhD in English and a management graduate, bats for opening up of new avenues for higher education in Budladha, one of the most educationally-backward segments.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate from the high-stakes Bathinda Urban seat, Jagroop Singh Gill pushes his party’s political stance to target the incumbent Congress MLA Manpreet Badal on issues of alleged corruption and mis-governance. His team of volunteers mention that Gill, a Bathinda councillor for the record sixth time, was back-stabbed by Manpreet in mayoral polls. .Congress contestant from Lambi, a keenly-watched segment, Jagpal Singh Abul Khurana is also seeking sympathy for his late father Gurnam Singh Abul Khurana’s legacy. “My father, a former irrigation minister, worked to consolidate people against the Akali patriarch Parkash Singh Badal on his home-turf. During the separatist movement in Punjab, my father stood by the victim of police atrocities. After his demise in March 2021, his supporters have encouraged me take the legacy forward,” he added.Punjabi singer and Congress candidate from Mansa Sidhu Moosewala is campaigning for party candidates in Mansa and Bathinda district. He takes pride in crediting his mother Charan Kaur, sarpanch of his native Musa village, for encouraging him to take the electoral plunge. “Constructive voting is needed to redress the grievances of the underdeveloped region of the state. The party has fielded several young and academically sound faces to give a new life to the next government,” said the singer.From Abohar, the traditional stronghold of the Jakhar family, Congress nominee Sandeep Jakhar highlights development works undertaken over the past two years. After ex-state Congress president Sunil Jakhar lost to BJP’s greenhorn in 2017, the Jakhar family pulled up its socks to reclaim electoral dominance in Abohar. With the support of newly elected members of the Abohar MC, the Jakhar scion mentions roads, underground drinking water pipeline, sewage system and stadiums as key public works started under his command.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/campaigning-in-south-malwa-first-timers-pitch-family-legacy-sympathy-as-major-poll-planks-101642689211082.html
20-01-2022||Lucknow||Akhilesh to make debut in UP polls from Karhal seat||LUCKNOW Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav will contest his first UP Assembly polls from Karhal seat in SP stronghold – Mainpuri. The development comes days after the BJP fielded Yogi Adityanath on the Gorakhpur Sadar seat.“Party president Akhilesh Yadav will contest from Karhal seat,” said Ashutosh Verma, SP national spokesperson. “It’s final, but we have not made a formal announcement yet,” said Rajendra Chaudhary, national secretary and spokesperson, Samajwadi Party.The SP could also make Tej Pratap Yadav, former SP MP from Mainpuri, Akhilesh’s election in-charge, party sources said. Pratap is the grand nephew of SP chief patron Mulayam Singh Yadav and he was Mainpuri MP from 2014 to 2019. In 2019, Mulayam became MP from Mainpuri. Ever since speculations on chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s candidature for assembly polls surfaced, there were talks about Akhilesh too contesting the 2022 polls. Yogi Adityanath and Akhilesh Yadav had been MPs in the past, but they had never contested assembly elections. Both took the Vidhan Parishad route to become members of the UP legislature when they became chief ministers. Akhilesh is currently Azamgarh MP. Before this, there had been speculations that he might contest from the Gopalpur Assembly seat in Azamgarh. Earlier, on January 3, he said if he would contest the UP elections himself, then there are many options for him. “If the party decides so then I will. We have many seats to choose from as Netaji (SP founder and Akhilesh’s father Mulayam Singh Yadav) had contested many assembly elections -- in Sambhal, Firozabad, Etah, Mainpuri, Shahjahanpur and Azamgarh. I can contest from any of these assembly seats.”Also at his press conferences on Wednesday and Thursday, Akhilesh said: “We are definitely ahead of the BJP. And if I contest polls, it will also be ahead of them (he meant election date ahead of the polling date in Gorakhpur).” Karhal is scheduled to go to polls on February 20 in the third phase of UP elections, while Gorakhpur Sadar will vote on March 3 in the sixth phase.Karhal is a stronghold of the Samajwadi Party since 1993, with only one exception. In the 2002 election, the seat went to the BJP. The sitting MLA of Karhal is Sobaran Singh Yadav, who was with the BJP when he won the seat in 2002. Since 2007, he has been contesting from the seat on the SP ticket. Before Sobaran Singh Yadav, Karhal was represented by Babu Ram Yadav from 1985. He later joined the Samajwadi Party. The constituency comes under Mainpuri Lok Sabha, which is Mulayam Singh Yadav’s turf. As Akhilesh is likely to make his debut in the state election from this seat, Karhal appears to be a safe bet.

And Delhiites growing their own produce are loving the look and taste of fresh herbs and veggies as they stay indoors to keep themselves safe. For Delhiite Ritesh Gandotra, it’s work from home that has given him a chance to spend more time in his kitchen garden. “We’re growing onions, coriander, mint and many seasonal flowering plants. I hope to be able to do organic farming one day. Until then, I’m living my dream like this,” says this MNC employee.Sonia Puri Dhillon, a businesswoman from Phase-1 Gurugram, grows herbs such as rosemary, thyme and basil as well as veggies including tomato, broccoli, cauliflower and bok choy, among others. “I work on my soil mix which is totally organic. I dig up a vegetable bed about two feet deep, fill it up with kitchen and garden waste. The top cover is of dry leaves that acts as mulch, and lastly, a mud cover is given. As and when the veggies grow, the soil level keeps going down. The waste keeps composting and hence, slow fertilisation takes place. The dry leaves mulch helps in composting and keeping the soil hydrated,” she says. Karan Tripathi, a community manager from Vasant Kunj, Delhi, managed to take his love for gardening a few notches higher thanks to WFH. “It became my escape amid all the chaos. Thanks to winter and the bounty of greens that it heralds, I have Romaine lettuce, chillies, spinach, mint, capsicum, ajwain (carom), garlic and mustard greens adorning my terrace garden. Methi, my favourite winter green, is what I harvest often, owing to its quick growth. Simple methi subzis and paranthas are a common sight. Spinach shows up in a lot of stir fries, lettuce gets tossed in dressing to make a quick salad and chillis get transformed into mirchi ke pakore,” he shares. Nancy Singh, who runs a home decor venture in Noida’s Sector 4, says initially, it was plants and flowers that drew her to gardening. “Gradually, I got inclined towards growing my own food. In winter, I grow spinach, lettuce, chillies and lemons, using which I make pickle. The taste of pesticide-free home-grown veggies is 10 times better than what you get in markets. The trick is to understand the need of every vegetable one grows, and the sowing season,” says Singh.Author Tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter

Upon verification, customs officials found that documents of the Navi Mumbai resident were used by an accused involved in the drug cartel.The officials then kept surveillance for five days and managed to arrest an auto driver, 32, from Navi Mumbai when he came to collect the parcel on Wednesday. During interrogation, he revealed that he worked for a Nigerian national. He was then made to call the Nigerian national and as soon as the foreigner came, he too was arrested, said a customs official. Both accused were produced before a court of Wednesday and remanded to judicial custody.“We got specific information about the consignment coming in a parcel. So once the parcel arrived at the international courier terminal at the airport where customs officials are assigned to check and verify, we identified it,” the officer said.He said that the auto driver had taken personal documents including the Aadhar card of one of his friends and given the same to the Nigerian national who used them to bring the consignment into India. During interrogation, the auto driver revealed that the Nigerian national had promised to pay him ₹10,000 for collecting the parcel and handing it over to him and that he had previously collected three to four parcels for the same drug syndicate, the officer added.The Nigerian national came to India one-and-a-half-years ago and is currently staying in Navi Mumbai, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/customs-seize-heroin-worth-2-7-crore-arrest-nigerian-national-and-auto-driver-101642688610915.html

Malik had stated that the statements made by him were not in his personal capacity but as a spokesperson of the NCP.Citing certain remarks made by Malik on December 28 and January 2 and 3 in his contempt petition Wankhede has stated that Malik breached the December 10 undertaking. The contempt petition states that making public statements against the petitioner and/or his family members, in particular, the actions/omissions of his son targets the personal integrity of Sameer by alluding to his caste/religion and thus Malik should be held liable for action under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.Wankhede’s contempt petition and interim application in the ₹1.25 crore defamation suit filed by him will come up for hearing in the HC in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/wankhede-moves-contempt-petition-against-nawab-malik-101642688490994.html

20-01-2022||Mumbai||Centre asks state wetland authority to act on herbicide use in Powai Lake||Mumbai The union environment ministry has instructed the state government, via its State Wetland Authority, to act on complaints against the use of glyphosate-containing herbicides in Powai Lake, which were first raised last year by city-based NGO Vanashakti. The NGO was informed about the same on January 12 by a senior scientist with the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC), after it highlighted a November 2021 permission letter by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), allowing the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to proceed with spraying glyphosate in a “judicious” manner to control the growth of invasive weeds.In a letter to the assistant municipal commissioner of S Ward, on November 2 last year, MPCB wrote, “Considering the submission made by the MCGM...water and sediment analysis reports, literature review and similar type of study, your request is considered and you are allowed to use glyphosate for the destruction of water hyacinth in Powai Lake.” This permission was subject to certain conditions, namely that BMC will stop the ingress of raw sewage into the lake, carry out regular bioaccumulation studies along with water and sediment analysis reports, and submit reports of the same to MPCB.The BMC had, in August last year, floated a tender for removal of water hyacinths at Ganesh Ghat, Pawarwadi and other areas of Powai Lake to make space for immersion activities during Ganesh Chaturthi. The following month, BMC launched a pilot project as part of which drones were used to spray glyphosate on two per cent of the lake’s water between September 3 and 5. Based on the success of the program, larger quantities of glyphosate are set to be used to eradicate water hyacinths from the lake area, along the lines of a similar project in Aurangabad’ Salim Ali Lake, executed by the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation.Stalin D, director of Vanashakti, which first raised the issue, said, “The lake is a crocodile habitat. You need to seek necessary clearances from the wildlife department, which BMC has clearly not done. Water hyacinths are invasive, but to remove them you need to first stop the entry of raw sewage into the lake, which has also not been achieved by BMC.” He added, “Bioaccumulation studies may tell you when the level of glyphosate in the water crosses detectable levels, but the more effective way to tackle the issue is through arresting the pollution source, not introducing known contaminants into a natural environment.”An MPCB official familiar with the matter, seeking anonymity, said, “We have considered the merits of the case and given BMC permission based on certain strict conditions. If those conditions are complied with, we do not see any harm being done to the ecology. On the contrary, as demonstrated by the cleanup of Salim Ali Lake in 2019, the water hyacinth can be brought under control and the fish population in the lake will increase after such a cleanup.”Narendra Toke, director of the environment and climate change department and member of the State Wetland Authority, did not respond to calls seeking comment on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/centre-asks-state-wetland-authority-to-act-on-herbicide-use-in-powai-lake-101642688196192.html
20-01-2022||Mumbai||Illegal constructions in Kalyan Dombivli limits up from 67K to 1.44L in 14 years, as per RTI||The number of illegal structures in Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) limits has gone up from 67,000 to 1.44 lakh in the last 14 years, revealed a Right to Information (RTI) application filed by a city-based activist.The KDMC commissioner, Vijay Suryavanshi, has initiated a three-month drive against illegal constructions in the city with the aim of razing a majority of the illegal structures in its vicinity.Since December 16, after the drive against illegal construction began in KDMC, the civic body has managed to demolish 45 big buildings, 87 constructions which are over the foundation, 90 chawls and 45 sheds of garages and shops.Activist Kaustubh Gokhale got a reply to his RTI that revealed that the number of illegal structures in KDMC area till 2007 was 67,920 but has increased to 1.44 lakh now.“In 2006, the Bombay High Court had asked the civic body to do a detailed study of 67,920 properties that are illegal and take necessary steps to ensure that there is no such construction happening in its limit. Today, when we look at the figure through an RTI application it has increased to 1.44 lakh. The civic body has failed to take any measures since then till now,” said Gokhale.Meanwhile another social activist and founder of Alert Citizen Forum, Sreeniwas Ghanekar, has also pointed out that the civic body has failed to meet the High Court directions on acting against the ward offices for illegal construction in their wards.“All these illegal constructions happen in the city due to the support from the civic ward officers. Why not take action against them in order to actually curb the increasing number of illegal constructions?” said Ghanekar.In an order passed by the Bombay High Court in August 2006, it was stated that the municipal commissioner is directed to issue necessary directives to all the ward officers to whom the power has been delegated to ensure that no unauthorised construction comes up henceforth in their respective wards and that they shall be personally held liable and responsible for such construction in their wards.“Now, since we can see that the number of illegal structures has increased, it means that there is a need to act upon the ward officers who have allowed the same. The civic commissioner should look into this with more severity instead of just demolishing the structures as the numbers keep increasing even after the demolition,” added Ghanekar.As per the RTI, out of all the ten wards in KDMC, ward ‘A’, which covers areas like Balyani, Titwala and Mohane, has the highest number of illegal structures at 36,622.“Regarding the constructions that have already happened, our ward officers are taking strict action and demolishing most of the structures with the help of the police. Meanwhile, based on the High Court order, I have strictly warned the ward officers of no new construction be allowed in their respective wards. Those ward officers failing to follow this and allowing illegal constructions will face strict action,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, KDMC commissioner. 
20-01-2022||Mumbai||MSRDC’s 6km road between Juinagar and Kharghar kept on hold||The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation’s (MSRDC) plans of developing a 6km road between Juinagar and Kharghar below the Kharghar Hills to reduce the travel time between these two places have been put on hold due to lack of funds.According to the MSRDC’s plan, a 1.8km-long tunnel would be developed under the Kharghar Hills. Then, a 2.5km-long elevated road would connect the Western end of the tunnel with the Sion-Panvel Highway outside Juinagar railway station.Likewise, another 1.7km-long elevated road would connect the Eastern end of the tunnel with the road outside Central Park in Kharghar. The estimated budget for the project is ₹1,300Cr.Presently, it takes almost 40 minutes to reach Juinagar from Kharghar and its adjacent Taloja. If this plan is executed, a motorist would be able to reach Juinagar from the other side in less than 10 minutes. This will also reduce the traffic congestions on the Sion-Panvel highway to a great extent.A senior MSRDC officer said, “After conducting multiple surveys on either side of the hills, we prepared a detailed project report of the proposed road last year. However, we got stuck when it came to execution.“CIDCO has developed the entire area of Kharghar and its peripheries. Similarly, a major part of the proposed road (on the Western side) will run through an area that falls in the jurisdiction of MIDC. Therefore, we requested CIDCO and MIDC to contribute ₹300Cr and ₹150Cr, respectively, for the project. We were ready to contribute ₹150Cr from our side. We planned to loan the remaining ₹700Cr and to recover that amount from the motorists later by collecting tolls. However, both CIDCO and MIDC informed us that they were unable to pay the said amounts at the moment. As we cannot execute this ambitious project on our own, we have kept it on hold for now. If we receive positive responses from the other two agencies in the near future, we will rework on it.”While CIDCO officials were unavailable for comments, an MIDC officer from Navi Mumbai confirmed the developments. However, he refused to explain the reasons behind their inability to pay the amount.The local residents say that if executed, the proposed road would leave a direct impact on the business and economy of Kharghar as well as Taloja. It would also boost the real estate market of those places, they said.Kaveri Sharma, a 41-year-old resident of Kharghar, said, “Presently, we have to tackle severe traffic jams on Sion-Panvel Highway while traveling to Juinagar and Vashi. It takes almost one hour to reach Juinagar if we travel during the peak hours. That problem will not be there if the authorities develop this road.”

20-01-2022||Mumbai||Two-year-old dies after sweeper administers wrong injection||Mumbai A two-year-old boy died at an unregistered hospital in Govandi in eastern Mumbai on Wednesday, after a sweeper allegedly administered him an injection meant for another patient. The Shivajinagar police are trying to trace the 17-year-old sweeper, who allegedly sometimes helps the nurses out. Police sources said the sweeper was a class eighth dropout. Police have also booked Dr Altaf Khan (29), a BUMS, and the owner of the nursing home Nasimuddin Sayyed (63), on the charge of death by negligence.Police inspector Iqbal Shigalgaar said that the incident occurred at Noor Hospital on Wednesday evening.Shigalgaar said that they received information that the relatives of a patient were creating chaos, so, they reached the spot to find that two-year-old Taha Azeem Khan had died. Azeem, Taha’s father informed the police that three days ago, Taha had loose motions so he had been admitted to the hospital. On Wednesday, his consulting doctor Pravin Gangane was about to discharge him when the sweeper and another nurse were arguing about an injection.The sweeper then picked up a jab and administered it to Taha. The injection was, however, meant for the patient next to him. “Without the knowledge of the doctor or me, Taha was given the injection which proved to be fatal,” said Azeem.Within minutes Taha became critical and succumbed. “There was no mention of the injection in Taha’s medical report,” said Shigalgaar. After the police were informed, Taha was rushed to another hospital but was declared brought dead.“We have registered a case against the nurse, the doctor and the owner of the nursing home and are awaiting the postmortem report of the child to find out the exact cause of his death. We are making efforts to track the accused and arrest them,” said Arjun Rajane, senior police inspector of Shivajinagar police station.Dr Harishchand Navneet, health officer of the M (east) ward said that there were 24 unregistered and 41 registered nursing homes in Shivajinagar area. He said that since 2009, there were no new registrations in the area, as the nursing homes do not meet the criteria laid down by BMC.According to the police, recently another nurse was arrested from AK Khan’s National clinic for administering a wrong injection to 26-year-old Shabana Sayyed. The injection created an infection after which she had to be operated on and eventually passed away in October 2020.The police arrested the nurse and are on a lookout for doctors Reham Khan and AK Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/twoyearold-dies-after-sweeper-administers-wrong-injection-101642686270862.html

20-01-2022||Pune||Forest dept begins fencing quarry on Vetal tekdi in Pune||PUNE The forest department has begun erecting a fence around the quarry on Vetal tekdi. The action has come after a 24-year-old man who was trying to save a cat fell into a 70-80 feet deep gorge at the tekdi on January 13.Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forests, Maharashtra, said, “We are building a link chain fence around the quarry which is in the forest land. We are doing this to help preserve the biodiversity within the periphery of the quarry and this will help keep accidents at bay.”The environment lovers, walkers and activists, meanwhile, do not want artificial structures on the tekdi.“By building a fence, it will also block the access of small forest fauna to the only water body on the hill. We are fine with access being denied to the quarry to people, but we strongly object to the chain link fencing. It will cut off access to the only source of water for the small forest fauna remaining on the tekdi - there are plenty of hares here and sightings of small jungle cats have also been reported,” said Sushma Date, a member of Deccan Gymkhana Parisar Samiti.“Instead of using artificial material, if the department can use natural green fencing like growing sagargota, nirgudi and other cactus plants, with small gaps for animals to pass through? The ecologists from Pune Ecological Society can also help in this matter,” Date added.Fencing the natural area around the quarry is not good for the tekdi’s flora and fauna. “Any artificial construction on the tekdi changes the ecosystem, restricts the movement and water intake of small animals across the land, and usage of cement will also eventually start changing the natural water table located on the tekdi, which is a rich catchment area directly in central Pune,” said Asira Lele, member of Save Vetal Tekdi group.“Fencing cannot be a solution because people will always find a way to go up to areas marked as dangerous and take selfies there. As a solution, the forest department can post a guard atop the tekdi instead to warn such people, and not increase the nefarious construction activities there,” said Lele.Deputy conservator of forests, Maharashtra, said, “There is nothing wrong in having a fence erected to save the quarry and the tekdi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/forest-dept-begins-fencing-quarry-on-vetal-tekdi-in-pune-101642685850871.html
20-01-2022||Mumbai||Activists in Navi Mumbai demand special fast track courts for environmental cases||With mounting complaints of mangrove and wetland destruction, greens in Navi Mumbai have demanded a proposal to have special fast track courts for environmental cases and green police to handle such crimes.This, they claim, would ease the burden of the existing judiciary and police force, and also ensure environmental complaints get resolved quickly.“CM Uddhav Thackeray’s office has asked the Forest Secretary B Venugopal Reddy to take this suggestion forward. We have requested the CM to involve the Environment department, too, in the process,” NatConnect Foundation director, BN Kumar, said.The Mangrove Cell proposed to have a CCTV camera network for surveillance on the sea forests. “This network should be further strengthened with a centralised Mangrove Control Room and a Rapid Action Force to quickly check destruction. The culprits are now going without trace in the absence of any surveillance,” he said.Nandkumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, pointed out that first of all the existing machinery takes time in registering cases and then the investigation is another long-term exercise.“In all fairness, we do not blame the police force or the judiciary since they are overloaded. Environment has been the biggest victim of the so-called project and infrastructure development in MMR in particular and the special courts will go a long way in ensuring justice,” Pawar said.Section 19 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, gives the Tribunal power to regulate its own procedure. Additionally, the Tribunal is not bound by procedure under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, or the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, and is guided by principles of natural justice. However, the Tribunal is vested with the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure for discharging its functions, Kumar pointed out to the government and stressed the need for a fast-track court system.The Forest Guards, at best, file FIRs with the police. “A full-fledged Green Police force under the Revenue and Forest Department should be empowered to conduct investigation and launch prosecutions and ensure punishment to the guilty,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/activists-in-navi-mumbai-demand-special-fast-track-courts-for-environmental-cases-101642685192435.html
20-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: Congress releases second list of 41 candidates, 16 of them are women||LUCKNOW The Congress on Thursday released its second list of candidates on 41 assembly seats for the upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh. Of these, 16 were given to women candidates, which was 40% of the total seats in the second list.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had announced 40% reservation to women in 2022 UP Assembly elections. These 16 women candidates included Poonam Pandit, a former national/international shooter, who was an active participant of farmers’ agitation and Sangeeta Tyagi, wife of late Rajiv Tyagi, former Congress spokesperson. Poonam Pandit, 25, was given a Congress ticket from Syana Assembly seat of Bulandshahr in western UP and Sangeeta Tyagi, 43, was fielded from the the Sahibabad Assembly constituency of Ghaziabad.Known for her oratory skills in Hindi and Haryanvi, Poonam Pandit had joined the Congress at a special programme at UP Congress Committee headquarters here recently. Sangeeta Tyagi is wife of All India Congress Committee (AICC) spokesman late Rajiv Tyagi, who died of heart attack soon after taking part in a debate on a news channel. Another woman candidate, Usha Gangwar, 57, was fielded from the Nawabganj seat of Bareilly. A former district panchayat president, she is a known ‘Kurmi’ leader who joined the Congress from the BSP following Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s ‘Ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon’’ (I am a girl, I can fight) campaign. On the other hand, Sikandar Valmiki, 34, a former government employee, was fielded from Agra Cantt (SC) Assembly seat. He resigned from his job to dedicate himself to the cause of the Valmiki community. He took up the cause of Arun Valmiki, 31, who allegedly died in police custody in Agra. With the second list, the Congress had so far declared 166 candidates out of 403 assembly seats going to polls in seven phases. As many as 94 seats will vote in the first phase of elections on February 10. “We have declared candidates for all the seats going for polls in the first phase,” said a party functionary. The last date for filing of nomination papers is January 21, 2022 and political parties are giving final touches or amending names on the seats left out, if any or already declared. A considerable number of defectors, including two sitting MLAs – Naresh Saini and Masood Akhtar from Saharanpur district of western UP – have left the Congress. So have senior leaders Imran Masood and Pankaj Malik. The Congress has been facing the challenge of finding suitable candidates for many such seats in western UP. 
20-01-2022||Mumbai||Mangroves clean-up group’s drive in Navi Mumbai enters 75th week||What started as a small initiative by a 35-year-old Nerul resident during the lockdown with the help of four friends has gradually gained momentum with almost 1,500 people across Navi Mumbai joining as volunteers in various mangrove clean-up drives.The group, Environment Life, started by Dharmesh Barai, is having its 75th Week of Mangroves Clean-up Drive on Saturday at Sarovar Vihar, Sector 11, CBD Belapur. Till date, the team has removed more than 70 tons of trash from the mangroves in the previous 74 weeks.Barai had shifted from Kamothe to Nerul in 2020 and in July, he happened to visit Shiv Temple at Karave jetty. “It was painful to see the sight of the mangroves around the temple littered with waste. That was when I decided that I, as a citizen, should do something to clear this. On August 15, 2020, along with Rohan Bhosale (22), Shriram Shankar (27), Aman Gupta (25) and Rahul Rahkar (25), I had the first mangrove clean-up drive,” Barai said.Right from local citizen groups to NGOs to corporates, all have taken part in various drives in Navi Mumbai. The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) and Mangrove Foundation took note of the initiatives and soon ward officers of the areas wherein the drives happened started joining them.Deputy municipal commissioner, Babasaheb Rajale, too, joined the drives and also made sure that the corporation backed the initiative in all possible ways.“The waste that are washed into Navi Mumbai by water most of the time come from other parts of MMR. None but humans are responsible for this, which is affecting biodiversity. People need to be more responsible in disposing of the waste. The initiative taken up by the soldiers of mangroves is helping the city a lot and people should enthusiastically come forward and do their bit. The corporation has been, and will, continue to give its whole support to the initiative,” Rajale said.Barai added, “NMMC provided us with sacks to collect the waste and also picked them up from the place where we gather them, and then recycled them 100%. NMMC also provides us with gloves and the sanitary officer and ward officer of those areas would join us with other equipment required to segregate the waste.”The biggest challenge in these drives faced by the volunteers is the risk of getting bitten by a snake and getting injuries from open syringes and broken bulbs. “We have spotted snakes many times but luckily none of us was ever bitten. Open syringes have injured many and NMMC provides us with TT shots,” Barai added.From Nerul to Belapur, around 25 spots are regularly cleaned by the team. While some of the spots are littered by the public, places attached to the ocean get littered during each high tide and hence repeated cleaning is required there.“The micro plastic waste like ketchup and shampoo packets are found immense in the drive. We have also found discarded sofa and bed. Medical waste including used syringes, medicine bottles, masks are the most that we find,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mangroves-clean-up-group-s-drive-in-navi-mumbai-enters-75th-week-101642683990642.html

He dies: Cops||MUMBAI: A two-year-old boy admitted to a nursing home in eastern Mumbai’s Govandi area by his parents on Wednesday evening died after the nurse allegedly administered him a wrong injection, police said, citing a complaint filed by the child’s family.The nurse, Nargis Shaikh, an 18-year-old class eight dropout, is missing, said inspector Iqbal Shigalgaar of the Shivajinagar police station. Dr Altaf Khan, who has a bachelor’s degree in Unani medicine and surgery (BUMS), and owner of the Noor nursing home, Nasimuddin Sayyed, have also been named in the FIR.Shigalgaar said they went to the nursing home after receiving information that some relatives of a patient were creating a ruckus on Wednesday. The child’s father Azeem told the police that the baby, who was suffering from diarrhoea, was admitted to the nursing home three days back.On Wednesday, his consulting doctor Pravin Gangane was about to discharge the child when two nurses identified as Nargis Shaikh and Nisha Khan (21) began arguing about giving Taha an injection. Nargis Shaikh picked up an injection meant for another patient and administered the shot to Taha.Azeem said the injection proved fatal.Within minutes, Taha’s condition suddenly deteriorated and he died. “There was no mention of the injection in Taha’s medical report,” said Shigalgaar. After the police were informed, Taha was rushed to another hospital but was declared brought dead.“We have registered a case against the nurse, the doctor and owner of the nursing home and are awaiting the post mortem report of the child to find out the exact cause of his death.

He said that since 2009, no new registrations have been issued in the area since the nursing homes do not meet the criteria laid down by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for opening a nursing home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-nurse-gives-2-year-old-injection-meant-for-another-patient-he-dies-cops-101642683150514.html
20-01-2022||Lucknow||High court rejects PIL seeking postponement of UP assembly polls||The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on Thursday refused to entertain a PIL (public interest litigation) seeking postponement of the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Rejecting the PIL, a division bench of Justice AR Masoodi and Justice Narendra Kumar Johari observed that the reasons for the rejection would be recorded later. The petitioner Atul Kumar and another person, both of whom had planned to contest the assembly polls, filed the PIL. Advocate Ashok Pandey represented them before the high court. The petitioners argued that the general election (Lok Sabha) and the assembly polls must be held after the dissolution of these legislative bodies or when their term is about to expire. Further, the petitioners argued that the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls must be held only after completion of the tenure of the existing assembly. They contended that since the present tenure of the state assembly would expire on May 14, 2022, conducting the polls two months prior to this period was unreasonable. Covid-19 could spread further if the elections were held amid the pandemic like it did during the Uttar Pradesh panchayat and West Bengal assembly polls last year, they argued. Opposing the petition, the Election Commission of India (ECI) pointed out that the notification for the assembly polls was within its powers under Section 15 of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951. The commission also pointed out before the high court that as per law, the election dates were notified within six months of the expiry of the present assembly. After hearing the arguments of both the petitioner and the ECI, the court refused to entertain the PIL.The EC had announced the schedule for the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls on January 8.The seven-phase polls will be held between February 10 and March 7. Polling will take place on February 10, 14, 20, 23, 27, March 3 and 7. The counting of votes will be taken up on March 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/high-court-rejects-pil-seeking-postponement-of-up-assembly-polls-101642682850465.html
20-01-2022||Lucknow||Keshav Prasad Maurya’s graph rises as OBC leaders exit BJP in Uttar Pradesh||There is an unmistakable spurt in deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s graph within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) before the UP polls and the development has overlapped the recent high-profile exit of OBC leaders from the party. Since all the recent exits from BJP to the Samajwadi Party (SP) were accompanied with a parting note of alleged “OBC-dalit neglect” by the ruling party’s government in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP-RSS top leadership quickly ensured greater visibility for Maurya in an obvious bid to rework perceptions in the state ahead of the UP polls.Since June 10, when OBC leaders started exiting, Keshav Prasad Maurya emerged as the party’s chief firefighter, appealing to the rebels to reconsider their decision while stepping up the campaign to induct prominent opposition names into the party. Keshav Prasad Maurya has featured in virtually all the sound bites that have been issued by the BJP against the Samajwadi Party. Along with chief minister Yogi Adityanath, he is set to take part in most virtual connect campaigns in the state. To be sure, his graph had started looking up since June, when the RSS brokered a truce between him and Yogi Adityanath as part of which the chief minister drove for a luncheon meeting to Maurya’s residence. There, in the presence of top Sangh leaders, a “united family” picture was projected. However, the manner in which OBC leaders exited from the party, days ahead of the elections, led to a flutter as the rebels claimed that Keshav Prasad Maurya, being an OBC, too, was neglected in the party. In the 2017 UP assembly elections, Keshav Prasad Maurya was the party’s state chief and had held more than 200 rallies, perhaps the most by any state leader. By the time the elections entered the last lap, the BJP, propelled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, an OBC himself, was confident of backward consolidation. OBCs make up for more than 45 per cent of the state’s electorate with Yadavs, considered loyal to the main opposition Samajwadi Party, being the most dominant. In the 2017 UP polls, the BJP succeeded in attracting a majority of non-Yadav OBCs, who along with non-Jatav Dalits, were the mainstays of the party’s 312 seat win in the 403-member UP assembly. Ahead of the 2017 UP polls, the BJP had imported Swami Prasad Maurya, the OBC face of the Bahujan Samaj Party and a grassroots leader, to better the party’s OBC connect. But his sudden exit just before the 2022 assembly polls that triggered a spate of resignations has, party leaders concede, only increased the reliance on the “original Maurya”.When asked about Keshav Prasad’s appeal to them to reconsider, Swami Prasad described the deputy chief minister as the “RSS’s parrot.”“Keshavji is a good leader. We respect him and he should join us as he, too, was betrayed as he wasn’t made the chief minister,” said Swami Prasad Maurya.The BJP list of candidates is dominated by OBCs. Party leaders admit that Maurya, whose candidature was announced by the BJP along with that of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, was greatly consulted. “He is soft spoken, rarely loses his cool and is extremely popular among party lawmakers and functionaries and has a great public connect,” said Dharmraj Maurya, the party’s Kaushambi unit functionary. “To send out a powerful message about the need to follow Covid-19 protocol, he had ensured that just 21 people attended his son’s marriage in May,” Dharmaraj said.Many were surprised when the BJP’s Sirathu MLA Sheetla Prasad Patel was seen celebrating after being dropped by the party. “I celebrated because I was replaced by my mentor Keshavji. It was he who had introduced me to Sirathu and now if he is coming back, how can I not be happy,” Patel said. Keshav Maurya is said to enjoy good relations with the party’s OBC allies Apna Dal and Nishad Party too. The BJP has firmed up a pre-poll alliance with them and the Apna Dal is expected to get around 15 seats while the Nishad party is to get around 10 as part of the seat-sharing agreement, party leaders said. The BJP’s 2017 OBC ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) that has now parted ways with the party and joined hands with the Samajwadi Party, too, has not been critical of Keshav Prasad Maurya.“The exits won’t have any impact. We are winning over 300 seats,” Maurya said.Political experts said Keshav Prasad Maurya’s appeal and utility for the BJP is that he brings several pluses to the table.“I think before joining the BJP, he was with Vishwa Hindu Parishad and close to the late Ashok Singhal. That obviously means like chief minister Yogi Adityanath, the deputy CM has also been part of the temple movement. He is an OBC and as the state’s PWD minister, he is also someone tasked with bettering road network. So, this blend of Hindutva, OBC and development means his utility quotient appears to be high for his party,” said prof Manuka Khanna of Lucknow University’s political science department.In the run-up to the 2022 UP polls, Keshav Prasad Maurya had ignited polarisation politics by flagging the Mathura temple issue and followed it up with “jaalidar topiwaley gundey (those who wear skull caps)”. The remarks, political experts maintain, were made as part of a party plan to ensure “Hindus vote as one.” At the foundation stone laying event of the Jewar airport, many noticed how Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reached out to Keshav Prasad Maurya and raised his hand along with that of chief minister Yogi Adityanath to symbolically indicate that the party was united ahead of the pollsMeanwhile, on Thursday, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav refused to take a query on Keshav Prasad Maurya, stating that he won’t discuss someone who remained “apmanit (humiliated)” in the party for five years — a line that has been taken by all opposition OBC leaders as the supposed proof of alleged neglect of backward caste leaders in BJP. “Jo apni party mein apmanit raha ho, uspe kya baat karein (what to talk of someone who remained humiliated in his party),” Akhilesh Yadav said.

He said Yash Bharati Awards and the new ‘Nagar Bharati Awards would be also be introduced.“On coming to power, we will reintroduce the Yash Bharati Awards, which were first introduced by Netaji’s government (Mulayam Singh Yadav) and carried forward in the previous SP government. Our governments used to honour eminent personalities in various fields such as art, culture, music, literature, sports etc for their contribution to respective fields,” Akhilesh said at a press conference at the party’s state headquarters, On the pattern of the state award, Yash Bharati, the government will also bring in Nagar Bharati Awards at the district level, said the SP chief. The former chief minister announced that the monthly pension scheme for the state employees, which existed in the previous SP government, will be reintroduced. It was discontinued by the BJP govt.“These promises will be incorporated in the SP’s manifesto, which we will release after the BJP releases its manifesto,” said Akhilesh.On the feasibility of the promises that he had been announcing one after the other, Akhilesh said: “We will form a corpus for the pension scheme so that there is no problem in paying the pension. All the promises – be it the 300 units of free power to domestic consumers or monthly pension to state employees are being made after consultations with financial experts regarding feasibility for implementation. The SP is known for fulfilling promises it makes.”ON KESHAV PRASAD MAURYAOn BJP backward leader and deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, Akhilesh said: “For 4.5 years, he faced insult and disrespect in the BJP government. He (Keshav Maurya) could not do anything for his ‘samaj’ (backwards community).”ON BHIM ARMY CHIEF’S CANDIDATUREWhen asked to comment on Chandrashekar Azad’s candidature on the Gorakhpur Sadar seat, from where UP CM Yogi Adityanath is contesting polls, Akhilesh said: “The SP will decide about the seat. Several people in the party have applied for the party ticket from the seat. Today itself, one family (a political family) came and met me about the seat. We will decide. The SP is likely to field a Brahmin candidate on the Gorakhpur Sadar seat.”ON ALLEGATION OF CRIMINAL CASES ON SP CANDIDATES“The IPC doesn’t have as many sections as the chief minister and deputy chief ministers have the number of cases against them,” said Akhilesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-sp-will-restore-old-pension-scheme-for-state-staff-if-voted-to-power-101642682550611.html

He will soon be produced in Thane sessions court for further police custody.A video of the self-proclaimed Godman, which was shot on December 26 during one of his sermons, went viral in which he was allegedly seen criticising and using derogatory remarks about Mahatma Gandhi and his political moves. He blamed Gandhi for partition of India and supported Gandhi’s assassin, Nathuram Godse. He went further to thank Godse for the assassination. Since he made those remarks, multiple complaints were filed against him that led to his arrest on December 30.On the same ground, Awhad had registered a case against him at Naupada police station in Thane. The police had booked him under Sections 295 (A), 298, 505 (2), 506 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.The Naupada police during investigation found Kalicharan was arrested by Wardha police in a case registered by them. “Our team has taken his custody from Wardha.

20-01-2022||Delhi||Food Samaritans step up to make meals for Covid patients||Several states across India are presently witnessing a steep surge in Covid-19 cases. Doing their bit to lend a helping hand are a host of good Samaritans who’ve taken the onus of ensuring that those in isolation have access to fresh food. A number of Delhi-NCR residents are preparing and delivering nutritious and hygienic home-cooked meals to those recuperating from the virus.Mother-daughter duo Aatika and Neelam Kapoor from Naraina Vihar have halted the operation of their catering business as they are inundated with orders for Covid-19 patients. “From December 16, we started getting orders again for tiffins and thalis. And by January first week, we were flooded with calls,” says Aatika. The Kapoors, who have recovered from the virus themselves, consult a doctor to prepare healthy meals at nominal prices. “My family had tested positive, so we had consulted a doctor for the diet. We have been preparing food accordingly, to provide a tasty, wholesome meal at ₹90,” adds Aatika. Some are even going the extra mile to personally deliver food at patients’ doorstep. Seema Verma, an entrepreneur from DLF Phase 1 Gurugram, says: “I also got Covid-19 and realised how difficult it is. While taking an order, I ask people about their taste preferences and if they’re allergic to anything. And if it’s nearby, I personally deliver the order, because sometimes, delivery apps take time.”And for some, it’s the act of kindness that is above all. Noida-based Madhu Arora, who’s supplying meals across Delhi-NCR, says: “Even now, those affected keep asking how will they pay me, but I tell them to eat food first, because the first thing that comes to mind when a whole house is affected is khana kahan se khaayenge? As a human, itna toh we can do for someone.” Echoing similar sentiments is Sarita Vihar-based Radhika Batra, who runs an NGO. “In this humanitarian crisis, we need to come together. When we got Covid-19, some people sent us (food). Now, we are doing it for others. It works both ways,” says Batra, who is offering meals free of cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/food-samaritans-step-up-to-make-meals-for-covid-patients-101642680750563.html
20-01-2022||Chandigarh||Those who layer up in dreary January and those who don’t||The opening scene of the movie shows a man’s hand gliding over the wheat crop in a field ready for harvest. We see the face of the protagonist, a warrior in contemplation, adorned in a splendid combatant’s armour, made of metal plates and trimmed with fur. The camera tracks him walking to his troops and later fighting bloody battles as the story of Gladiator unfolds. This is unarguably one of the most iconic scenes of a battle movie ever shot, yet I find myself distracted from the brilliant scenes, designed to engross the viewer with the thrill of horseback charges and sword fights, and stuck on armours the fighters are shown wearing. This preoccupation can be attributed to a combination of cold weather, no sun and less activity, for it is dreary January. The mercury is plummeting and anything that remotely resembles a form of impenetrable clothing to protect the wearer captures my attention. Medieval Romans may have had the most powerful armours but the ones who are truly protected are those who are able to weather the cold, the quintessential ‘winter people’, better insulated than lesser mortals like me. Pretty much like Karna from the Mahabharat, who was born with a celestial armour, affixed to him, the winter people too are invincible. Every time I leave the warmth of my house, it needs immaculate planning to dress up. Jacket? Check. Gloves? Check. Cap? Check. Fleece lined boots? Check. And then once outside, all blue-nosed, one spots these stubborn souls walking around nonchalantly in meagre clothing. They have somehow tricked their nerves into not picking up the fall in temperature and passing this information to the brain. Or maybe they were born with a natural Yakut gene. It is believed that what you notice first about a person reveals a lot about your personality. There are people who believe that you can always tell a gentleman by the shoes he wears. In my case, it has always been how warm-clad the person is. The ones who have mastered the art of layering up without compromising on style leave the most favourable impression on me. Yes, there are winter-coping strategies but I no longer wish to cope up. I wish to do away. I fantasise about a winter home, somewhere along the coastline. I might even sell my soul to the devil to avoid another harsh season. The winter people in my life try to convince me that it is all in the mind, and that I have simply hardwired my brain into feeling the cold more intensely than others. I am at a loss on how to rewire it, with Jack Frost nipping on my nose and toes. According to a study, men can be comfortable at temperatures as much as 5 degrees lower than women are. Yet, in the cold countries, the office buildings have temperatures set to men’s need, leaving women to be too cold to work. Now this is the thermostat-ceiling I would want to shatter. As of now, I am counting days to February and the end to this season. Till then, I embrace my inner snow queen huddled up to a heater, with Netflix, books and mugs of hot chocolate. rupymand@gmail.com The writer is a Jalandhar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/those-who-layer-up-in-dreary-january-and-those-who-dont-101642679910383.html
20-01-2022||Mumbai||50% response for online classes during pandemic: Thane Municipal Corporation survey||Shreya Yadav, a 12-year-old resident of Lokmanya Savarkar Nagar, was unable to attend online classes initially as her family’s financial condition was not such that she could afford internet connectivity in her phone. Missing out on the explanations given by teachers online, Shreya only managed to take notes regularly.There were many students like Shreya who missed out on school education due to their financial problems. As per a survey done by Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), the response for online education in the city was merely 50% during the pandemic. The TMC report states that the lack of availability of smart phones or regular internet connection led to poor response for online classes. Most schools preferred to provide videos to children so that they could access the classes whenever possible.The TMC pays for the basic internet connection. However, many do not have smartphones.“Many students do not have access to Android smartphones and many have parents who are working outside and hence students are unable to attend online classes through these phones. Many also do not have regular internet connection or are unable to afford internet that can access video calls. Hence, we decided to provide recorded videos as well. These are uploaded on YouTube. Those who have working parents can access these videos after their parents return home,” said Rajesh Kankal, education officer, TMC.There are 777 schools within TMC jurisdiction. These include both Primary and Secondary sections in civic, aided and private schools within Thane city. Every day, students from the civic schools attend four hours of online education. This includes 40 minutes each of one particular subject such that every day four subjects are taught. A similar pattern of online education is followed by most aided or private schools as well.Anubha Sahai, president, Parents Association, said, “The government or even private schools should make arrangements to provide gadgets or internet connection to students who cannot afford them. In the current scenario, this is equivalent to the stationery provided by schools to students at the beginning of the year. It should not be ignored as many students are out of school due to inability to attend online classes.”Sharing her experiences, Shreya said, “Initially, I did attend a few classes. However, I noticed that my family was struggling to make ends meet and did not want to burden them further. My parents are daily wage workers. We do not have any steady income since the lockdown has been implemented. In the first week, after classes began, I had to miss out on lectures one by one as my data pack finished too soon.”After she shared her problems with her teacher, she is now being provided with recorded videos of the online sessions and teachers are available on call to solve any of her doubts.However, not everyone has shown keen interest in continuing studies and has discontinued school education. “This pattern of education is impacting children’s academics. Some low budget schools also find it difficult to continue the online pattern. The exams conducted online are objectives and are not helping students to understand even the basic concepts. All of this will have an impact when schools return to normalcy as students will be restless to sit in the classroom for long hours,” said a teacher from a city school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/50-response-for-online-classes-during-pandemic-thane-municipal-corporation-survey-101642679851993.html
20-01-2022||Mumbai||Thane district vaccinates 45.68% of children in 15-18 yrs age group in 15 days||Thane district has vaccinated 45.68% of its population in the age group of 15-18 years within a fortnight of immunisation.The response for vaccination among the adults, though, is less in rural areas, over 70% of the target population in rural areas in the 15-18 years age group are vaccinated.In order to ensure that teenagers are vaccinated, Thane district organised vaccination centres in educational institutions across the district.Around 2.27 lakh in the age group of 15-18 years have been vaccinated from among the target population of 4.96 lakh. In rural areas of the district, the response among adults to get immunised has been low and the Zilla Parishad made various efforts to reach out to the remote areas as well and conduct vaccination.However, among teenagers, it was easier and within a fortnight, around 53,110 have already been vaccinated from among the target population of 75,000.Anjali Chaudhari, immunisation officer, Thane district, said, “Initially, we set up vaccination centres in colleges within the rural areas. After a few students in ashram schools tested positive in Bhiwandi, we set up vaccination drives in ashram schools as well. This helped to identify all students in the eligible age group and made it easier to administer the vaccine. Within the rural areas, convincing the adult population to get vaccinated was a task, especially among the tribals. But, when the educational institutions ask them to vaccinate their children, they take it seriously. This has made it easier to reach out to the teenage population.”Meanwhile, in the urban areas of the district, most prominent colleges had vaccination centres for students above 18 years. These centres also started providing vaccines to the 15 to 18 years of age population, making it easier to reach out to the target population.Within rural areas, there are 33 vaccination centres. Ambernath taluka has vaccinated 18,825 students while Murbad has vaccinated 6,206 students. Meanwhile, Kalyan, Bhiwandi and Shahapur taluka have vaccinated 8,012, 9,173 and 10,894 students, respectively.“Unlike the vaccination drive for adults, there was hardly any convincing required in rural areas, we did organise awareness programmes about teenage vaccination. Both in urban and rural areas, the vaccination drive was diligently organised in each ward and taluka that helped provide easy access to vaccination centres. As the response for adult vaccination was saturated, we made use of the manpower for teenage vaccination,” said Rajesh Narvekar, Collector, Thane district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-district-vaccinates-45-68-of-children-in-15-18-yrs-age-group-in-15-days-101642677871684.html
20-01-2022||Pune||Taste of Life: When an age of temperance held Pune in a relative state of sobriety||In 1773, Dhondo Balaji, a police officer, reported to the authorities about a contraband ale-house in Narayan Peth in Pune. He had received an anonymous tip and when he visited the house, he found that liquor was being sold there. His report could be found in the “Peshave Daftar” - “In Narayan Peth, an old Brahmin Dravidian widow is found possessing twenty-five cans of liquor. The cans have been confiscated and brought to the chowki. Upon inquiry, it was revealed that the woman was selling liquor in her shop. She refuses to reveal her name. She says she is poor and has no other means of supporting herself”. The Maratha Empire, under the rule of Peshwas, absolutely discouraged the drinking of liquor. Excise duties coming from liquor, as a source of income, were ignored altogether. For, in controlling the manufacture and sale of liquor, the Peshwa acted not only as the secular head but also as the ecclesiastical head of the state. His revenue policies, to some extent, were governed by religious ideas. Drinking was forbidden by the “Shastras” and the Peshwa, as the head of a Hindu empire, tried to enforce this injunction. GS Sardesai and DB Parasnis, noted historians, have recounted several instances of the temperance practiced in the Maratha Kingdom. In 1775-76, during the administration of Shrimant Madhavrao, the second, Balaji Ganesh, the officer incharge of Taluka Devgad, was ordered to stop the manufacture of liquor from coconut trees from the beginning of the next year. A similar order was sent to the officer at Vijaydurg on the same date. In 1783, Ramchandra Balwant, the clerk of Sardar Potnis, was fined ₹1,700 for bringing illicit liquor from Mahad to Poona. The Prohibition Law became quite rigid in the Maratha state in the last three decades of the eighteenth century. At Pargaon, near Junnar, Balaji Dhondo Kulkarni, a Brahmin, took to eating meat and drinking liquor. It soon became a concern for the Brahmins of Poona, and penance was enjoined upon him by a committee of Brahmins. Kulkarni was ordered to visit holy places and pay a fine. But such religious injunctions also caused hardships to the people. Hence, these orders were from time to time modified in order to mitigate such inconvenience. Some people earned their living by the manufacture of liquor mainly for the Portuguese and Christian soldiers in the Peshwa’s employ. Some provisions had to be made for these people. Accordingly, Shrimant Peshwa Balajirao Bhat allowed the “Bhandaris” and “Kolis” of Prant Firgan to manufacture wine in the early 1750s, but they were strictly ordered not to sell or to give wine to Brahmins, Prabhus, and government employees. Some Portuguese and other Europeans were employed under Sayyad Ahmed Khan Gardi who was serving under Ragho Vishwanath. They always required liquor for consumption. Permission was therefore given to allow them to distil liquor for their personal use. The duty on the manufacture was to be levied by Ragho Vishwanath for the government and he was to be held responsible for the liquor so prepared, passing into the hands of persons other than the Portuguese. This was order was issued to Ghashiram Kotwal. Pune’s temperance went undisturbed for a long time after the Peshwa was banished from his kingdom. Seetaram Ramchandra Gaikwad, the chronicler of Pune, wrote in 1884, that there were hardly any shops that sold liquor during the reign of the Peshwa. After the British came, there was a shop that sold locally distilled liquor at the confluence of the rivers Mula and Mutha. Even though the native soldiers were not allowed to drink, they would visit the shop stealthily. Others would crowd there and drink as much as they wanted. But they were not allowed to bring liquor in the city. Gaikwad notes that in the first decade of the nineteenth century, the shop earned ₹20 per month, while the turnover from the liquor business in Poona in 1884 was ₹two hundred thousand. In “A Report Exhibiting a view of Fiscal and Judicial system of Administration”, Captain Grant, in 1824, is said to have written that “drunkenness was by no means a prevalent vice in Poona where only one distillery exists, and the Collector is of opinion that not half a dozen quarrels in the course of the year originate in intoxication”. Captain Briggs had also made the same observation. Even though Pune did not welcome liquor for a long time after the British took over, according to NV Joshi, who wrote “Pune shaharache varnan” in 1869, it became much easier for people to procure liquor in the early 1860s because several shops mushroomed across the city; there were sixty liquor shops in Poona cantonment and the government earned ₹12,000 per month through them. Joshi rued that due to the new liquor shops opening in the city, Brahmin men had taken to the vice. “They feel good while drinking, but one has to face the ill-effects of liquor later. If this continues, Poona will soon need a Temperance society”, he wrote. According to the Bombay Gazetteer, in 1884, there were seventeen liquor shops in the city, ten country liquor shops, and seven European liquor shops. Country liquor was sold by “Maratha servants of the liquor contractor”, and European liquor shops were kept mostly by Goanese Native Christians. Kirkee Cantonment had one palm liquor, one country spirit, one opium, and two European liquor shops. The Poona cantonment had one palm liquor, one country spirit, one opium, and two European liquor shops. The sudden rise of shops selling liquor could be attributed to the revenue earned from the sale of liquor. The British liquor policy was guided by the twin objects of generating revenue and checking intemperance among people towards safeguarding their morality. Two important legislations, The Bombay Abkari Act of 1878 and the Mhowra Act of 1892 had a great effect on the customary drinking of the natives, especially tribals, which we would see in the subsequent articles. The two legislations however had the summary effect of blocking the major sources of liquor – toddy, the fermented juice of palm tree, and mahua drink made from the flowers of ‘Bassia latifolia’ – by taxing the former beyond the means of the poor and banning the latter. The new system opened up an important source of revenue for the government. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, revenue from excise, most of which came from country liquor, was second in importance only to land revenue. It also gave rise to a class of European capitalists for whom the manufacture of liquor, especially beer and rum, became an extremely lucrative business. The history of the manufacture of malt liquors in India, is, to some extent, the history of a series of unsuccessful efforts at establishing an exotic industry, in a country then unfavourably placed for its prosperity as a remunerative enterprise. It was in the nineteenth century, as a consequence of the growth of large European communities and the existence of army contracts, given out by the government to European and Indian brewers, which the industry was able to firmly establish in this country.

The action was taken after the video of the son and his five friends riding on the said scooter went viral.According to the Mumbra police, the accused have been identified as Manojkumar Gupta (40) and his son Pritam (19), both residents of the MR Complex in Mumbra.The police said that on Wednesday morning, they saw the video on a YouTube channel, in which a young man, later identified as Pritam, was riding a Honda Activa scooter on a busy road, while five of his friends were riding behind him, some sitting, some standing and some barely hanging on. The video was shot by a passing motorist and had only partially captured the license plate of the Activa.“We noted down whatever number and alphabets that were visible in the video, and obtained details of all license plates with those details. We then checked the addresses registered against the license plates and found one in Mumbra, registered to Gupta,” Balasaheb Patil, DCP (Traffic), Thane City, said.A joint team from the Thane Traffic Police and the Mumbra police was sent to the Gupta residence, and the police confirmed that the rider seen in the video was indeed Pritam. Further inquiries also revealed that Pritam did not have a driving license.Subsequently, the police booked Gupta and Pritam for rash and negligent driving under the Indian Penal Code, along with ten different sections of the Motor Vehicles Act, including sections for rash driving, riding a two-wheeler without a helmet, driving a vehicle without a driving license and letting a non-license holder drive one’s vehicle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fatherson-duo-booked-for-rash-negligent-driving-in-mumbra-101642676250134.html

The top ranking now makes Khagaria district entitled to receive additional grant of ₹10 crore, the NITI Aayog said in its letter to Subhani.It is a significant development for Khagaria since it is one of the most backward districts of the state, which routinely takes a huge battering from floods every year. Khagaria’s district magistrate Alok Ranjan Ghosh said that its top-rank listing was a reflection of the improvement it has shown on a number of key parameters. “It has got the top rank overall as well as on the health indicators. There are five parameters out of which Khagaria showed maximum improvement from its previous position in two. In the rest three, it ranked third or fourth. There is still a long way to go and we want our team to maintain the same tempo. For serious illnesses, people still go to Bhagalpur, Begusarai or Patna. We hope one day Khagaria will be able to cater to its people’s needs within the district,” the DM said.Ghosh said that the district had been primarily focusing on health and education. “Health is one area where improvement can show in a short span of time, name in institutional delivery, anaemia control programme, immunisation, functioning of primary health centres, Covid-19 care and so on... The district has tried to make small but determined efforts to improve. The district was ranked No.1 twice in the past also and we got a funding of ₹13 crore... Now another ₹10 crore means we can have more schemes,” he said.Launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January 2018, the Aspirational Districts Programme aims to transform and uplift 112 most underdeveloped districts, including 13 from Bihar, from across the country. 
20-01-2022||Mumbai||Leopard found dead near Sanjay Gandhi National Park||MUMBAI: A three-year-old leopard known as C-40 was found dead on a road near Mumbai’s Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) on Tuesday, officials said. The animal’s post-mortem ruled out the possibility of any collision with a vehicle. The autopsy attributed the death to blunt trauma, possibly due to a fall from a height, leading to a rupturing of the animal’s liver. The leopard died of internal haemorrhaging that led to hypovolemic shock, a condition in which severe blood loss makes the heart unable to pump enough blood.“We are carrying out further inquiries into the death of the animal,” said G Mallikarjuna, SNGP field director, in a statement.According to the non-profit group Wildlife Protection Society of India, Maharashtra reported the highest number of leopard deaths in the country in 2021 and accounted for 178 out of 614 such deaths. Poaching accounted for nearly 30% of all deaths. Road accidents were the second leading cause of leopard deaths in the state and the country. At least 93 leopards died in road accidents.In November 2020, a pregnant leopardess died after being hit by an unidentified speeding vehicle on the Ghodbunder Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/leopard-found-dead-near-sanjay-gandhi-national-park-101642673610033.html
20-01-2022||Mumbai||Maharashtra to reopen schools for all classes from Monday||Schools in Maharashtra will reopen from Monday (January 24) for all classes from 1 to 12, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad announced on Thursday. "The chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) has given consent to reopen offline schools for classes 1 to 12," Gaikwad said in a statement."However, Covid appropriate behaviour and SoPs issued by the government must be followed," Gaikwad said. Pre-primary schools can also begin physical classes from the same day, as per the order.Earlier this month, the Maharashtra government announced the closure of schools after Covid-19 cases started spiralling from December. The surge which was mostly led by the highly transmissible Omicron variant led to various other restrictions as well, including night curfew.According to the order, the authority to reopen schools has been given to local authorities such as municipal commissioners, district collectors, chief executive officers, education officers.

20-01-2022||Delhi||2020 Delhi riots: Man who torched a woman’s house slapped with 5-year jail term||NEW DELHI: In the first ever jail sentence over the deadly riots that rocked northeast Delhi in 2020, a city court on Thursday slapped Dinesh Yadav, 25, with five years of imprisonment for torching a 73-year-old woman’s house in Gokalpuri during the communal violence in February that year.Although it is the second sentencing in the cases surrounding the northeast Delhi riots, Thursday’s ruling marks the first conviction and sentencing after a full-fledged trial. In the first sentencing, there was no trial as the accused had pleaded guilty and was let off for the period already undergone.The deadly rioting had claimed 53 lives and left at least 400 people injured.Additional sessions judge Virendra Bhat sentenced Yadav alias Michael for being part of an unlawful assembly, armed rioting using a deadly weapon, trespassing a house, robbery, and committing mischief using fire or an explosive substance with the intention of destroying a house.A detailed order on the sentence was expected to be uploaded on the district court’s website. On December 6, 2021, the court had convicted Yadav in the case and sentencing was pending since then. Yadav was arrested in June 2020 and the charges in the case were framed on August 1, 2021. A total of 12 prosecution witnesses were examined during the trial.Also Read: Delhi riots: HC tells cops to identify errant officials in national anthem caseAccording to the prosecution, Yadav was an “active member of the riotous mob” and took active participation in vandalising and setting afire the house of a 73-year-old woman named Manori on February 25,2020.The woman, who was the complainant in the case, had alleged that a mob of around 150-200 rioters attacked her house when her family was not present and looted all their belongings, including a buffalo.While convicting the accused, the judge had said that his presence among the mob at the scene, with a wooden pole, indicated that he shared the common objective of unlawful assembly and to target a different community.Meanwhile, in the first sentencing on December 17, 2021, the court had let off a convict, awarding him a period already undergone and imposing a fine of ₹2,000 as he accepted his guilt of harbouring Shahrukh Pathan, who was accused of rioting. Earlier, on December 7 last year, the court had convicted Kaleem Ahmed for giving shelter to Pathan at Shamli after he pleaded guilty to his crime.

20-01-2022||Delhi||First sentencing in Delhi riots, man gets 5 years in jail for putting house ablaze||In what comes as the first sentencing in the ill-famed Delhi riots case, a court in the national capital on Thursday punished one Dinesh Yadav with a term of five years in jail for offences that involved rioting and deliberately setting the residence of a Muslim family on fire.Yadav is the first person convicted in connection with the February 2020 riots; in December last year, additional sessions judge Virender Bhatt had held him accountable for being part of a riotous mob that set the said house ablaze. Yadav's sentencing today, condemning him to five years in prison, was also pronounced by Justice Bhatt.A detailed order on the sentencing is still awaited; however, it was reported that Yadav has also been directed to pay a fine of ₹12,000.The prosecution held that Yadav was an “active member of the riotous mob” and participated in vandalising and putting on fire the house of a 73-year-old woman named Manori on February 25 night.Manori had alleged that a mob of around 150-200 rioters attacked her house when her family was not present and looted all the articles and even the buffalo.According to excerpts published by Bar and Bench, the court noted, “The fact that the accused also belongs to the Hindu community and was present in the mob armed with a wooden rod which mob resorted to violence against the Muslims, indicates that he shared the common object of the unlawful assembly.”Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi in February 2020, after the violence between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiraled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.The 25-year-old Dinesh Yadav was arrested in connection with the Delhi riots case on June 8, 2020, but charges were framed against him by the court on August 3, 2021, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. He was convicted on December 6 later that year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/first-sentencing-in-delhi-riots-man-gets-5-years-in-jail-for-putting-house-ablaze-101642668330358.html

20-01-2022||Delhi||Covid challans: Excuses aplenty for flouting rules||We might be in the third wave of the pandemic, but the true meaning of Covid appropriate behaviour still seems to be taken up lightly by many. Despite the high number of Covid positive cases in Delhi, and an imposition of weekend curfew, the number of Covid challans has gone up. And special teams of Delhi Police, which were formed for the enforcement of Covid-19 protocols, reportedly collected challans worth ₹1 crore, across 11 districts, on last Saturday alone.Mask na pehnne ke 10 bahane!‘Pani pee rahe the isiliye utara tha mask’, ‘Sans nahi aa rahi thi’ ... these are some of the common excuses that police personnel get to hear with they catch people for violating Covid protocols. Even Delhi Police officials enlist some of the excuses as pretty common, such as the ones for not wearing mask. “Log bolte hain just abhi utara tha mask, and give us reasons like they wanted to drink water or that they couldn’t breathe. Ya bolenge ki kha rahe the ya mask abhi abhi toot ke gir gaya. There are very few people who accept that they have done anything wrong,” says Deepak Yadav, DCP New Delhi. Curfew or just weekending?Yadav adds, “During the weekend curfew, essential services are allowed and we are not stopping anyone who is out for groceries or milk or medicines. But kuch log without any reason nikal rahe hain bahar ghumne. Toh phir hum unke naam pe FIR register karte hai.”“Weekend curfew ke time toh bahut log bahar hote hain,” adds Hemant, a volunteer with the Civil Defence Corps, whose duty is to ensure that people are following Covid protocols in Azadpur. “The minute we catch anyone without a mask, we tell them ya toh Covid ka check up karwao, ya phir challan bharo. We have stopped listening to excuses. A lot of teenage boys are out during the weekend curfew and they will give us reasons like, ‘Mummy ne doodh lene ke liye bheja hai!’ But now we can tell by looking at their face that who is lying and who has a genuine reason to be outside,” he says. In fact when Shubham Singhal, an engineer from Paschim Vihar, had to step out to buy some medicines over the weekend, he says he was shocked to see the crowd outside. “I had to step out during the weekend curfew since we needed some important medicines. I had assumed that there won’t be any rush but that was so not the case. Compared to a weekday, roads were empty, but still there were many people outside and it just didn’t feel people are caring about the curfew that has been imposed for our benefit. I remember during the lockdown, one barely found people out on the roads, par abhi toh sab bahar ghum rahe hain bina kisi dar ke,” says Singhal. Rule is a rule“We had to travel urgently to meet my brother who lives in Delhi. It took us about 40 minutes to reach his place. My husband, my 3-year-old son and I were in the car. When we started, we were wearing masks but when we were about to reach we took them off because after the long drive we all feeling suffocated. Just then we were stopped by a cop. We tried to tell him ki abhi utara hai mask kyunki sir dard ho gaya tha pehne huye itne lambe raste mein. We tried a lot to convince him, and even apologised saying ki abhi pehen lete hain but he didn’t listen and we had to pay the fine,” says a Noida-based homemaker, who wishes to remain anonymous.

But if the party has decided to give a ticket to only one person per family, I will resign from my present Lok Sabha seat if Mayank gets a ticket,” news agency ANI quoted Joshi as saying.Joshi’s offer came days after Uttar Pradesh minister Swami Prasad Maurya quit the BJP on January 11 and joined the Samajwadi Party. BJP leaders have claimed Maurya, whose daughter is a Member of Parliament of the party, was angry over the denial of ticket to his son. Maurya has denied the claim.Despite BJP’s one family, one candidate’ policy, several leaders in Goa are believed to have sought tickets for their family members. In Uttarakhand, Harak Singh Rawat said he asked for a ticket for his daughter-in-law before he was expelled from the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/politicians-continue-seeking-tickets-for-kin-101642660828058.html

HT has seen a copy of the draft bill, which says the state will allocate developmental funds for these communities and issue separate orders for the allocation on year to year basis as per their share in the population. STs account for 12% and SCs 18% of Rajasthan’s population.The Rajasthan government in the 2021-22 Budget allocated ₹1.32 lakh crores for SC and ST communities compared to ₹1.10 lakh crore in 2020-21.The bill says departments will prepare and send proposals for developmental funds to promote equity and for direct and quantifiable benefits to bridge the gaps in the development indicators of these communities. It adds each department will ensure transparency and accountability at all levels in the implementation.Budget Analysis Rajasthan Centre director Nesar Ahmad said the provision for separate fund allocation proportional to the SC and ST populations is already there. “But it is not in the legal framework. The (erstwhile) Planning Commission introduced it during the fifth and sixth five-year plans. The state governments followed these directives but it is difficult to figure out how much allocation has been made and spent by the departments. This (proposed law) will give a legal framework to this allocation...”He said Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand have such laws. Ahmad said recently Punjab brought a similar provision through an ordinance. He added the passage of the bill in Rajasthan will bring transparency and clarity. “Besides, it will be easy to track the allocations made in the Budget.”Centre for Dalit Rights director Satish Kumar said the quality of life of SC and ST is not good and that the legislation will ensure fund allocation for them as per their population, ensuring the upliftment of these communities. “The (proposed law) will help in attaining sustainable development... and overall empowerment as every department has to make separate schemes...”In the objectives and reasons for the bill, Gehlot wrote it was being introduced to bridge the developmental gap and ensure all-round development of SCs and STs.
20-01-2022||Delhi||Cold day conditions to abate in Delhi from today||NEW DELHI: Cold day conditions are likely to abate in Delhi from Thursday with the city expected to record an increase in the minimum temperature by over two degrees even as the air quality was in the “very poor” category. Delhi recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 363 at 7:30 am on Thursday. The AQI was 322 at 4 pm on Wednesday.Maximum temperatures and wind speed are likely to increase gradually, which will enhance ventilation of pollutants and lead to improvement in air quality. From January 21, the wind speed will pick further.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Delhi has faced cold day conditions for about a week as dense upper-level fog made it difficult for sunlight to penetrate to the surface. Shallow fog persisted in the early hours. It was expected to clear out in the second half of the day.The minimum temperature was likely to be 10 degrees Celsius, about 2-3 notches below normal, while the maximum 18 degrees Celsius. On Wednesday, Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 7.4 degrees Celsius and the maximum 18.1 degree Celsius, a notch lower than normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cold-day-conditions-to-abate-in-delhi-from-today-101642647747270.html
20-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiwale: In the company of loneliness||The evening is feeling like night. It is prematurely dark. The air is icy. The street is empty. Everyone appears to be sheltering at home. Even the community dogs have vanished. But this lean lad at the milk booth is standing alert behind the counter. The kiosk’s closing time is 10pm. He will retire to his bed not before 11pm. The bed in question consists of a single chatai (mat) that will be spread out on the milk booth’s floor, along with a single blanket. On most nights, while waiting for the sleep to take over his senses, he says, he tends to think of his “mummy” in the village, and of his warm, comfortable bed at home, and the very many blankets there.“But I fall asleep soon, even though it is so cold nowadays,” says Ravindra Kumar. In his early 20s, he started as a milk booth attendant in this upscale central Delhi neighbourhood a month ago, after arriving in the city from Alwar, Rajasthan. With a colleague away on holidays, he is managing the establishment alone. “I sometimes make my [night-time] bed down there,” he says, pointing to the cramped space where customers queue up for the token-operated toned doodh.The one convenient aspect about Mr Kumar’s previous job in a delivery company’s warehouse was that it was closer to his village. But then, the company shut that warehouse down and he was out of work. Thanks to some strings pulled by a contact of his brother (who works in an automobile plant in Rajasthan), he got the present assignment. “But my dream job…” - Mr Kumar trails off shyly. With some nudging, he longingly talks of the extremely rare possibility of him getting a job, any job, in a government organisation - any organisation. “Maybe, if I find something in the railways…”Talking of his daily life, the young man says he cooks his own meals. It is too expensive to eat outside, he remarks. “Eating out means spending 200 rupees daily on khana.”Yesterday, he made aloo subzi and roti. Tonight’s menu might stay the same. Checking the day’s entries that he has scrawled on the pages of the milk booth’s account register, he murmurs consolingly that “this extreme cold will last for a few days more, and then things will become better.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-in-the-company-of-loneliness-101642633134154.html
20-01-2022||Delhi||Interest subvention plan for e-vehicles||The Delhi government on Wednesday signed an agreement with Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL) for providing 5% interest subvention on loans for the purchase of electric rickshaws, autos, carts and light goods vehicles. It also signed an MoU with the firm for the installation of charging and battery swapping stations at cluster bus depots.The interest subvention will help not just individual buyers but also fleet owners deploying vehicles for e-commerce, grocery or delivery industry, Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Wednesday.The interest subvention on loans on the purchase of electric vehicles in the particular category will be in addition to the purchase incentive of ₹30,000 and scrapping incentives of up to ₹7,500 provided under the Delhi government’s EV Policy, the transport department said in a statement. Through the scheme, an electric auto and electric light commercial vehicle will be able to avail up to ₹25,000 additional benefit, the statement said.Currently, the rate of interest on EVs varies from 25-30% for some vehicle segments which makes owning an electric vehicle a cost-intensive proposition, it said. “The empanelled financial institutions will provide loans with a minimum 80% loan-to-value at interest rates of a maximum of 20% (including the interest subvention) for a loan tenure which is in the best interest of the buyer,’’ the statement said.Gahlot said CESL has also agreed to procure, install, operate and maintain charging units and related infrastructure at 14 cluster bus depots at its own facility costs and expenses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/interest-subvention-plan-for-evehicles-101642632921913.html
20-01-2022||Chandigarh||32 years of mass exodus: Kashmiri Pandit’s wounds remain raw, hearts crave for homeland||Thirty-two years on, the wounds of the exiled Kashmiri Pandit community have not healed. However, they have still not lost hope of returning to their homeland someday. While successive regimes did try to soothe their frayed nerves by doling out sops in the form of jobs and promises of resettlement, January 19, 1990 is marked as a black day – the day the entire Kashmiri Pandit community had to flee the Valley amid calls of “ Cheliv, Galiv ya Raliv (leave,die or support us)” by Islamist radicals. “I was nine years old when my family fled Valley. We had a three-storeyed palatial house on eight canals in Amirakadal. The house was torched in 1992 in the aftermath of Babri mosque demolition. It remains in dilapidated condition now,” recalled 40-year-old Sunit Kachroo. “We lived in inhumane conditions with scores of other Kashmiri Pandits s in tents in Prukhoo till 1992 and then my father purchased a small piece of land and constructed a room,” he added. “While my father breathed his last in 2017 with a wish to return to his roots, my mother still calls our Srinagar house as her real home. My father was caught in a sort of time warp. Though he shouldered all his responsibilities of a father, he couldn’t find happiness in anything after 1990,” said Sunit. Yamini Kaul, who now lives in Delhi, said, “January 19, 1990 remains a painful reminder to all Kashmiri Pandits of an unbearable loss of their homes, livelihoods, cultural moorings, and much more than just a piece of land. Even 32 years later, there is a gaping wound in our lives, which refuses to heal unless the status quo is changed. My son, who is seven years old, would never know Kashmir the way his parents and grandparents knew. Who will be answerable for that sense of disconnect for a whole generation of Kashmiri Pandit kids”. Yamini recalled she was 13 when her family home in Jammu became the base for several Pandit families fleeing from Kashmir in the aftermath of January 19, 1990. “During those months, I was witness to a humongous tragedy unfolding as each family reached Jammu, heartbroken, desperate to return, and clinging on to that tiny sliver of hope, which remains a painful reminder to all Kashmiri Pandits of an unbearable loss of their homes, livelihoods and cultural moorings”, she said. The community observes January 19 every year as a holocaust day. A 75- year old Kashmiri Pandit, who insisted anonymity, recalled how his eldest son was shot dead by the terrorists in Shopian bus stand in 1990. “I still remember the day when my eldest son was shot dead at the bus stand and how I along with my wife and two sons had to flee our home in the dead of night,” he said. “We had a vast orchard, a big house and a thriving business but we had to leave everything behind,” he said. The old man said that the wounds of losing a son and leaving behind home and hearth can never be healed. Meanwhile, to mark the day Panun Kashmir, a frontal organization of the Pandits organised a webinar and took a renewed pledge to rededicate itself to the cause of a separate homeland in Kashmir. Meanwhile, Omar Abdullah, in a tweet, said, “Sadly Kashmiri Pandits are no closer to being able to return to the valley than they have been in the recent past. Along with a clear-cut policy, a greatly improved security environment would be essential precursors to facilitate a return. We hope & pray that day is not far.” 
20-01-2022||Delhi||Focus on destitute as govt widens the vaccine net for kids||Fifteen-year-old Gunjan holds a stack of books in one hand and her year-old brother in the other, waiting for the traffic signal at central Delhi’s Barakhamba Road crossing to turn red so that she can go around the vehicles, making her sale for the day.Within 500 metres of the signal are two vaccination centres open for children her age, but Gunjan says that she cannot afford to lose a day’s earnings to get her Covid-19 vaccination. “Also, I don’t have a mobile phone to register for vaccination. And I don’t have the time to go and get the shot, I have to be here through the day,” she says, when asked about vaccination.With around 50% of eligible teenagers in the 15-18 age group vaccinated in the Capital since inoculations started on January 3 this year, senior officials from the health department said that they will now focus on homeless and out of school children like Gunjan to increase the vaccine coverage, with some help from resident welfare associations (RWA) and market associations.Officials said the government will also increase the number of vaccination centres for teenagers, especially in localities where the number of registrations is higher.Delhi government data shows that of the 1, 001,000 children in the 15-18 years age category in the Capital, first doses have been administered to 613,865.Officials said that they are planning to conduct awareness drives with RWAs, market associations and citizen’s groups to bring underprivileged and street children around them to the nearest vaccination centres.“...every day we are managing to immunise nearly 40,000 to 50,000 children. But now our focus is to get the underprivileged children because we know that children from upper and middle-class families will get access to the vaccine. These unaccounted children are also our responsibility,” said a senior health official.Officials said that once the children are brought to the vaccination centres, government teams will help them get registered on the Co-WIN portal, administer their doses and follow up with them on their health post the shot.Delhi government officials also said that they will now progressively increase the number of vaccination centres for teens. There are 220 vaccination centres for children in the Capital now, up from 159 when the vaccination started for children on January 3.“There are some centres where we are getting 200-300 children every day, but there are also centres where, in an entire day, only five-six children turn up. While our strategy is to increase the centres, it will be need-based,” a senior government official said.Experts said that involving the general public to get more children in the eligible age category to vaccination centres will be helpful.“It is a good message that the government is sending. If a child under 18 in the neighbourhood has not received the jab yet, RWA representatives can get in touch with their parents and make arrangements to take them to the centres. This way we are also making our neighbourhoods safer because the more people around us get vaccinated, the less chance there is of a severe infection. The aim should be to push this as much as possible through awareness drives and social media campaigns,” said Anubhav Bhatt, co-founder of ‘Sarthi’, an NGO that works with street children in Delhi-NCR.
20-01-2022||Chandigarh||Aerial ropeway connects Dharamshala to McLeodganj||The Dharamshala Skyway, an aerial ropeway connecting the tourist destinations of Dharamshala and Mcleodganj, was inaugurated on Wednesday. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur inaugurated the ₹207 crore skyway, which is likely to reduce traffic congestion and boost tourism at the tourist destination. “The project was developed as a public-private-partnership project by Dharamshala Ropeway Limited and Himachal Pradesh’s tourism and civil aviation department,” the CM said.In peak tourist season it may take several hours to travel from Dharmashala to McLeodganj, however the skyway has cut travel time to just nine minutes. The skyway, which has a mono-cable detachable gondola (cabin) system, with 18 gondolas and a capacity of ferrying 1,000 persons per hour.Covid norms tossed to the wind While the common man is being penalised for not following coronavirus guidelines, the politicians were seen flouting rules with abandon. Even the CM, who just a day ago had hinted at imposing strict curbs, was seen without mask while posing for a selfie during the inaugural ride. Social justice and empowerment minister Sarveen Chaudhary, industry minister Bikram Thakur, Rajya Sabha Member Indu Goswami, Dharamshala MLA Vishal Nehria and a Ropeway Company official were in the same gondola, all of them smiling sans masks for the camera.Chaos prevailed at the terminal as people violated the social distancing norms and jostled against each other to avail a free ride. Amid all this, cops and administrative officers were mute spectators. Fare too high: ResidentsResidents were sceptical about whether the skyway will be able to meet its primary objective of reducing congestion as the ride does not come cheap.

20-01-2022||Chandigarh||Five people die after consuming spurious liquor in Mandi||Five people were killed after they consumed spurious liquor in Sundernagar of Mandi district on Wednesday.The victims had allegedly consumed the “Santra” brand of countrymade liquor, which is manufactured by VRV Foods Limited Sansarpur Terrace, Kangra, and 999 Power Star Fine Whiskey manufactured by a Chandigarh-based company in Salapar area of Sundernagar. After their health deteriorated on January 18, their family members rushed them to the civil hospital in Sundernagar, from where they were rushed to Government Medical College, Nerchowk. The first causality took place early on Wednesday and five people have succumbed since.The victims’ kin have blamed the liquor mafia, who allegedly smuggles in spurious liquor for the tragedy.

Predicting light spells of light rainfall and snow over the next 10 days, the IMD said, “The weather will remain cloudy in both regions with possibility of light rain and snow at scattered places. Mainly, dry weather is expected from January 24 onwards.”The meteorological department said there was no prediction of major snowfall till the end of this month. The fresh rain and snow led to drop in the day temperature and improvement in night temperature, which was sub-zero at many places.Drass shivers at -19.2°C, Gulmarg at -6°CThe minimum temperature in Srinagar is 2.7 °C, Pahalgam is shivering at -1.9 °C and Gulmarg at -6°C.

20-01-2022||Delhi||Old drinking age despite new excise policy in place||Delhi may have a new liquor policy, but two of the key promises made previously -- the lowering of the legal drinking age to 21, and a reduction in the number of dry days to 3 -- appear to have remained just that for now, promises.Neither is mentioned in the final policy that was notified by the government.In a press conference on March 22 last year, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also the city’s excise minister, announced that the union territory’s government would embark on a new excise regime by slashing the legal age of drinking to 21, exiting the retail alcohol business, overhauling a labyrinthine tax system, and reducing the number of dry days to 3.All these were to be included in a sweeping new policy meant to boost the city’s revenue, crack down on the liquor mafia, and improve user experience.While the parts about the government quitting the retail business of liquor and restructuring taxes by charging it all upfront are explained in detail in the new policy, the document is silent when it comes to the other two aspects.But since the two other decisions were announced by the government, it has led to confusion among customers. On November 23, HT reported how some liquor store owners were displaying posters at their stores saying “liquor sales not allowed to those below 21 years of age”.The excise department later issued a clarification referencing the HT report : “It is clarified that as per the excise policy 2021-22, presently, legal age of drinking in NCT of Delhi remains as 25 years. In case of any changes in respect of legal age of drinking in NCT of Delhi, the same shall be communicated separately to all concerned.”A senior government official said on condition of anonymity that both decisions -- on the legal drinking age and the number of dry days -- had the necessary approvals from all concerned authorities.“But gauging the situation, the political executive was of the opinion that the two should be put on hold for some time. It is not that the government is not willing to do it, but the reason could be political in nature.”To implement both decisions, the excise department has to issue separate notifications.Though the Delhi government did not comment on the matter, in an interview to HT last month, Sisodia said that the government has approved the plan to reduce the legal drinking age, but he did not clarify when it will be implemented. “The notification will be issued in due course of time. There’s no problem there,” Sisodia told HT on December 8.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress have opposed the new excise regime. The BJP-led MCDs have even sealed at least 30 new liquor stores since November last year, while court cases are going on against several other outlets.“Municipal elections are scheduled in about two months. So, it is very unlikely that such decision (on the legal age or number of dry days) will be taken anytime soon,” a senior excise official said on condition of anonymity.In September 2015, the then seven-month-old Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government first floated the idea of reducing the legal drinking age in the Capital. Delhi is one of only six states or Union territories that pegs the benchmark at 25, encouraging people to misrepresent their age, force restaurants to be lax in monitoring or lose out on revenue, and present young people with the option of travelling to watering holes in the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh, which allows drinking at 21.Delhi is now the only metropolitan city with the high drinking age – even in Mumbai, only hard liquor is barred for those under 25, while wine and beer is allowed at 21. In major global cities such as New York and London, the drinking age is 21 and 18 respectively.As per the draft proposal, the only three dry days in Delhi were supposed to be on Republic Day, Independence Day and Gandhi Jayanti. At present, Delhi has 21 dry days, one of the highest compared to most states and UTs in India.
20-01-2022||Chandigarh||Feathered guests alight, rare species also make a pit stop in Kashmir||The snow-covered scenic wetlands and lakes of Kashmir are hosting winged guests from across Europe, Japan, China and Central Asia, including some rare species. Wildlife experts and bird watchers say this year around 10 to 12 rare species are visiting the Himalayan region.Wildlife warden, wetlands, Ifshan Dewan said around 3.5 lakh birds have arrived at Srinagar’s biggest wetland, Hokersar, while around 2.5 lakh birds have graced Hygam wetland in north Kashmir’s Baramulla.This is huge improvement from last year when few birds had stopped at Hokersar due to low water-levels. “Last year, the arrival of birds was affected owing to low water level at Hokersar, but this year we have made timely interventions by working on bunding and breaches, which had helped water retention,” Dewan said.Kashmir has around 400 waterbodies, of which 25 are the winter haunt of migratory birds. At present, the Valley has nine wetlands, of the 13 in Jammu and Kashmir.Shalbough, in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district, is the biggest wetland spread over 16 square kilometres, Hokersar on the city’s outskirts covers around 13.5 square kilometres, while Hygam in north Kashmir is spread across nine square kilometres. Chatlam wetland in south Kashmir’s Pampore also attracts several migratory species.Despite a good water-level few birds have arrived at Shalboug so far. Dewan says, “The water level at Shalboug is good, but few birds have arrived so far. Usually, the birds start arriving in January-end and February, so there is still time. Pampore also hosts a good number of bird species.” The birds travel from the colder areas of the world flying over continents in flocks. The birds that arrive here every year are mallards, greylag geese, pochards, common tails, shovelers, pintails and gharwals, which visit the region between October and April.“This year birders have sighted around 10-20 new species, including the whooper swan and waders. Some new species were spotted last year as well. These exotic species are rarely sighted in the region,” Dewan said, adding that the department will be carrying out a census by February-end. For the last two years, the department’s census reports are pegging the number of birds whoarrive here annually at 8-10 lakh.The wetlands had seen large-scale poaching of migratory birds during the early years of militancy. However, now vigilance has been stepped up and encroachments on wetlands have also come down to a large extent. Dewan said they have established control rooms to stop poaching of birds.“Poaching does happen but we have established control rooms at Hokersar, Wular, Dal and Shalbough which work 24X7. There is constant patrolling. and whenever we get information of any poaching incident, our teams reach the spot,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/feathered-guests-alight-rare-species-also-make-a-pit-stop-in-kashmir-101642630404455.html
20-01-2022||Chandigarh||Forged promotion orders: Mohali cyber cell inspector, dismissed sub-inspector arrested||Probing further into the forgery of orders to promote 11 Punjab Police personnel under the name of a former Punjab DGP, the Chandigarh Police have arrested a Mohali police inspector and a dismissed sub-inspector (SI).The latest arrests include inspector Satwant Singh Sidhu, 48, currently posted with the Mohali police cyber cell, and dismissed sub-inspector Sarabjit Singh, 47.With this, the total number of arrests has reached five, including Sandeep Kumar, 55, and Bahadur Singh, 52, both working as superintendents in the Punjab DGP’s office, and head constable Mani Katoch, 33, whose name figured in the fake promotion list.Apart from the forged orders, a dispatch register, Sandeep’s laptop, a computer CPU, mobile phone and a car have been seized in the case.The matter came to fore in the second week of January after an officer with the Punjab DGP office, Sector 9, Chandigarh, approached the Chandigarh Police that he had received four fake promotion orders under the forged signature of former Punjab DGP, Siddharth Chattopadhyaya.A special investigation team was formed and all beneficiaries were interrogated. “The five accused arrested played active and vital roles in preparing the forged orders in connivance with each other,” said police.“All accused have been sent to four-day police remand,” said Ketan Bansal, superintendent of police (SP, City), Chandigarh. They are facing a case under Sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating), 464 (false document in the name of a fictitious person), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, or to receive any money, etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code, registered at the Sector 3 police station.Meanwhile, inspector Satwant, who has been accused of helping the accused prepare forged orders, claimed that he was being falsely implicated in the case owing to professional rivalry. Main accused at large Police sources, privy to the case, said the main accused, Harwinder Singh, who is also among the beneficiaries of the forged orders, was at large.Presently posted at the Sohana police station, he has not been reporting for duty. The forged order featured a special mention that Harwinder, a local-rank sub-inspector (SI), will be immediately promoted as officiating SI for good work in a blind murder case and an NDPS case registered at the Sohana station. Collected up to ₹10 lakh from each beneficiarySources said dismissed SI Sarabjit approached the beneficiaries with promotion offers, claiming good relations with the DGP and also conducted a meeting at his residence to execute the forgery.After being introduced by Sarabjit, Harwinder collected ₹5 to 10 lakh from each beneficiary, and paid ₹50,000 to Sandeep for preparing the forged promotion order and ₹20,000 to Bahadur, who visited the DGP office in the night to release it after marking it with a diary number. Mani typed the forged orders in the laptop of Sandeep on his instructions, following which the latter and Bahadur handed over the promotion order to Harwinder, who further gave it to Satwant. Accused surrounded by controversiesInspector Satwant has been embroiled in controversies earlier as well. In September 2019, Satwant, who was then posted as Mohali CIA in-charge, was booked by the special task force (STF) after his name cropped up in a case regarding the illegal release of a drug supplier.The case was lodged against SI Sukhmander Singh, then posted at Saneta police post, for letting off a drug supplier in lieu of ₹7.3 lakh.Earlier in July 2019, Satwant, was placed under suspension after an accused in a robbery case approached the Punjab and Haryana high court, accusing him of extortion and illegal custody.Sarabjit was dismissed from service after heroin was recovered from his house in Nayagaon by a police team from Fatehgarh Sahib. His name had also figured in the infamous Jagdish Bhola drug case.

20-01-2022||Chandigarh||Indian Oil, Chandigarh petrol pump to pay ₹5,000 for overcharging||Charging a customer for 51.47 litres of diesel for a car with only 48-litre fuel capacity has cost the Indian Oil Corporation Limited and its petrol pump in Sector 33-B dear.Terming them guilty of unfair trade practice, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Chandigarh, has directed them to pay ₹5,000 as compensation to the complainant, Aryan Jajma, of Preet Nagar, Zirakpur.In his complaint, Jajma had alleged that in January 2020, he had visited the Sector-33 petrol pump to get his Maruti Vitara Brezza refuelled.Much to his astonishment, the fuel machine showed 51.47 litres of diesel had been filled, while his car’s fuel capacity was only 48 litres and it already had around 10 litres of diesel in it.When Jajma sought to see the automation record, he was turned down, following which he filed a complaint with the petrol pump. But it was also not addressed, prompting him to move court.In their response, the petrol pump officials said the fuel capacity mentioned by the car manufacturer was just the safe filing limit and not the actual capacity, which was usually at least 15-20% higher, allowing the tank to hold a few extra litres.The commission observed that as per the car manual, the fuel tank had extra space for fuel expansion in hot weather. Besides, the car already had some fuel in it to reach the filling station and yet the petrol pump filled 51.47 litres of diesel. “It clearly establishes that either the petrol pump’s fuel filling system or the machine malfunctioned and the complainant was wrongly made to pay in excess,” it said.“The opposition parties failed to render proper services to the complainant. Therefore, deficiency in service as well as unfair trade practice are proved, which certainly caused financial loss and harassment to the complainant,” the commission said in its order and directed them to pay ₹5,000 as compensation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/indian-oil-chandigarh-petrol-pump-to-pay-5-000-for-overcharging-101642628195501.html

20-01-2022||Chandigarh||2.2 lakh people skipped Covid vaccine’s second dose in Mohali||Even as Panchkula has achieved 100% double-dose vaccination coverage, over 2.2 lakh people in Mohali have skipped Covid vaccine’s second dose after the due date. According to Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarsh Pal Kaur a total of 10,01,792 people had been vaccinated in the district till date and among them, 6,05,326 had received both doses. But 2,20,964 people had not turned up for the second dose even after the due date, rendering the first dose ineffective, as both doses were required for better immunity against the virus. The number of eligible adult beneficiaries in the district is 7,43,811, but several people from other districts and states have also been immunised in Mohali.97,967 adults in Chandigarh have also delayed second shotIn Chandigarh as well, 97,967 adults have not turned up for the second jab. This includes residents of Chandigarh and other states who got the first shot in the city’s vaccination centres.Chandigarh’s target is to immunise around 8.4 lakh eligible people. The city’s first-dose coverage stands at 126% with 10,65,940 people, including people from other states, having been vaccinated, and 8,35,524 (99.11%) are fully vaccinated.Due to people missing the second dose, UT has already missed its target of fully vaccinating its entire eligible population by December 31, 2021. To achieve the goal, the UT health department has been contacting the eligible people from a special call centre set up at the Chandigarh Housing Board office in Sector 9.“In the past two days, the teams have made telephone calls to over 20,000 people with overdue vaccination. The common answers given by people are that they were busy, had forgotten or that they do not remember the date of first dose. But these are all excuses, despite health department’s best efforts to vaccinate the entire eligible population.

20-01-2022||Chandigarh||In battle against pandemic, female health staff also fighting harassment, stalking||Fighting bravely against the Covid-19 pandemic, which is once again raging across Panchkula district, female healthcare workers here are dealing with another battle – harassment, stalking and unruly behaviour. While Panchkula today is among only three districts in Haryana to have achieved 100% double-dose vaccination coverage, besides Ambala and Gurugram, female healthcare workers say the road to achieving the target was riddled with several distressing experiences.From dealing with abuses, derogatory words and harassing phone calls late at night, disturbing their sleep and peace of mind, the workers have had to face a lot of humiliation and still continue to.“To convince citizens to get vaccinated, health teams, including women, were given phone numbers, which they would call from their personal mobile phones. While during the day, men would use foul and intimidating language, at night they would make inappropriate calls to the female staff,” said Dr Meenu Sasan, district immunisation officer, Panchkula.“This left the staff emotionally and mentally drained. Still pursuing wide vaccination coverage, they relentlessly contacted people from other phone numbers. They were guided not to lose their cool and politely disconnect the call, without losing focus on the bigger picture,” Dr Sasan said, adding that despite dealing with these unexpected struggles, the healthcare staff valiantly helped Panchkula fully vaccinate 100% of its eligible population.Still their days at work continue to be filled with unpleasant episodes. A woman doctor posted at the Sector-21 government dispensary, requesting not to be named, said, “While I was on a phone call regarding delivering home kits to patients in isolation, a patient’s mother, who was not wearing a mask, started yelling at me. On my request to wear a mask, she started questioning my credibility and threatened to complain against me.”Dr Mankirat Kaur, spokesperson from the chief medical officer’s office, shared complaints from female healthcare staff regarding threatening behaviour were common and she herself had been victim to it.“After I tried to pacify and guide a male caller, who had not received his RT-PCR test result, he rudely interjected me with ‘main dikhata hun nazaare aapko (Wait for the consequences),” she said.She further shared that people also get unruly when asked to get tested for Covid before being attended to by a dentist at the government facilities.“Often patients start shouting at the staff, leaving them threatened at work. Why should health staff have to face this behaviour when they are working overtime and without leave amid the pandemic?” she questioned.
20-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Three Mohali leaders return to Congress fold after a year||Giving a fillip to the Congress campaign in Mohali, three former Congressmen, Inderjeet Singh Khokhar, Parminder Singh Rehal, and Khushwant Singh Ruby, on Wednesday returned to the party fold in the presence of Mohali MLA and Congress candidate Balbir Singh Sidhu.All three leaders had switched their loyalties to the AAP-Azad alliance during the 2021 Mohali MC elections. “We have returned after getting disillusioned with the working and policies of Kulwant Singh. We have full faith in Balbir Sidhu’s leadership and have realised that only the Congress has the vision to help Mohali growth further,” they said.Later in the day, Sidhu held a series of nukad meetings in Hussainpur, Thaska, Manana, Taroli, Jhampur, Bahlolpur, Jujhar Nagar, Barmajra, Raipur and Daon villages, and appealed to the villagers to vote for the Congress.He said the effect of pro-people decisions taken by the Congress government in Punjab was being felt all over the state due to which more and more people were joining and supporting the party.Congress sarpanch joins AAP with supportersMohali Congress sarpanch of Kurri village, Chhajja Singh, along with several supporters, Wednesday joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the presence of former mayor and party’s Mohali candidate Kulwant Singh.Chhajja said the Congress MLA did nothing to uplift villages despite being part of the cabinet previously. “In many villages, people are practically living in hell. An MLA who has been ignoring villages despite having his own government cannot be expected to do any development work in future,” he added.“On the other hand, Kulwant, as the Mohali mayor, had carried out several development works with utmost honesty and dedication, and therefore, we want the AAP candidate to take over the responsibility of Mohali this time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-three-mohali-leaders-return-to-congress-fold-after-a-year-101642628186501.html

20-01-2022||Delhi||Supreme Court allows DND Flyway operator to put hoardings in Noida||The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed the operator of the DND Flyway to put up advertisements on the Noida side of the expressway connecting Delhi and Noida after the hoardings erected by the company were removed by the Noida authority over alleged non-payment of licence fees.The company in question – Noida Toll Bridge Company Limited--relied on revenue from advertisements to maintain the 9km-long road, of which only 2.2km stretch falls under the jurisdiction of the Noida authority. After the hoardings were pulled down, the company approached the Supreme Court claiming it had no revenue to maintain roads and should be allowed to erect hoardings. It also sought an order to stay any coercive action by the Noida authority.No toll is charged on this stretch after the Allahabad high court on October 26, 2016, restrained the company from collecting toll on a petition filed by Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Association. The company had filed an appeal against this order, which is still pending consideration before the top court. The present application was moved in that petition.A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai agreed to allow the request of the company as an interim measure till it takes up the main appeal in March. The court permitted hoardings to be erected by the company on the Noida side of DND Flyway on payment of licence fee to the Noida authority at the rate of ₹125/ square feet per month to be deposited in advance. The Court clarified that it was an interim arrangement being made in the interest of maintaining the road.Representing the company, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued that the sole aim behind the action of the Noida authority was to irreparably harm the financial assets of his client and to negate its continued viability as a going concern. “It is a completely egregious act. This should not be done by a public authority. In 2010, the fee applicable to us under the advertisement policies of Noida was ₹50/sq ft that was increased to ₹125/sq ft in 2013, which we paid under protest. Now by a letter of December 31, 2018, the license fee to display advertisement along DND Flyway has been retrospectively increased to ₹300/sq ft. This issue is pending in arbitration which is also stayed.”Senior advocate Ravindra Kumar, who represented the Noida authority, opposed the application by claiming that the company defaulted payment of licence fee since 2010 and has been handsomely earning revenue on the Delhi side of DND Flyway, which was sufficient to maintain the roads. “The right to put up hoarding was not part of the Concession agreement. From April 1, 2019, they have no permission. The arbitral tribunal is not concerned with this issue,” said Kumar. However, being an interim arrangement, the court clarified that its order will not create any equity for any side.The company, represented by the law firm Karanjawala & Co, told the court the obligations cast on it regarding the operations and maintenance of the bridge under the Concession Agreement required constant maintenance of the road, besides making necessary arrangements for traffic and security arrangements that required day-to-day expenses. The company produced audited balance sheets to show the financial stress on the company due to the general economic slowdown brought by the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/supreme-court-allows-dnd-flyway-operator-to-put-hoardings-in-noida-101642626744066.html
20-01-2022||Noida||In Greater Noida, CM Yogi Adityanath takes a dig at opposition over ‘Noida jinx’||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday reviewed the Covid-19 situation at Gautam Budh Nagar’s Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida and lauded the efforts of the state and central government to ensure better Covid management during the first and second wave of the pandemic. He also took at a jibe at the opposition and said he was happy to have visited the district several times during his tenure, unlike his predecessors who avoided the district as “they valued their life and position” more than the people here, he said.“After taking control of the Covid-19 situation during the first wave, we witnessed an oxygen crisis across the country during the second wave and seeing the situation, the Centre made all possible efforts to supply oxygen to all parts of the country, via the railways as well as airways. In Uttar Pradesh, 550 new oxygen plants have been added, of which 11 are in Gautam Budh Nagar,” he said. Wednesday’s was Adityanath’s first visit to the 500-bed hospital in Kasna region of Greater Noida. Talking about the Covid vaccination programme, Adityanath said Uttar Pradesh has achieved over 95% coverage of the first dose vaccine and 62% coverage of the second dose. “Uttar Pradesh has a target of vaccinating 1,400,000 children between the age of 15 and 18 years of whom we have already given the first dose to 6,28,300 children. On the other hand, 52,900 beneficiaries have been given the precautionary dose in Uttar Pradesh so far,” he said. “Gautam Budh Nagar district has carried out the vaccination drive very efficiently, as it has already completed 100% coverage of the first dose vaccine and 92% coverage of the second dose. In the 15-18 age group, 11,600 doses have been administered while the precautionary dose coverage is about 46%,” he said.The CM further appreciated the efforts of frontline and health-care workers, administration, health department and local surveillance teams comprising ASHA and Aanganwadi workers in controlling the spread of Covid-19 infection in the district.“Last year, we were anticipating that the third wave of Covid-19 would hit us in August or September 2021. However, we were able to control that. Now, the Omicron variant of Covid-19 has spread rapidly across the country but if we look at hospitalisation figures, less than 1% of the infected cases require hospitalisation. In Uttar Pradesh, only 0.5% of the total active cases are hospitalised. Similarly in Gautam Budh Nagar, of the 9,500 active cases, only 200 are in hospital. In fact, even those cases are of patients who are suffering from other comorbidities,” the chief minister said while addressing the media.He further said, “The third wave is less harmful as compared to the second wave. But it is a disease and we have to save children, women and senior citizens. For that, we have also installed 5,500 public address systems to give out public awareness messages. People should avoid crowded places. We are hopeful that we will be successful in controlling and saving lives and livelihoods during this third wave too”. The CM’s visit comes close to the heels of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections slated to begin from February 10. Taking a jibe at the opposition, Adityanath said he has been fortunate to have visited the district a number of times in the past few years. “The district is of prime importance as it is close to the national capital and there is a frequent movement of people across the state borders. My predecessors used to shy away from visiting this district as their own life and position were more important to them than the people of this area. However, I am thankful that I got the opportunity to visit this district several times,” said Adityanath.The chief minister was referring to a well-known superstition among previous government heads that if a chief minister visited Gautam Budh Nagar district, their government would collapse or they would not be re-elected. At GIMS, Adityanath inspected the flu out-patient department (OPD) , control room and vaccination area. “He also interacted with patients admitted in isolation ward and inquired about the state of heath facilities available at the hospital. GIMS is a L-2 category hospital that has a total of 500 beds. Of these, 450 are Covid beds and currently 54 beds are occupied by Covid patients,” said Dr (Brig) RK Gupta, director, GIMS.After a review of Covid situation at GIMS, the chief minister later visited Kayampur village, five kilometres away. There, he interacted with the local surveillance team (or nigrani samiti) at a government school in the village. “The local health teams have done exceptional work in the past two years of the pandemic and I thank them for their service. The focus of health teams should now be to ensure full coverage of the precautionary dose and the vaccination of children aged 15 to 18 years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/in-greater-noida-cm-yogi-adityanath-takes-a-dig-at-opposition-over-noida-jinx-101642626384088.html

The suspects have been captured in CCTV cameras and search is on, said police. Abhay Bhadauria (36), a resident of Noida Sector 71, said his family owns a four-storey building in Noida’s Sector 70. “The flats of the building have been rented out to tenants. The incident took place on the first floor, where a family lives. The husband (52) was out of station while his wife (50) and daughter (25) were in the flat around 3:30pm. Three suspects swiftly entered the building premises and went to the first floor. They knocked the door and the daughter opened the gate. The suspects pushed her aside and held the mother at knife point,” said Bhadauria. He said the three suspects immediately ransacked the flat and fled with gold jewellery worth ₹8 lakh and some cash. The mother-daughter soon informed the neighbours and police. A police team reached the spot but the suspects had escaped by then. Bhadauria said he too reached the spot after getting information. He said the woman sustained injuries for resisting the robbery attempt of the suspects. In the CCTV footage, the first suspect is seen wearing a sweater with a hood and carrying a backpack.

20-01-2022||Kolkata||Mukul Roy didn’t join TMC, his lawyer to Bengal speaker at anti-defection hearing||KOLKATA: Refuting charges of defection brought by the Bharatiya Janata Party, Mukul Roy, who returned to the Trinamool Congress on June 11 last year, told the West Bengal legislative assembly Speaker through his lawyers on Wednesday that he is still in the BJP and never joined the ruling party. Roy, a founder member of the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC, joined the BJP in 2017 following differences with chief minister Mamata Banerjee, and was appointed and was appointed BJP’s national vice-president. His son, Subhranshu, also joined the saffron camp but returned to the TMC with his father in June last year.Roy contested and won the Krishnanagar North assembly seat on a BJP ticket in the March-April polls last year. His son also contested on a BJP ticket but lost.Mukul Roy, who is ailing, has not attended any public meeting in months. Bengal assembly officials aware of Wednesday’s hearing on the disqualification petition filed by the BJP said Roy’s lawyers have argued that he never left the BJP. They argued that Roy’s visit to the TMC headquarters, where he was greeted by Banerjee and her nephew Abhishek on June 11 in the presence of the media, was a mere courtesy call. The lawyers cited the judgments of several courts to back their argument. The Supreme Court on Monday told Bengal assembly speaker Biman Banerjee to decide the disqualification petition filed against Mukul Roy under the anti-defection law within two weeks. Leader of the opposition in the assembly Suvendu Adhikari filed the disqualification petition in June last year.The speaker had filed an appeal before the Supreme Court through senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi challenging a September 28 order of the Calcutta high court asking him to produce the decision taken on the appeal for Roy’s disqualification.The Calcutta high court passed the order in September after hearing a petition filed by BJP legislator Ambika Roy who challenged Roy’s nomination as chairman of Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on July 9, two days before he returned to the TMC. Mukul Roy was subsequently declared the PAC chairman by the speaker.“There was a long hearing today. Mukul Roy’s lawyers presented their arguments. Adhikari’s lawyers said they want to raise a legal point at a later date. The hearings are over. I do not want to prolong the process. I will announce my decision as soon as possible as ordered by the Supreme Court,” the speaker told the media after the hearing. Adhikari said he has very little faith in the judgement of the speaker. “We have to place our belief in the Supreme Court. I do not have much faith in the hearing held at the assembly,” said Adhikari.In response, the speaker said the leader of the opposition was frustrated.“Adhikari seems to have no faith in either the judiciary or the assembly. He appears to be frustrated because his role as leader of the opposition is very unimpressive. No BJP legislator has taken part in any assembly event apart from the official proceedings. They are never seen any event held on the assembly campus. This never happened in the past,” said the Speaker.TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said, “I do not know what Roy’s lawyers said at the hearing. None of us were present there. As far as I can remember he was in the BJP when he filed his nomination for the post of PAC chairman.”Bengal BJP spokesperson Jay Prakash Majumdar took a swipe at the TMC.“In the TMC, there seems to be no limit to lying. The entire world saw on television that Mukul Roy was welcomed back by Mamata and Abhishek Banerjee. Even he called it his homecoming. How can someone lie like this in parliamentary democracy?” said Majumdar.Avoiding a direct reply, TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said: “Roy is a BJP legislator for the first three days of the week. He is not with any party for the next three days. And, on Sunday, he has tea with TMC leaders. Does Adhikari have any objection to that ? Instead of questioning Roy, he should first clarify his father Sisir Adhikari’s political position. His father is a TMC Lok Sabha MP but joined the BJP at a rally of Union home minister Amit Shah.”The TMC moved a petition before Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla last year, demanding Sisir Adhikari’s disqualification. Birla has held two hearings on the petition so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mukul-roy-didn-t-join-tmc-his-lawyer-to-bengal-speaker-at-anti-defection-hearing-101642625484041.html

Meanwhile, the district reported 1,402 fresh infections on Wednesday, taking the number of cases reported in the month of January to over 21,000. According to data available with the district health department, on January 13, active cases in the district had crossed 10,000 and was on the rise since then till January 17, when there was a slight drop. The active cases have been declining in the past few days as more recoveries are being recorded. Additionally, more recoveries were reported on Wednesday than the total number of fresh infections reported in a day. This has also happened for the first time in the district since the current wave started around mid-December. Hospitalisations are also reducing as officials said just about 100 patients are taking treatment for Covid in the hospitals across the district. “We are keeping a close watch on the cases, which have been reducing in the past few days, but it is too soon to say that there is a downward trend. Our focus is to keep hospitalisations low and prevent the spread of infection,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate adding that most of the patients, who are admitted in hospitals, are those whose condition is stable but they do not have adequate space for proper isolation. Health officials say that while there are positive developments in Noida, one still needs to stay cautious. “Cases are reducing here and in neighbouring Delhi as well. However, there are still a high number of cases in Ghaziabad,” said Dr Manoj Kushwaha, district surveillance officer.The vaccination status in Gautam Budh Nagar has crossed 94% with around 1,464,000 people jabbed with the second dose of the Covid vaccine. The estimated population in the district is about 1,556,000. According to district data, over 2,097,000 people have taken the first dose and 15,541 beneficiaries have taken the precautionary dose. Over 15,000 doses are being given daily in the district to complete administering both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine to eligible beneficiaries within this month. Officials are also targeting vaccinating all those in the 15-17 age group by the end of the month. This category includes around 115,000 children, of whom 70,000 have taken the shot so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/1402-fresh-covid-cases-emerge-in-noida-active-cases-fall-below-10k-101642624584041.html

He said that compoundable offence could be regularised after charging a penalty, the second category could be the violation carried out within the boundary wall and the encroachment on the government land could fall in the third category, he said, and added that the authorities should in the initial stage regularise the need-based changes carried out in the first and second categories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/need-based-changes-chb-s-non-official-members-suggest-one-time-settlement-on-delhi-pattern-101642624404173.html

20-01-2022||Noida||Ghaziabad: Congress yet to declare candidates for Sahibabad and Modinagar seats||All major political parties have declared their candidates for all five assembly seats in Ghaziabad these upcoming elections, except for Congress, which is yet to announce candidates for Sahibabad and Modinagar assembly seats till Wednesday evening. The Congress said the names would be declared by late Wednesday or Thursday. The last date for filing of nominations is January 21 and major political parties such as the Aam Aadmi Party, Bharatiya Janata Party, Samajwadi Party along with its ally the Rashtriya Lok Dal and Bahujan Samaj Party have already declared their candidates and several of those candidates have also filed their nomination papers. The Congress, on the other hand, has given tickets to its district president Bijendra Yadav from Muradnagar, Yameen Malik from Loni and Sushant Goyal from the Ghaziabad seat. “There has been some delay for the two seats of Modinagar and Sahibabad and it is expected that the names will be declared soon. The delay could be due to different considerations but Congress will contest on all five seats in Ghaziabad,” said Dolly Sharma, member of All India Congress Committee and spokesperson of UP Congress Committee. Party sources said one of the two pending tickets may be offered to a woman candidate. The Congress has fared poorly in the past three assembly elections of 2017, 2012 and 2007 when none of its candidates could secure a win in the district. During the 2017 elections, all five assembly seats were won by the BJP while in 2012, four were won by the BSP -- Zakir Ali from Loni, Wahab Chaudhary from Muradnagar, Amarpal Sharma from Sahibabad and Suresh Bansal from Ghaziabad. The Modingar seat was won by Sudesh Sharma of the Rashtriya Lok Dal. During the 2007 elections, there were three seats in Ghaziabad which were won by Sunil Sharma of the BJP (Ghaziabad), Raj Pal Singh from the BSP (Modinagar) and Raj Pal Tyagi, who contested as an independent from the Muradnagar seat. Political experts said the Congress not deciding the two seats shows the lax approach of the party. “If they declare candidates a day or two before the filing of nominations, the candidate will not be able to prepare fully while the other parties have planned their candidates well in advance. Maybe, the delay or not declaring candidates could be a strategy. If they don’t field candidates, the anti-BJP votes will go to the strongest contender, otherwise they may get divided,” said KK Sharma, associate professor (history) from MM College, Modinagar. Other experts said the delay in declaring candidates will send wrong signals to the party cadre. “The base of the Congress party is still not much in Uttar Pradesh as they have lost the previous elections. However, they should further elevate their leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in the party and this will help the Congress gain larger ground in UP in the next five or 10 years. She has the leadership qualities and can identify issues that concern people,” said Dr Virendra Singh, associate professor (political science) from MMH Degree College, Ghaziabad. “She has the ability to raise issues which other political parties do not or may not,” he added. Led by Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the Congress has given 40% party tickets to women candidates and also made some populist announcements for them.

He alleged that his wife continuously suffered from pain and redness in abdomen after delivery and her situation kept deteriorating.As per FIR, the two doctors -- Poonam Yadav and Anurag Yadav -- are the directors of Shiva Hospital in Gurugram’s Sector 12, where Diwas’s wife Swastika Rai was operated on both occasions.The FIR against the duo was registered under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 336 (act negligently as to endanger human life), 337 (causing grievous hurt by act of negligence), 417 (cheating) and 506 (criminal intimidation). Satender Singh, station house officer (SHO) of Sector 14 police station, said that the FIR against both doctors was registered on direction of a court of judicial magistrate. “In such cases, investigation is carried out on directions of the district’s chief medical officer. Police would seek his help to form a team to investigate the case,” he said. When contacted, hospital manager Pramod Pathak, speaking on behalf of the doctors, said the patient’s attendant was apprised that there was some problem in her intestine which needed medical attention. “Surgery was performed after due consent from the attendant. The first time Swastika was admitted at the hospital was for a delivery. Both mother and girl child were discharged in a healthy condition. Dr Poonam had performed the delivery,” Pathak said.When asked, Pathak said he would have to look into who had performed surgery the second time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-2-doctors-booked-for-leaving-cotton-gauze-in-abdomen-101642623506851.html
20-01-2022||Noida||Dissent in BJP after party tickets go to incumbent MLAs in Ghaziabad||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s decision to field all five incumbent MLAs of Ghaziabad in the upcoming assembly election has not gone down well with the party cadre, especially in the Sahibabad and Ghaziabad assembly segments, said party sources. The party is facing stiff opposition from within its ranks, especially from Purvanchalis (people from eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) who have a large presence in Ghaziabad district. According to rough estimates, the Sahibabad and Ghaziabad assembly segments have about 400,000-500,000 Purvanchalis and they are considered one of the largest voter bases which is eyed by all political parties com elections. A section of Purvanchalis publicly dissented on January 16, a day after the BJP announced that its tickets in Ghaziabad will go to the five sitting MLAs -- Sunil Sharma (Sahibabad), Atul Garg (Ghaziabad), Nand Kishor Gurjar ( Loni), Dr Manju Shivach (Modinagar), and Ajit Pal Tyagi ( Muradnagar). A large group of people staged a protest outside the Indirapuram police station and demanded a ticket for BJP leader Sacchidanand Rai from Sahibabad, which is the largest of the five assembly segments and comprises the more urban localities of Indirapuram, Vasundhara and Vaishali. Rai is a coordinator of the Uttar Pradesh BJP and a former DIG (revenue). The police had to intervene and break up the protest and also register an FIR against the protesters for violating Covid protocols. The dissent was also vociferous on social media, with several netizens claiming that Rai would contest as an independent from Sahibabad. On Wednesday, Sanjay Singh, BJP councillor from ward 100 of Indirapuram, held a press briefing along with a few associations representing Purvanchalis and claimed that those opposing the ticket to MLA Sharma were only doing so to grab a ticket. “We held a press briefing along with several organisations representing Purvanchals who said that they are with our party. Those opposing the issue of ticket are protesting only to get a ticket and they may have some personal grudge as well. They are trying to project the protest as a public outburst against the BJP but that is absolutely not the case,” Sanjay Singh said. When HT reached out to Rai, his PRO Suraj Singh issued a response on the leader’s behalf. “All organisations of Purvanchalis that protested against the ticket were of view that our leader (Rai) should be the candidate.But he is still with the BJP and will not contest as an independent candidate,” he said. The dissent in Sahibabad again came to the fore when BJP leader KK Shukla joined the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and was declared that party’s candidate from Ghaziabad. BSP district president Virendra Jatav said, “He is now our candidate from Ghaziabad in place of former BSP MLA Suresh Bansal, who is still in hospital after testing positive for Covid.” Shukla was the vice-president of the BJP’s youth wing in 1998 and its district president in 2001. He contested the 2007 assembly elections on a BJP ticket from Gonda (eastern UP) and also served as the regional vice-president of the party in western UP. “People in Ghaziabad have been demanding a hospital, degree college, and proper drainage system since long. I assured them these past four years that the BJP MLA would fulfil these demands. But nothing was done. When tickets were issued to the sitting MLAs, I approached the party brass to reconsider the decision but they did not do so. So, I joined the BSP and also got a ticket from Ghaizabad. Now, I will fulfil those pending promises,” said Shukla, who hails from Gonda. He added that his candidature will also earn him support of Purvanchalis, besides others. The Ghaziabad BJP president Sanjeev Sharma said issuing tickets to sitting MLAs was a party decision. “While the other parties are finding it difficult to field candidates, we have about 15 to 20 names for each seat. So, people who did not get tickets may feel offended. The party will not face any issue from the people of Purvanchal as it commands a major position among them. Many from Purvanchal had come to us and were pacified. There is no dissent whatsoever,” he said. “Shukla joining the BSP and getting a ticket will also not affect our Purvanchali voter base. It is a blessing in disguise as former MLA Suresh Bansal would have been a formidable opponent,” Sharma said. The office bearers of the Purabiya Jan Kalyan Parishad, a socio -cultural organisation of Purvanchalis, said their voters are silently gauging the ongoing events. “We have about 10-12 lakh (about 1.2 million) people from Purvanchal living in Ghaziabad (across all five seats). A majority of these voters is in Sahibabad and Ghaziabad constituencies and they have the ability to decide which candidate to vote for. Like the other voters, people from Purvanchal will also vote on local issues and development agenda,” said Rakesh Tiwari, national general secretary of the association.Loni Nagar Palika chief offers to resign from BJP In another development on Wednesday, chairperson of the Loni Nagar Palika has shot a letter to the BJP brass, offering her husband’s and her resignation from the primary membership of the party. Ranjeeta Dhama is the present chairperson of the Loni Nagar Palika said she is upset about party offering the Loni ticket to sitting MLA Nand Kishor Gurjar and also alleged that a conspiracy had put her husband, Manoj Dhama, in jail in a criminal case last year. Dhama in her letter offered to resign from the primary membership of the party, along with her husband, as their voices were not heard. Dhama did not respond to calls to reach her for comment. BJP district president Dinesh Singhal said he is in receipt of the letter. “We have received her letter and we will discuss the issues with her before issuing a statement,” he said.

20-01-2022||Chandigarh||BJP multiplied farmers’ woes, not their income: Congress||The Congress on Wednesday targeted the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for “failing the farmers”, stating that the DNA of the Modi government is “anti-farmer and anti-labourer”. Releasing a booklet on the issues and challenges of farming community titled “Aamdani na hui doguni, dard sau guna” (income has not doubled but pain increased a hundred times), Congress national general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala said that the poor, labour and farming class of the country had voted, relying on Modi Ji’s promises, but he betrayed them. “They (PM and BJP) have attacked the farmers, in whose hands the fortune of nation lies and the country will never forgive them,” he said at a press conference. Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu was also present. Surjewala said that it has been six years since Modi had promised the farmers of the country at his rally in Bareilly on February 28, 2016, that he would double the farmers’ income by 2022. “Now, it is 2022 and the income has not doubled, the pain has definitely increased several folds,” he said before listing the anti-farmer steps of the NDA government at the Centre. Sidhu, while speaking on his Punjab model on agriculture, said that everybody tries to do politics on farm issues, but no one has given a road map for resurrection. “There are many things that the state government can do, but sadly in the last 25 years no significant policy has been introduced to promote diversification and to increase farmers’ income,” he said, giving the mantra of “grow what you eat”. The PPCC chief said that in this politics of mudslinging and focus on freebies, the real issues are getting forgotten. “We need new “Farm Revolution 2.0” backed by good policies where farmer and small industry will come together,” he said, promising MSP on dal, oilseeds and maize with the government procuring, processing and marketing these through cooperatives and corporations. “Under the Punjab model, the government will pay half the wages of labour working in farms up to 5 acres. Logic is to give subsidy in the hands of farm labour, small farmer families, incentivise crop diversification and labour-intensive cultivation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-multiplied-farmers-woes-not-their-income-congress-101642622844823.html

Senior MC officials were present during the meeting and introduced themselves to the councillors. Both AAP and Congress expressed unhappiness over the way the meeting was called by the mayor. A senior AAP leader said that the mayor has no right to call a meeting, as her election is sub-judice and such a meeting should have been held in MC building itself.The Congress also maintained that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) mayor must first take other parties on board before calling meetings.In the House of 35 councillors, 13 are from BJP, 14 from AAP, seven from Congress and oner from Shiromani Akali Dal. The mayoral election, which was held on January 8, was marred by heavy ruckus in the House after one vote of AAP was declared void resulting in BJP’s victory.Immediately after her election, mayor had stated that she would take everybody along, over and above political affiliations.But on Wednesday, the political gulf among the three parties once again came into open. Congress president Subhash Chawla, said, “She is a minority and not a majority mayor. The BJP should bring minimum common programme of all the parties. We are not here for BJP’s agendas, but for city’s development.”Chandigarh AAP president Prem Garg, said, “It was not an official meeting. An official meeting has to be in the MC building. We do not recognise the mayor as the mayoral election was held fraudulently.”AAP has also challenged Kaur’s election in the Punjab and Haryana high court and the case is scheduled to come up for hearing on Thursday.Mayor Sarabjit Kaur maintained, “Rising above party lines, I tried to get councillors of all the parties on board and called up each of the councillors. It’s always the mayor who has called introductory meetings in the past. The meeting was called in a community centre in view of the surge in Covid cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhmc-congress-aap-skip-councillors-meeting-called-by-mayor-101642622665193.html
20-01-2022||Chandigarh||CHB to auction off eight of its plots in IT Park||The Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) is planning to auction off eight of its plots in IT Park in a month’s time. The plots, with sizes varying from 3.5 to 6 acre, will be available for developers who in turn will be permitted to construct residential multi-storey buildings there.The decision to proceed with the auction of the plots was taken in a recent meeting of the board chaired by UT adviser Dharam Pal.Confirming the development, CHB chief executive officer Yashpal Garg said that these residential plots will be offered on freehold basis. The CHB is working on the terms and conditions and deliberating on fixing the reserve price, he added.The project land is part of 123 acres that CHB got back from Parsvnath Developers after a long-drawn legal battle. It was in October 2006 that CHB had decided to develop residential, commercial and other infrastructure with Parsvnath Developers at IT Park, but project didn’t take off because of multiple reasons.Thereafter, CHB failed to sell 18 residential and commercial sites at an e-auction in 2018. Due to the high reserve prices, not many developers showed interest in the auction.

Sukhbir was addressing a gathering in Tarn Taran organised by former MLA Harmeet Singh Sandhu to induct more than a dozen Congress leaders, including former PPCC members Gurminder Singh Rataul, Vijaypal Chaudhari and Tarn Taran Mahila Congress president Anita Verma. “Channi has been gathering money. Today, ₹10 crore has been seized. His nephew has been controlling most of the things in the government, besides running the mining network for the last five years…Channi should resign on moral grounds,” Sukhbir said. Before the Tarn Taran event, Sukhbir visited Amritsar and inducted Punjab Labourfed chairman Jagtar Singh Gosal, three sitting municipal councillors, various Block Samiti members, sarpanches and a host of other Congress office-bearers into the SAD. Speaking to the media at Amritsar and Tarn Taran, Sukhbir said the recovery of cash by the ED from the house of Channi’s nephew has vindicated our accusation that Channi runs the biggest sand mining mafia in the state. He also demanded that his official residence at Chandigarh should also be raided as there were reports of him shifting cash from his Morinda house to the CM residence. Badal said that after forming the SAD-BSP government in the state, this case would be thoroughly probed. “We would recover every penny of the ill-gotten money and prosecute him for running illegal Sand mining mafia in the state,” he said. Sukhbir said that AAP convener and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal was a “fraud” and naming Mann as the CM candidate was just a gimmick. “Kejriwal is a known Punjab opponent who had demanded the closure of thermal plants in Punjab; had favoured completion of the SYL Canal to take Punjab’s water to Delhi; and also went to the Supreme Court, demanding registration of cases against Punjab farmers for stubble burning,” Sukhbir said. Replying to a media query, the SAD president said that AAP was allotting tickets to people with a criminal background. He categorically mentioned Dera Baba Nanak candidate facing a police case for his involvement in terror activities. “Similarly, some of Ludhiana district candidates were infamous extortionists and Bathinda Rural candidate is known for committing frauds with innocent people of Malwa,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/channis-link-with-sand-mafia-in-the-open-must-quit-as-cm-sukhbir-badal-101642622425682.html

On Wednesday, a total of nine structures were sealed in Badshahpur, sectors 38, 66, 67, Kadarpur road, and an illegal structure of a private colony was demolished in Sector 69, according to a release issued by the civic body on Wednesday.The MCG officials said that all the anti-encroachment drives were conducted under heavy police protection and no untoward incident or resistance was reported in any of the drives.“Before any type of construction in MCG limits, it is mandatory to take building plan approval as per rules. The constructions which are done without prior approval are unauthorised, and the action of sealing and demolishing such constructions is being done by the MCG from time to time,” said SS Rohilla, public relations officer, MCG.Rohilla further said that MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja has constituted separate enforcement teams to take action against unauthorised constructions, encroachments, and illegal occupations in all four zones of the civic body.The last time that the MCG executed an anti-encroachment drive was on October 4 last year, when seven illegal structures were demolished in Nathupur village. Just a week before this, they had demolished and sealed two structures each in the Palam Vihar area.The officials said that no such drive was conducted in the past three months due to construction and demolition ban imposed in the wake of high air pollution levels.“Since mid-October last year, the Graded Response Action Plan measures were imposed in the city. For most of the last three months, there were bans on construction as well as demolition due to which the drives had been suspended. Now that they are permitted, we have restarted the drives,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.The commission for air quality management (CAQM) allowed construction and demolition activities in the national capital region (NCR) to resume on December 20 last year following improvement in air quality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-mcg-demolishes-13-illegal-structures-seals-24-101642622363852.html

The accused were identified as Suraj, who works as a painter in the senior section engineer (SSE) works’ wing of railways in Rajpura (Ambala Division), and Prakash Chand, a scrap dealer in Ludhiana.Suraj, who is said to have got the job on compassionate grounds, resides in Railway Colony, Rajpura, and hails from Shyam Nagar of Ludhiana. He is also a drug addict, RPF officials said.They added that there were numerous complaints of tap thefts on various trains in Patiala, Phillaur, Ludhiana, Rajpura and Ambala last month.“Passengers used to complain of water leakage in toilets which had become a headache for railway staff. Following this, teams were deputed on trains to nab the culprits,” said an RPF official. On January 13, during checking on Gangasatluj Express train, an RPF team found Suraj leaving the toilet in haste. His clothes were drenched and he was carrying a bag. On suspicion, the team checked the toilet and found a tap missing. Suraj was immediately nabbed. He claimed to be a railway employee who had come to repair the tap, but on checking, officials recovered five taps from his bag and arrested him. During investigation, the accused confessed to his crime and revealed that he had previously carried out thefts on trains, including Mumbai CSMT Amritsar Express, Paschim Express, Dadar, Punjab Mail, etc.“The thefts took place between Phagwara and Ambala, Patiala and Dhuri-Ludhiana sections,” added an officer.Suraj was booked under Sections 3 RP (UP) Act dated at Ludhiana RPF Post on January 13.Suraj further revealed that he sold the taps to a local junk dealer Prakash Chand, who was eventually held on January 16, after numerous raids and traps. “As soon the scrap dealer got to know about Suraj’s arrest, he fled but landed in police net after three days. Around 40 taps were recovered from him, which were stolen by Suraj and sold to him,” said an official.

The residents tried to obstruct the process and pelted stones at police in which two female personnel were injured. Two persons have been arrested and 200 residents booked for obstruction and other relevant sections of IPC,” said Sube Singh, spokesperson for the Faridabad police.The MCF had cleared illegal encroachments from the forest land in June-July last year when the Supreme Court fixed a six-week deadline to remove the 6,600 dwelling units in the Khori village. A senior official from MCF, requesting anonymity, said, “A team went to Khori village on Wednesday with around nine JCB machines to raze illegal structures where residents had been illegally staying for the past six months.”Yashpal Yadav, MCF commissioner, did not respond to calls for comment.Residents, meanwhile, alleged that their belongings were set afire by police officials and they were lathicharged. “Around 10.30am, MCF officials, along with police personnel, came to Khori and started demolishing our makeshift houses using JCB machines. When residents resisted, they were lathicharged and even their auto rickshaws were burnt. No notice was given to us. After the demolition drive that was conducted last year, no rehabilitation has been done till now,” said Muskan, a resident of Khori. However, police officials denied the allegations and said that residents had pelted stones at them. Around 1,000 families had been staying in Khori village since the MCF conducted the demolition drive last year, the officials said. The district authorities on Monday released a list of over 1,400 residents who were allotted flats at Dabua colony in Faridabad as part of the rehabilitation process. The residents have been asked to submit their documents and bank account details at a temporary MCF office set up near Khori village on January 25 to proceed with the EWS flat allotment process, the officials said. Meanwhile, activists and scholars working in the area and supporting the residents fight the case in the apex court also said that rehabilitation has been promised but the residents have not been given an alternative place to stay yet. Ishita Chatterjee, a PhD scholar from the University of Melbourne, who has been studying Khori village, said, “The residents have continued to stay in the same location since there is no other option. They have not been given any compensation, and the rehabilitation flats are not ready. So, the question remains -- where will they go? After the forced eviction, the government has further augmented this problem.” Nirmal Gorana, general secretary of Bandhua Mukti Morcha, an organisation that has been working with the residents of Khori village to seek rehabilitation, said, “After demolishing 10,000 houses, giving houses to 1,403 families and rendering the rest homeless is a grave injustice. So many people applied for homes, but they have not been given any alternative accommodation. They are not even being allowed to live amid debris in their original place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/khori-two-held-200-booked-for-disrupting-demolition-drive-101642621943699.html

20-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Cold wave, Covid curbs dim poll mood in south Malwa||BATHINDA: Coronavirus-induced restrictions and intense cold wave in Punjab have dimmed the regular festive mood during the elections.Unlike the previous state polls or even the municipal elections held during the second Covid wave in February last year, Bathinda and other districts of south Malwa are witnessing low-key electioneering. No political rallies are permitted to check huge gatherings amid a surge in Covid cases. Usual scenes of rickshaw-mounted blaring loudspeakers, poster wars and buntings in markets are absent from urban and rural segments this time. Following directions of the Election Commission, the candidates and the ticket claimants are holding small election meetings. Besides, politicians prefer door-to-door meetings with electors in the comfort of their houses.Political managers are keeping the election meetings a subdued affair. Candidates are avoiding going “live” or posting videos on their Facebook pages to avoid getting caught on the wrong foot by the election authorities. According to the photographs posted by the candidates from Bathinda, Mansa, Faridkot, Muktsar and other districts, on their Facebook pages, considered to be the most popular social media platform in Punjab, Covid-appropriate behaviour is missing.Leaders and people are seen without facemasks and social distancing norm is not followed.In Bathinda Urban, incumbent Congress legislator and finance minister Manpreet Badal is banking upon his close team managed by brother-in-law Jaijeet Singh Johal to maintain a connect with voters. Manpreet’s wife Vinu Badal and party councillors are actively meeting voters.At the high-stake Gidderbaha segment in Muktsar, two-time Congress MLA Amrinder Singh Raja Warring has been visiting 6-7 villages every day. His wife Amrita Warring is teaming up to better connect with voters.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) nominee and incumbent MLA from Talwandi Sabo Baljinder Kaur is also meeting villagers at their houses and shops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-cold-wave-covid-curbs-dim-poll-mood-in-south-malwa-101642621223556.html
20-01-2022||Chandigarh||HPSC scam: Vigilance bureau’s challan reveals deep-rooted nexus||Whether it is recruitment of dental surgeons, HCS officers, staff nurses or ANMs under the HPSC – the challan presented by Haryana state vigilance bureau points to deep-rooted recruitment scam, wherein jobs were ‘sold’ at the cost of ₹10 to ₹35 lakh per candidate.The matter is still under investigation and high profile officers are allegedly involved. From an HCS officer to the one that prepared results and other agencies are involved in this multi-crore scam.On January 17, the vigilance bureau has presented a challan in the Panchkula court against the three arrested accused, including the then Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) deputy secretary Anil Nagar who are allegedly involved in the HPSC recruitment scam, under Sections 7 and 7A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Sections 420, 466, 468, 471 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 8(3)(4) of the Haryana Public Examination (Prohibition of Unfair Means) Act, 2021.The case dates back to November 17, 2021 when the vigilance bureau got a written complaint from a Hisar resident regarding the scam.The complainant had stated that two friends had been planning to expose corruption in the examination process for the past several years and have now got success.The challan mentioned that the complainant came across Naveen, who charged ₹35 to 40 lakh per candidate to get their dental surgeon exam cleared. All they had to do was answer 35 to 40 questions. The dental surgeon exam was held on September 29, 2021 and they got hold of two candidates, one of which is Dalbir Singh.“The candidate copy was given to Naveen, which had marked 60-62 questions but the final copy had 172 questions answered. Eight days before the result was officially announced, he informed us that our candidate has cleared the exam and asked for ₹35 lakh bribe,” the challan mentioned.The complainant approached the vigilance bureau, which arrested Naveen from the parking of Sector 5, Panchkula with ₹20 lakh – the initial amount of the bribe.His arrest led them to Ashwani Sharma, who prepares results for various posts under the HSSC and the HPSC. “Together, we cleared exams of dental surgeons of eight candidates and charged ₹20 lakh each. It includes candidate Dalbir Singh as well. Bribe from seven candidates has been handed over to Ashwani:” as stated in the challan.Naveen allegedly confessed that apart from this examination, in HCS exam, 2021 they got ₹20 lakh each from two candidates, then exams of 40 staff nurses, four VLDA, and 15-16 ANMs were cleared, and ₹10 lakh per candidate was taken.Based on his confession and other evidence, Ashwani Sharma was arrested and ₹1.07 crore was recovered. Ashwani, who runs a data processing company, said he came in contact with Naveen around one year back.“He gave me roll numbers of five candidates and I got their pre-exam of HCS cleared. The bribe was given to Anil Nagar, HCS, deputy secretary, HPSC. He gave 13 such cases of dental to Nagar. In return, I used to get the work of data processing and ₹2 lakh commission:” the challan stated.He alleged that he has to give pending bribe amount of ₹1.07 crore to Nagar regarding dental surgeon exam. A WhatsApp call was made to Nagar and they spoke in “code language”, following which, Nagar asked him to visit his office. Later, the bribe amount was recovered from Nagar’s office.In the challan, it is mentioned that Anil Nagar, who was given the responsibility by the HPSC to conduct exams of HCS and dental surgeon, accepted that he took bribe of ₹25-30 lakh from candidates for dental surgeons’ exam and took ₹15-20 lakh for clearning pre-exam of HCS candidates.“I had asked Ashwani Sharma to get roll numbers and candidate OMR sheets of a few candidates. I got 15 such candidates. After scanning, we filled the blank answers on the original and carbon copy of the sheets. Of 15, five candidates passed the test and Ashwani Sharma had given me ₹1.30 crore:” stated the challan.It adds: “Then, Ashwani gave me 17 roll numbers of candidates in dental surgeon exam. Of these, 13 cleared the test. I got ₹2.08 crore from Ashwani.”The original OMR sheets and carbon copy of 14 roll numbers of the recruitment test for dental surgeons (Class-II), 20 OMR sheets of HCS (Ex Br) and other allied services preliminary examination was recovered from his office.On November 23, the three were sent to judicial custody and are lodged in Ambala jail.The investigation, in this case, is under progress, while the report of handwriting check, voice sample, etc is yet to arrive from FSL Madhuban.

Khaira had moved the HC seeking bail on December 13. A Mohali court had dismissed his plea on December 7. The order was reserved by high court bench of justice Sureshwar Thakur after completion of arguments from both sides. The central probe agency had raided Khaira’s premises in March 2021. Proceedings have been initiated in connection with a 2015 FIR. A court had convicted four persons and by the same order, Khaira was summoned as “additional accused”. In December 2017, the Supreme Court stayed his summoning. Khaira, who joined the Congress in June 2021, has all along maintained that these proceedings are part of a “political vendetta”. Khaira claimed that the ED’s action was a case of “witch-hunt” as he has been vocal against the three farm laws, later repealed by the Centre. The ED had initiated proceedings under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in January, even as there was a stay from the Supreme Court in the 2015 matter, he had claimed.The ED on the other hand, opposed the bail and claimed that he was an “accomplice” of drug case convicts and fake passport racketeers. The ED has also been claiming that he did not cooperate during the custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/money-laundering-case-hc-reserves-order-on-khaira-s-bail-plea-101642620863539.html

Secondly, most men who lost their battle to the virus had comorbidities.”Singh said that fortunately hospitalisation is low this time due to which the stress on healthcare system is also less. Health experts predict that though cases may dip in cities, there may be a surge in small towns and rural areas in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/85-of-ludhiana-s-covid-deaths-since-january-1-were-of-males-101642620624719.html

The farmers had alleged most people in the area are suffering from skin, eye and respiratory problems.The impact on the ambient air quality was also revealed in the report as the results of the parameters PM10 and PM2.5 were found to be exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) at all locations with the PM10 concentration ranging between 330 to 396 against the standard, while the PM2.5 concentration ranging between 109 to 167 against the standard.The fine particulate matter was ranging between 130 to 167 against the standard 60 UG/M3. Nickel concentration in the ambient air was found to be exceeding at three locations ranging between 25 to 43 in 24-hours against the standard annual average of 20. Groundwater sampling was conducted at seven locations from borewells upstream and downstream of the Panipat thermal power plant ash dyke.The microbiological parameters were found to be exceeding in six borewells and this needs further investigation to find out the root cause and remedial action, reveals the report.The soil samples from five locations of the study area were drawn and analysed and it was observed from the analyses of the soil samples that concentration of chromium, chopper nickel and zinc is on a much higher side in comparison of the target values of this heavy metal in soil specified by the World Health Organisation (WHO).Further, the report also revealed the impact of fly ash on the plant and seeds as analysis of the samples of paddy plant and seed grown on the soils indicate “very high” concentration for heavy metals for heavy metals-specific to thermal power plant fly as chromium, copper, nickel and zinc when compared with the target values of these heavy metals for the plant specified by the WHO, it mentioned.Panipat chief medical officer’s office, in its report submitted to the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) revealed that 91 cases of respiratory tract infection, 87 of hypertension, 35 of cardiac diseases, 32 of cancer, 44 of skin diseases, and 42 of eye diseases were reported in five villages – Assan Kalan, Khukhrana, Jattal, Untla and Sutana from 2016 to 2021.On the efforts being made to decrease the impact of fly ash, HSPCB member secretary S Naryanan said this report has been submitted by the joint committee to the NGT and will take necessary action as per the legal provisions against the lapses.“We will examine the deficiencies on the board-level and initiate action as deemed fit,” he added.On the other hand, Panipat thermal power plant executive engineer Jit Singh said two units of the power plant were operational and they are following the guidelines issued for management of fly ash. He said more efforts will be made for compliance of the NGT orders.

It is also contrary to the Haryana government’s claims of inoculating 100% eligible adults with the first dose.Till January 15, 68% (71,180) government school employees had been inoculated with both the doses. Haryana has 14,160 government-run schools in 22 districts of the state and 1,04,162 employees (majority teachers). According to official data, 16,167 teachers have taken only the first dose, and 16,815 teachers have so far not ventured out to take the first dose of the Covid vaccine.The data showed that every district has teachers who have not taken even the first dose.

And we cannot force them to vaccinate themselves in view of the recent court orders,” Pal said, pointing out that contrary to teachers, there is enthusiasm among students as till January 18, about 51% students in the 15 to 18 age group have been administered the first dose.Jhajjar district having 526 schools and total 3,857 teachers tops the list with 94% vaccination (single and both doses included) among teachers, followed by Karnal (93%), Rewari and Yamunanagar (92%) and Gurugram (90%).The data showed that Nuh district has the lowest of 60% vaccination among the school staff.

As per information, supporters of Congress leader Kamaljit Singh Karwal were setting up a poster when LIP supporters reached there and accused them of removing their leader’s poster.A scuffle broke out between both groups, and in the melee, the LIP chief’s brother Paramjit Singh Bains alias suffered injuries on his hand. A supporter of Karwal was also injured. Pamma was taken to the civil hospital, where Simarjit Bains also reached along with his supporters. Addressing mediapersons outside the hospital, Bains accused Karwal’s supporters of carrying firearms, weapons and sharp-edged weapons, and added, “We know how to fight elections. I warn Karwal to refrain from indulging in such political antics; otherwise we also know how to handle such people.”The LIP leader also said he will be lodging a formal complaint with the election commission. On the other hand, Karwal said that while his supporters were installing a poster, Pamma arrived at the spot and started threatening the Congress workers. “He was carrying a pistol and threatened our supporters. My supporters also suffered injuries in the incident. Bains has always indulged in politics of threat and intimidation, but not anymore. We have lodged a formal complaint in this regard and sought police action,” said Karwal.A local court had on Tuesday issued non-bailable warrants against the LIP chief in a case of alleged violation of Covid norms. The next hearing of the case is on January 28, in the court of additional chief judicial magistrate Harsimranjit Singh.Security failure exposedThe incident has yet again exposed the failure of the police in maintaining law-and order in the area which was already been declared sensitive. Police had inputs of a possible clash but cops did little to avert the problem. When the clash took place, hardly any cop was present at the spot.When asked, joint commissioner of police Ravcharan Singh Brar said he was conducting a meeting in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lok-insaaf-party-congress-workers-clash-in-ludhiana-3-injured-101642620206509.html
20-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Projects initiated by Capt in Patiala remain in limbo||Patiala : Most of the developmental projects initiated by former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh since 2017 continue to remain in limbo. The projects include setting up of heritage street, multi-crore canal-based water supply project in Patiala district, rejuvenation of seasonal Chhoti Nadi and Badi Nadi, dairy shifting project and renovation of Rajindra Lake.Though the projects progressed well during his tenure, the work on these has come to a standstill since his unceremonious ouster as the Punjab CM on September 18 last year. “In October 2020, the former chief minister announced ₹1,100-crore projects for Patiala, but political differences have slowed their pace,” said a senior Congress leader.In 2018, the state government kicked off the canal-based water supply project, which was later approved by Union ministries of finance and urban development. The project worth ₹503 crore was to be carried out as a joint venture by the state and the central government for which the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is the main financial sponsor. The government had set March 2022 as its deadline, but other than tenders and work orders, nothing has progressed so far, say officials. As far as dairy shifting project is concerned, despite spending ₹15 crore on the development of the site, the project failed to take off due to reluctance shown by dairy owners.In October last year, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi directed the Patiala administration to halt the shifting till all necessary facilities were made available at the new site.Similarly, the work on the rejuvenation of Badi Nadi and Chhoti Nadi, dream projects of the former CM, is moving at a snail’s pace after his ouster. Prior to this, Amarinder and his wife Patiala MP Preneet Kaur use to personally monitor the projects. The heritage street project, which was to be completed by December 2021, has already missed its deadline. Under the project costing around ₹41 crore, heritage street was to be constructed around Patiala’s 256-year-old Qila Mubarak.Patiala mayor Sanjeev Sharma Bittu said the projects were closely monitored by senior officials of state government during Amarinder’s tenure. “Now, the government has completely ignored these projects as nothing has been done in the past four months,” he said.Bittu added that he has written to Punjab CM Charanjit Channi and epartments concerned to expedite the work on these projects and take action against executing agency as per contract agreement.

20-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: Samajwadi Party aims to upset BJP’s applecart||The trend of a chief minister failing to get a second term and a majority of regimes being voted out in the next election has emboldened the state’s opposition parties, particularly the Samajwadi Party (SP), to believe that the 2022 UP polls could mark the end of the BJP government’s innings in the state. In deed, electoral history shows that no government has won a second successive term in Uttar Pradesh since 1989. Since 1952, the state also has never seen a chief minister (CM) returning to power to complete another term after a full five-year tenure. For over 15 years through the 1990s and the early part of 2000s, UP witnessed a fragmented polity till the situation changed decisively in 2007. Since then, the state has had regimes that won a clear majority. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) was the first in this respect. It won a majority on its own in 2007 for five years. The Samajwadi Party (SP) got a clear mandate in 2012 and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2017. In 2022, the Samajwadi Party led by Akhilesh Yadav with a substantial support base of Yadavs and Muslims has emerged as the main challenger. Currently, the battle for 2022 looks like a BJP vs SP contest though the BSP and the Congress are also fighting for power. “The fight, at this point, is certainly between the BJP and the SP. Other parties are trying, but they may not find favour with voters. The BSP’s base is vastly eroded, and at the same time, the party is suffering desertions. The Congress has no presence at the grassroots level,” said professor SK Dwivedi, political analyst and former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University. The Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party looks better prepared, including technologically, given that most of the campaign is now set to be through the digital mode and door-to-door canvassing because of the election commission’s Covid guidelines. Unlike the 2017 election, which reduced the SP’s tally from 224 seats in 2012 (in 403-member assembly) to just 47, the party has overcome the chaos fuelled by the Yadav family’s political feud. The feud, too, has been put behind with Akhilesh’s uncle and Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L) chief Shivpal Yadav joining the SP-led alliance. The fight between the then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Shivpal Yadav (the then public works department minister) had resulted in a long-drawn-out power struggle. Mulayam Yadav, the then Samajwadi Party national president, appeared to be a fence-sitter in the intra-family battle. Now, Akhilesh’s leadership is undisputed and his father stands by him. The uncle is now an ally and the party has no factions. To regain power, Akhilesh Yadav had spurred the party into an extensive campaign, leaving no stone unturned in its voter outreach. As a party with a significant presence across the state, its campaign included yatras, cycle rallies, Brahmin conferences, backward caste conferences, minority outreach and Dalit sammelans (conventions). It is bracing up for a virtual campaign with its Samajwadi digital wing. Just before the onset of the second wave of Covid-19, Akhilesh had travelled to 40 districts. Post the wave, and by the time the election schedule was announced, he had covered all regions on his Vijay Rath Yatra in a total of 10 phases. He also appeared to add a dash of soft Hindutva through his temple runs and the installation of a Lord Parshuram idol in Lucknow. The Samajwadi Party, along with consolidating its caste equations, expects the new poll promises by Akhilesh to work heavily in favour of the party, especially the 300 units free power to domestic consumers and free power to farmers. The party has also promised free laptops to students for higher studies; MSP (minimum statutory price) for all crops, interest-free loans, insurance, and pension for farmers. Akhilesh Yadav started inducting outsiders from other parties after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The SP’s alliance with the BSP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls failed to give the desired benefit, but it triggered the movement of BSP leaders to the SP. Many prominent BSP and Congress leaders, a couple of sitting BJP MLAs and regional satraps joined the Samajwadi Party. “People know that the SP is returning to power. More than 100 BJP MLAs are in touch with the SP,” said the party’s state spokesperson and former minister Rajendra Chaudhary. “Isn’t this trend of movement from all parties to the SP enough to show who is coming to power? Feeling the pulse of the voters, most of the disgruntled leaders of the BSP, the Congress, and the BJP are joining our party. There must be a strong wave in favour of the SP, and that is why leaders from other parties are trusting the visionary leadership of Akhilesh Yadav,” said Abdul Hafiz Gandhi, an SP spokesperson. Last week, the SP in a major show of strength vis-a-vis non-Yadav backwards classes vote bank, inducted three ex-ministers of Yogi Adityanath cabinet--Swami Prasad Maurya, Dharm Singh Saini, and Dara Singh Chauhan. A total of seven backward classes BJP MLAs, including two BJP ally MLAs joined the SP; one who joined the SP ally the RLD is now the RLD’s Jewar candidate. Akhilesh Yadav recognises the BJP is the SP’s only rival. It is ignoring all other BJP rivals in the 2022 poll arena. “The BJP is our only rival, no one else. We are not going to waste our energies on the BSP and the Congress. The Congress is a confused party. It doesn’t even know who it is fighting — the BJP or the SP,” said Udaiveer Singh, an SP MLC. While attacking the BJP, the SP often speaks of its allegedly divisive politics, farm laws, backward caste issues, and caste census. It has heavily criticised the state government for its supposed Covid-19 mismanagement, the prevailing law and order in the state and the country at large, the purported rise in crimes against women, and slump in the economy. Just after becoming the SP chief, Akhilesh Yadav struck an alliance with the Congress for the 2017 UP polls. The alliance failed. For the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Akhilesh allied with the BSP. This partnership, too, did not click. Now, Akhilesh is allying with small regional parties. He has allied with the SBSP,Mahan Dal, Janwadi Party (Socialist) for consolidation of backward caste votes. Since 2017, the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) has been the only constant companion of the SP. Akhilesh is looking for consolidation of votes of farmers, Jats, Muslim and Dalits in western UP. Defeating the BJP in a crowded poll landscape is going to be no easy task. “It will not be as easy as it was in 2012 for the SP to regain power. Then it was a clear bipolar contest against the discredited BSP government. The SP was the sole rival to the BSP, as both the Congress and the BJP were either virtually non-existent or very weak then. But now, the Congress and the BSP are trying hard too. They might not be in a position to win, but they might hurt the SP,” said professor SK Dwivedi. The SP faces an uphill battle to regain power in the state. In 2017, the BJP bagged 312 seats against its 47 seats in 2012. The SP fell to 47 seats from its 2012 tally of 224. The BJP’s vote share jumped to 39.67% (a swing of 24.67%). The SP’s vote share fell to 21.82% (a negative swing of 7.33%). Mayawati bagged 19 seats in 2017, but her party’s vote share was 22.23% — higher than the SP’s. 
20-01-2022||Chandigarh||ED raids: Channi alleges conspiracy to frame him||Chandigarh : A day after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raids on his nephew and others in an illegal sand mining case, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Wednesday accused the Centre of attempts to frame him in order to take revenge for the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Ferozepur visit fiasco. Channi said his nephew (Bhupinder Singh Honey) was tortured by the agency and even lured to name him in the case as part of a conspiracy to target the Congress and spoil its election. “I have learnt that those who had come to interrogate talked about the PM’s visit, saying they will not let us file our nomination papers or contest the elections,” the beleaguered chief minister alleged at a press conference at the party headquarters in Chandigarh. Accompanying him were deputy chief minister Sukhinder Singh Randhawa, cabinet ministers Brahm Mahindra and Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa. The ED had on Tuesday carried out raids at 10 places, including Honey’s house, in Pathankot, Mohali and other areas. It has recovered ₹10 crore so far during the anti-money laundering probe against illegal sand mining operations. Calling the ED raids at his nephew’s premises a “planted exercise”, Channi claimed his nephew was not even named in the 2018 FIR of the Nawanshahr police on which the agency’s action was based. “This is a conspiracy to trap me in this case. They are taking revenge because I stood with Punjab and people of Punjab during the Prime Minister’s visit to Ferozepur,” he said, questioning the timing of the ED raids. Accusing the Centre of “vindictive action”, the chief minister said that if Modi had to return, what was his fault? “Why revenge is being taken on me?” he asked, alleging that his ministers and other party leaders were also under pressure. He also alleged that whenever elections are to take place, the Centre uses the ED, Income Tax and other agencies to arm-twist political opponents. “During the West Bengal elections, Mamata Banerjee’s relatives were raided and cases registered. They did this in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra also. Like West Bengal, they will not be allowed to succeed in Punjab,” he said. Hitting out at Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Channi said that when the former’s nephew was arrested in a corruption case related to roads and sewerage works in Delhi, he cried vendetta but is happy when ED has carried out raids in Punjab. He also alleged that SAD leader Bikram Majithia against whom a case had been registered (under the NDPS Act) and former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh are behind the raids. “They are all mixed-up against the Congress…they cannot tolerate how a poor man’s son has become the chief minister,” said Channi. Asked why Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu has not spoken a word in his favour, the CM ducked the query.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ed-raids-channi-alleges-conspiracy-to-frame-him-101642619544731.html
20-01-2022||Mumbai||Local election results: MVA parties strong together||Mumbai: The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) were neck-and-neck in the rural and semi-urban local bodies that went to polls in two phases starting December, results declared on Wednesday revealed. Wednesday’s results, declared on a majority of the nagar panchayat seats that polled in 31 districts, indicated that the BJP has not lost much ground support among its local base but that the MVA partners would have to stick together if they wanted to win. Polls in 1,802 seats in 106 nagar panchayats across 31 districts, and 105 seats in district councils as well as 210 seats in 17 panchayat samitis in two districts, namely Bhandara and Gondia were conducted in two phases. On December 21, only general category seats polled, and on January 18, only Other Backward Class (OBC)-reserved seats that were re-notified as open category seats (412 in all), polled. The results of 1,638 nagar panchayat seats were declared on Wednesday. The results of nine nagar panchayats in Gadchiroli will be declared on Thursday, along with the remaining district councils and panchayat samitis results. The BJP, which is in opposition in the state, won 384 seats in nagar panchayat polls while the NCP, which is part of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition, won 344 seats. The NCP improved its tally in terms of the number of seats while its coalition allies, Congress (316 and Shiv Sena (284 seats) were reduced to third and fourth position, respectively. The three ruling parties however, bagged more than 57.63% seats collectively by winning 944 of the 1,638 seats in which the results were declared. The BJP, by comparison, won 23.44% seats in the nagar panchayats. The counting of votes in 97 nagar panchayats (civic bodies that govern semi-urban areas) began in 31 districts on Wednesday morning. Though the elections to the post of chairman for these bodies will be held next week, present numbers indicate that NCP could control 25, BJP 24, Congress 22 and the Shiv Sena, 15. In some of the urban local bodies that went to polls, the ruling parties will need to join hands to gain power. At least 10 bodies have local alliances, and in some areas, such as Patan in Satara, Mandanga in Ratnagiri, Vikramgad in Palghar, Shirdi in Ahmednagar, local unregistered parties have won more seats than the big four. Former home minister RR Patil’s son Rohit Patil emerged victorious as the NCP won 10 out of 17 nagar panchayat seats in Kavathe-Mahankal which was fought under his leadership. Congress won all three panchayats in Nanded under the leadership of former chief minister Ashok Chavan, as well as the Tivasa panchayat under the leadership of women and child welfare minister Yashomati Thakur. The BJP scored in Vidarbha — a Congress stronghold traditionally —winning six panchayats in Chandrapur, Bhandara, Nagpur districts. The party bagged four out of five panchayats in Beed in central Maharashtra, which could be considered as a setback for social justice minister and NCP leader Dhananjay Munde. Most of the seats that the NCP won were from western Maharashtra, as well as Nashik in north Maharashtra and Raigad, Ratnagiri in the Konkan region. “Despite gross misuse of the money and muscle power by the ruling parties in the local body elections, the BJP has emerged as the leader by winning highest number of seats. We will elect our chairmen in at least 30 bodies with the help of our allies. BJP has retained its top position in the state,” said former chief minister and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis. NCP’s state unit chief Jayant Patil said that the party emerged as the leader in the nagar panchayat elections by winning the highest number of seats. “It is the result of our continuous efforts of serving the people and taking up the issues related to them,” he said. Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole said that the party improved its tally compared to the previous elections. “We have fared satisfactorily. We have won 22 panchayats from the existing number of 17. We are leading in Vidarbha and have made inroads in Konkan. The number of seats won by the BJP is lesser than what they won in the same bodies the last time,” he said. OBC ire not on display The results also serve as a breather for the MVA as it indicated that the OBC communities have not yet displayed their displeasure over the loss of political reservation in local bodies. “It is true that the OBC community is upset with state government for the inordinate delay in collating empirical data. It would have gone in the favour of the opposition BJP, but it could not be seen as a perfect picture. The nagar panchayats are local bodies in semi urban areas with limited population. The real picture will come to the fore in the local body polls to be held in next few months,” Chandrakant Bavkar, president OBC Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti, said. In March 2021, the SC ordered Maharashtra to conduct a rigorous empirical survey to ascertain the exact nature of the socio-economic backwardness of OBC communities before deciding on the quantum of reservation. It said that the legal provisions in place failed the triple test of reservation —it exceeded the 50% ceiling on reservation when taken together with other constitutionally-mandated reservations to persons from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The SC ruled that the political quota to the OBCs in local bodies cannot be given until the data was produced. As a result, in October 2021, by-polls in 84 seats of district councils and 141 panchayat samitis from six districts were held after the SC scrapped the elections of the candidates elected from the OBC quota in these local bodies. This was the first time polls were held without OBC quota, after the reservation came into force in 1994. In September 2021, the state government promulgated Ordinances to allow up to 27% reservation in urban and rural local bodies. However, in December, the SC which was continuing to hear the reservation petitions struck down these Ordinances as well. Furthermore, it directed the state election commission (SEC) to re-notify OBC-reserved seats as general category seats and proceed with the elections that were set to take place on two days — December 21 and January 18. 
20-01-2022||Other||Farmers’ income has not doubled, their pain increased, says Sachin Pilot in Varanasi||VARANASI Congress leader and former deputy chief minister of Rajasthan, Sachin Pilot, on Wednesday said that the farmers’ income had not doubled in the last six and a half years but their pain had increased a hundred times. Pilot was interacting with media persons in Varanasi in the presence of Congress leaders and workers. “Six years ago, BJP government at the Centre had promised it would double the income of farmers by 2022. Now, the year has begun but the farmers’ income didn’t double. Instead, their pain has increased a hundred times during the rule of present government due to its anti-farmer policies,” alleged pilot.Pilot said, “The tax has been imposed on agriculture equipment and products. The rates of fertilizers have increased indiscriminately and now a fertilizer bag of 45 kg in place of 50kg earlier is being sold on a higher price. Inflation is growing and unemployment is at its peak due to which people are upset, he said.He said that people would give befitting reply to the BJP in the assembly elections and would dethrone it from the government in UP.

20-01-2022||Mumbai||SC: Submit OBC data to MSBCC||Mumbai: The Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday refused to offer relief on the plea filed by the Maharashtra government seeking a recall of the top court’s December order stating that seats reserved for Other Backward Class (OBC) candidates in local bodies should be re-notified as general category seats.However, the apex court allowed the state government to submit existing data on OBC communities to the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (MSBCC) for assessment, and said that the commission could submit its interim report to the state within 15 days of receiving this data.State officials took this as a positive development and said that this could pave the way for the state to bring back OBC reservation in local bodies.“The data and information may be furnished before the dedicated commission (MSBCC) to enable the latter to examine it and submit interim recommendations, which can be acted upon in terms of the law. This obviously would not obviate the triple test which had to be completed by the state under the 2021 judgment before providing reservation of seats for OBC in local bodies,” a three-judge bench comprising justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar, said.The state uses data based on a sample survey conducted by the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics and what is currently available on a government portal to provide reservation to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe (SC, ST) and other communities in local bodies as per the existing formula laid down by law.State food and civil supplies minister and prominent OBC leader Chhagan Bhujbal said today’s development was positive. “Until today, there was no way ahead except completing the triple test exercise, which will take some time. But today, the apex court allowed the state government to submit the data to MSBCC and further allowed the commission to submit its interim report to the state government, which is a positive development. It shows we are in the right direction and hoping that the OBC reservation will be restored soon.”“The order has come as a big relief for the state as it will allow the restoration of OBC reservation in local bodies based on the interim report of the MSBCC. Based on recommendations made by the MSBCC, the state government can take a decision on OBC reservation,” said advocate Sachin Patil, standing counsel for Maharashtra government in the Supreme Court.“As per data available on the Saral portal, the population of OBC of citizens is tentatively available with the state… This data was available for some time but has been recently analyzed to reveal the population of the backward class of citizens,” the state’s application for recall order said.“The reservation in various districts of Maharashtra is based on the proportion of population of OBCs in the respective districts and is not a blanket reservation of 27% in all the districts in the entire state of Maharashtra,” it said. The quota will not be applicable in the districts of Nandurbar, Palghar and Gadchiroli which have a substantial population of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes, it added.As an intermediate measure to justify the 27% OBC quota in local bodies, the state referred to a sample survey, conducted by Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, which said that the distribution of OBCs in the sample size was found to be 48.6%.Shreehari Aney, former advocate general of the state, said that the interim report will have significance if it is related to determining backwardness for the purpose of elections. “It all depends on the nature of the interim report of the MSBCC. If it is related to reservation in education and reservation in employment then it will have no meaning.”“The data the state government is talking about consists of a report prepared by Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics. It was prepared for Maratha reservation, which focuses more on social and economic status of the communities and it is based upon socio-economic caste census (SECC) made by the Central government. According to the Centre, SECC has errors and the Supreme Court has also said that political reservation is different from socio-economic status of the community. I doubt that OBCs will get reservation in the upcoming local bodies’ elections,” Chandrakant Bavkar, executive president, Jan OBC Morcha, said.As many as 15 out of 27 municipal corporations, 25 out of 34 district councils and more than 320 municipal councils and nagar panchayats are due for elections in the next three months. This is slated to take place across Maharashtra, including in cities like Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Nagpur, and Aurangabad.On December 15, two weeks after striking down two Ordinances promulgated by the state government to ensure up to 27% political reservation to OBC candidates, the SC directed the state election commission (SEC) to hold elections on OBC reserved seats after re-notifying them as general category seats. The SEC held polls for 412 seats from rural as well as urban local bodies on January 18.

20-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Channi not a common man but a ‘dishonest man’, says Kejriwal||Chandigarh : Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi is not a common man but a “dishonest man” as he sought to corner the Congress leader over an ED raid on the premises of his nephew.Kejriwal made the comment as the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided the premises linked to the Channi’s nephew and others as part of a money laundering probe against “sand mafia”. Channi has dubbed the raids an attempt to “trap” him in the case while claiming that it was being done to take revenge as PM Narendra Modi had to return without addressing a rally in Ferozepur earlier this month.Kejriwal through his comment sought to target the common man image, which Channi has tried to cultivate following his elevation as the chief minister last year.“Channi aam aadmi nahi, baiman aadmi hai (Channi is not a common man, he is a dishonest man),” Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi attacking the CM on Wednesday.On Tuesday too, Kejriwal had attacked Channi over illegal sand mining.“It is sad that a relative of the chief minister is being raided for sand mining,” Kejriwal had said, adding that his party leader had earlier exposed how illegal sand mining was taking place in Channi’s Assembly constituency Chamkaur Sahib.“Despite uncovering it, the chief minister did not take action and even tried to justify it. It is clear that he (CM) and his family are involved in illegal sand mining. What can be expected for Punjab’s future from a person whose family is involved in illegal mining,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-channi-not-a-common-man-but-a-dishonest-man-says-kejriwal-101642619003807.html
20-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Mohindra, Rana Gurjeet back Channi for CM face||Chandigarh : Hours after the Congress reiterated its decision to fight under “collective leadership”, Punjab cabinet ministers Brahm Mohindra and Rana Gurjeet Singh on Wednesday pressed for naming incumbent chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi as the party’s chief ministerial face for the assembly elections in the state. Mohindra and Rana Gurjeet put their weight behind the incumbent even as the Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary clarified that the party will not announce its CM candidate for the February 20 state polls, and will go with collective leadership. There is a tussle on in the state Congress over the chief ministerial face with Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and Channi throwing their hats in the ring. Mohindra, a six-time MLA and one of the senior-most party leaders, urged the Congress high command to clear doubt about the chief ministerial candidate, stating there should not be any confusion in the party about naming the CM face when there is already one who proved himself beyond everybody’s expectations. He also cited in support Channi’s “outstanding performance” as the chief minister in just over three months. “It is the Congress that had set the tradition of declaring the CM candidate ahead of elections in 2012 and 2017. It should continue with that tradition and announce the candidate sooner than later,” the minister said, referring to the AAP’s announcement naming Bhagwant Mann as its CM face and Akalis projecting Sukhbir Singh Badal. The Congress cannot afford to leave any vacuum as it can prove detrimental to party’s interests, and that too when we have a far better choice than others, tried and tested,” he emphasised. Rana Gurjeet, who has been openly backing the present incumbent, also said that he wants Channi as the CM candidate because he has come up to the expectations of the people. “In three months, everyone has seen how hardworking he is and surely deserves another chance,” he said, expressing full confidence in his ability to retain power and deliver the state to the party. CM under fire, Sidhu silent The ministers’ support for beleaguered Channi has come at a crucial time as he is facing fire from all sides after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raids on his nephew along with some others and huge cash recovery in the illegal sand mining case. Rival parties, including the AAP, SAD, BJP and the Punjab Lok Congress, have gone after the CM all guns blazing, insinuating his involvement. Besides Mohindra, three other ministers, including deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria and Tript Rajinder Bajwa, were by Channi’s side to show their support at a press conference in which he hit out at the BJP government at the Centre for its alleged “attempts to trap him in the case”. The PPCC chief has been rather muted on this issue. Sidhu also addressed a press conference along with Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala in Chandigarh on farmers’ issue. Surjewala, in response to a query, categorically stated that the chief minister had nothing to do with the FIR. However, Sidhu did not offer any comment. Congress to go with 3 prominent faces Earlier, Chaudhary said the Congress has three prominent faces in Punjab, including Channi, Sidhu and Sunil Jakhar. “In 111 days, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi has taken historic decisions focused on public welfare. So, the Congress is going to win more seats in 2022 than in 2017,” he told ANI, claiming that “all is well” inside the party. Asked about the announcement of Bhagwant Mann as the AAP’s CM candidate, he said: “The AAP has already accepted that they have no support base in Punjab. Their call response itself is under question. The Congress demands that all those call responses and call data be kept in the public domain”.

There are 98,238 active cases in the state at present.“A key factor responsible for people between 20 and 40 years of age getting infected is their movement outside their houses. For education, work or for household needs, it is this age group, both men and women, which mostly goes out,” said Dr Sandeep Kapoor, director Healthcity hospital.He said, “Those staying at home are also at risk if family members returning home do not follow appropriate Covid-19 behaviour.”“We need to pay more attention to pregnant women and children apart from the elderly. Also, all eligible should take both their vaccine shots, as the vaccine is a safety shield against the virus,” said Prasad.“Also as the positivity rate has gone up recently, we need to follow Covid-19 protocol even after vaccination,” said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/in-up-maximum-covid-cases-are-of-20-to-40yrolds-101642618584713.html

20-01-2022||Delhi||Covid care centre for Delhi Police reopens as nearly 2,000 test positive||A 70-bed Covid care centre for Delhi Police personnel, which was opened last year and shut temporarily after a drop in cases, has been made functional again in the backdrop of nearly 2,000 police staff testing positive for the infection in the ongoing wave of the viral disease. Of the total 2,000 who had tested positive, nearly 1,000 personnel have recovered and joined duty, police officers aware of the matter said. Officials’ in-charge of the Covid Care centre that was set up at the Shahdara police station said no one has been admitted. “Most of our personnel have mild symptoms and are isolating at home. It (the centre) has been made functional as a precautionary measure. We have four ICU beds too at the facility. We are prepared but no personnel so far needed institutional care,” an official, in charge of the centre said, asking not to be named. Delhi Police officers said they are following a detailed standard procedure issued by the police commissioner’s office two weeks ago after cases of infection started rising in the city. “There was a detailed SOP issued in May 2020. That has been revised with new directions and sent to all police personnel across the city. All police personnel have to follow the SOP in letter and spirit,” said a second senior police officer, who too asked not to be named. Like health care workers, who are at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19, police personnel have also been tagged under the category of front-line workers. According to a copy of the new SOP, seen by HT, the police chief, Rakesh Asthana has directed personnel at the stations to be grouped into different categories. “There are micro groups like field duty staff, which comprises of police personnel who have the maximum contact with the public. Then there is the group of fixed duty staff who have desk jobs at the station. They have been segregated so that if one of them tests positive, a small group is tested or quarantined. There should be least contact between these micro groups,” the second officer mentioned above said. In May 2020, during the first wave of the infection, the Chandni Mahal police station had to be sealed after most officers in the station tested positive. The infection had spread from the barracks within the station. The new SOP also makes it mandatory for station house officers to conduct a “risk profiling” of the personnel at the station. “Risk profiling of the available staff in police station shall be done and appropriate staff accordingly be assigned high-risk duties,” reads the SOP. Separately, the welfare unit of the Delhi police, which is overseeing the Covid-19 cases in the force, has also set up camps for booster doses of police personnel. Such camps are being held across all police districts for police personnel to take time off from their duties and get the third booster dose jab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-care-centre-for-delhi-police-reopens-as-nearly-2-000-test-positive-101642618403230.html
20-01-2022||Lucknow||Law graduate arrested for murdering parents, brother in UP||A judicial services aspirant was arrested on Wednesday on charges of killing his parents and his brother and disposing their bodies at different places on the city’s outskirts. The police officials said the accused Sarfaraz, 31, allegedly murdered his parents Mehmood Ali, 65, and Darkasha, 60, and his younger brother Shaawez, 26, by slitting their throats after putting sleeping pills in their food at his house in Vikas Nagar on the night of January 5. Police said Sarfaraz, a law graduate who was preparing for judicial services, believed his father will oust him from home and transfer all his properties to younger brother. Police believe that this could have been the motive behind this gruesome crime. Circle officer (CO) of Bakshi Ka Talab, Naveena Shukla, who was supervising investigations related to recoveries of three bodies on the city outskirts, said Sarfaraz later disposed of their bodies one by one in Itaunja, Mal and Malihabad. The three areas come under the jurisdiction of Lucknow rural police while the house in Vikas Nagar, where the three were allegedly murdered comes under Lucknow police Commissionerate limits. The CO said the body of Shaawez was found in bushes on Mal road under Itaunja police station limits on January 6, Mehmood Ali’s body was found on a deserted stretch on Zehra road under Malihabad police station limits on January 8 and Darkasha’s body was recovered from Mal area on January 13. “After committing the crime on January 5, Sarfaraz texted a message to his sister Anam, who lives in Delhi, from Shaawez’s mobile phone posing as latter (Shaawez) stating that his parents and brother are going to Jammu and Kashmir for a holiday trip and will return after week while Sarfaraz will remain at home,” the CO said. She said that he later, went to Jammu on January 13 and called up his sister using Shaawez’s mobile phone stating that Shaawez and his parents are stuck in landslide in Ramban district of Jammu,” she stated. “Sarfaraz tried to create an impression among his family that all three deceased are missing after getting stuck in the landslide,” she added. The CO said the real story behind the mysterious disappearance started unfolding when the identities of the three deceased was ascertained on Tuesday through their photographs published in Uddham Singh Nagar edition of a Hindi daily that the three deceased are missing from Raban district and it was found that they all were from the same family. She said Sarfaraz came under suspicion when the locations of mobile phones of all three deceased were found in Lucknow. “The truth was revealed when Sarfaraz was taken into custody and questioned rigorously on Tuesday,” the CO said. She said Sarfaraz had taken help of his friend Anil Yadav to dispose the bodies and both of them have been arrested under charges of murders and concealment of crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/law-graduate-arrested-for-murdering-parents-brother-in-up-101642618343285.html

Bajaj said that when he woke up on Wednesday morning, he had a headache and his entire house was ransacked. He also found that his domestic help, Maan Singh, was nowhere to be seen. Realising that the domestic help had burgled the house after serving him food laced with sedatives, Bajaj immediately alerted his family members and relatives, and also called the police. On examining closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in the area, police found a man entering the house at around 12am while two more came around 1am. The trio, along with Maan Singh, was later seen leaving the house in the wee hours. Sarabha Nagar station house officer (SHO) Jaskanwal Singh said the complainant had been alone at home as his family members were in Bathinda to attend the cremation of some relative.

20-01-2022||Delhi||Can’t allow an absurdity to prevail, amicus tells Delhi HC on marital rape||Putting forward powerful arguments for criminalising marital rape, amicus curiae and senior advocate Rebecca John told the Delhi high court on Wednesday that the current rape laws are based on the doctrine that a married woman grants irrevocable sexual consent to her husband and such “absurdity should not be allowed to prevail”.John told a bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar that the exception in the rape law, which excludes forced sexual relations between spouses from the purview of rape, was carved out to favour the conjugal rights of the husband. She said “consent” is an underlying condition in the exception to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Exception of Section 375 IPC decriminalises marital rape and mandates that sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age, is not rape.The court is hearing PILs by NGOs RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association and two individuals who have sought striking down the exception in the Indian law, saying that it discriminated against married women who were sexually assaulted by their husbands.John said even before Thomas Babington Macaulay, who presided over the first Law Commission in India in 1833 and said the exception was to protect the conjugal rights of a man, the concept finds its origins in the doctrine of coverture and implied consent.“And according to this legal doctrine, the legal rights of a woman were subsumed by the husband after marriage. By entering into marriage, a wife was considered to have granted irrevocable sexual consent to her husband,” she said.To this Justice Shakdher said, “She (wife) was almost treated under that doctrine as someone who is incapacitated from giving consent. It is like what we have in the Contract Act that certain categories of people cannot give consent. The enunciation (declaration) seems a little problematic.”“The woman’s consent is fundamental to the invocation of 375 and so we cannot wish it away,” John said, adding that even with respect to Exception 1 in Section 375, which states that a medical procedure or intervention shall not constitute rape, a medical practitioner is not permitted to do certain acts that are mentioned in the definition of rape.“So when we look at exceptions drafted in absolute terms, we should not allow an absurdity to prevail,” John argued.In 2017, central government, in its affidavit filed in the case, had said that marital rape cannot be made a criminal offence as it could become a phenomenon that may destabilise the institution of marriage and an easy tool for harassing the husbands.Last week, the union government had told the court that it was considering a “constructive approach” on the issue of criminalising marital rape and has sought suggestions from several stakeholders and authorities to make comprehensive amendments to the criminal law.It said the Centre was undertaking a comprehensive task of amending the criminal law which includes Section 375 IPC as well.In an additional affidavit, the Centre asserted that the marital rape exception could not be struck down only at the instance of the petitioners as the principles of natural justice required a “larger hearing of all stakeholders”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cant-allow-an-absurdity-to-prevail-amicus-tells-delhi-high-court-on-marital-rape-101642617983489.html
20-01-2022||Delhi||Mercury inches up but ‘cold day’ conditions prevail in Delhi||Parts of Delhi recorded ‘cold day’ conditions for the seventh consecutive day on Wednesday, despite the maximum temperature going up by nearly three degrees, with Safdarjung -- Delhi’s base station -- recording a high of 18.1 degrees Celsius (°C) – two degrees below normal for this time of year.While Narela was Delhi’s coldest location with a high of 14.7°C, Jafarpur recorded 15°C – both five degrees below normal for this time of the year.According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi’s maximum temperature will remain around 18-19°C in the next 48 hours, with rain expected on Friday and Sunday.When the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees or lower than normal, while the minimum is below 10°C, the IMD classifies it as a ‘cold day’. When the maximum temperature is 6.5 degrees or lower than normal, it is classified as a “severe cold day”. Both Narela and Jafarpur met cold day conditions on Wednesday.Delhi last recorded a longer spell of consecutive cold days between December 23, 2019 and January 1, 2020.“The impact of a western disturbance will soon be seen, which is also gradually leading to a rise in the maximum temperature. From Friday night, Delhi will see drizzle, with peak rain expected on Saturday, when light showers could be recorded. More drizzle could be seen on Sunday,” said RK Jenamani, a scientist at IMD.A western disturbance refers to an area of “disturbed” or reduced air pressure, moving from the west to the east, carrying with it moisture associated with rainfall, snowfall, and fog in northern India.Delhi, meanwhile, recorded a minimum temperature of 7.4°C on Wednesday, which is around the normal mark for this time of the season. The IMD forecast the minimum temperature to rise to around 10°C by Thursday and around 13°C by Saturday. “The minimum temperature will now rise. We are expected to see a low maximum temperature on Saturday now, which will be due to overcast conditions,” Jenamani added.In terms of air quality, Delhi recorded an Air Quality Index reading of 322 in the “very poor” category, according to Central Pollution Control Board’s daily 4pm bulletin. It was 352 (very poor) on Tuesday. Agencies forecast the Capital’s air quality to remain “very poor” for the next two days as well.An AQI reading between 201 and 300 is considered “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.“The AQI is expected to remain ‘very poor’ as wind speed and temperature are likely to remain almost the same. It is likely to rain on January 22 and 23 with gusty winds leading to wet deposition and strong dispersion, which will result in an improvement in the AQI,” said the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), a government forecasting body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mercury-inches-up-but-cold-day-conditions-prevail-in-delhi-101642617928017.html

The members carried placards against plastic pollution and raised slogans against the authorities for failing to perform their duty and action against the culprits.The members rued the state government failure to ban plastic carry bags despite issuing a notification in April 2016, adding that it was the joint responsibility of PPCB and Municipal Corporation (MC) to stop manufacturing, sale and use of the bags.Notably, the NGO has been staging weekly protests outside the civic body’s office since last month.“We were surprised to know that PPCB and MC never conducted a meeting in this regard in the last six years. The PPCB has to stop manufacturing and MC has to stop the trade and use of plastic carry bags. But there is a lack of coordination between both departments. We have demanded that PPCB should convene a meeting wherein MC officials and plastic industry representatives should also be invited, so that corrective steps can be taken,” Navneet Bhullar, founding member of the NGO.Bhullar further said they have written a number of letters to the chief minister’s office to impose the ban, adding that they will continue to stage weekly protests outside the PPCB and MC offices until the ban is imposed. He suggested that the authorities promote compostable bags as an alternative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngo-stages-protest-outside-punjab-pollution-control-board-office-in-ludhiana-over-failure-to-stop-use-of-banned-plastic-bags-101642617870213.html
20-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi reports 13,785 Covid cases, positivity rate at 23.86%||Breaking the downward trend of the last two days, the number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi rose slightly on Wednesday, recording 13,785 new infections out of the 57,776 total tests conducted.The Capital saw 11,684 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday and 12,527 cases on Monday.The rise in new infections also reflected in a minor increase in the positivity rate, which rose from 22.47% on Tuesday to 23.86% on Wednesday. The positivity rate was 27.99% on Monday. Death due to Covid-19 meanwhile dropped in the last 24 hours, with 35 people succumbing to infection on Wednesday, as against 38 on Tuesday.Senior officials of the Delhi government’s health department said that the rise in cases is not significant. “The rise should not be read as a spike. Our focus is on hospitalisations which is still stable,” the official said. On Wednesday, 2,734 (17.52%) beds out of the total 15,603 in Covid hospitals were occupied, leaving 12,869 hospital beds vacant. Curiously, the number of Covid patients in home isolation has been consistently going down over the last four days. From 68,411 patients in home isolation on January 16, the count reduced to 68,275 on January 17, before suddenly dropping to 63,432 on January 18 and finally 58,501 on January 19. Health officials attributed this decline in home isolation cases to a shorter infection period among patients in home care. “Unlike Delta wave, when the patients were taking 12-14 days to recover, in Omicron infections, patients are taking fewer days to recover,” the health official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-reports-13-785-covid-cases-positivity-rate-at-2386-101642617866967.html

Maximum recoveries were made between March mid-November as most of the trains were cancelled permanently due to dense fog by the railways last year,” an official said.

20-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi: Special vaccination camp for children of GB Road sex workers||The Delhi government on Wednesday opened a special Covid-19 vaccination camp at Anglo Arabic Senior Secondary School for over 150 children whose mothers work as sex workers in brothels on GB Road. Government officials said the aim of the special camp was to provide as many sex workers’ children in the 15-18 age group with access to the vaccine.“Over the last year, we have identified several areas where people from unorganised sectors cannot easily access vaccination. Last year, we conducted vaccination camps for sex workers of GB Road and we wanted their children to also get the opportunity to get the vaccine shots without any trouble,” said Akriti Sagar, district magistrate (central district), who organised the camp.Since the government started vaccinating teens in the 15-18 age group, the administration has also organised camps for children in de-addiction centres, shelter homes and also for school dropouts, apart from sex workers’ children.A 16-year-old boy who arrived at the Anglo Arabic Senior Secondary School at 9am to receive his first vaccine dose on Wednesday, discussed how Covid-19 cases were rising alarmingly, while occasionally making jokes about how his social life had been impacted by the pandemic. “I live with my mother on GB Road; she has received both her vaccine shots. She insisted that I also receive my dose at the earliest,” said the boy.A 15-year-old, who had also come to get inoculated at the camp, said that such initiatives by the government were a step towards breaking social discrimination against sex workers and their children.“I usually tell people that I live in Sadar Bazar, without giving them specific details of my address. As soon as you tell anyone that you live on GB Road, their attitude towards you completely changes. Children like me would perhaps never even get a shot at life and education if social organisations and governments do not intervene,” the teenager said.Pragya Baseria from Kat Katha, an NGO that works with the sex workers of GB Road, which also helped spread the word among children for Wednesday’s camp, said that while sex workers did initially hesitate to get vaccinated, but now they are getting themselves and their children vaccinated.“Many of these children got enrolled in schools late but they are very smart and pushed their mothers to take the vaccine,” Baseria said.

Round the clock work. Pathways ready. Water bodies get bridges. Trees stand tall. Only 25 relocated. 3 on Rajpath itself & 22 to NTPC Badarpur,” the minister tweeted.Last year, the central government came under criticism from environment activists for uprooting trees, especially Jamun trees, for the project. The Centre had then rejected the reports that several trees were being uprooted for the project.After his visit to the project site on Tuesday, Puri said the redeveloped facility will have modern amenities and enhanced green spaces. “Closely monitoring the progress of the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment project. Amongst other modern features & amenities, the new Central Vista Avenue will provide enhanced & green public spaces through three parallel pathways of 2 kms on either side of Rajpath,” Puri tweeted on Tuesday.As part of the redevelopment project, the avenue lawns have been refurbished and pathways along Rajpath and across the lawns have been paved with Lakha granite. The heritage light poles along Rajpath have been refurbished, and new light poles near the lawns and canals have been installed. New signages have also been put in place for better directions.While most of the redevelopment work has been completed, work on eight amenity blocks and four underpasses will be completed after January 26, said a senior CPWD official.The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), nodal agency for the execution of the project, has completed the redevelopment work on the Rajpath and the lawns.

The CPWD and Delhi Traffic Police have made parking arrangements for more than 7,000 vehicles, said a senior Delhi Traffic Police official.“The parking space at the venue has slightly been reduced due to the construction of amenity blocks and underpasses. We have been provided alternate parking sites at Jawahar Bhawan (on Raisina Road) and Vanijya Bhawan (on Akbar road). This is for the first time we have been provided parking sites at these locations,” said a senior traffic police official, who is aware of the matter.CPWD officials said that bleachers have been installed for the parade in the lawns along the Rajpath, but seating has been done in such a manner to ensure social distancing between spectators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/finishing-touches-being-given-to-central-vista-avenue-hardeep-puri-101642617443439.html
20-01-2022||Lucknow||Baghel releases Congress’ white paper on UP farmers||Lucknow: Chhatisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Wednesday released the Congress’ white paper on farmers titled “Aamadni na hui do guni, dard sau guna” (income of farmers has not been doubled while their pain has increased 100 times) and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government had betrayed farmers. Baghel, who along with All India Congress Committee spokesperson Supriya Shrinate and others released one of the Congress’ seven white papers at the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) headquarters here, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to double the income of farmers by 2022 at a rally in Bareilly on February 28, 2016. He said the PM also announced that the report of the Swaminathan committee would be implemented. He said six years after the promise, the income of farmers had not been doubled while their pain had increased 100 times. He said the farmers would not forgive the Modi government for this betrayal. He said the Modi government came out with NSSO survey six years after its promise of doubling the income. The survey report revealed that the daily income of farmers had been reduced to ₹27 per day and loan per farmer was about ₹74,000. He said the Modi government brought three black laws to benefit some industrialist friends and for the first time, taxes were being imposed on agriculture implements. He said such steps along with rising fuel prices were having an adverse impact on the farmers. He called the crop insurance scheme Kisan Loot Yojana. At point number six, titled “Kisan Loot Yojana of the white paper, it has been pointed out that the Prime Minister claimed to have launched the world’s best crop insurance scheme for farmers in February 2016. The Prime Minister’s home state Gujarat, however, has stopped implementation of the scheme. The paper said a sum of ₹21,450 crore was realized from farmers in the name of premium and these companies earned a profit of ₹30,320 crore from 2016 to 2020-2021. Baghel also spoke about the problem of stray animals in Uttar Pradesh and how the same had been handled in Chhatisgarh by buying cow dung and making compost fertilizer from it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/baghel-releases-congress-white-paper-on-up-farmers-101642617143054.html
20-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi: Yamuna water too toxic to treat for 134 days last year||Last week, the ammonia levels in the Yamuna, the primary source of water for Delhi, went up so high that the Delhi Jal Board had to shut its three treatment plants. Though it is nothing new for the city, the episode yet again underlined the crucial issue of pollution in the Yamuna which at times become so acute that it renders the river water not even fit for mechanical treatment.High levels of ammonia not only disrupts supply of water to several parts of the city, but is also an indicator of the inability of the river water to support aquatic life.According to data from the Wazirabad water quality monitoring laboratory, the city witnessed 22 ammonia spike episodes spread over 134 days last year, during which ammonia levels went above 1 ppm level. Cumulatively, for over three months during 2021, DJB reported ammonia levels higher than the maximum treatable limit, the data shows. DJB’s plants have the capacity to treat up to 0.9 ppm levels of ammonia in raw water.A senior DJB official said, “The problem is witnessed throughout the year, but the concentration of ammonia recorded in winters (between December and March) is relatively higher.”“We try to divert water from other sources to dilute the raw water to keep the operations running at the treatment plants. Ozonation plants are also being set up to increase the treatment capacity to up to 4ppm of ammonia to help deal with the periodic problem,” the official said asking not to be named.The data from Wazirabad pond shows that ammonia levels stayed above 1 ppm for 16 days in January 2021, and for 27 days in February, 19 days in March and 13 days in April. The DJB report shows that 15 smaller disruption periods varying between two to six days were observed between May and November 2021.Of the total 935 MGD of Delhi’s daily water supply-- over 230 MGD is supplied by Chandrawal and Wazirabad plants both of which draw water from Wazirabad pond fed by Yamuna water.DJB has maintained that the untreated industrial pollutants released from Panipat industrial is the main reason behind the periodic exceptionally high ammonia levels in Yamuna. In a letter to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, DJB vice chairperson Raghav Chadha said the main source of Yamuna pollution are some drains in Haryana.“The pollution is occurring due to waste water and industrial waste water discharge from Panipat drain DD-1 through DD-2, Rohtak X-regulator, DD-6 through DD-8 which reaches Wazirabad barrage and in turn pollutes Yamuna downstream,” the letter dated April 14, 2021 said.A DJB official explained: “Panipat drain 1 and drain 2 carry pollutants from the dye industries. Also, DD 8 and DD 6 drains are vulnerable points in Sonipat as Delhi’s fresh water and industrial waste run parallel in these drains which are separated by just a few inches wide muddy wall.”The Haryana pollution control board and the Haryana irrigation department, however, have repeatedly denied the allegations of DJB. The pollution board did not comment on the matter,Experts say that while Delhi needs to expedite the much delayed upgradation of its water treatment plants, interstate agencies such as the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Upper Yamuna River Board also need to intervene to curb pollution in the Yamuna.Environmental activist Manoj Misra who heads Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan said the main body responsible for controlling the ammonia level spikes is CPCB. “The problem has persisted for so many years and yet no resolution has been found. We require to work on both the technological upgrade of water treatment plants, and tackling the pollution at source. If we know that the problem increases during January to April period, patrolling should be done along industrial areas so that major culprits can be caught,” he said.Misra said zero liquid discharge policy is the only permanent solution. It is a wastewater management system that ensures there is no industrial discharge into the environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiyamuna-water-too-toxic-to-treat-for-134-days-last-year-101642616963126.html
20-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi govt addresses NCPCR fears over its ‘Desh Ke Mentors’ programme||Addressing concerns raised by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) about the safety of children participating in the Delhi government’s ‘Desh Ke Mentors’ programme, the Directorate of Education (DoE) on Tuesday said necessary police verification of mentors will be conducted and all online sessions will be recorded.The child rights body wrote to the Delhi government on January 11, seeking the suspension of its ongoing ‘Desh Ke Mentors’ programme for school students, citing concerns over children being exposed to unknown persons.The commission alleged that the programme, as part of which students are provided career guidance by eminent citizens, “exposes them to certain dangers”, and asked the Delhi government to suspend the programme till the loopholes are “overhauled”. The NCPCR also wrote to the chief secretary, Delhi government, seeking clarification on the issue of police verification of the staff.In its written response to NCPCR on Tuesday, the DoE stated that new features had been added to ensure the safety and security of children enrolled in the programme, including the police verification of mentors. A report of criminal record (if any) about a registered mentor would be obtained from the police station concerned. In case of an adverse report, the mentor would be de-registered immediately, the DoE informed NCPCR. The exercise will also be undertaken for all mentors already registered under the programme.The department conveyed that all conversations between mentors and mentees will be recorded by the department. “There is no in-person interaction intended among the mentor and mentees and since every phone call will be recorded by the government, there no scope left for child abuse by any mentor,” stated the DoE in its response to NCPCR.Additionally, the contact number of children/mentees shall not be disclosed or made available to the mentor or any other person. Mentors will also not be allowed to meet with mentees offline, and, in case of violation, he/she will be deregistered from the program, DoE said in its response.Along with the addition of the new features, the DoE also issued a circular to all government schools on Monday directing that all parents are advised to ensure the presence of an adult family member during the conversation between the mentor and the mentee through the programme’s app.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia last Friday said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was plotting to derail the Delhi government’s ‘Desh Ke Mentor’ programme by asking the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) to act against the scheme on a complaint by a party worker from Chhattisgarh.“BJP doesn’t want poor children to have a chance to attend world-class universities so it can spread hate and filth through its ‘WhatsApp University’. BJP is terrified of the success of poor children through ‘Desh Ke Mentor’ and is trying to stop the programme using a complaint by a BJP worker,” Sisodia said, asserting that the programme has checks and balances to leave no scope for abuse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-addresses-ncpcr-fears-over-its-desh-ke-mentors-programme-101642616603150.html
20-01-2022||Delhi||5 days after Ghazipur, unclaimed bags in East Delhi spark bomb scare||Five days after an improvised explosive device (IED) containing RDX was found at Ghazipur flower market, two black bags left unclaimed on a busy street in east Delhi’s Trilokpuri sparked fears of a similar bomb threat but a subsequent examination by a bomb disposal squad found just a laptop, cell phone and some documents inside the bags on Wednesday afternoon.Police said the bags belonged to an IT professional from Pitampura who had lost them to a thak-thak gang near Nizamuddin area.A passerby spotted the two bags at Metro pillar number 59, near Trilokpuri and alerted the police control room, following which police teams secured the area as the bomb disposal squad examined the bags. An earthmover too was brought to the spot, in case there was a need to dig a pit to defuse the bomb through a controlled explosion -- as was done in the case of IED found at Ghazipur.Delhi has been on high alert since last Friday, when police recovered an IED from a black bag at the Ghazipur flower market -- less than 5km from Trilokpuri. Police have subsequently said that the IED used in Ghazipur contained about three kilogram of RDX and ammonium nitrate.On Wednesday, residents of the densely populated east Delhi locality were asked to stay away from the spot as police cordoned off the area, but many continued to linger. Police said personnel from the National Security Guard (NSG) too were on their way to the spot when it was found to be a false alarm.Joint commissioner of police (eastern range) Sagarpreet Hooda, said, “Our officers were at the spot and we followed our standard operating procedure. There were no explosives or any illegal item in the bag. It had personal belongings.”Police said Somesh Gupta, the owner of the laptop and the cell phone, told them that the bags were stolen from his car by a thak-thak gang that divert the attention of drivers by tapping on the car’s body, or tyres to steal items left on the backseat or dashboard.“While travelling in his car, Gupta was stopped by two men who claimed that the vehicle was leaking engine oil. When he stepped out, the men stole the two bags and fled. However, it is not clear why they abandoned the bags with the laptop and cellphone inside, in Trilokpuri,” said a police officer who asked not to be named.Police now suspect the thieves may be from a gang that only deals in stolen cash or jewellery. “It is possible that the thieves are from nearby areas of Trilokpuri or Kalyanpuri. We are now looking at the CCTV footage to identify who brought the bags from Nizamuddin to the metro pillar where it was found,” said a police officer.Meanwhile, the Delhi Police control room also received a distress call about a bomb planted at the CRPF headquarters in Lodhi Colony, but it turned out to be a hoax.Deputy commissioner of police (South) Benita Mary Jaikar said police had received the call at 6.36 pm. “Police personnel from the Lodhi Colony station reached the spot. A joint bomb disposal squad team of the CRPF, CISF and Delhi Police was constituted and a thorough search was conducted. They did not filed any such explosives in the premises or outside,” said DCP Jaikar.Police investigation revealed that the PCR call was made from a cell phone belong to a person from Telangana. “We are probing the case,” DCP Jaikar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/5-days-after-ghazipur-unclaimed-bags-in-east-delhi-spark-bomb-scare-101642616184387.html
20-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi among 3 global cities part of Nasa's air pollution challenge||The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) has partnered with a crowdsourcing platform to launch ‘Air-othon’, a competition aimed at utilising a combination of meteorological data, low cost-sensors and satellite imagery to develop models for air pollution in Delhi, Los Angeles and Taipei.It has invited individuals and teams to analyse a 5x5 km grid in the three cities, and the data gathered in this manner will be shared with the US embassy in Delhi and the Delhi government. The winning team will be receiving a prize of $50,000.Launched on Tuesday in Houston, Texas, the ‘Air-othon’ challenge is being undertaken with DrivenData, a social enterprise that uses data tools, and HeroX, a crowdsourcing platform, to generate daily estimates of surface-level NO2 and PM 2.5 across a 5km grid of the participant’s choosing.While high NO2 levels can lead to respiratory and asthma issues and the formation of other harmful pollutants, such as ozone and particulate matter, PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in size) is known to penetrate deep into human lungs, resulting in major health concerns in the long-term.‘Air-othon’ officials said existing ground monitors have large gaps in coverage, which can be bridged using forecasting and real-time data models.“This is a difficult problem where better data tools can provide timely information to millions of people to help them protect their health,” said Greg Lipstein, co-founder of DrivenData.“The challenge will test solutions from a global community of experts, with the best approaches automatically rising to the top of the leaderboard,” he added.Experts said models that make use of widely available, low-cost sensor data and satellite imagery also have the potential to provide daily local air quality information to thousands of people. “This effort prioritises the health of entire communities. I am eager to see the innovative ways the crowd can improve air quality data collection and enhance public health,” said Kal K Sahota, CEO, HeroX.A Nasa official said the overarching goal of the challenge is to deliver top-performing solutions to the state department at designated embassy locations, including Delhi.Professor SN Tripathi from IIT Kanpur, who is part of a CPCB committee that is looking at the utilisation of low-cost sensors, said satellite imagery can be used to identify NOx levels, while PM 2.5 data can be utilised from low-cost sensors and fed into a machine which analyses concentration levels at different time stamps. “Machine learning is possible and models can be developed that forecast concentration several hours in advance. Such learnings can be beneficial for India too,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-among-3-global-cities-part-of-nasa-s-air-pollution-challenge-101642615403014.html
20-01-2022||Lucknow||Top Opposition leaders from other states to campaign in Uttar Pradesh||Top opposition leaders with a political base in other states are likely to campaign in support of the Samajwadi Party (SP) in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections.West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar, Rashtriya Janta Dal (RJD) leader and former Bihar deputy chief ministerTejashwi Yadav, besides Shiv Sena leaders Sanjay Raut and Aaditya Thackeray will be in action in Uttar Pradesh, leading the opposition attack against the BJP, according to people in the respective opposition parties. Samajwadi Party national vice-president Kiranmoy Nanda had on Tuesday announced that Mamata Banerjee will campaign virtually for the SP in Lucknow on February 8 and she may also campaign digitally in Varanasi.NCP state unit spokesperson Vishal Nath Tiwari said Sharad Pawar will campaign for the Samajwadi Party in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has already announced that NCP leader KK Sharma will contest as the joint candidate of the SP-NCP alliance from the Anupshahr assembly seat in Bulandhshahr district of western Uttar Pradesh. Sharad Pawar may be present with TMC chief Mamata Banerjee during the virtual campaign in Lucknow on February 8, Tiwari said. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav will campaign in support of the SP in the east UP assembly constituencies bordering Bihar, as well as in other segments. RJD state unit president Ashok Singh will be the SP-RJD joint candidate from Sareni in Rae Bareli district. Rahul Yadav, son-in-law of RJD leader Lalu Yadav, is in the fray as the SP-RLD joint candidate from Sikandrabad assembly seat in Bulandshahr district.Ashok Singh said, “Tejashwi Yadav will campaign in support of the Samajwadi Party across Uttar Pradesh.”An SP leader said Jharkhand chief minister and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader Hemant Soren may campaign in support of the SP to help the Opposition give a united fight to the BJP. Talks are going on with JMM leaders to address virtual campaign for the SP. Hemant Soren had campaigned in support of the TMC in the West Bengal assembly election, he said.Shiv Sena state secretary Vishwajeet Singh said the party central leadership’s is in talks with the Congress, which is part of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), for pre-poll alliance in UP. If the alliance talks fail, the Shiv Sena will field candidates for 80 assembly seats in UP.“Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut and Aaditya Thackeray will campaign for the party candidates (in UP),” he said. 
20-01-2022||Lucknow||Election talk revolves around KV Corridor in Purvanchal||The Kashi Vishwanath (KV) Corridor, inaugurated on December 13, 2021, is at the centre of the election talk , along with other issues, in the Purvanchal (eastern UP) region. Little wonder, as tea boils at a roadside stall in the Pandeypur area of Varanasi (also known as Kashi), the political debate among the locals heats up.Kashi, a prominent pilgrim centre for millions of Hindus and often described as the cultural capital of India, enjoys pride of place in this region.Ashwini Pandey, a devotee of Lord Shiva, says, “The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor is grand and divine. Devotees of Baba Kashi Vishwanath are very happy because expansion and beautification of Kashi Vishwanath Dham was needed for a long time. But the previous governments didn’t pay attention to it. Prime Minister Narendra Modi conceived and planned extension and beautification of the Kashi Vishwanath temple and chief minister Yogi Adityanath completed it despite two waves of Covid-19.”“Baba’s devotees are happy. It will benefit the BJP in the election,” Pandey says.But another local Lallu Yadav says, “BJP failed to carry out any development in the state. Therefore, the BJP is once again at God’s mercy to win the election.”Referring to Pandey’s remarks, Yadav says that such bhakts (followers) of the BJP are out to create an atmosphere in favour of the party.“Why don’t you people mention five major developmental works?” he asks.Ramji Mishra aka Bachcha Guru, resident of Ramiliha, says, “The KV Corridor will promote tourism for sure. But we must remember that Kashi is known for its antiquity, lanes and culture. The tourists, especially foreigners, visit the city to feel antiquity, and devotees visit Kashi Vishwanath (temple) to offer prayers due to their faith. Those who feel that many lanes disappeared and those who think that KV temple’s expansion was needed, both are discussing it.”Tea stall owner Vijay Yadav Ballu, another devotee of Kashi Vishwanath, can’t resist the temptation to join the debate and make his point.“No one even thought about expansion and beautification in the last seven decades. When it has been done by the Modi government, many are trying to find a way to criticise it, let alone praising the great work which should have been done long ago,” says Ballu.So grand is the KV Corridor that if the critics visit it, they will be left tongue tied, he adds.Such discussions are common in other eastern UP districts too.In the neighbouring Chandauli district, villagers are curious to visit the KV Corridor to see the transformation around the Kashi Vishwanath temple.Arun Kumar Rai, resident of Udharanapur village in Ghazipur district, says, “Villagers are curious about the grandeur of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham, so they are talking about it. Pro-BJP people are discussing it. In addition, issues like unemployment, stray animals are also at the centre of the discussions in villages.”Arvind Rai, resident of Ballia, says unemployment is an issue for the youths. But elderly people are more inclined towards the ruling party due to construction of a grand KV Corridor in Kashi and Ram temple being built in Ayodhya.Piyush Barnwal, resident of Varanasi, says the KV Corridor is indeed grand.“Kashi Vishwanath’s devotees will go with those who built the grand KV Corridor here. Ever since the KV Corridor has been inaugurated, the number of devotees visiting the KV temple daily has increased manifold.”For the first few days, lakhs of devotees (around 5 lakh on the firs day, 3 lakh on the second day and 2.5 lakh on third day) visited the Kashi Vishwanath temple.“It gave a boost to local business. The people are happy,” Barnwal says.On the other hand, Congress leader Shailendra Singh says, “Faith should not be mixed with politics. But the BJP has been doing it as it doesn’t have anything concrete to present before the people, so it always tries to mix politics and religion.”Kashi region BJP leader Somnath Vishwakarma says the Congress did nothing for the expansion and beautification of the KV temple.“Now that it has been done by PM Modi, and it is being praised by devotees of Baba Kashi Vishwanath, the Congress leaders are left with no option but to criticize it. They are making baseless allegations. Devotees of Baba Kashi Vishwanath are very happy.”During his visit to Varanasi in December 2021, Union home minister Amit Shah had instructed BJP office bearers in the Kashi and Gorakhpur regions to keep their election campaign centred around Ayodhya and Kashi in an apparent reference to the Ram temple being built in Ayodhya and the recently inaugurated grand Kashi Vishwanath Corridor.Kaushal Kishore Mishra, dean and professor of the political science faculty at BHU, says, “The KV temple’s expansion and transformation in the form of a grand and divine Kashi Vishwanath Corridor has brought cultural secularism to the centre of debates focused on polls and politics. Now onwards, cultural secularism, which is more or less cultural socialism, will gain momentum across the country.”
20-01-2022||Mumbai||‘Update your bank KYC’: How Delhi man conned people to steal savings; arrested||A Delhi-based loan agent was arrested on Monday for allegedly duping bank customers and extracting their account details by pretending to update their KYC (Know Your Customer).According to the North Mumbai cyber cell of the Mumbai Police, the accused, identified as Vivek Sunil Sabarwal (38), was apprehended after over eight months of search.On July 16, 2021, they received a complaint from a Mumbai-based estate agent that an unidentified caller had posed as a bank employee and asked him to email him his bank details for KYC updation.The complainant in his statement said he had a savings account in Corporation Bank at Malad. However, after the bank’s merger with Union Bank, his account was shifted to the latter.On June 5, 2021, he got calls from an unidentified caller about updating his KYC with Union Bank. On July 16, 2021, he received an email to update his bank details and mobile number.Assuming the email to be genuine, the complainant replied to the email with his account details. A few days later, he learnt that his account was debited of ₹12.73 lakh. The bank informed him that they received a request from the account holder to change the registered mobile number after which the money was withdrawn. He subsequently registered an FIR.PI Savita Kadam, from the cyber cell, said that they began the investigation by tracking the mobile number registered with the bank. “We traced the mobile number to Burari in Delhi,” said Kadam.When we found out the address of the SIM card owner, we kept a watch on the house and on Monday arrested Sabarwal.On searching the flat, the police found five mobile phones, 10 debit cards, 14 fake Aadhaar cards and five fake driving licenses, 35 stamps of companies, 43 letterheads of multiple companies and data of more than 50,000 account holders from different banks.On further investigation, the police learnt that Sabarwal used to call up account holders of banks which had gone through mergers. By posing as a bank employee, the accused used to get their account details and mobile number registered with the bank.After securing the details, he then called up the bank pretending to be the account holder and put in a request to change the registered mobile number. After changing the mobile number, he used to withdraw money from the account.“We are investigating the number of people he cheated and whether there are more people involved in the crime,” said Kadam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/loan-agent-from-delhi-arrested-for-cyber-fraud-of-12-lakh-101642606821839.html
20-01-2022||Mumbai||BJP wins 384 seats in nagar panchayat polls, jabs Uddhav Thackeray over Sena tally||MUMBAI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday ended up with the maximum number of seats in Maharashtra’s local body elections in semi-urban and rural areas, closing the gap and racing ahead of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) which appeared to have the lead in the early hours of counting of votes.The BJP has won 384 seats in nagar panchayats that govern smaller towns in semi-urban areas as compared to the NCP’s 344 seats. The two other constituents of the state’s ruling coalition Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi, the Congress and the Shiv Sena, were pushed to the third (316 seats) and fourth (284) position, respectively.Collectively, the three ruling coalition partners have won 944 seats, more than 60% of the seats for which results have been declared. To be sure, the three parties contested the elections on their own.The NCP, however, has won 25 nagar panchyats, one more than the 24 won by the BJP. The Shiv Sena and Congress have won 14 and 18 bodies, respectively. The election is seen as an indication that the BJP has not lost much ground and the MVA partners will have to stick together if they want to stay in power. Leaders of the ruling coalition suggest that the results also indicate that the OBCs are not furious with the MVA for losing political reservation in local bodies.In all, the Maharashtra State Election Commission held elections for 1,802 seats in 106 nagar panchayats, 105 seats in two district councils and 210 seats in 15 panchayat samitis.Voting was held on December 21 and January 18. The second phase was necessitated due to the Supreme Court verdict of December 15 which refused to allow the seats to be reserved for other backward classes (OBC) for the civic polls and ordered Maharashtra to re-notify them as general category seats. Elections for 336 seats in 93 nagar panchayats, which were earlier reserved for OBCs, were held in the second phase on January 18.On Wednesday morning, the counting of votes in 97 nagar panchayats began in various districts of the state. Votes for the 9 panchayats in Maoist-affected Gadchiroli will be held on Thursday.Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil cheered party workers for the party’s performance though the BJP has been out of power for 26 months. He also took a quick swipe at chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “The Shiv Sena got the chief minister’s post, but it is struggling to remain in the third or fourth position in these elections,” Patil said.Chandrashekhar Bawankule, a former minister and OBC face of the state BJP, said: “Despite the use of the money and muscle power by the ruling parties in the local body elections, the BJP has emerged as the leader by winning the highest number of seats. With the help of our allies, we will control more than 30 nagar panchayats that went to polls”.NCP state unit chief Jayant Patil celebrated the fact that the NCP emerged won the largest number of nagar panchayats, 25. “It is the result of our continuous efforts of serving the people and taking up the issues related to them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-wins-400-seats-in-nagar-panchayat-polls-jabs-uddhav-thackeray-over-sena-tally-101642600761147.html

20-01-2022||Lucknow||Bhim Army chief to contest against Yogi in Gorakhpur||Lucknow: Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad will contest the assembly election against chief minister Yogi Adityanath from Gorakhpur urban seat. Chief election in-charge of Bhim Army, Dr Mohammad Akib said Chandrashekhar Azad would contest the assembly election from Gorakhpur urban seat on the ticket of Azad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram), the political outfit launched by the Bhim Army in 2020. Azad will contest the election on the issue of social justice and share in power of dalits, backwards, Muslims and weaker sections of society. Under the BJP government, the weaker sections had been suppressed. To take the fight for social justice to the Hindutva stronghold Gorakhpur, the Azad Samaj Party had decided to field party chief Chandrashekhar Azad against chief minister Yogi Adityanath, he said. The Azad Samaj Party would release its election manifesto for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections within two days, he said. After failing to stitch an alliance with the Samajwadi Party (SP), Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad had announced on Tuesday that his Azad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram) would contest the assembly election alone. On Thursday, he called upon the party workers to gear up for the contest against chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been winning the assembly election on Gorakhpur urban seat since 1989. The present BJP MLA from Gorakhpur urban seat Radha Mohan Das Agarwal has won the seat four times. Yogi Adityanath converted Gorakhpur into a Hindutva stronghold after winning the Lok Sabha election in 1998. He won the Lok Sabha seat in 2004, 2009 and 2014. Yogi vacated the seat after becoming chief minister in 2017. In the by-poll held in 2018, the BJP suffered setback after Nishad Party leader Praveen Nishad, who contested on the Samajwadi Party ticket, defeated BJP candidate Upendra Dutt Shukla. In 2019 Lok Sabha election, the BJP captured the seat. Among the 4.53 lakh voters in Gorakhpur urban seat, majority consists of upper castes, trader community, Muslims and backwards. Dalits constitute around 25,000 to 30,000 voters who support the BJP or the BSP in the consecutive assembly and Lok Sabha elections. The BSP enjoys hold over the Jatav voters. BSP candidates had polled 15,000 to 24,000 votes in the last four assembly (2002,2007, 2012 and 2017), The Samajwadi Party that enjoys hold over the OBC and Muslim voters, had been challenging the BJP in the consecutive assembly elections since the early nineties, said Satyadeo Singh, a teacher in government college, Gorakhpur. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath is the head priest of Gorakhnath temple that is revered by Hindus belonging to upper caste, backward and dalit sections. The sah- bhoj (community feast) with the dalit community organized by Yogi Adityanath has strengthened his hold over the Scheduled Castes. As an MP, he also launched movements for the rights of marginalized communities, including Musahars and Vantangiyas. In return, these communities had been voting for the BJP in the elections, he said. BJP state unit spokesperson Sameer Singh said under the leadership of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, the party had been working on the Hindutva and development agenda and all communities benefited with the welfare schemes launched by the BJP government with ‘sabka saath- sabka vikas’ mantra. The Bhim Army indulged in caste politics and had nsupport base in Gorakhpur region, he said. 
20-01-2022||Patna||Niti Ayog delta ranking: Backward Khagaria gets tops in Bihar, to get more funds||Khagaria district in Bihar has secured first rank on the basis of overall performance assessment in the month of November 2021, as per the Niti Aayog ranking under the aspirational districts programme, officials said.Niti Aayog chief executive officer Amitabh Kant communicated this to Bihar’s chief secretary Amit Subhani on Wednesday. This makes Khagaria entitled to receive additional grant of ₹10 crore, says the Niti Aayog letter.It is a significant development for Khagaria, which is one of the most backward districts in Bihar and is hit by by floods every year. Khagaria district magistrate Alok Ranjan Ghosh said, “It has got top rank in overall as well as health indicators. There are five parameters, of which Khagaria showed maximum improvement from its previous position in two, while in the rest three, it has been ranked third or fourth. There is still a long way to go. For serious illness, people still go to Bhagalpur, Begusarai or Patna. We hope Khagaria will be able to cater to its people’s health care needs within the district one day,” he said.Ghosh said the district had mainly focused on health and education. “Health is one area where improvement can show in a short span, viz, institutional delivery, anaemia control programme, immunisation, functioning of primary health centres, Covid care etc. In some spheres, changes will be visible only over a long period. The district has tried to make small, determined efforts for improvement. The district was ranked No.1 twice in the past also and we got ₹13 crore in funds. Now, another ₹10 crore means we can have more schemes,” he said.The DM said the district would now send proposals to improve the condition of farming and farmers. “Flood is a perennial problem in the area, where 15 panchayats are located in river beds. As a result, health centres also get affected. We plan to send a proposal for special health centres for flood affected places. They could be elevated to ensure people’s accessibility despite floods. We also intend planning for maize production and processing so that the farmers get the benefits. Two upcoming units for animal and poultry feed will help. Ethanol unit is also coming up. There is also immense scope for banana cultivation,” he said.Launched by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January 2018, the aspirational districts programme aims to quickly and effectively transform 112 most underdeveloped districts across the country, of which 13 are in Bihar. The broad contours of the programme are convergence (of central & state Schemes), collaboration (of central, state-level ‘Prabhari’ officers & district collectors), and competition among districts through monthly delta ranking.

20-01-2022||Chandigarh||At 5,818, Jammu and Kashmir’s Covid daily cases hit all-time high||Jammu and Kashmir’s daily Covid cases breached all records since the onset of the pandemic in 2020 after the UT recorded 5,818 fresh infections on Wednesday. Four people also lost their lives to the disease in Jammu division. Before Wednesday’s surge, the highest caseload had been reported at the peak of the second wave on May 7, 2021 when the UT had seen 5,443 infections and 50 deaths. At the peak of the first wave, Jammu and Kashmir had reported a high of 1,698 cases and 10 deaths on September 12, 2020. Positivity rate touches 7%Active cases in the Union Territory reached 26,236 on Wednesday. Officials said a record 83,019 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours in the UT, taking the daily test positivity rate to 7% for the first time since May when the second wave had peaked. The authorities have increased the testing rate this month as they have been conducting between 42,000 and 56,000 average daily tests every month from May to December. Health experts say that the third wave has been fuelled by Omicron, a highly transmissible variable of Covid. “The doubling time of Omicron is 3-4 days, which is why it is spreading so quickly,” said Dr Rouf Hussain Rather, community medicine specialist and in-charge data analysis at divisional Covid control room in Kashmir, adding that on the upside the infectiosn were very mild.  “If one gets infected his or her chances of getting admitted to a hospital are very low and chances of succumbing are also less. Vaccination has also alleviated the situation,” he said. Of the total infections on Wednesday, Kashmir valley saw almost 70 % of the infections with 4,066 cases while 1,752 cases and all the four deaths were reported in the Jammu division.Rather said they are hopeful that the wave will wane quickly, judging by its rate of ascend. “The wave may be over by as early as February-end,” he said. Kashmir sees 1,745 casesKashmir valley saw 1,745 cases, while Srinagar saw 791 cases, Baramulla 594, and Budgam and Pulwama 230.Jammu district reported 1,131 cases, followed by 105 in Udhampur and 100 in Kathua. Srinagar has taken over as the district with highest number of Covid active cases at 6,189, followed by Jammu and Baramulla districts with 5,760 and 3,856 active cases, respectively.Of the 4,794 beds dedicated for Covid patients, just 8.32% or 416 are occupied in J&K, indicating that the higher cases are not translating into higher hospital admissions. Rather said that the hospital admissions in Kashmir were less than 2% of the active cases. “In the past we usually got 8-10 % of active cases admitted in hospitals. This time our hospital occupancy is less,” he said. “When the wave crosses its peak, the percentage of admissions increases further. We have to keep a track of the active cases. The more the denominator, the more chances of increase in admissions even if they are less than 4% of active cases,” he said.He said that the authorities are looking into that aspect and trying to increase the bed strength further in the divisions. “For example, in Kashmir we have more than 3,000 beds and we can extend it by 1,000 more,” he said.J&K hits milestone of vaccinating 2 crore persons 
20-01-2022||Noida||Ghaziabad gets over 2,000 fresh Covid cases in a day for second time this month||The district on Wednesday registered 2,041 fresh Covid-19 cases, the second-highest spike in a single day since the beginning of the pandemic. The district reported the highest number of cases in a single day four days ago on January 16, when it recorded 2,103 new cases. According to official data, 19,121 infections have been reported in January alone, the month which has recorded the maximum Covid cases (till Jan 19) since the start of the outbreak. A total of 4,789 samples were collected on Wednesday, the lowest number of samples to be collected in the two weeks ending on January 18. “The sampling got reduced as there were HR issues with the staff, which have now been sorted out. The testing will again increase. The number of fresh cases shot up as we received many pending reports from labs in Lucknow (on Wednesday). Currently, there are about 8,000 test reports pending at Lucknow and we have asked the state officials to get these expedited,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer. Experts said cases have not seen a considerable decline so far. “There is a need to ramp up testing to find more cases. This will help in isolating the patients and prevent the further spread of infection,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter).Meanwhile, starting January 24, the state government has issued directions for a five-day door-to-door survey across the states to find out people suffering from Covid-like symptoms and people over 60-years-old, who have still not taken their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Officials said the survey will follow the pattern adopted for pulse polio immunisation, and children who have been left out of routine vaccination will also be identified. Officials of the Ghaziabad health department said the survey also aims to identify people, who have been left out of the Covid vaccination programme. “The drive will be launched in rural as well as urban areas. We have formed about 1,950 teams, who will be a part of the door-to-door survey. Proper training schedule has also been chalked out for the teams well before the drive begins. Wherever needed, the rapid response teams will also assist the survey teams,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer. He added people suffering from influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) will also be identified and tested while people needing vaccine doses will also be jabbed at their doorstep. The order issued by Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health), stated that cases of ILI/SARI will be shifted to presumptive Covid wards with the help of ambulances. According to the figures available on the CoWIN portal till Wednesday evening, Ghaziabad district completed administering 2,937,718 first doses, 1,997,365 second doses and 20,555 precaution doses, besides inoculating 125,709 children in the 15-17 age group with the first dose of Covaxin.
20-01-2022||Chandigarh||Criminal cases against lawmakers: HC expresses displeasure over slow pace of probe||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday expressed displeasure over the slow pace of probe in criminal cases against lawmakers.Posting matter for further hearing on March 28, the high court bench of justices AG Masih and Sandeep Moudgil gave time to Punjab Police and Haryana Police to file fresh status reports in pending cases by then.“The assurances which were given on the last date of hearing as recorded in the order dated November 11, 2021, have not been fulfilled in toto. We would not say that the intention on the part of the state of Punjab or Haryana is lacking, but the efforts and the actions supporting the said intention appear to be missing or at least lagging. The reports as have been submitted indicate the movement in the right direction but the pace thereof is moving cannot be, by any stretch of imagination, said to be satisfactory”, the bench observed while perusing the reports submitted by police from both the states.On November 11, the court had observed that the speed at which the progress of investigation is going on is not satisfactory. It had given six weeks to speed up the probes and sought fresh status reports.The court was hearing a plea in which it is monitoring probe in criminal cases against lawmakers on the orders from the apex court since February 2021. According to an affidavit filed last year, 53 criminal cases against former and current lawmakers are pending in trial courts in Punjab.These are other than 29 criminal cases in which probe was pending. As of Haryana, 82 criminal cases are registered in the state against sitting and former MLAs and MPs.In the affidavit filed by Gursharan Singh Sandhu, inspector general of police, Bureau of Investigation, Punjab, had told the court that scrutiny of 29 criminal cases pending till November 11 has been carried out in which untraced and cancellation reports have been filed in 23 cases and submitted before the courts concerned. Investigation is pending in seven cases, the affidavit said. The affidavit reveals that the police filed cancellation reports in FIRs against SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, AAP MP Bhagwant Mann, Lok Insaaf Party leaders Balwinder Singh Bains and Simarjit Singh Bains, Amarjit Singh Sandhoya and Harpal Singh Cheema, among others. These FIRs were registered under Disaster Management Act and disobedience of order promulgated by public servant during Covid. Criminal cases pending investigationTwo criminal cases were registered against former MLA Anil Joshi in Amritsar in 2012 under the Excise Act and criminal conspiracy and the second FIR was registered against him in August 2021 under the Disaster Management Act and disobedience of order promulgated by a public servant. An FIR was registered against former MLA Malkeet Singh in August 2020 in Amritsar on allegations of disobedience of order promulgated by public servant and performing an act which may cause spread of a disease. Ex-MLA Ajit Singh Kohar and MLAs Pawan Kumar Tinu, Gurpartap Singh Wadala and Baldev Singh Khehra were booked in an FIR registered in Jalandhar in December 2017 on allegations of disobedience of order promulgated by public servant and National Highways Act.

20-01-2022||Chandigarh||Buddha Nullah pollution: World Cancer Care Society asks people to vote wisely in upcoming Punjab assembly elections||Lambasting the industry for allegedly polluting Buddha Nullah and dubbing the city as a ‘hub of cancer’, the World Cancer Care Charitable Society urged the public to question the Punjab assembly elections’ candidates on the steps being taken to clean the drain. A team from the organisation, led by its global ambassador Kulwant Singh Dhaliwal, on Wednesday visited the nullah to spread awareness among residents. Alleging that the industry and administration is putting lives at risk, Dhaliwal say they will submit a report regarding the Buddha Nullah pollution to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations Organisation (UNO). “Our society has been working on cancer-related issues in the state for a long time. Knowing about Buddha Nullah pollution, we travelled around 12 kms on Wednesday and appealed to the public to ask questions from the leaders who will come to seek votes,” Dhaliwal said. The Buddha Nullah has been a bane for the city for decades and despite tall claims made by the successive governments, the pollution levels have not been brought under control.“Tall claims have been made of a major ₹650-crore-project to clean the nullah being launched, but nothing has materialised,” the group’s global ambassador claimed.Dhaliwal further said the people living in the vicinity of the drain are suffering from different diseases like cancer, Hepatitis B and C, liver problems among others, before making an appeal to industrialists to end the alleged pollution.He highlighted the huge number of cancer cases in the city, adding that the administration has still failed to take the required steps to clean the nullah.“We have also collected samples of residents from the area and will also submit a report regarding the buddha nullah pollution with UNO and WHO in the coming time,” Dhaliwal said, adding that the organisation had no political affiliations and did not support any party or outfit. The Municipal Corporation (MC) officials and the state government, meanwhile, are said to be working to set up a new sewer treatment plant (STP) and upgrade the old under the project to clean the nullah. They added that a Common Effluent Treatment plant (CETP) has also been established by industry and Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to stop the dyeing industry discharge from getting into the nullah. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said the STPs are being established at the cost of around ₹519 crores and interceptor lines are also being installed to stop direct discharge, before adding that other steps are also being taken to stop pollution in the drain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/buddha-nullah-pollution-world-cancer-care-society-asks-people-to-vote-wisely-in-upcoming-punjab-assembly-elections-101642617865616.html
20-01-2022||World||Doomsday Clock stays at 100 seconds to midnight, says Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists||NEW DELHI: The influential Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS) on Thursday retained its “Doomsday Clock” at 100 seconds to midnight, pointing to the continuing and dangerous threats posed by nuclear weapons, climate change, disruptive technologies and Covid-19.BAS said leaders across the world “must immediately commit themselves to renewed cooperation in the many ways and venues available for reducing existential risk”.It added: “Citizens of the world can and should organise to demand that their leaders do so – and quickly. The doorstep of doom is no place to loiter.”BAS was founded in 1945 by Albert Einstein, J Robert Oppenheimer, Eugene Rabinowitch and scientists from the University of Chicago who helped develop the first atomic weapons, and the organisation created the Doomsday Clock two years later. According to the organisation’s website, the clock uses the “imagery of apocalypse (midnight) and the contemporary idiom of nuclear explosion (countdown to zero) to convey threats to humanity”.Every year, BAS’s Science and Security Board, in consultation with its board of sponsors that includes 11 Nobel laureates, makes the decision to move, or to leave in place, the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock. BAS has reset the minute hand on the Doomsday Clock 24 times since its debut in 1947.The last movement was in 2020, when the minute hand was moved from two minutes to midnight to 100 seconds from midnight because of an “unprecedentedly high risk” of a nuclear exchange. This brought the minute hand closer to midnight than ever in the Doomsday Clock’s history.BAS said factors such as nuclear weapons, climate change, disruptive technologies and the pandemic were exacerbated by “a corrupted information ecosphere that undermines rational decision making”.Rachel Bronson, president and CEO of BAS, said: “The Doomsday Clock continues to hover dangerously, reminding us about how much work is needed to be done to ensure a safer and healthier planet. We must continue to push the hands of the clock away from midnight.”Sharon Squassoni, co-chair of the Science and Security Board of BAS, said: “One hundred seconds to midnight reflects the board’s judgment that we are stuck in a perilous moment – one that brings neither stability nor security. Positive developments in 2021 failed to counteract negative, long-term trends.”BAS said the leadership change in the US last year had provided hope that “what seemed like a global race toward catastrophe might be halted and – with renewed US engagement – even reversed”. The Biden administration changed policies in some ways that made the world safer, such as agreeing to an extension of the New START arms control agreement and beginning strategic stability talks with Russia, announcing the US would seek to return to the Iran nuclear deal, and rejoining the Paris climate accord. Science and evidence also returned to US policy-making, especially regarding the pandemic, but these changes were not enough to reverse negative international security trends, the organisation said.US relations with Russia and China remain tense and all three countries are engaged in nuclear modernisation and expansion efforts, including Beijing’s large-scale programme to increase its deployment of silo-based long-range nuclear missiles. “If not restrained, these efforts could mark the start of a dangerous new nuclear arms race,” BAS said. “Ukraine remains a potential flashpoint, and Russian troop deployments to the Ukrainian border heighten day-to-day tensions,” it noted.BAS listed steps that should be taken to address current threats and to reverse the hands of the Doomsday Clock.It said the Russian and US presidents should identify “more ambitious and comprehensive limits on nuclear weapons and delivery systems by the end of 2022”, and agree to “reduce reliance on nuclear weapons by limiting their roles, missions and platforms”.The US should persuade allies and rivals that no-first-use of nuclear weapons is a step toward security and stability, and then declare such a policy in concert with Russia and China.The US and other countries should accelerate decarbonisation, and China should set an example by pursuing sustainable development pathways in the One Belt One Road initiative. The US and other leaders should work through World Health Organisation (WHO) and other international institutions to reduce biological risks of all kinds through better monitoring of animal-human interactions, improvements in international disease surveillance and reporting, increased production and distribution of medical supplies, and expanded hospital capacity, it added.
20-01-2022||World||US official lays out Biden’s China strategy, says India’s role ‘critical’||In its first year in office, the Joe Biden administration has focused on a five-part strategy to compete with China, and sees India’s role as “critical” in both pushing back against China, and advancing an affirmative vision of the Indo-Pacific, National Security Council (NSC) senior director for China Laura Rosenberger said on Wednesday.Speaking at the launch of Strategic Asia 2020-21 – a report on challenges emanating from US-China strategic competition, deglobalisation, and Covid-19 for countries and regions in the Indo-Pacific, Rosenberger said the administration’s approach to China rested on the analysis that while competition is particularly pronounced in the Indo-Pacific, it is playing out globally.When asked about how the US saw India’s role in this competition with China, at a time when India is facing China’s military aggression at the border, Rosenberger said, “We have taken a number of steps to deepen the partnership with India…India’s role is quite critical.”And the fact that the leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) - India, US, Australia, and Japan - had met twice in the past year, once virtually and once in-person, was proof of the importance of the format, she said.Acknowledging that Beijing had been “engaging in provocations” along India’s border, Rosenberger said that India was an important partner not just in terms of pushing back China but also on a range of other issues, from vaccines to technology, as well as for advancing a different and affirmative vision of the Indo-Pacific.Rosenberger said that the first element of the broader US strategy on China involved “investing in ourselves”.“You can’t win a competition with only defence,” she said. This entailed, over the past year, battling the pandemic, staving off the prospects for recession, decreasing unemployment, ramping up vaccination, investing in infrastructure, diversifying supply chains to ensure that US was not dependent, and investing in the country’s technological edge.The second element, she said, was “investing in allies and partners”. This included intensive diplomacy with European allies and partners, harmonising differences, giving momentum to Quad, and deepening ties with the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), among other steps.The third element was “shaping the international environment around China”, which involved re-engaging with multilateral platforms, and reinforcing deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, among other steps.Rosenberger said the fourth element of the administration’s strategy was based on “defending our values”. This involved imposing costs on China for its actions in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, ensuring global norms and institutions were consistent with democratic values, “strengthening democracy at home and abroad”, and showcasing how democracy delivered.The final element of the strategy, the NSC official said, was “responsibly managing competition” with China. This entailed maintaining channels of communication at the leader-level and installing “guardrails” to ensure that competition did not descend into conflict. Rosenberger cited the example of the Biden-Xi Jinping virtual summit in November as evidence of this engagement, and said these engagements provided an opportunity to set the terms of competition as well as discuss areas where interests align.
20-01-2022||World||UN approves resolution condemning Holocaust denial||The U.N. General Assembly approved an Israeli-sponsored resolution Thursday condemning any denial of the Holocaust and urging all nations and social media companies “to take active measures to combat antisemitism and Holocaust denial or distortion.”The 193-member world body approved the resolution by consensus -- without a vote -- and with a bang of a gavel by Assembly President Abdulla Shahid. Israel’s No. 1 enemy, Iran, “disassociated” itself from the resolution.The ambassadors of Israel and Germany, which strongly supported the resolution, stressed the significance of the resolution’s adoption on Jan. 20: It is the 80th anniversary of the Wannsee Conference where Nazi leaders coordinated plans for the so-called “Final Solution of the Jewish Question” at a villa on the shores of Berlin’s Wannsee Lake in 1942 during World War II.The result was the establishment of Nazi death camps and the murder of nearly 6 million Jews, comprising one-third of the Jewish people. In addition, millions of people from other nationalities, minorities and targeted groups were killed, according to the draft resolution.“We now live in an era in which fiction is becoming fact and the Holocaust is becoming a distant memory,” Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan told the assembly in urging support for the resolution. “And as this happens following the greatest crime in human history, now comes the greatest cover-up in human history.”Erdan, the grandson of Holocaust survivors, said the resolution is a commitment to make sure that Holocaust distortion and denial “will be tolerated no more.”He said social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and You Tube are spreading the “pandemic of distortions and lies” about the Holocaust“Social media giants can no longer remain complacent to the hate spread on their platforms” and must take action now, the Israeli ambassador said.The resolution commends countries that have preserved Nazi death camps and other sites from the Holocaust and urges the 193 U.N. member states “to develop educational programs that will inculcate future generations with the lessons of the Holocaust in order to help to prevent future acts of genocide.”It requests the U.N. and its agencies to continue developing and implementing programs aimed at countering Holocaust denial and distortions and to mobilize civil society and others to provide truthful facts about the Holocaust.Currently, the U.N. has an outreach program on the Holocaust and the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, has a program on Holocaust education and combatting anti-Semitism.Unlike Security Council resolutions, General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but do reflect global opinion.The General Assembly designated Jan. 27 — the day the Auschwitz concentration camp was liberated by the Soviet army — as the annual International Day of Commemoration in memory of victims of the Holocaust in 2005. The resolution underlines that remembrance “is a key component to the prevention of further acts of genocide.”It says Holocaust denial “refers to discourse and propaganda that deny the historical reality and the extent of the extermination of the Jews by the Nazis and their accomplices during World War II” and “any attempt to claim that the Holocaust did not take place” or call into doubt that gas chambers, mass shooting, starvation, and intentional genocide were used against the Jewish people.The resolution says distorting or denying the Holocaust also refers to “intentional efforts to excuse or minimize” the role of Nazi collaborators and allies, “gross minimization” of the number of victims, “attempts to blame the Jews for causing their own genocide,” statements casting the Holocaust as a positive event, and attempt to “blur the responsibility” for establishing concentration and death camps “by putting blame on other nations or ethnic groups.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-approves-resolution-condemning-holocaust-denial-101642697746617.html
20-01-2022||World||Biden confirms Kamala Harris would be running mate in 2024||Addressing a press conference to mark his first year in office on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden confirmed that if he runs for a second term in 2024, he would nominate vice-president Kamala Harris as his running mate again, even as he blamed Republican obstructionism for blocking progress in his first year in office and committed to greater public outreach to explain the administration’s work in his second year.The president commended his administration for progress in the battle against Covid-19, while acknowledging that the job remained unfinished, and battling unemployment, which was at 3.9% in December. Biden outlined steps that he was taking to tame to inflation – focusing on supply chain issues and indicating a role for the Federal Reserve in terms of monetary policy.He indicated a willingness, for the first time, to break up his signature legislation, the $1.9 trillion Build Back Better plan, into smaller components and pass whatever was possible at the moment. And he reiterated his commitment to getting bills related to voting rights passed, even as it failed to muster the numbers in the Senate the same evening. When asked if he was satisfied with VP Harris’s work on voting rights (Biden has given her charge of the contentious issue), and if he would nominate her as his running mate again if he stood in 2024, Biden said, “Yes and yes.” His remarks, though not unusual since it would have been rare for a sitting president to undermine his VP, assume salience given recent critical reports in the US media about Harris’s working style, and possible challenges from other contenders in the party if she positions herself as a presidential candidate in 2024. Biden would be 82 in 2024.But the focus of Biden’s remarks on domestic US politics rested on critiquing Republicans: he repeatedly wondered what they stood for, alleged they had been far more obstructionist than they had been even during Barack Obama’s presidency, and claimed that the entire party was in fear of “one man” who had lost office, hinting at Donald Trump.“Did you ever think that one man out of office could intimidate an entire party where they’re unwilling to take any vote contrary to what he thinks should be taken for fear of being defeated in a primary? I have had five Republican senators talk to me, bump into me, or sit with me, who’ve told me that they agree with whatever I’m talking about for them to do. ‘But, Joe, if I do it, I’m going to get defeated in a primary’”, he said.The president, who is battling unfavourable ratings, said he would do three things differently in the second year of office. “Number one, I am going to get out of this place more often. I’m going to go out and talk to the public… Number two, I am also going to be out there seeking the advice of experts outside, from academia, to editorial writers, to think tanks,” he said.“And the third thing I’m going to be doing is be deeply involved in these off-year elections. We’re going to be raising a lot of money. We’re going to be out there making sure that we’re helping all of those candidates,” Biden further said. He was referring to elections to the House of Representatives, and one-third of the seats in the Senate in November this year. The Democrats, at the moment, command a majority in the House, while the Senate is split 50:50. Observers believe that the outcome in the mid-terms will have a major impact on the remaining two years of the Biden presidency.

20-01-2022||World||In a first, Amazon to open fashion store where algorithms suggest what to try on||Amazon.com Inc's recipe for the department store of the future includes algorithmic recommendations and what one corporate director called "a magic closet" in the fitting room.The online retailer is making another push to grow its fashion business, announcing on Thursday it will open its first-ever apparel store this year, with a tech twist. "We wouldn't do anything in physical retail unless we felt we could significantly improve the customer experience," said Simoina Vasen, a managing director.At 30,000 square feet (2,787 sq meters), the planned "Amazon Style" shop near Los Angeles is smaller than the typical department store. Model items are on the racks, and customers scan a code using Amazon's mobile app to select the color and size they would like. To try on the clothes, which are stored in the back, shoppers enter a virtual queue for a fitting room that they unlock with their smartphone when it is ready.Inside, the dressing room is "a personal space for you to continue shopping without ever having to leave," Vasen said. Each has a touchscreen letting shoppers request more items that staff deliver to a secure, two-sided closet "within minutes," she said."It's like a magic closet with seemingly endless selection," Vasen said.The touchscreens suggest items to shoppers too. Amazon keeps a record of every good a customer scans so its algorithms personalize clothing recommendations. Shoppers can fill out a style survey as well. By the time they arrive in a fitting room, employees have already deposited customers' requested items and others that Amazon has picked.Shoppers can opt out with a concierge's help, Amazon said.Amazon has unveiled tech to help customers choose outfits before. The company has surpassed Walmart Inc as the most-shopped clothing retailer in the United States, according to analyst research.But it still has room to expand and compete with the likes of Macy's Inc and Nordstrom Inc, which have opened smaller-format stores.

20-01-2022||World||Not heavy viral load; studies say this is the reason why Omicron spreads so fast||The viral load of Omicron and Delta is almost the same and it is not the reason why Omicron rapidly surged across the world and became the dominant SARs-CoV-2 strain replacing Delta. According to Nature, two studies, yet to be peer-reviewed, have shown that the Omicron does not release a larger amount of viral load than Delta. It is spreading in lightning speed only because it is able to evade immunity -- either natural or generated by past vaccination.The results suggest that Omicron’s hyper-transmissibility does not stem from the release of large amounts of virus from infected people. Instead, the best explanation for its lightning-fast spread is its ability to evade SARS-CoV-2 immunity caused by either vaccination or past infection, Emily Bruce, a virologist at the University of Vermont in Burlington, said.What is viral load? It is the amount of the virus in an infected person. The RT-PCR test reveals the viral load. The CT value of the RT-PCR test report indicates the viral load, the lower the value, the higher the viral load is.To compare the viral loads, the researchers studied the PCR test results of the nose and throat swabs collected from infected individuals and found that those who had Delta had a slightly higher viral load than those who had Omicron. “I was really not expecting to see that,” Yonatan Grad, an infectious-disease specialist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, said.“Naturally, you’d think that higher transmissibility must cause a higher viral load,” Benjamin Meyer, a virologist at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, said.Since the identification of Omicron in South Africa on November 24, 2021, the latest variant of the virus has been spreading at an unprecedented speed and within two months, Omicron has become the dominant strain in the world, inviting a fresh surge of the pandemic.  According to many scientists, Omicron is an altogether different pandemic with patients showing different symptoms. Unlike Delta, Omicron is not affecting the lungs leading to a lower hospitalisation rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-heavy-viral-load-studies-say-this-is-the-reason-why-omicron-spreads-so-fast-101642674095575.html

From now on, Govt is no longer asking people to work from home," he said.Johnson further said that the UK was the first nation in the world to administer a vaccine, and one of the fastest in Europe to roll it out."This was because we made the big call to pursue our own vaccine procurement, outside of the European Medicines Agency (EMA)," said Johnson."We made the tough decision to open up last summer when others said that we shouldn't, and kept open this winter while others locked down. As a result, we have the most open economy and society in Europe, and the fastest-growing economy in the G7," added Johnson.The UK PM also said that they are the first nation to emerge from the Omicron wave because it focused on NHS on delivering the fastest booster campaign in Europe."And it is because of the extraordinary booster campaign - together with the way the public has responded to the Plan B measures - that we can return to Plan A in England and allow Plan B regulations to expire," said Johnson.Plan B measures refer to legally enforced face masks, mandatory Covid passes, and advice to work from home.Johnson also said that his "government got the big things right". He said, "Confronted by the nation's biggest challenge since the Second World War and the worst pandemic since 1918, any government would get some things wrong."The move comes amid a peak in Covid-19 cases in the UK and his former chief adviser Dominic Cummings accusations that the British prime minister lied to the parliament that he thought a drinks party held in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown was work-related."On 18 January 94,432 new cases and 438 deaths in 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK," tweeted UK Health Security Agency.A total of 52,133,611 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine, while 47,989,635 people have now received the second dose of a vaccine.Meanwhile, 36,546,583 people have received a booster dose, added UK Health Security Agency.The UK was the first country to raise alarm over Covid-19 mutations, to limit international travel over the Omicron variant, and in December introduced work-at-home advice, more mask-wearing and vaccine passes to slow its spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-boris-johnson-rolls-back-covid-19-measures-including-mandatory-face-masks-vaccine-pass-101642671837226.html

Vouchers!" Chancellor Karl Nehammer told a news conference with the leader of the opposition Social Democrats, Pamela Rendi-Wagner, with whom the measure was negotiated.Nehammer said he wanted there to be a financial reward for those who get vaccinated, adding: "We have learned from the past and we have seen that a vaccination lottery is the best possible way to set up such a system."Members of the public, whether already vaccinated or not, would get a ticket for each shot they have had - three tickets in total for those who have had their booster shot.Every tenth ticket would win a 500 euro ($568) gift voucher, Nehammer said, without specifying what the vouchers were for.The lower house of parliament is due to pass a bill later on Thursday making vaccines compulsory for all adults in Austria, with initial fines of 600 euros, rising to up to 3,600 euros if the fine is challenged unsuccessfully.Austria will be the first European Union country to introduce a Covid vaccine mandate for all adults when the measure takes effect on February 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austria-introduces-lottery-to-encourage-citizens-to-get-vaccinated-against-covid-101642669141302.html

The random trial involving 52 Canadian hospitals, and with 1,282 patients, had researchers studying the effects of Remdesivir in hospitalised patients with Covid-19 between August 14, 2020, and April 1, 2021.According to a release issued by CMAJ, the researchers found that among patients not receiving mechanical ventilation at the start of the study, the need for mechanical ventilation arose for 8% of those receiving Remdesivir compared with 15% of those receiving standard care. “In addition, patients treated with Remdesivir were able to come off oxygen and ventilators sooner than those receiving standard care,” the release said.It quoted the study’s authors, led by University of British Columbia’s Dr Srinivas Murthy, as saying, “The benefit of treatment was most apparent for preventing the need for mechanical ventilation, suggesting probable added value for patients with less severe disease to avoid progression during hospital stay.”“This may have important implications for patients and for health systems, particularly when ICU capacity, mechanical ventilation or oxygen is in limited supply,” they added.The trials were led by researchers at University of British Columbia and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.The research gains relevance as the number of persons infected with the Omicron variant of Covid-19 grows across the world, including in India and Canada. While infections from the variant are considered milder than those earlier, its rapid transmissibility has led to record number of cases being reported on a daily basis in Canada.Last week, Canada also cleared the use of the antiviral pill Paxlovid, manufactured by Pfizer, which is aimed at reducing hospitalisation amid the surge in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remdesivir-cuts-need-for-medical-ventilation-by-50-in-covid-patients-canadian-study-101642668329443.html

Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are already in use in Australia. Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen vaccine is also approved but the government has not bought any.The Novavax vaccine will be available to unvaccinated Australians aged 18 years and older but will not be used as a booster for the 95% of the population aged 16 and older who have already received a vaccine.“There are some individuals, notwithstanding a massive take up of vaccination in this country, who have been waiting for Novavax, and it’s great that it’s finally been approved,” said chief regulator John Skerritt, head of the Therapeutic Goods Administration.“Our dream is we might turn our 95% into a 97 or 98% in this country,” Skerritt added.The protein-based vaccine is to be administered in two doses three weeks apart.Paul Griffin, associate professor of medicine at Queensland University, said Australia needed to strive to improve an already impressive vaccination rate.“For a variety of reasons, it seems some have remained reluctant to receive these vaccines thus far so an additional option, based on what is considered perhaps a more traditional platform, is likely to increase our vaccination rate even further,” Griffin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novavax-becomes-australia-s-5th-approved-covid-19-vaccine-101642666851174.html
20-01-2022||World||What is behind the surge in Omicron cases in US? Report points to sewage water||The Omicron variant of Covid-19, which is the primary reason for the worsening pandemic situation in the United States, has set authorities thinking for how long this surge might last.According to a report by the New York Times, the omicron variant's surge is emerging from the unlikely source, the sewage.People who test positive for the coronavirus disease shed the virus in their stool, the report said, adding “the virus levels in local wastewater provide a strong, independent signal of how much is circulating in a given community.”The sewage data reveals an Omicron wave that is cresting at various times and locations.In Boston city, the surge in Covid-19 cases might have hit a peak amid a steep decline in viral signals in wastewater.Biobot Analytics, a Boston-based startup that monitors Covid-19 levels in sewage, said the virus concentration in the city’s wastewater samples is down over 50% from its recent peak.Apart from analysing Boston, Biobot Analytics is also tracking the virus in 183 communities across 25 states. The firm said that virus levels have already started to drop in many big cities. However, they are rising in smaller communities, according to the New York Times report.The drop of virus concentration in Boston's wastewater samples is the most dramatic to date, Biobot Analytics president and co-founder Newsha Ghaeli said last week.“We are pretty confident and hopeful that we have passed the peak of omicron infections,” Ghaeli told Bloomberg Radio on January 13 and added that hospitalisations might still surge “but there are better days ahead.”Citing wastewater data, Boston's mayor Michelle Wu said on January 13 that Omicron's peak may be past us soon.In the state of Florida, sewage data has indicated that the Omicron crisis in Miami-Dade County might soon peak, according to Bloomberg. On the other hand, in New York, people visiting emergency departments with Covid-like illness have dipped in all five boroughs.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that has been funding sewage surveillance in the US is now planning to add sewage surveillance to its daily Covid tracker on the internet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-behind-the-surge-in-omicron-cases-in-us-report-points-to-sewage-water-101642657526941.html

The airline released a statement saying Boeing has issued a clearance to operate flights on its B777 aircraft.“Boeing has cleared AI to operate to USA on B777. First flight left this morning to JFK. Other flights leaving in the day are to Chicago and SFO. Arrangements to carry stranded pax are being worked out. Matter regarding B777 flying into USA has been sorted,” Air India said in a statement.Air India had cancelled at least eight B777 flights to key destinations in the USA including Chicago, Newark, New York and San Francisco. The airline had said it would try and switch to other aircraft for these routes.In total, airlines have cancelled more than 320 flights to and from the US by Wednesday evening following warnings from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) due to the rollout of high-speed wireless service interfering with aircraft technology that measures altitude, an Associated Press report said. This accounts for a little over 2 per cent of the US total, according to FlightAware."It is important to fully understand and reduce potential 5G signal interference with radio altimeters that are integral to aircraft security systems. We understand that the activation of these services is a part of India's select Coming soon in cities," the Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) expressed concern in a January 4 letter.The FIP also mentioned that if 5G deploys, pilots may face safety issues while operating flights.US telecom service providers AT&T and Verizon had announced that they would pause the 5G roll-out around key airports until the issue was fixed.US is not the first country to rollout 5G services and similar mobile networks have been deployed in more than three dozen countries. However, the US networks are designed in a certain way that raised concern of potential problems for airlines.Boeing Co. has in a statement assured that it would work with airlines, the FAA and others to ensure that all aircrafts can fly safely as 5G is rolled out in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5g-rollout-in-us-air-india-gets-technical-clearance-to-fly-boeing-777-aircraft-101642656884589.html

Its date of construction is given as around 1190.It sits in a rugged, inaccessible valley along the Harirud river, well off Afghanistan's tourist track even in the 1960s, when the country was a magnet for hardy Western travellers.Archeologists backed by UNESCO have tried previously to repair the minaret, but its remote location -- in the heart of territory controlled by the Taliban even before they took power in August -- meant security was always an issue.The last UNESCO mission to the site was in 2019 and at that time they said it faced no risk of collapse.Last year, agency head Audrey Azoulay called on the Taliban to help preserve Afghanistan's cultural heritage, including the minaret.Shortly before their first stint in power came to an end in 2001, the Taliban destroyed two giant centuries-old Buddha statues carved out of a cliff face in Bamiyan, sparking global outrage.They have promised a softer version of rule this time around, and Taliban fighters now guard what remains of the statues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/800yearold-afghan-minaret-in-danger-of-collapse-after-quakes-101642656886179.html
20-01-2022||World||Pakistan’s $7 billion ‘green’ city, Imran Khan's pet project, takes grim turn||After the British divided Pakistan and India more than seven decades ago, Suleman Mohammad Sajjad Warraich’s father received a section of land on the outskirts of Lahore. It was a place to put roots in the new nation. Later on, Warraich and his family filled their 300 collective acres with vegetable plots, marigold gardens, and guava groves.The property was supposed to pass through generations. But early last year Warraich was told that the government would be acquiring the land. He’d be compensated, and his farm turned into something other than agricultural land. That didn’t sit right with him, so he filed a petition opposing the acquisition.Warraich is among dozens of landowners petitioning against the government's plan to build a megacity from scratch on the banks of the Ravi river, a once-thriving waterway that’s been depleted by pollution and dwindling water levels. The $7-billion endeavor would span 46 kilometers (29 miles) and include housing, commercial areas, hospitals and schools — creating a metropolis that could ease pressure on overpopulated Lahore and support its urbanization.The Ravi Urban Development Authority, a government body created to manage the project, pitches it as a green initiative that will bring in much-needed resources to clean up the river. “The idea is to manage the area properly,” says RUDA’s Chief Executive Officer Imran Amin.RUDA aims to build a man-made channel and a series of barrages along the Ravi’s path to control its water level, which the authority says will help conserve what limited flow remains and restore Lahore’s supply of groundwater. But some opponents are skeptical of those claims and what they see as a land grab by RUDA. The city’s high court halted the project last year — one ruling in an ongoing legal fight for the future of the river that could reach Pakistan’s Supreme Court.“This is our property. We don’t want to sell it,” says Warraich, sitting on a white plastic armchair outside his farmhouse. “They are acquiring our land for a new city” where local residents won’t be able to continue farming, he says. “I don’t understand this logic.”Pakistan’s leaders have been trying to develop the banks of the Ravi for almost a decade and Prime Minister Imran Khan has made the task a priority.The Ravi river was instrumental to Lahore’s development, but today large pockets sit stagnant while other sections have dried up completely. A water-sharing treaty with India has limited its flow, while Pakistan’s own mismanagement has exacerbated the problem. For decades, the river has collected untreated sewage from Lahore, as well as industrial and agricultural waste.In recent years, Pakistan has developed legislation to regulate water use amid warnings that the country will face water scarcity by 2025. According to a government study last year, only 39% of water sources across 29 cities were safe for drinking. Cleaning up the Ravi could help Pakistan forestall an impending water crisis — its basin is home to some 50 million people and the river irrigates about 7 million acres of land.These short-term solutions, however, will run up against the climate clock. Most of Pakistan's rivers are fed by melting snow from glaciers in the Himalayas, which are set to shrink as the world heats up. As global average temperatures rise beyond 2 degrees Celsius — a highly likely scenario based on current trajectories — the volume of Himalayan glaciers will be halved.Global warming is set to increase precipitation across Pakistan, but climate models show the seasonality and intensity of those rains will become less predictable. That's bad news for farmers given the vast majority of crops grown in Pakistan are dependent on reliable monsoon patterns. Though agriculture provides less than 20% of the country's gross domestic product, it employs 40% of its labor force.Pakistan isn’t the first country to try and solve its environmental issues with more development. Governments have plowed billions of dollars into eco-city initiatives everywhere from Malaysia to Iceland to simultaneously boost economic growth and adapt to a warming planet. The projects are marked by common features including more efficient public transport, green spaces and wastewater treatment systems.RUDA says that Ravi City will follow the same mold and become a sister city to Lahore, helping to control its urban sprawl while reviving the river. A 2017 census put the population of Pakistan’s second-biggest city at 11 million, though unofficial estimates say it’s grown to about 13 million since. RUDA will take “all the proceeds from this zone which you are developing and put it in the water channelization, barrages and the wastewater treatment plants,” says Amin.Pakistan has had some success with planned cities. Its capital, Islamabad, shares a larger metropolitan area with neighboring Rawalpindi — the way RUDA says it envisions its city relating to Lahore. The grid structure of Islamabad is drastically different from other Pakistani cities; traffic and pollution are better and the city feels orderly in a way Lahore does not.But critics worry that the new city, which RUDA says will take 12 to 15 years to build, will replicate Lahore’s problems instead of fixing them — especially its inequality. They also say the government’s focus on building a new city could lead to further neglect in parts of Lahore. As the city boomed, it has stretched west toward the Ravi, spawning packed settlements around the river. The area’s population density contrasts starkly with growing wealth at the other end of the city, where single-family houses built on large lots in private communities extend far enough to almost kiss the border with India.Lower-income residents in Lahore bear the brunt of the city’s environmental woes, living in areas with dirty water and bad air. Meanwhile, wealthier residents are protected in housing developments that operate like private businesses with separate water supplies. “It’s a very sad reflection of what has happened to our city because it has been totally commercialized,” says Fauzia Qureshi, an architect and urban planner.The question for residents like Warraich who are being pressured to give up their land is whether the potential improvements and compensation will be worth it.To create the proposed city, RUDA would sell land to developers, who would build on it under the government’s supervision. Opponents argue that the promised environmental benefits of Ravi City are being used to justify the government’s exercise of “eminent domain” — giving it the right to claim private property for public use — on land they fear will actually be used by private developers for commercial purposes. RUDA’s official land-use master plan sets aside space for a high-rise residential zone, business district, and area that will be called Sports City.“There won’t be any forced acquisition,” says Amin from RUDA. “Unless it’s important where it’s [a] wastewater treatment plant or something which is necessary to be placed there and we will try our best” to give current residents “a fair market price.”According to Section 45 of the Ravi Urban Development Authority Act, which outlines RUDA’s powers and functions, the authority may “use such force as may be necessary” to “eject any person in unauthorized occupation of any land or property vested in the Authority.” The document also gives RUDA power “to remove, demolish or alter” any building or structure as needed to realize development plans.There’s no guarantee that those plans will help restore the Ravi.Raising the river’s levels by creating a channel and barrages will have “almost no impact” on Lahore’s groundwater levels, says Vaqar Zakaria, an environmental consultant. The city’s water table will keep being depleted unless groundwater usage by housing developers and factories is regulated, he says, something that isn’t addressed in RUDA’s proposal. “Those who are bigger and richer can bore and get the water from the ground and a poor man can’t afford to do that,” Zakaria says. Ravi City “is going to benefit a small number of people, and it's not going to add value to the average citizen.”Environmentalists have also cast doubt on the other green pillar of the Ravi City plan: Lahore’s first wastewater treatment plant.Untreated sewage flows into the Ravi from multiple points, and treating discharge from one area near the Ravi won’t fix the river’s water quality as a whole, says Ahmad Rafay Alam, a lawyer and environmental activist. “Nobody upstream changes their habits and you end up subsidizing pollution.”Amin argues that housing developments are already being built in Lahore without environmental approval. If the area near the Ravi isn’t acquired by RUDA, it would be snapped up by developers who operate with far less oversight. At least, he says, “we make sure that it is planned according to the green standards.”The case against development along the Ravi has been taken up by public interest litigators and lawyers representing landowners. They argue an environmental study RUDA presented in court was inadequate, and that the authority has failed to explain in detail what exactly the 100,000 acres of acquired land will become. Lawyers say a land-use master plan was only submitted in court last month.Advocates also challenge the establishment of the Ravi River Development Authority, whose sweeping control they say is unconstitutional. The way the project is progressing is “unprecedented,” says Waqar Sheikh, a lawyer who argues that RUDA’s development plan doesn’t legally justify government acquisition of land.Sheikh argues that it isn’t in the public interest to get rid of agricultural land since Pakistan already struggles with food shortages. Seventy-five percent of the Ravi river basin is used for agriculture, according to a study by the Asian Development Bank, and a large percentage of the city’s vegetables and dairy supply comes from areas along the Ravi.RUDA now awaits a judgment from the Lahore High Court. If the project doesn’t get permission to go ahead, the authority will likely appeal the decision, sending the case to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, some farmers have agreed to sell their land after negotiating better payments with RUDA.Malik Ghulam Murtaza, a 56-year-old landowner, says he started to see the development more positively after compensation talks with RUDA. He believes the price he was offered will be enough to give his family a better life and he’s convinced the environmental plans will benefit everyone.Others are still adamantly opposed. Haji Abdul Ghani, 56, is most upset about giving up cultivatable land, which he worries will be harder to come by. “This is all agricultural land, and will be lost forever,” he says. “If you really want to expand, look for barren land where the fertility of the soil doesn’t matter.”Sitting near their house perched precariously near the river, Karamat Jutt, 26, and his family say they’ve already lost much of their land to floods last summer that destroyed an entire settlement. They know the volatility of the river and changing climate could make things worse, but, for now, their bigger concern is losing their livelihoods to development.Warraich remains suspicious of RUDA. He says the agency labeled parts of his family’s land barren, despite it being viable for farming, and offered less than what he believes the land is worth. Even if more money was offered, Warraich says he wouldn’t sell because of the many tenant farmers and workers who rely on their land for subsistence. “Without justice there is no community,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-7-billion-green-city-imran-khan-s-pet-project-takes-grim-turn-101642654953152.html

This is the most significant advancement of an idea the country's leaders have been toying with for years.The new state capital law, which provides a legal framework for President Joko Widodo's ambitious $32 billion mega project, also stipulates how development of the capital will be funded and governed."The new capital has a central function and is a symbol of the identity of the nation, as well as a new centre of economic gravity," Planning Minister Suharso Monoarfa told parliament after the bill was passed into law.Why is Indonesia moving the capital from Jakarta?The plan was formulated as Jakarta is prone to flooding amid climate change. The sinking megacity also suffers from chronic congestion and air pollution.Monoarfa said that the relocation of the capital city to Nusantara is based on several considerations, regional advantages, and welfare and with a vision of the birth of a new economic centre of gravity in the middle of the archipelago.President Joko Widodo first announced the capital would be relocated in 2019, but the move was delayed due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.How fast is Jakarta sinking?Jakarta sits on the swampy ground near the sea - making it especially prone to flooding - and is one of the fastest-sinking cities on Earth, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). It has been dropping into the Java Sea at an alarming rate due to the over-extraction of groundwater.Jakarta is also one of the world's most overpopulated urban regions. It is home to more than 10 million people, with an estimated 30 million in the greater metropolitan area, according to the United Nations.About NusantaraThe name of the new city has been chosen by Widodo. It is a Javanese term which translates to "archipelago" in the Indonesian language. It is located within the jungle of Kalimantan on Borneo island.According to data from the National Planning and Development Agency, the total land area for the new capital city will be around 256,143 hectares (around 2,561 square kilometres) - almost all of it converted from the forest area.Indonesia owns the majority of Borneo, the world's third-largest island, with Malaysia and Brunei each holding parts of its northern region.The initial relocation will start from between 2022 and 2024.Nusantara would follow in the footsteps of new capitals in other countries, notably Brazil and Myanmar.It will strengthen supply chains and place Indonesia "in a more strategic position in world trade routes, investment flows, and technological innovation," the government said in a statement.The new capital has been dubbed by the government as a low-carbon "super hub" that will support pharmaceutical, health and technology sectors and promote sustainable growth beyond Java Island.Nusantara will be led by a chief authority whose position is equivalent to a minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-replaces-sinking-jakarta-with-new-capital-city-nusantara-details-here-101642653954758.html

Titled ‘The overlooked pandemic of antimicrobial resistance’, it highlights the growing threat of superbugs.The study has been carried out by researchers from the University of Washington and University of Oxford. They said that anti-microbial resistance (AMR) killed as many people as HIV (680,000) and malaria (627,000) combined.The researchers further said that these superbugs were a potential factor in five million global deaths in the year 2019.In comparison, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) killed 3.5 million people last year.The figure of 1.2 million fatalities is much higher than the estimates released by the World Health Organization (WHO), which said that 700,000 people died from drug-resistant infection.The study published in The Lancet further called for urgent action to stop the death toll from AMR going up further.What are superbugs?These are pathogens which are resistant to multiple antimicrobial drugs, thus making it harder to treat. Patients infected with any of these bugs often have to be treated with last line drugs, which are both expensive and toxic. And many of them succumb.A 2018 study, carried out in 10 Fortis Group hospitals in India, found that patients with multidrug resistant infections were almost thrice as likely to die as those with susceptible ones.What the study saysAccording to the research published in The Lancet, the toll taken by AMR on patients and their families is largely invisible but is reflected in prolonged bacterial infections that extend hospital stays and cause needless deaths.Moreover, AMR disproportionately affects poor individuals who have little access to second-line, more expensive antibiotics that could work when first-line drugs fail, it further said.Discovered in the 1920s, antibiotics have saved tens of millions of lives by defeating bacterial diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis and meningitis.But over the decades, bacteria have learned to fight back, building resistance to the same drugs that once reliably vanquished them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-killed-1-2-million-people-in-2019-claims-study-101642649289598.html
20-01-2022||World||Covid-19 deaths much higher than official figures, claims report||Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in late 2019, more than 55 million people have lost their lives due to the viral disease, according to official figures. But a new research published in Nature has claimed that the actual toll count could be many times higher.There has been an ongoing debate about whether countries hide their actual Covid-19 death toll to protect their image on the global platform.The report published in Nature takes into account a machine learning approach used by The Economist magazine in London. It found some issues with the collection of data and claimed the actual fatalities could be two and four times more than the official Covid-19 data.The report in Nature cited examples of how countries around the world have been reporting the victims of Covid-19. It said that in the Netherlands, the government, during the early stages of the pandemic, only counted those patients who died in the hospital after getting infected.On the other hand, Belgium included deaths caused by severe cold and as Covid-19 fatalities, without testing the patients, the report said.The report said that the death toll remained high in rich countries and low in poor countries. But an analysis of the World Mortality Dataset (WMD) of 116 countries said that poorer countries recorded fewer deaths, it further said.According to data modelling, the actual Covid-19 deaths in wealthy countries may be as high as a third of the current figures. In poor countries, meanwhile, the actual fatalities can be up to 20 times higher than the current figures.The report said that the WHO may soon release its first assessment regarding the deaths. It has taken the opinion of several experts to conclude that in order to estimate the actual Covid-19 fatalities, the deaths that happened five years before the pandemic will have to be compared with the current period.The report also stated that Covid-19 pandemic is the largest after the Spanish flu that spread during 1918-20.Going as per the WMD model, Russia saw more than 300,000 patients succumbing to Covid-19 by the end of 2021. However, excess deaths are likely to have crossed one million in that period.More than 100 countries, including China, India, and several in Africa, lack excess-death estimates in the WMD. This is due to either their governments not collecting the death figures or publishing them speedily, the Nature report said.However, these countries also account for millions of deaths due to Covid-19.India, which was severely hit during the second wave of Covid-19 last year, has reported more than 487,000 deaths since the onset of the pandemic. But, the aforementioned model adopted by the Economist estimated around five million deaths in the country.Similarly in China, which is the epicentre of Covid-19, the Economist’s model has estimated over 750,000 deaths in total which is 150 times more than the official data at 4,600.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-deaths-much-higher-than-official-figures-claims-report-101642644577295.html
20-01-2022||World||Scientists develop Covid diagnosis test using X-rays, say it's 98% accurate||A group of scientists in Scotland has found a way to detect the presence of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infection in a person using X-rays. The diagnosis test uses artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of the virus inside a person.The scientists from University of West Scotland (UWS), who developed the test, claim it is 98 per cent effective.Also Read | Why symptom link is key to OmicronThey also said that it will be faster than the PCR test, which takes to hours to return a result.“There has long been a need for a quick and reliable tool that can detect Covid-19, and this has become even more true with the upswing of the Omicron variant,” said Professor Naeem Ramzan, who led the three-person team at the UWS.How the test works?According to UWS researchers, the new technique utilises X-ray technology to compare scans to a database of around 3,000 images, belonging to patients with Covid-19, healthy individuals and those with viral pneumonia.An AI process, known as the deep convolutional neural network, then uses an algorithm to analyse visual imagery and make a diagnosis. During an extensive testing phase, the technique proved to be more than 98 per cent accurate, said UWS scientists.What is the utility of the new testing technique?Professor Ramzan said that there are many countries are unable to carry out large numbers of Covid tests because of limited diagnosis tools. Their research utilises easily accessible technology to quickly detect the virus.“It could prove to be crucial, and potentially life-saving, when diagnosing severe cases of the virus, helping determine what treatment may be required,” said the professor.He, however, acknowledged that Covid-19 symptoms are not visible in X-rays during the early stages of infection so it cannot fully replace the PCR tests.Also Read | Endemic Covid would not mean end of danger, says WHOProfessor Milan Radosavljevic, Vice-Principal of Research, Innovation and Engagement at UWS and another member of the team said they now plan to expand the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-develop-covid-diagnosis-test-using-x-rays-say-it-s-98-accurate-101642645045854.html

20-01-2022||World||Ukraine crisis: What Russia is demanding and how the West has responded?||The concentration of Russian forces along the Ukrainian border has concerned the West, in particular the United States, which has warned of "swift, severe, and united response". Western intelligence officials say that Russia has amassed 100,000 troops on the eastern side of the former Soviet republic.They fear another invasion by Russia, on the lines of Crimea in 2014. Numerous rounds of talks have been held between the West and Moscow, but the Russian troops remain in the area.Watch: Why US fears Putin could invade UkraineRussia has, however, said that the fears of the West are unfounded and it doesn’t plan to start a war. But the West is keenly watching what Russian President Vladimir Putin’s next move will be.What triggered the crisis?Ukraine shares its border with Russia and the European Union (EU) countries. It has deep cultural ties with Russia and Russian is widely spoken there.Russia has expressed its displeasure over Ukraine’s increasing move towards the European institutions and wants it shouldn’t join the Nato. The demand has been rejected by the Western alliance, which comprises of the United States, EU countries and Nato allies.The deposing of Ukraine’s pre-Russia president in 2014 sent the alarm bells ringing in Moscow, which moved in and annexed Ukraine’s southern peninsula Crimea. It also backed separatists who them captured large parts of Ukraine’s eastern region. More than 14,000 people have been killed in nearly eight years of fighting there.Is the threat of war real?The West says yes. It has held several rounds of negotiations with Russian officials, Putin has also spoken to US President Joe Biden, but the troops remain along the Ukrainian border. Officials in the US have said that Russia has offered no proof that it will not invade.After the recent talks with his US counterparts in Geneva, Russian foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov assured that there are “no plans or intentions to attack Ukraine”.But Putin’s recent statements about “appropriate retaliatory military-technical measures” against West’s “aggressive approach” has worried officials. At a press conference on Wednesday, marking his first year in office, Biden said he thinks Putin will “move in” on Ukraine although he suggested a full-scale invasion may not be in the Russian leader’s plans.Moreover, there are reports that Russia has provided passports to 500,000 people in the rebel-held areas in Ukraine. This, many political observers say, is a tactic adopted by Kremlin to protect its ‘citizens’ if its demands are not met.Then there are war games held by Russia closer to Ukraine to prepare its troops. On Tuesday, reports emerged that Russia is a sending an unspecified number of troops from the country’s far east to Belarus for major war games in February. White House press secretary Jen Psaki described the Russian forces' move into Belarus as part of as “extremely dangerous situation.”What is Russia demanding?Russia has denied an intention to attack its neighbour but demanded guarantees from the West that Nato will not expand to Ukraine or other ex-Soviet nations or place its troops and weapons there. It has also asked Western countries to not adopt “aggressive” approach and abandon military activity in Eastern Europe.What this means that Nato countries will have to pull out their combat units from Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.Washington and its Nato allies have rejected Moscow’s demands.Moscow has also accused Nato countries of flooding Ukraine with weapons and the US of stoking tensions. In his remarks to military officials last month, Putin had said that Russia has nowhere further to retreat to. “Do they think we’ll just watch idly?”The West’s responseIn his Wednesday’s address, Biden said that the US and its European allies are united on making sure Russia would face “severe economic consequences” if Putin attacks. But the US President acknowledged it would be crucial, and potentially difficult, to keep Nato united on the response to any attack on Ukraine.The UK said it is supplying Ukraine with short-range anti-tank missiles for self-defence in the wake of Russia’s belligerence. Fearing an attack from Russia, Sweden recently moved hundreds of troops over strategically important Gotland Island. Denmark too adopted a similar approach a few days ago, strengthening its presence in the region.Visiting Kyiv in a show of support, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that Russia could launch a new attack on Ukraine at "very short notice" but Washington would pursue diplomacy as long as it could.Meanwhile, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said it is upto Ukraine to decide when it is ready to join the alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-crisis-what-russia-is-demanding-and-how-the-west-has-responded-101642639499413.html
20-01-2022||World||Japan, France to hold talks amid China's growing assertiveness in Indo-Pacific||Amid China's growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region, the foreign and defense ministers of Japan and France will hold security talks virtually on Thursday.The Indo-Pacific region, where China's rise has stoked concern among many countries, is expected to top the agenda for the talks between both sides, Kyodo News reported.Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi on Tuesday said that the two countries share fundamental values and strategic interests and will promote their security collaboration during the online "two-plus-two" meeting, after the French Defense Ministry announced its schedule on Monday.Hayashi said that he and Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi will discuss a variety of topics including recent regional affairs in the first such talks since January 2019 with their respective French counterparts Jean-Yves Le Drian and Florence Parly, the Japanese news agency reported.The countries had initially planned to hold an in-person two-plus-two meeting in Japan by the end of 2021 but put it off due to the coronavirus pandemic, lately fueled by the rapid spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. They have generally taken turns hosting such talks since their first session in 2014.Japan has been boosting defense cooperation with European countries, including Britain and Germany, as China increasingly flexes its military muscle and steps up its territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific region, Kyodo News reported.It further reported that France, which has overseas territories in the region such as New Caledonia, released its Indo-Pacific strategy in 2018 to promote a stable and rules-based order.Meanwhile, French troops last year for the first time carried out joint exercises with Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force and the United States on Japanese soil aimed at defending remote islands.France is hoping to launch talks with Japan on a defense cooperation agreement to allow the easing of restrictions on the transportation of weapons and supplies for joint training and disaster relief operations, Kyodo News reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-france-to-hold-talks-amid-china-s-growing-assertiveness-in-indopacific-101642637095585.html

20-01-2022||World||North Korea hints at resuming nuclear, ICBM tests||Accusing the United States of hostility and threats, North Korea on Thursday said it will consider restarting “all temporally-suspended activities” it had paused during its diplomacy with the Trump administration, in an apparent threat to resume testing of nuclear explosives and long-range missiles.North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said leader Kim Jong Un presided over a Politburo meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party where officials set policy goals for “immediately bolstering” the North’s military capabilities to counter the Americans’ “hostile moves.” Officials gave “instructions to “reconsider in an overall scale the trust-building measures that we took on our own initiative … and to promptly examine the issue of restarting all temporally-suspended activities,” the KCNA said.The North’s Foreign Ministry had already warned of stronger and more explicit action after the Biden administration last week imposed fresh sanctions over the North’s continued missile testing activity.Kim unilaterally suspended his nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests in 2018 as he initiated diplomacy with then-President Donald Trump in an attempt to leverage his nukes for badly needed economic benefits. But negotiations have stalled since the collapse of their second meeting in 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korea’s demand for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.The North has been ramping of its weapons demonstrations in recent months, including four rounds of missile launches just this month, as Kim revives Pyongyang’s old playbook of brinkmanship to extract concessions from Washington and neighbors as he grapples with an economy decaying under pandemic-related difficulties and crippling U.S.-led sanctions over his nuclear ambitions.Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on five North Koreans over their roles in obtaining equipment and technology for the North’s missile programs, in its response to North Korea’s earlier tests this month.The State Department ordered sanctions against another North Korean, a Russian man and a Russian company for their broader support of North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction activities. The Biden administration also said it would pursue additional U.N. sanctions over the North’s continued tests.The announcement of the sanctions just came hours after North Korean state media said Kim oversaw a successful test of a hypersonic missile last Tuesday, the country’s second test of the purported system in a week, and claimed that the weapon would greatly increase the country’s “war deterrent.”The North tested fired short-range ballistic missiles on Friday and Monday in an apparent reprisal against the U.S. sanctions, which came after its Foreign Ministry warned of “stronger and certain reaction” if Washington maintains its confrontational stance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-hints-at-resuming-nuclear-icbm-tests-101642635579411.html
20-01-2022||World||Biden expects Russia to ‘move in’ on Ukraine, warns Putin again||President Joe Biden said he thinks Vladimir Putin will “move in” on Ukraine after amassing more than 100,000 troops on the nation’s border, although he suggested a full-scale invasion may not be in the Russian leader’s plans. “I’m not so sure he has, is certain, about what he’s going to do,” Biden said at a news conference Wednesday marking his first year in office. “My guess is he will move in, he has to do something.”Pressed on whether that means he has determined Putin is definitely going to attack, Biden said “that decision is completely, totally, solely Putin’s decision,” later adding “I don’t know whether he’s decided if he wants to do that or not.” Biden said the US and its European allies are united on making sure Russia would face “severe economic consequences” if Putin attacks, though he signaled that something less than a full-blown invasion might prompt disagreements.“I think what you’re going to see is that Russia will be held accountable if it invades,” Biden said. “And it depends on what it does. It’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not do.”If Putin chooses to continue or ramp up cyber attacks on Ukraine, Biden said, “we can respond the same way, with cyber.” While top US officials have stepped up their warnings about Putin’s possible intentions -- and Russian officials continue to say they don’t plan to invade -- the remarks by Biden were the starkest yet about the crisis on the border. He said a major attack would prompt a devastating economic response. “If they actually do what they’re capable of doing it is going to be a disaster for Russia,” Pressed on whether sanctions are an effective tool against Putin, Biden said “he’s never seen sanctions like the ones I’ve promised will be imposed if he moves.”NATO’s ‘Differences’But Biden acknowledged it would be crucial, and potentially difficult, to keep NATO united on the response to any attack on Ukraine. “That’s what I’m spending a lot of time doing,” Biden said. “And there are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do, depending on what happens, the degree to which they’re able to go.”Those remarks come amid signs that European nations aren’t on the same page when it comes to the package of sanctions that would hit Moscow following an attack. Some European governments have expressed anxiety that hitting Russia hard could damage their own economies, or perhaps spur Putin to cut off essential gas supplies to them. And because the bulk of any European Union-wide response would have to be agreed to by all 27 member states, several governments are keen to avoid a group-wide debate for now, fearing it would advertise potential differences.In Kyiv on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said diplomacy is still the best path out of the current crisis. Previewing his planned meeting Friday in Geneva with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Blinken said, “We need to see where we are and see if there remain opportunities to pursue the diplomacy and pursue the dialog.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-expects-russia-to-move-in-on-ukraine-warns-putin-again-101642631642694.html
20-01-2022||World||Biden hails 'enormous progress' in first year despite pandemic||A defiant President Joe Biden acknowledged missteps over the still-raging pandemic Wednesday but hailed a year of "enormous progress" on the US economy as he took stock of his first year in office.In a rare news conference marking his first 12 months, Biden touted a period of unprecedented job creation, infrastructure improvements and a growing economy that he said would help counter inflation and supply chain woes plaguing his presidency."It's been a year of challenges," Biden told reporters in the ornate East Room of the White House, saying he "didn't anticipate" the level of obstruction he has encountered from Republicans in Congress."But it has also been a year of enormous progress," the US leader said."We went from two million people being vaccinated at the moment I was sworn in to 210 million Americans being fully vaccinated today. We created six million new jobs -- more jobs in one year than any time before."It was Biden's first news conference of the year -- and the first formal such event at all since November.Biden was set to face questions on everything from the confrontation with Russia over Ukraine and North Korea's missile tests to US inflation, Covid-19 and what he calls a threat to democracy from his predecessor Donald Trump.The press conference was at the core of an intense new effort by the White House to spin the calamitous last few weeks into a new narrative focusing on what officials say are Biden's many, if overlooked, gains during his first year in the Oval Office.It came as a new Gallup poll showed Biden with just 40 percent approval, down from 57 percent when he started. Since World War II, only Trump's first year averages were lower, Gallup said.Biden's press secretary, Jen Psaki said he has made "a lot of progress" in "incredibly difficult circumstances, fighting a pandemic, a massive economic downturn."The White House points out that in the last year, unemployment fell to 3.9 percent from 6.4 percent at the height of pandemic fallout on the economy and that mass vaccination has been a success, with 74 percent of adults now fully vaccinated.However, Biden has faced a string of recent setbacks, including the highest inflation in decades and the Supreme Court striking down the administration's vaccine mandate for large businesses.The inability of Democrats to use their razor-thin majority in Congress to pass another top Biden priority -- voting law reforms that he says are needed to protect US democracy -- was highlighted Wednesday as the Senate moved to almost certain defeat for two bills.Republican comeback? Biden's press conference came on the eve of the anniversary of his January 20th inauguration, which took place in the extraordinary circumstances of a pandemic and the aftermath of a violent assault by Trump supporters on Congress to try and overturn Biden's victory.Now, with a State of the Union speech to Congress set for March 1, Biden faces the rapidly approaching likelihood of a Republican comeback in midterm congressional elections this November.Republicans are forecast to crush his party and take control of the legislature. That risks bringing two years of complete obstruction from Congress, likely including threats of impeachment and a slew of aggressive committee probes.Trump, who continues to perpetuate the lie that he beat Biden in 2020 and seeks to undermine Americans' faith in their election system, is eyeing a possible attempt at another run at the White House in 2024.Biden's team hopes that good news will gradually outweigh the pandemic-related gloom, with the economy continuing to rebound, the Omicron coronavirus variant tailing off, and Americans taking notice of achievements, like massive spending on infrastructure.As White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain told Politico: "President Biden was elected to a four-year term, not a one-year term."While Biden does frequently interact with journalists in short, often-hurried question-and-answer sessions at the White House, his lack of full press conferences has raised eyebrows. Wednesday's event was only the second held at the White House since he took office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-hails-enormous-progress-in-first-year-despite-pandemic-101642627870073.html

That figure is less than the 538 reported last Wednesday, although the number could climb throughout the day.Airlines that had cut flights for Wednesday included Emirates, Air India, ANA and Japan Airlines.Also read | Explained: Why major airlines suffered disruptions due to US 5G 'nightmare'Both ANA and Japan Airlines said they were restoring service on Thursday after assurances from regulators at the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)."As the launch of the 5G service in the US has now been partially postponed, operation of ANA flights from Jan. 20 will follow the normal schedule based on FAA notification that there is no safety issue with the operation of Boeing 777 aircraft to the US airports that we serve," said a statement from ANA President Yuji Hirako.Telecom giants spent tens of billions of dollars to obtain 5G licenses last year but aviation industry groups have raised concerns about possible interference with airplanes' radio altimeters -- which can operate at the same frequencies -- particularly in bad weather.On Tuesday, both AT&T and Verizon agreed to scale back the launch of 5G near airports following an outcry from US airlines, who warned of mass disruptions.AT&T said Wednesday its high-speed service was available in "limited parts" of eight major metropolitan areas across the United States, while Verizon said it now provides 5G coverage to 90 million Americans.Hans Vestberg told CNBC that he was confident the issues with the airline industry would be "cleared out" following collaboration with "all involved parties, including the White House."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5g-launches-in-us-without-huge-impact-on-flights-101642622900769.html
20-01-2022||World||US senior diplomats in Sudan to try resolve post-coup crisis||Two senior US diplomats were in Sudan Wednesday to try to find a way out of the crisis roiling the African country since an October military coup. An Israeli delegation meanwhile met with Sudan’s ruling generals to consolidate newly established ties between their countries.The October 25 military takeover has upended Sudan’s transition to democratic rule after three decades of repression and international isolation under autocratic President Omar al-Bashir, ousted during a popular uprising in April 2019.US Assistant Secretary of State Molly Phee and the newly appointed US special envoy for the Horn of Africa, David Satterfield, first met with pro-democracy activists from the Sudanese Professionals Association, according to the US Embassy in Khartoum.The activists led the uprising against al-Bashir and are now a pillar of anti-coup protests that have demanded a fully civilian government to lead the transition. The diplomats also met with another group, the Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change, on “their positive engagement” with UN efforts to end the deadlock, the embassy said. They were expected to meet with the ruling generals later Wednesday.US State Department spokesman Ned Price said earlier this week that Phee and Satterfield would reiterate Washington's call for Sudanese security forces to “end violence and respect freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.”Before arriving in Khartoum, the two attended a meeting of the Friends of Sudan group in Saudi Arabia to rally support for UN efforts to end Sudan’s deadlock. The group includes the United States, Britain and other international governments and world financial institutions.Sudan’s turmoil has been worsened following the resignation of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok earlier this month. Hamdok, who was ousted in the October coup only to be reinstated a month later under heavy international pressure, stepped down on Jan. 2 after his efforts to reach a compromise failed.The Sudan Doctors Committee, also part of the pro-democracy alliance, said one protester was shot and killed Wednesday as security forces removed makeshift barricades in Khartoum’s twin city of Omdurman.The barricades were part of a two-day civil disobedience campaign the pro-democracy movement had called for following a deadly crackdown on Monday when security forces opened fire on anti-coup protests in Khartoum, killing at least seven people. Wednesday’s fatality brings the death toll among the protesters since the coup to 72.Also Wednesday, an Israeli delegation met with top Sudanese military officials in Khartoum, according to a Sudanese military official and Israeli reports.The Sudanese official said the delegation, including officials from the Mossad spy agency, met with Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the coup leader and head of the ruling Sovereign Council, and other military officials.

20-01-2022||World||UK lifts Covid-19 restrictions, says Omicron wave 'has peaked'||Face masks will no longer be mandatory in public places and Covid-19 passports will be dropped for large events as infections level off in most parts of the country, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday.Johnson told lawmakers that the restrictions were being eased because government scientists think it is likely that the surge of infections prompted by the highly contagious omicron variant “has now peaked nationally.”While hospitals in northern England still are getting pressed by high caseloads and infections were still rising in schools, Johnson said hospital admissions and patients in intensive care units elsewhere in England were stabilizing or falling.The government is no longer advising people to work from home, and compulsory face masks will be scrapped in secondary school classrooms starting Thursday.Mandatory Covid-19 passes will not be needed to gain entry to large-scale events beginning January 27. Face masks will no longer be legally required anywhere in England as of that day.“We will trust the judgment of the British people and no longer criminalize anyone who chooses not to wear one,” Johnson said.The restrictions were introduced in December to slow the rapid spread of the omicron variant and buy time for the population to get their booster vaccine shot.Johnson said Wednesday that more than 90% of those over age 60 in the UK have had booster shots.Official figures showed that Covid-19 infections have dropped in most parts of the UK for the first time since early December. The government reported 108,069 new cases on Wednesday, about half the daily number recorded over the holidays.The requirement for those infected to self-isolate for five full days remains, but Johnson said that measure will also end in the coming weeks. He said while the self-isolation rule expires on March 24, he will seek to scrap it earlier if the virus data continues to improve.Johnson and Health Secretary Sajid Javid both suggested that the government is planning for a post-pandemic period when it can treat Covid-19 more like the flu.“There will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether, just as we don’t place legal obligations on people to isolate if they have flu," Johnson said.Nonetheless, Johnson urged people to remain cautious in the last weeks of winter and stressed that the pandemic was “not over.”The news was welcomed by businesses, especially those relying on workers re-populating city centers, as well as hospitality and tourism. But some said officials need to give more details about their plans to cope with the coronavirus in the longer term. Johnson’s spokesman said the government would publish such a plan “shortly.”“There’s a vital need now for greater consistency in how we live with the virus in the longer term. Swinging back and forth between restrictions and normality has been damaging," said Matthew Fell, chief policy director of the Confederation of British Industry.Scotland and Wales, which set their own public health rules, have also announced similar easing of restrictions.Britain has the second-worst pandemic death toll in Europe after Russia, with over 153,000 confirmed virus-related deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-lifts-covid-19-restrictions-says-omicron-wave-has-peaked-101642617953058.html
20-01-2022||World||China warns US missile destroyer in South China Sea||China on Thursday said its armed forces deployed warships and aircraft to monitor and warn away a US guided missile destroyer from waters near the Paracel (Xisha) islands in the South China Sea, the latest tense incident between the two countries in the disputed maritime region.The US warship USS Benfold “illegally” sailed into Chinese territorial waters without permission, violating the country’s sovereignty, and that Chinese naval and air forces tracked the ship before warning it away, the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Southern Theatre Command said.“The actions of the US side have seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security, which is another iron proof that it is pursuing navigational hegemony and militarising the South China Sea,” the theatre command said.“We solemnly demand that the US side immediately stop such provocative actions, otherwise it will bear the serious consequences of unforeseen events,” it added.The US navy denied that the warship was “warned” away.“The People’s Republic of China’s statement about this mission is false. USS Benfold conducted this FONOP (freedom of navigation operation) in accordance with international law and then continued on to conduct normal operations in international waters,” the 7th Fleet spokesperson Mark Langford said in an emailed statement on Thursday.In an earlier statement, Langford said that USS Benfold “…asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the vicinity of the Paracel Island, consistent with international law”.“At the conclusion of the operation, USS Benfold exited the excessive claim and continued operations in the South China Sea,” Langford added.The US, the statement added, carries out what it calls freedom of navigation missions in the South China Sea to challenge Chinese territorial claims.China claims nearly the entire South China Sea but that claim is disputed by several maritime neighbours including Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia besides Vietnam and Taiwan (which China says is a breakaway region).Specifically, China, Taiwan and Vietnam claim sovereignty over the Paracel islands, known as Xisha islands in China.“By engaging in innocent passage without giving prior notification to or asking permission from any of the claimants, the US challenged the unlawful restrictions imposed by the PRC, Taiwan, and Vietnam,” Langford said.China has built and established military outposts on artificial islands in the South China Sea, a vital shipping lane for international maritime trade besides containing gas fields and rich fishing grounds.The South China Sea has become one of many flashpoints in the relationship between China and the US besides Taiwan, trade and alleged rights abuses in Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-us-missile-destroyer-in-south-china-sea-101642675830078.html

The Union health ministry of Thursday said Omicron is driving the surge, but the effect has not been severe only because of the vaccine coverage. The Centre on January 10 notified that only symptomatic people should get tested. This created a notion that testing has gone down following the notification. The health ministry on Thursday said there has been no decline in the number of testing. Between Wednesday and Thursday, 19 lakh tests were conducted, the ministry said. Few districts which have seen a dip in the tests have been asked to ramp it up.Fatality in 3rd wave significantly lower than Covid 2nd wave: Health ministryHere are the 5 things Centre said on Covid third wave:1. Comparing the Covid figures between April 1 and April 30, 2021, with that of January 1 and January 20, 2022, the health ministry claimed that in the Omicron-driven surge, the number of fatalities has remained significantly low.2. During the second wave, when India was reporting 3.86 lakh Covid cases daily, the daily toll was over 3,059. On January 20, this year, India again breached the 3 lakh mark, but the toll was 380.3. Giving the specific example of Delhi, the ministry said during the 2nd wave, caused by Delta, bed occupancy in the Capital remained significantly high between April 1 and May 20, 2021. In the third wave, in contrast, Delhi's daily cases peaked up in the first two weeks of January but bed occupancy remained low.4. The current surge in India is not witnessing severe illness and death following high vaccination, the Centre said.5.

20-01-2022||India||Stop auction of farmers’ land for non-payment of loans, orders Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday directed officials to stop the auction of agricultural land of farmers who could not repay their loans taken from commercial banks in the state even as the opposition demanded a complete farm loan waiver. The banks are auctioning land under the Rajasthan Agricultural Credit Operation (Removal of Difficulties) Act, 1974 (RODA Act). The auctioning of agricultural land of farmers who failed to repay loans has led to protests in Rajasthan. A delegation led by BJP MP Dr Kirodi Lal Meena, along with farmers today tried approaching the chief minister’s residence demanding cancellation of the land auctioning process. However, the police took Meena into custody and dispersed the protestors. As the issue turned political, Gehlot issued instructions to stop the auction of agricultural land of farmers who failed to repay the loans taken from commercial banks in the state. In a statement, Gehlot said, “Due to non-payment of loans of farmers taken from commercial banks that are controlled by the Reserve Bank in the state, land attachment and auction action is being taken under the RODA (Removal of Difficulties) Act. State government officials have been instructed to stop this.” The chief minister has also said that the state government has waived off the loans of cooperative banks and urged the Centre to waive the loans of farmers by doing one-time settlements from commercial banks. The state government is ready to bear its share in this also. He said, “Our government had passed a bill in the assembly to ban land auction of farmers having agricultural land up to five acres, but due to lack of permission of the governor, it has not become a law yet. I am sad that due to non-compliance of this law, the said situation has come.” He expressed hope that this bill will be approved soon so that further auction will not happen. Many cases of issuing notices to auction the land of farmers who are unable to repay the loans have come to the fore recently, leading to discussions on social media. The main opposition party, the BJP has targeted the Congress government of the state over the issue. Alleging that the state government failed to fulfill its promise of complete loan waiver, Meena said Congress in its 2018 election manifesto promised complete loan waiver but they have instead insulted farmers in the name of auction. Meena said Congress promised a complete loan waiver in10 days but despite that, the land is auctioned and attached. He alleged that the notices have been pasted to attach the lands of 800 to 1000 farmers in Dausa, 600 to 700 in Sawai Madhopur, around 800 in Karauli, about 3000 in Alwar district, and hundreds of others in Dholpur-Bharatpur. According to a rough estimate, ₹10,000 crores of cooperative banks loan on 15 lakh farmers are pending. In the memorandum to the chief minister, Meena mentioned a case from Dausa where the land of a deceased farmer Kajod Meena was auctioned on Wednesday. The farmer took a loan of ₹3.87 lakh in 2017 to dig a tube well, which with interest has reached around ₹7 lakh. Under pressure to repay loans and repeated requests from bank officials and employees, the farmer, a resident of Ramgarh Pachwara, committed suicide on October 26, 2021. Despite this, on January 18, bank employees and revenue officials tried auctioning his 15 bighas of land, which has a district level committee rate of around ₹75 lakh and market value of Rs1 crore. The auction was later cancelled. He demanded cancellation of the auction of farmers’ lands across the state; action against the bank and revenue officials who forced farmer Kajod Meena to commit suicide; to waive his entire loan and provide a financial assistance package of ₹25 lakh. Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait said, “The auction of entire land could not be done for a small loan. It was an illegal auction. Land mafia has their eyes on prime land. An investigation should be done against the bank officials.” BJP state president Satish Poonia tweeted, “Due to the promise of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in 2018, the lands of farmers of Rajasthan are being auctioned, farmers are being forced to commit suicide. CM Gehlot is busy writing letters. If a little bit honesty is left, then waive off the entire loan of the farmers.”

20-01-2022||India||At Mauritius event, PM Modi spotlights India’s development partnership approach||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Mauritius counterpart Pravind Jugnauth on Thursday inaugurated a $45-million social housing project with 956 units and launched work on a solar power plant and a civil service college to be built with Indian aid of more than $500 million. At a virtual event joined by the prime ministers, the two countries also concluded agreements for India to provide about $200 million as assistance for a metro rail and other infrastructure projects in Mauritius and for small but high-impact development projects in fields such as education, healthcare and disaster risk reduction. Referring to the long-standing ties between the two sides based on history, ancestry, culture, and the waters of the Indian Ocean, Modi said in his opening remarks that the development partnership has become a key pillar in the close ties. “Mauritius is a prime example of India’s approach to development partnership which is based on the needs and priorities of our partners and respects their sovereignty,” he said, in an apparent reference to China’s Belt and Road Initiative that has been criticised for creating a “debt trap” in several Indian Ocean states. Modi added: “Mauritius is also integral to our approach to the Indian Ocean. It was in Mauritius, during my 2015 visit, that I had outlined India’s maritime cooperation vision of SAGAR – Security and Growth for All in the Region.” Thank you, says Mauritius PMJugnauth interspersed his address with remarks in Hindi to convey his government’s gratitude for the wide-ranging cooperation and technical and financial assistance provided by India over the years. “We never cease to acknowledge that without the financial assistance of the government of India, this [metro] project would not have been implemented so fast,” he said.He said one of the major stations on the metro rail system will be named after Mahatma Gandhi to express the gratitude of Mauritius. Noting that the loans and grants reflect India’s commitment to the progress of Mauritius, Jugnauth invited Modi to visit the country in November or December for the inauguration of the full metro service. India-assisted projects in MauritiusThe 956 social housing units located at two sites were built with an Indian grant of $20 million and a line of credit of $25 million. This was one of five large infrastructure projects that were part of an Indian $ 353-million special economic package unveiled in 2016. The units were built by an Indian firm to bolster the Mauritius government’s affordable housing scheme. The two leaders virtually laid the foundation stone of the civil service college to be built with a grant of $4.74 million. The college, to be completed in 18 months, will build capacity in public sector management and governance. The 8-MW solar farm at Tamarind Falls, to be built with a line of credit of $500 million from India’s Exim Bank, is expected to be completed in 11 months. The facility will be the largest solar farm in Mauritius and will generate 14GWh a year. The plant will help Mauritius achieve its target of having 60% of renewables in its energy mix by 2030, and reduce the use of coal and oil imports. The two agreements concluded on Thursday included a line of credit for $190 million from India’s Exim Bank for the metro rail and other infrastructure projects, and a memorandum of understanding on small but high impact development projects worth $10 million in fields such as education, healthcare, community development, women’s empowerment, disaster risk reduction and energy. The first phase of the metro rail was inaugurated in 2019 and it has carried more than 5.6 million passengers since commercial operations began in January 2020. The second and third phases of the flagship project will be completed by the end of 2022 and work is already underway on the fourth phase. Modi also pointed to ongoing maritime security and defence cooperation between the two sides, saying this has translated the vision of SAGAR into action. “Despite the constraints of Covid, we were able to hand over a Dornier aircraft on lease and complete the short refit of the Mauritian Coast Guard ship Barracuda,” he said. The Dornier aircraft was leased in September 2021 and the free refit of the Coast Guard vessel was completed in October 2021. “In the coming days, we will begin work on several important projects such as the renal transplant unit, the Forensic Science Laboratory, the National Library and Archives, the Mauritius Police Academy, and many others. I would like to reiterate today that India will always continue to stand by Mauritius in its development journey,” Modi said.

Utpal, whose father represented the capital of Goa as a BJP MP continuously since 1994 until 2014 when the quit to take charge as union defence minister and then again from 2017 until his passing in 2019, is said to have rejected the offer of the party’s central leadership to contest from the Bicholim seat, 25 kms away from the capital. In choosing Babush Monserrate over Parrikar, the party leadership has chosen to reward the Monserrates with whose help ten Congress MLAs joined the BJP back in 2019. Atanasio “Babush” Monserrate is facing several cases against him including that of rape, rioting, etc. The ruling BJP defended the decision saying that the ticket was given to the “sitting MLA”. “A sitting MLA has been given a ticket in Panaji. Parrikar’s family is our family. They are close to us. I had given Utpal Parrikar two options, from where he could contest. He had refused one option. We are still discussing the second option with him. We all feel he should accept it. BJP has respected the Parrikar family,” Devendra Fadnavis who is the BJP in-charge of Goa, said. Utpal was offered the BJP’s ticket for the Bicholim seat where the party is struggling to find a candidate after assembly speaker Rajesh Patnekar, who represents the seat, withdrew from the race citing his weak health. Utpal who is contemplating contesting as an independent indicated that he won’t sit idle if the BJP gives the ticket to a person “who has criminal antecedents.” “The kind of politics that is happening in Goa, I cannot tolerate it. It is not acceptable to me. Are they suggesting that only winnability is the criteria (and that) integrity doesn’t matter? Character doesn’t matter? and you are going to give the ticket to a person who has criminal antecedents and we have to sit home quietly?” Utpal said a week ago, while responding to comments by Fadnavis, who said: “Just because you are Manohar Parrikar’s or anybody’s son doesn’t mean you will get a BJP ticket.” Meanwhile, Aam Aadmu Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal publicly offered an AAP ticket to Utpal. “Goans feel v(ery) sad that BJP has adopted [a] use and throw policy even with [the] Parrikar family. I have always respected Manohar Parrikar ji. Utpal ji is welcome to join and fight elections on AAP ticket,” Kejriwal tweeted on Thursday. Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant however shot back calling Kejriwal an opportunist and recalled Kejriwal’s past tirade against Parrikar accusing him of failing to tackle corruption in Goa despite promising to do so. “Hypocrisy! Person whose entire party & politics is based on shallow opportunism should brush up his memory & remind himself of his own filthy comments used against one of the greatest leaders Shri Manohar “Bhai” Parrikar,” Sawant tweeted in response. Earlier Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said that opposition parties in Goa should rally behind Utpal Parrikar should he decide to contest as an independent. Meanwhile in Mandrem, former Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar is also weighing his options after he was denied a ticket in favour of Dayanand Sopte who joined the party from the Congress. The BJP in its list of 34 candidates announced so far has left out PWD Minister Deepak Pauskar (who defected from MGP), Isidoro Fernandes and Filipe Neri Rodrigues (who joined from the Congress) while Alina Saldanha, Carlos Almeida, Wilfred de Sa and Pravin Zantye quit the party in anticipation of denial of tickets to them..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-polls-utpal-parrikar-weighing-options-as-storm-brews-over-bjp-s-ticket-denial-101642688671046.html
20-01-2022||India||‘More draconian’: Mamata Banerjee fires another letter to PM Modi over IAS rule change||KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday sent her second letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in seven days, opposing proposed changes in service rules for Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers, which she said, will empower the Centre to transfer IAS officers serving in the cadre to the central government without the concurrence of the officer concerned and the state government.“This is going to destroy our federal fabric and basic structure of our Constitution too. It is our Constitution which gives the states their powers and functions and it is our Constitution which provides the framework and structure of the all-India services as they exist. The swift unitary turn that the Central government has now proposed will strike at the root of the frame which has existed and worked well since the inception of our democracy,” Banerjee said in her two-page letter to PM Modi.Mamata Banerjee’s loud protests to the proposed change in the IAS cadre rules come after the Centre in May last year ordered Alapan Bandopadhyay, then serving as chief secretary, to join the union government on central deputation. Banerjee refused to let him go, and Bandopadhyay eventually opted to retire on May 31 rather than take an extension he was given. Bandopadhyay was reappointed as chief adviser to the chief minister and faces disciplinary action for not attending a meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Bengal visit on May 28.Under existing rules, officers of the three All India Service (AIS) - the IAS, Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service officers - are attached to a state (or a group of smaller states) as a cadre where they serve unless they opt to serve in the union government. If they do exercise this option, the state concerned has to concur to their request before they can be considered for a posting by the Centre.The central government has been facing a shortage of relatively young officers who often prefer to work in the field and state secretariat rather than come to Delhi in the early part of their careers. To be sure, there are also instances where requests from officers to serve in the union government are vetoed or kept on hold.Banerjee wrote her first letter of objection to Modi on January 13 after the department of personnel and training sought the opinion of all states on the proposed amendments to the IAS (Cadre) Rules. The Congress and Left parties have also opposed the proposals.Banerjee’s second letter on Thursday referred to some more changes proposed by the Centre. She asked the Centre not to push the states into a movement on this issue and said that once enforced, the new rules may be misused by the party in power at the Centre. “….I have to write again, further reiterating my points, because the central government has meanwhile further accentuated its stand, proposing yet another revised draft, taking the matter to further non-federal extremes. I find the revised amendment proposal more draconian than the former and indeed its very grain is against the foundations of our federal polity and the basic structure of India’s Constitutional scheme,” Banerjee wrote on Thursday.“The moot point of the further revised draft proposal is that an officer, whom the Central government may choose to take out of a state to any part of the country without taking his/her consent and without the agreement of the state government under whom he/she is serving may stand released from his/her current assignment forthwith,” the letter said.“The power proposed to be usurped by the central government by resorting to over-centralisation of powers is going to destroy the morale and freedom of the All India Service officers quite apart from such usurpation being unconstitutional on the face of it. It is going to completely render them and all the state governments at the mercy of the central government since the All India Services serve as the backbone of a state’s administrative machinery. It will hang on the head of each officer of the All India Services like a Damocles sword,” Banerjee said.“It will create fear psychosis which is bound to impact their performance, effectiveness and accountability to the state government. This will destroy the fundamental principle of the services which postulates that an officer serving in connection with the affairs of the state is accountable to the state government alone,” Banerjee wrote. “I request you not to take such a measure which will irreparably damage the spirit of mutual accommodation between the Centre and the states which has existed in respect of utilization of services of the All India Services. I request you not to denude the states of their powers over its officers which will have far-reaching consequences for our country. Let us not forget that the proposed amendments are very prone to be misused by the party in power at the Centre. We at the helm of governance of the country should not be misled by immediate gains which may sound tempting but have the potential of causing damage for all times to come,” the Bengal chief minister said.Stating that the proposed amendments will cause severe damage to the “steel frame” of the nation on its 75th year of Independence, Banerjee requested Modi not to “push us to the point of greater movements on this issue to protect the soul of this great democracy that India is and has been.”Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, a known critic of Banerjee, backed her up on this issue.“This is not a new move by the Centre. It has been trying to control bureaucrats for a long time. We have seen how Bengal’s former chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay was harassed,” said Chowdhury. Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) countered Banerjee, accusing her of stopping IAS officers from opting for central deputation and hurting their careers.“Many bureaucrats posted in Bengal want to opt for central deputation but the state government has blocked their career growth. These officers are suffering. It is the state that is damaging the principles of our federal system. We support the Centre’s move to help the bureaucracy,” said Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-draconian-mamata-banerjee-fires-another-letter-to-pm-modi-over-ias-rule-change-101642688371664.html
20-01-2022||India||Covid 3rd wave reaches South: Kerala reports 46,387 cases; Karnataka over 47,000||The third wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic which is believed to have crossed its peak in Delhi and Mumbai has hit hard Karnataka and Kerala as both the southern states reported a record surge in the last 24 hours. India on Thursday reported over 3 lakh cases, the highest in the ongoing third wave of the pandemic. The impact of the Omicron-driven third wave was felt first in Delhi and Mumbai, but now the wave has shifted the south with Kerala reporting 46,387 fresh cases on Thursday which is the highest-ever single-day spike.Given the fact that Kerala was one of the worst-affected states in the pandemic, the tally of the last 24 hours is significant. During the second wave, Kerala reported 43,529 Covid cases in a day, the highest before Thursday. The rate of hospitalisation remains low. For the two coming Sundays, there will be complete lockdown in Kerala, the government has announced. Kerala health minister Veena George said on Wednesday that the state has already started witnessing the third wave of the pandemic. The minister said both Delta and Omicron are contributing to the surge in the state. If the range of spread was 2.68 per cent during the second wave, it was 3.12 per cent these days and the next three weeks would be crucial for the state, the minister said.Karnataka too witnessed a massive spike on Thursday recording 47,754 fresh cases. Out of these cases, 30,540 are from Bengaluru, the state bulletin said.The third wave of the pandemic has been different from the first and the second waves in India. Experts said previous waves moved from west to east, but this wave moved from metro cities to other districts.  The peaks of the wave have been projected to come around different dates between the 2nd and the 4th week of January. Last week, Kerala health ministry warned that the peak of the third wave will come in another week as the Omicron spread started a little late in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-3rd-wave-reaches-south-kerala-reports-46-387-cases-karnataka-over-47000-101642686708038.html
20-01-2022||India||India successfully tests new BrahMos version with higher indigenous content||NEW DELHI: India on Thursday successfully tested a variant of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile with higher indigenous content and improved performance from the Integrated Test Range at Chandipur off the Odisha coast, the defence ministry said. “The flight test is a major milestone for BrahMos programme. The highly manoeuvrable missile cruised at supersonic speed for its maximum range and all mission objectives were met,” a statement from the ministry said. The launch was conducted by BrahMos Aerospace and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). The BrahMos missile, an Indo-Russian joint venture, has a range of 290 km and is the fastest cruise missile in the world with a top speed of Mach 2.8 (nearly three times the speed of sound). “The missile (tested on Thursday) was equipped with advanced indigenous technologies and followed a modified optimal trajectory for enhanced efficiency and improved performance. The missile with the modified control system has been fine tuned to achieve an enhanced capability,” the statement added. Defence minister Rajnath Singh complimented the BrahMos, DRDO teams and industry for the successful flight test. BrahMos was in the news last week after the Philippines confirmed it will acquire three batteries of the missile in a deal worth almost $375 million, a development expected to boost India’s efforts to become a major exporter of defence hardware. BrahMos variants can be launched from land, air, sea and under water. In 2020, the country upgraded its capabilities to keep a watch on the strategically-important Indian Ocean Region and deliver an offensive option swiftly, if necessary, with the air force basing its front-line Sukhoi-30 fighters in southern India for the first time. The Su-30 fighter jets, based at Thanjavur air force station in Tamil Nadu, are equipped with the air-launched version of the BrahMos missile. India has already developed an extended range BrahMos missile that can hit targets at a range of more than 400 km by tweaking the configuration of the existing weapon. Increasing the missile’s range became possible after India’s induction into the Missile Technology Control Regime in June 2016. India is also laying the groundwork to develop a high-range BrahMos supersonic cruise missile, capable of striking targets more than 800 km away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-successfully-tests-new-brahmos-version-with-higher-indigenous-content-101642684530719.html
20-01-2022||India||Bangalore Talkies: Covid takeaways and New Year resolutions||The new year has turned. Omicron still looms. But Bangaloreans are looking back-- and forward. We are asking ourselves and others about resolutions and Covid takeaways. What changed in our lives? What remained constant?Silk List, an online mailing list, founded in Bengaluru had a discussion on this topic. As did many alumni reunions that I attended in person and virtually. I compiled the answers into categories and directives. Which one resonates with you?Faith and hope restored: Whether it is being awestruck by the frontline workers who showed up day after exhausted day, or the numerous small acts of kindness that we witnessed from our neighbours, all of us felt a twinge of hope in our humanity. People gave to pet causes (migrant workers), charities (vaccine camps), and volunteered in our own way.Personal care: This seems particularly universal. Freed of our commutes, lots of us developed self-care routines. We walked or ran every morning, restarted our yoga, pranayama and meditation practices, learned to cook at home, and got healthier in the process.Family time: Since we were stuck at home, we planned dinner times with family. We had conversations about sexual orientation and silliness, politics and memes with our siblings, friends, nieces and kids. We learned new ways of being.Cloud kitchens: Lots of restaurants became cloud kitchens. Lots of home cooks became caterers. Kappa Chakka Kandari, Go Native, Klaa Kitchen, all sent out comfort food to patrons all over Bengaluru.Creative collaborations: Artists, dancers and musicians pivoted to the virtual world. They came up with collaborations and ways to reach their audiences. Shaale.com (the word means school in Kannada) set up master classes with musicians, mridangists and veena players. Now, music rasikas could learn kunarkol (chanting the beats of a drum) or the kanjira from the comfort of home. Many did.Hobbies: We dived into things that we had been putting off. Bengaluru has a thriving group that chants the Gita, plays bridge, does ikebana, goes bird-watching every week, and does virtual music/antakshari.Tackling big and deep projects that were put off: With time on hand, people faced their inertia and decided to tackle the big, deep and difficult projects that they had put off forever. Some set a goal of reading a physical book for an hour a day. Others took up embroidery and knitting. Others made time to visit old relatives who they cordially disliked out of compassion. Still others wrote the business plan, launched a start-up, quit a job, joined an NGO, trekked in Kashmir, or learned Kannada.Enjoy small things: We don’t take life, living or breathing for granted any more. Thanks to enforced constraints, we took pleasure in small things: locally brewed Geist beer, Bengaluru Avarebele mix from Postcard, warm croissants from Zed the Baker coupled with Begum Victoria’s brie cheese, Araku or Kalmane coffee at home. We created terrace gardens and enjoyed a hot bowl of homemade bisi-bele-bhaath with a nice dollop of Nei Native A2 ghee on top.Splurge: We took the acronyms YOLO (You Only Live Once) and Life is too short to eat/drink/enjoy bad stuff to heart. So we ordered rare orchids and tulips from the Flower Box or Ohana Fine Flowers. Since we couldn’t travel, we bought expensive Burgundy wines alongside local brands such as Grovers, KRSMA, Early Dark, and SDU. We finally bought that Sailor fountain pen from William Penn, and that Ganjam ruby earring. We splurged on things we cared about.Home improvement: Lots of us painted our homes, bought that new teak wood chair from Vyom Studio or that cool antique trunk from Saanchi. We reupholstered our sofas with silk from Atmosphere and accessorised with playful toys from the Varnam Craft Collective.Saved money: Of course we saved money. Where could we go? Well, some of us went to Karnataka’s many wildlife sanctuaries, ranging from Dandeli to BR Hills to Kabini to Nagarhole. But other than that, we couldn’t go to restaurants, pubs or restaurants so we learned, some for the first time, to plan and invest our money.Hotels and marriages took on new avatars: Hotels offered staycations, private dining options and learned to pivot to become local rather than global. Marriages went small and virtual.So what was my Covid takeaway? Mine was learning to follow my bliss, which was being out in nature, ideally in a forest or at least in the woodlands, accompanied by expert naturalists who taught me how to see that spotted owlet camouflaged in the raintree. I drank good wine, ate simple food, and took pleasure in hugging vaccinated friends and family. Touch, you see, is an underrated comfort.(Disclosure: I have mentioned Bangalore-based brands in this piece. They deserve patronage.

20-01-2022||India||BJP declares first 34 candidates for Goa polls, Utpal Parrikar denied Panaji seat||PANAJI: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday announced its first list of 34 candidates for the upcoming Goa assembly polls. The list released by BJP in-charge for Goa elections Devendra Fadnavis and party national general secretary Arun Singh notably excludes former defence minister Manohar Parrikar’s son Utpal Parrikar and includes two husband-wife duos. The party gave away the Panjim seat, which was claimed by Utpal Parrikar, to sitting MLA Atanasio “Babush” Monserrate. The party also overlooked former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar to favour Dayanand Sopte who joined the BJP mid-term from the Congress. The list includes two husband-wife duos-- Babush Monserrate and his wife Jennifer, who is currently the minister of revenue in the Pramod Sawant government, and health minister Vishwajit Rane and his wife Divya Rane. The party, however, denied ticket to wife of deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar. While Babush will contest from the state capital of Panaji, Jennifer will contest from their traditional stronghold Taleigao. Vishwajit Rane will contest from his sitting seat Valpoi while his wife will contest from Poriem, currently represented by his father and former chief minister Pratapsingh Rane, putting her on the path of a potential face off with her father-in-law. Rane has been declared as the Congress candidate but is yet to make up his mind on whether to contest or not. Among those who didn’t make the cut include PWD minister Deepak Prabhu Pauskar (Sanvordem) who defected from the MGP to the BJP, Isidore Fernandes (Canacona) and Filipe Neri Rodrigues (Velim). Sanvordem and Canacona have been given to party old-timers Ganesh Gaonkar and Ramesh Tawadkar, while Velim has been handed to newbie Savio Rodrigues. New entrants Jayesh Salgaocar (Saligao), Rohan Khaunte (Porvorim) Ravi Naik (Ponda) and Govind Gaude (Priol) have also been rewarded with tickets. Congress leaders who switched to the BJP Dayanand Sopte, Nilkanth Halarnkar, Francisco Silveira, Subhash Shirodkar, Clafasio Dias have all been given tickets. Explaining the decision to give the Panaji ticket to the Babush Monserrate by ignoring the claim of Utpal Parrikar, Fadnavis said Parrikar was given “other options.” “A sitting MLA has been given a ticket in Panaji. Parrikar’s family is our family. They are close to us. I had given Utpal Parrikar two options, from where he could contest. He had refused one option. We are still discussing the second option with him. We all feel he should accept it. BJP has respected the Parrikar family,” Fadnavis said. It is understood that the party has offered the Bicholim seat to Utpal Parrikar where the party has been struggling to find a candidate ever since assembly speaker Rajesh Patnekar who currently represents the seat withdrew from the race on health grounds. Immediately after the BJP’s announcement, Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party national convenor Arvind Kejriwal offered a ticket to Parrikar. Earlier, Shiv Sena also offered a ticket to him. Those close to Utpal, however, said he is yet to make up him mind on contesting. Fadnavis also said that the party has adequate representation for all communities in Goa. “The world’s biggest party, BJP, has worked for the rights of the dalits and backward classes. In three general seats, ST candidates have been fielded. In one general seat, BJP has fielded an SC candidate. We have a total of 11 OBC candidates, nine minority Christian candidates have also been given tickets and nine are general,” he said. Defending his decision to offer tickets to husband-wife duos, Fadnavis said that was one of the occupational hazards of politics. “Babush Monserrate and his wife were elected and joined the BJP. Jennifer Monserrate has her own identity and she is a minister in the BJP government. Vishwajit Rane joined BJP from Congress and got elected on BJP ticket. The Poriem seat is Pratapsingh Rane’s seat. He has been elected from that seat for 50 years on a Congress ticket. The Congress has never lost from there,” Fadnavis said. He said the BJP has “requested” Pratapsingh Rane not to contest from the seat he has been representing for the past 50 years and instead “give the seat to the BJP” by either contesting on a BJP ticket or withdrawing from the race. The Goa government in December accorded a life-time cabinet minister rank to Pratapsingh Rane. “He accepted what we said and said that I have aged so I will not contest, Divya Rane will contest instead. Congress will contest the seat, but we will defeat them,” Fadnavis said. The BJP’s list consists of incumbent MLAs Dayanand Sopte (Mandrem), Nilkanth Halarnkar (Tivim), Joshua D’Souza (Mapusa), Glenn Souza Ticlo (Aldona), Atanasio Monserrate (Panaji), Jennifer Monserrate (Taleigao), Francisco Silveira (Sant Andre), Pramod Sawant (Sanquelim), Vishwajit Rane (Valpoi), Subhash Shirodkar (Shiroda), Milind Naik (Mormugao), Mauvin Godinho (Dabolim), Clafasio Dias (Cuncolim), Chandrakant “Babu” Kavlekar (Quepem) and Nilesh Cabral (Curchorem). New faces include Pravin Arlekar (Pernem), Premender Vishnu Shet (Maem), Sudesh Bhingi (Marcaim), Krishna Salkar (Vasco da Gama), Datta Borkar (Nuvem), Ulhas Tuenkar (Navelim), Damodar Bandodkar (Benaulim) and Savio Rodrigues (Velim). Others include former minister Ramesh Tawadkar (Canacona), former MLAs Subhash Phal Dessai (Sanguem), Damodar Naik (Fatorda), Dayanand Mandrekar (Siolim) and Manohar Ajgaonkar, who is now contesting the Margao seat against Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat having shifted from Pernem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-declares-first-34-candidates-for-goa-polls-utpal-parrikar-denied-panaji-seat-101642682552340.html
20-01-2022||India||‘More draconian’: Mamata again writes to PM Modi on proposed changes in IAS cadre rules||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to withdraw the proposed changes to rules for the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) cadre. Calling the central government's draft amendment of the IAS cadre rules more “draconian” than the former, Banerjee said that it goes against the “foundation of our federal policy and the basic structure of Constitutional scheme”.In another letter earlier this month, Banerjee had written to Prime Minister Modi on January 13, urging him to not go ahead with the proposal.In her two-page letter today, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo made references to a note that she had sent in this regard last week, and said that since then the central government had “accentuated its stand” and that its revised draft is taking the matter to “non-federal extremes”.This is the second letter that Mamata Banerjee has sent to the Prime Minister in eight days and in this one, she insisted that the proposed amendment to the IAS (Cadre) Rules, 1954, will create a “fear psychosis” among officers and impact their performance.What are the proposed changes to the IAS cadre rules?The Union government has proposed an amendment to the IAS (Cadre) Rules, 1954, which would enable it to post IAS officers on central deputation, bypassing reservations of state governments.In its amendment, the Centre has proposed to insert a provision in Rule 6 of IAS (Cadre) Rules, 1954, which stated that any IAS officer could be posted on central deputation with the concurrence of the state government concerned.The Centre has proposed to keep this part of the rule intact, but to add: “Provided that each state government shall make available for deputation to the central government, such number of eligible officers of various levels to the extent of the central deputation reserve prescribed under regulations referred to in Rule 4 (1), adjusted proportionately by the number of officers available with the state government concerned vis-a-vis the total authorised strength of the State Cadre at a given point of time.”What are Mamata Banerjee's objections to the proposed changes?The letter reads, “The moot point of the further revised draft amendment proposal is that an officer, whom the central government may choose to take out a state to any part of the country without taking his/her consent and without the agreement of the state government under whom he/she is serving, may now stand released from his/her current assignment forthwith.”Explaining why such a proposal comes across as problematic to her, Banerjee wrote, “The power proposed to be usurped by the central government by resorting to over-centralisation of powers is going to destroy the morale and freedom of the All India Service officers quite apart from such usurpation being unconstitutional on the face of it.”“It is going to completely render them and all the state governments at the mercy of the central government since the All India Services serve as the backbone of a state's administrative machinery,” the letter added. “It will hang on the head of each officer of the All Indian Services like a Damocles' sword.

20-01-2022||India||HT THIS DAY: January 21, 1957 --Nehru inaugurates India’s first reactor; peaceful uses only objective, says PM||BOMBAY- MR NEHRU gave the assurance today that India would never use atomic energy for evil purposes “ whatever might happen and whatever might be the circumstances.” “ There are no conditions attached to this assurance,” Mr Nebru said inaugurating the atomic reactor, first in Asia outside the Soviet Union, at the atomic energy establishment at Trombay, 16 miles from here. Mr Nehru was loudly cheered when he said he was giving the assurance not only on behalf of his Government but also on behalf of all future Governments of India. “ Once we attach conditions nobody knows what conditions or circumstances might be and such assurances have no value or meaning. “ The atomic reactor of the “ swimming pool “ type, which actually went into operation on August 4 last year was named by Mr Nehru as apsara a la water nymph or a celestial dancer. Nearly a hundred scientists from all parts of the world attended the inauguration of the atomic energy establishment and the reactor. Among them were Gen K. D. Nochols, Dr B F. J. Schnoland, Deputy Director of Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell in the U.K., Mr Nesmeyananov, Mr V. S. Emelianov, Mr A. I. Alikhaniants, Mr L G Lenov, Mr N. N. Privalov and Mr D V. Skobelt (all from the Soviet Union) and Dr Hideki Yukawa, member of the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan. The function, which was attended by members of the consular corps, Ministers of the Bombay Government and leading citizens was presided over by Mr Sri Prakasa, Bombay Governor. CENTRE OF LEARNING Mr Nehru said the atomic energy establishment would not only help Indian people but would also serve as a centre where scientific knowledge and experience could be shared and training facilities offered to other countries, more especially countries of Asia and Africa. Mr Nehru said the development of atomic energy had to be organized in such a way as to bring good and not evil to the world People in countries advanced its atomic development had realized that there was a tremendous danger if the energy were used in the wrong way. “ In fact I imagine everybody now realizes that things as they are today make a total war in which atomic weapons are used out of Question.” The Prime Minister said such a war would bring disaster to everybody and that was why talks for controlling the use of atomic weapons were going on He said disarmament was a very difficult task. “But I believe inspite of apparent and real difficulties, peoples’ minds, and more than that the minds of those who control the destinies of nations are beginning more and more to take a realistic view of the situation. Let us hope that they will arrive at some decision which will put an end to the terrible fear that these weapons may be used, he added. THE MAIN QUESTION Mr Nehru said all develop. mental activity in the country revolved round one question and that was how to raise the standard of life of the people. Some people might think that the development of atomic energy was not directly related to that question at any rate at present. “ “In any event, whether we like it or not, it is quite inevitable that we do it. We must go ahead or we fall back and drag ourselves along the tails of others. That naturally is not good enough,” he said. Mr Nehru was not sure whether all the changes that were taking place in the world in the name of progress were very admirable. “ Sometimes doubts arise. Whether they are admirable or not, they are inevitable. One should make them admirable by giving the right turn.” he said. The Prime Minister said India was at the beginning of the journey so far as the development of atomic technology was concerned but India had done rather well in the last two years. He paid tributes to Dr Bhabha, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, and Dr K. S. Krishnan, Director of the National Physical Laboratory, for their efforts. INDIA’S SCIENTISTS Mr Nehru particularly referred to young scientists who have been working in the establishment and said: “ It is really when I see them and talk to them and see their informed enthusiasm and their trained mind that I realize that it is very good material we have got. The future becomes much more assured not because of the concrete and stones of the buildings being put up but because of the human material employed in the work.” The Prime Minister expressed gratitude to the countries which had generously helped India in its atomic energy development programme. He referred to the help given by Canada, which is helping to set up a second reactor at the establishment, the U.K., the U.S A. and France. With the Soviet Union, he said, there had been co-operation in this matter, “ which. no doubt, will develop in future.” Mr Sri Prakasa, earlier, said the new discovery of atomic energy gave mankind hope and cheer. The new energy had potentiality of disaster as well as enriching and enhancing human life. India would use atomic energy for the arts of peace and not for the arts of war. BHABHA’S SPEECH Dr Bhabha in his speech, outlined the future atomic development programme of the country. He said if India were not to lose further ground in the modern world it was necessary to set up some atomic power stations in the coming five years which would produce electricity as well as plutonium which would serve as fuel for future power reactors. The problem was being studied in the Department of Atomic Energy in consultation with the Planning Commission and other Ministries concerned and a decision was expected within the next few months. He said a plant to turn uranium salt into uranium metal had already been designed and was expected to come into operation by the middle of next year. (Uranium salt is produced at the establishment from uranium and thorium cake manufactures at the Alwaye Plant in South India during the processing of monazite sand). Heavy water, another chemical required in nuclear reactors to serve as a moderator, would also be manufactured in quantity, Dr Bhabba said. The fertilizer plant to be set up at Nangal would produce ten to 20 tons of heavy water per year. It was the intention of the Government to produce heavy water in all fertilizer factories which would be set up in the second Five-Year Plan.The government was also studying the erection of a plant to make atomically-pure graphite from the coke produced in the refinery in Assam. He said it was also the intention of the Government to erect plants for the manufacture of beryllium and ziroconium metals. India was the largest producer in the world of the rare mineral K. Beryl from which beryllium metal was obtained The metal ziraconium could be obtained from the zircon sand found in the southwest coast of India. Both the metals had important uses in advanced types of atomic reactors. Dr Bhabha said in order to ensure a steady supply of trained scientifle and technical Dersonnel the establishment was starting a training programme in June this I ‘ year. Two hundred and fifty young graduates and engineers would be recruited annually from universitibs and ,given supplementary ( training for a year to fit them for work in India’s atomic energy programme. It was hoped to increase the intake of the school to 350 in due course. Dr Bhabba said work on setting I up another reactor had started in the establishment since February last year. The reactor had been offered by the Government of Canada. It was expected to be completed by the first half of next year. THIRD REACTOR He said the erection of a third reactor had also been decided I upon and it was expected to get it started also in the first half of next year. In fact, this reactor might go into operation earlier than the second reactor offered by Canada for which heavy water was required. In India, Dr Bhabba said, the need was for small electric power stations of 20 to 50 megawatts and I it was the intention to study at the establishment reactors for this ‘I purpose moderated with beryllium oxide, gas cooled and working on natural or slightly enriched uranium. If India was to attain a standard of living equal to that obtaining in countries most advanced industrially, she had to use new sources of energy. Fortunately, India’s reserves of uranium and thorium were equivalent to more than 15 times her reserves of coal. Many more deposits were likely to be discovered. For long-term industrialization in India atomic energy was a necessity, he added. Besides the U. S.A , the Soviet Union and the U.K . other countries which sent their scientists to the inauguration ceremony were Afghanistan, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Burma, Canada, Ceylon, China, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, France, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan Sweden, Thailand, Tunisia, North Viet-Nam.

Around 99% of patients in Delhi complained of these symptoms, the health ministry data revealed. Fever, cough, throat irritation generally subside after day 5.From Alpha, Delta to Omicron: How Covid-19 symptoms changedAmong children between the age of 11 and 18 years, fever is the common symptom along with upper respiratory tract infection, the ministry said. Covid pneumonia was less this time, the health secretary said.Omicron was first detected on November 24, 2021, in South Africa and since then doctors have been flagging the difference of Omicron symptoms than earlier Covid caused by Delta or any other variants. Scratchy throat was highlighted worldwide as the most common symptom of Omicron.As Omicron advanced in all countries, other symptoms like night sweat, loose motion were added to the list. It was confirmed that Omicron has not been targeting the lungs and its impact are limited only to the upper respiratory track. The Centre's findings supported the universal belief but at the same time, the health ministry experts on Thursday warned that though the extensive vaccine coverage has saved Indians from the severity of the 3rd wave, people with comorbidities have to remain extra cautious. The health ministry on Thursday said the present 3rd wave of the pandemic in India is being driven by Omicron. Comparing the fatalities of the 2nd wave and the 3rd wave, health ministry data revealed that the third wave in India is milder than the second wave. On April 30, 2021, when the second wave was at its peak in the country, there were 3,86,452 new cases, 3,059 deaths and 31,70,228 active cases. The proportion of fully vaccinated people was 2%. On January 20, 2022, there are 3,17,532 new cases, 380 deaths and 19,24,051 active cases. The proportion of fully vaccinated people is 72%, health ministry data said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fever-with-or-without-rigors-among-5-common-symptoms-of-3rd-wave-in-delhi-centre-101642678219405.html

20-01-2022||India||Maharashtra govt gives nod to reopen schools, local bodies to take final decision||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government on Thursday decided to reopen schools, including pre-primary classes, from January 24, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, however, adding that the government has given the powers to local bodies to take a final decision depending upon the Covid-19 situation in the respective areas. Gaikwad said the department received several representations from various stakeholders to reopen schools, and the department has taken the decision keeping the safety of children in mind. The school education department sent the proposal to reopen schools for offline classes from January 24 to the Chief Minister’s Office. “The chief minister gave consent to reopen offline schools for classes 1 to 12. Till now, pre-primary schools too were shut. But we have decided to reopen pre-primary schools as well. Wherever Covid cases have gone down, the schools will reopen from January 24. However, Covid-appropriate behaviour, the SOPs issued by the government must be followed by the schools,” she said. The minister further added, “We are not talking about a blanket reopening of schools. Local bodies have the authority to decide depending on the Covid-19 situation in the city or district.” The offline classes in schools and colleges resumed in December as the Covid-19 cases were dropping. However, with a surge in coronavirus infections in January, the state government decided to keep offline classes shut. Besides the early signs of the third wave ebbing in some parts of the state, the growing pressure from various quarters to reopen schools has prompted the nod by the chief minister’s office. “We have received several representations from parents’ associations, schools, elected representatives, etc, to reopen schools. They all contended that the children are missing out on the social environment, school atmosphere, interactions etc. Our priority has always been the safety of children but as the Covid cases are reducing we decided to reopen schools, and the decision will remain with the local municipal bodies,” the minister said. 
20-01-2022||India||Fatality in 3rd wave significantly lower than Covid 2nd wave: Health ministry||The health ministry on Thursday presented a comparison between the 2nd and the 3rd wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India and noted the difference in the number of fatalities and the coverage of the vaccination. For the first time, the health ministry termed the present surge as the third wave of the pandemic in the country.Here is what the health ministry said about Covid 3rd wave in India:1. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha, Delhi and Rajasthan are the top states contributing the maximum number of daily cases.2. In the week ending on January 19, India has 515 districts reporting weekly case positivity of more than 5%. 3. Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on April 30, 2021, when the second wave was at its peak in the country, there were 3,86,452 new cases, 3,059 deaths and 31,70,228 active cases. The proportion of fully vaccinated people was 2%.Variant watch: Even mild cases may leave a mark on brain4. On January 20, 2022, there are 3,17,532 new cases, 380 deaths and 19,24,051 active cases. The proportion of fully vaccinated people is 72%.5. The 3rd wave in India is not witnessing severity because of the vaccine coverage, Dr Balram Bhargava, director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research said.6. Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said the overall positivity rate of 16% is quite high for India. The surge is driven by Omicron, Dr Paul said. 7. The Union health ministry also presented a comparison of the 2nd and the 3rd surge of Covid in Delhi showing that the number of Covid beds occupied during the 3rd surge is low.8. Adequate Covid-19 testing is being done in the country, the health ministry said. "One-day figures do not show any trend. If one day, there is low testing and a lower number of infections, then that value is not our interest. We provide weekly data which shows a trend," Rajesh Bhushan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fatality-in-3rd-wave-significantly-lower-than-covid-2nd-wave-health-ministry-101642676028999.html

The app itself was named after derogatory references to the Muslim community and came one year after a similar fiasco involving another targeted harassment app, Sulli Deals, hit the headlines.Hundreds of Muslim women, including vocal activists and top professionals, were listed for “auction” and had their photographs doctored and sourced without permission. While there was no actual “auction” or “sale”, the purpose of the app seemed to be to humiliate and intimidate the targeted women, many of whom are active social media users.The police investigating the case, have linked the creators of the contentious app to alt-right groups. They made four arrests in the matter – Vishal Kumar Jha (in Bengaluru), Shweta Singh (in Uttarakhand), Mayank Rawal (in Uttarakhand), and Niraj Bishnoi (in Assam's Jorhat), all of them being college students who allegedly came together to create the app.A fifth person was also arrested from Odisha on Thursday, reports said. Identified as Neeraj Singh, the latest person to be accused in the case is said to be an MBA degree holder and was involved in the planning of the app with the main culprits.Meanwhile, Niraj Bishnoi, the alleged mastermind of the Bulli Bai app, and his co-accused in the case Aumkareshwar Thakur, the alleged creator of the Sulli Deals app, have both been brought to Mumbai by the city's cyber police and were produced before the Bandra magistrate court, which remanded the two in police custody up to January 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bulli-bai-case-mumbai-court-refuses-bail-to-all-three-accused-101642673968546.html

The Army contacted the PLA as soon as it received the information regarding the missing 17-year-old, ANI further reported.According to the officials, the teenager who is a native of Zido village in Upper Siang district, was abducted by the PLA on Tuesday. The district authorities said the youth along with others were hunting in the border area between both countries when the incident took place.In September 2020, the PLA had abducted five youths from Arunachal Pradesh's Upper Subansiri district and released them after about a week. India shares a 3,400 km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.The latest incident comes at a time when the Indian Army is engaged in a stand-off with the PLA in eastern Ladakh since April 2020.So far, officials from both sides have held 14 rounds of military-level talks, but no resolution has been found.The disengagement process is due in areas of Hot Springs, Depsang bulge and Demchok in eastern Ladakh. Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.Earlier in the day, senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi targeted the Centre over the missing boy. "Just a few days before Republic Day, the future of India is kidnapped by China. We stand with the family of Miram Taroun and we will not give up hope will not give up, won't accept defeat.

20-01-2022||India||1.2mn people died in 2019 from antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections: Study||NEW DELHI: At least 1.2 million people died in 2019 as a direct result of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, according to a study published in the medical journal Lancet. This is by far the most comprehensive estimate of the global impact of antimicrobial resistance.The analysis covering 204 countries and territories found that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was now a leading cause of death worldwide, higher than HIV/AIDS or malaria. In effect, hundreds of thousands of deaths now occur due to common, previously treatable infections such as lower respiratory and bloodstream infections as the bacteria that cause them have become resistant to drugs.The report highlights an urgent need to scale up action to combat AMR and outlines immediate actions for policymakers that will help save lives and protect health systems. These include optimising the use of existing antibiotics, taking greater action to monitor and control infections, and providing more funding to develop new antibiotics and treatments.“These new data reveal the true scale of antimicrobial resistance worldwide and are a clear signal that we must act now to combat the threat. Previous estimates had predicted 10 million annual deaths from antimicrobial resistance by 2050, but we now know for certain that we are already far closer to that figure than we thought. We need to leverage this data to course-correct action and drive innovation if we want to stay ahead in the race against antimicrobial resistance,” said the study co-author Chris Murray, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington.Estimates of the health impacts of AMR have been published for several countries and regions, and for a small number of pathogen-drug combinations in a wider range of locations. However, until now no estimates have covered all locations and a broad range of pathogens and drug combinations, according to the researchers.The new Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (GRAM) report estimates deaths linked to 23 pathogens and 88 pathogen-drug combinations in 204 countries and territories in 2019.“Statistical modelling was used to produce estimates of the impact of AMR in all locations – including those with no data – using 471 million individual records obtained from systematic literature reviews, hospital systems, surveillance systems, and other data sources,” said the paper.Disease burden was estimated in two ways: deaths caused directly by AMR (ie deaths that would not have occurred had the infections been drug-susceptible and therefore more treatable), and deaths associated with AMR (ie where a drug-resistant infection was implicated in deaths, but resistance itself may or may not have been the direct cause). Deaths caused by and associated with AMR were calculated for 204 countries and territories and reported for 21 global regions and seven super-regions.The analysis shows AMR was directly responsible for an estimated 1.27 million deaths worldwide, and associated with an estimated 4.95 million deaths, in 2019. HIV/AIDS and malaria have been estimated to have caused 860,000 and 640,000 deaths, respectively, in 2019.Drug resistance in lower respiratory infections – such as pneumonia – had the greatest impact on AMR disease burden, causing more than 400,000 deaths and associated with more than 1.5 million deaths. Drug resistance in bloodstream infections – which can lead to the life-threatening condition sepsis – caused around 370,000 deaths and was associated with nearly 1.5 million deaths. Drug resistance in intra-abdominal infections – commonly caused by appendicitis – led directly to around 210,000 deaths and was associated with around 800,000.While AMR poses a threat to people of all ages, young children were found to be at particularly high risk, with around one in five deaths attributable to AMR occurring in children aged under five years.Deaths caused directly by AMR were estimated to be highest in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, at 24 deaths per 100,000 population and 22 deaths per 100,000 population, respectively. AMR was associated with 99 deaths per 100,000 in Sub-Saharan Africa and 77 deaths per 100,000 in South Asia. In high-income countries, AMR led directly to 13 deaths per 100,000 and was associated with 56 deaths per 100,000.Of the 23 pathogens studied, drug resistance in six alone (E coli, S aureus, K pneumoniae, S pneumoniae, A baumannii, and P aeruginosa) led directly to 929,000 deaths and was associated with 3.57 million. One pathogen-drug combination – methicillin-resistant S aureus, or MRSA – directly caused more than 100,000 deaths in 2019, while six more each caused between 50,000 and 100,000 deaths.Across all pathogens, resistance to two classes of antibiotics often considered the first-line defence against severe infections – fluoroquinolones and beta-lactam antibiotics – accounted for more than an estimated 70% of deaths caused by AMR.The health impact of pathogens varied widely based on location, with deaths attributable to AMR in Sub-Saharan Africa most often caused by S pneumonia (16% of deaths) or K pneumonia (20%), while around half of deaths attributable to AMR in high-income countries were caused by Slead-based aureus (26%) or E. coli (23%).“With resistance varying so substantially by country and region, improving the collection of data worldwide is essential to help us better track levels of resistance and equip clinicians and policymakers with the information they need to address the most pressing challenges posed by antimicrobial resistance. We identified serious data gaps in many low-income countries, emphasising a particular need to increase laboratory capacity and data collection in these locations,” said study co-author Christiane Dolecek.

With this, the total number of deaths and recoveries has climbed to 487,693 and 35,807,029 respectively. The active cases are nearing the two million mark and currently constitute 4.83% of total cases.Thursday's case count has been the highest in 249 days, the health ministry said.On Wednesday, the country registered nearly 283,000 fresh cases, 441 deaths and 188,157 recoveries.The total number of tests carried out in the country is over 700 million with 1,935,180 tests conducted in the last 24 hours, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said on Thursday.The country's Omicron count is nearing 10,000 with 9,287 cases of the fast-spreading variant detected so far, an increase of 3.63% since Wednesday.Authorities have administered more than 7.33 million vaccine doses to eligible beneficiaries in the last 24 hours, and the cumulative vaccination coverage is nearing 1.6 billion.The health ministry added that more than 1.58 billion vaccine doses have been provided to states and Union Territories (UTs) so far through the Centre's free of cost channel and direct state procurement category.“More than 127.2 million balance and unutilized Covid vaccine doses are still available with the States/UTs to be administered,” the ministry added.The third wave of Covid-19 in the country might peak on Sunday as the daily cases will be less than 400,000-mark. According to a study by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, “The daily peak cases are projected to peak on January 23 in India and stay below the 400,000-mark. Metro cities Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata have already peaked.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-covid-in-india-records-sharp-spike-with-317-532-cases-new-deaths-at-491-101642650182449.html
20-01-2022||India||10 endangered turtles released into the wild in Sunderbans||KOLKATA: For the first time, 10 northern river terrapin, one of the most endangered species of turtles in the world, were released into the wild from a breeding centre in the Sunderbans in West Bengal on Wednesday.Forest officials said the 10 turtles (Batagur baska) have been fitted with GPS transmitters and would allow experts to track them and know about their home range and the habitat.“We have released 10 sub-adults including seven females and three males, in the wild on Wednesday after fitting them with GPS transmitters,” said S Jones Justin, deputy field director of the Sunderban Tiger Reserve.Even though the species was once widespread in the mangroves and estuaries of West Bengal and Odisha, overfishing led to a rapid decline in their population. It is believed that only a handful of them may now be living in the wild in the Sunderbans, the world’s largest mangrove delta.In 2009, the reserve authorities and the Turtle Survival Alliance started a breeding programme at Sajnekhali. Three years later, the programme yielded results, and the first batch of hatchlings, around 33, were produced.As the numbers started growing, in 2017, the population, which was contained in a single pond, was distributed in four ponds in the reserve. There are 12 adults and around 370 juveniles in the ponds.“They have been reared for nine years in the ponds. On Wednesday, 10 were released in the wild (in rivers) after being fitted with GPS transmitters. The transmitters would help researchers track the turtles across the vast expanse of the Sunderban mangrove and generate data which would help in their conservation programme,” said a forest official.The Sunderban mangrove, formed by the Ganga and the Brahmaputra, sprawls over 10,000 square km across India and Bangladesh, of which 40% lies in India. Surrounded by rivers and creeks, the mangrove is home to many rare and globally threatened wildlife species such as the Royal Bengal Tiger and the estuarine crocodile. In India, it is confined to the southern tip of West Bengal.Recent reports said the world’s largest mangrove delta is losing its dense forest cover. Experts said the rising salinity levels and increasing cyclones are taking a toll on the mangrove system. The mangroves act as a green barrier against cyclones and protect Kolkata from the direct brunt of storms that originate in the Bay of Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/turtles-released-into-wild-in-sunderban-101642650687734.html

The meeting will be held in Delhi after 6pm, Sangma said on Wednesday while speaking to reporters."We will be submitting more or less a common report and then I think the Government of India has to move according to the laws," he also said, as per a PTI report.The recommendations of the regional committees of Meghalaya and those of the Assam government will be given to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) for further actions, he further informed.The Assam and Meghalaya cabinets have approved a ‘give-and-take’ formula to resolve the five-decade-old border dispute between the two states. In the first phase, issues of six of the 12 disputed areas will be resolved. The six areas that will be taken up for final settlement in the first phase are Hahim, Gizang, Tarabari, Boklapara, Khanapara-Pilingkata and Ratacherra.The other six areas, where the disputes are more complicated, would be taken up later.As per the plan, the boundary demarcation is expected to be done after the due procedure in Parliament. The Survey of India will also be roped in for necessary inspections.In 1972, Meghalaya was carved out of Assam and both states share a 733-km boundary. Over the years, the two neighbouring states have witnessed several skirmishes between various communities inhabiting the border areas.This year on January 21, Meghalaya will celebrate its 50th formation day and the governments of both states are trying to forge an understanding on the dispute before the golden jubilee celebrations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meghalayaassam-border-dispute-cms-of-2-states-to-meet-amit-shah-today-101642643980758.html

Delilah will contest from the Siolim constituency while Kedar Naik will contest from Saligao. The Congress also named Moreno Rebello from the Curtorim seat, a clear message to Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, the former Congress legislator from Curtorim who quit the party to join the Trinamool Congress (TMC). This week, Lourenco resigned from the TMC and asked the Congress to take him back.Former advocate general of Goa Carlos Ferreira has been announced as the party’s candidate from the Aldona constituency.In all, the party has announced candidates for 32 assembly constituencies but several crucial segments remain including capital city of Panaji, and the bellwether seat of Benaulim in South Goa. The party has conceded two seats to the Goa Forward Party, so far.Meanwhile, BJP MLA Wilfred D’Sa resigned from the party as an MLA on Wednesday and is expected to contest as an independent. D’Sa, who was one among the ten MLAs who defected from the Congress to the BJP back in 2019, represented the Christian-dominated Nuvem constituency, which observers said, made his re-election on a BJP ticket highly unlikely forcing him to contest as an Independent. There is speculation that another BJP MLA and water resources minister, Filipe Neri Rodrigues, may quit the party to switch to the Trinamool Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-election-michael-lobo-s-wife-his-aide-in-new-congress-list-of-candidates-101642630344461.html
20-01-2022||India||Will review Covid-19 restrictions in state on Friday with experts: Bommai||BengaluruKarnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday said that he would review the restrictions imposed in the state on Friday as he will hold a meeting with Covid-19 experts amid a surge in cases. “On Friday I will hold a meeting with experts. We will review all restrictions. The number of Covid infections is going up but there is no load on hospitals and no admissions. We have to pay more attention towards OPD (outpatient department),” Bommai said in Bengaluru. In a statement, the chief minister’s office (CMO) said: “The number of hospitalisation cases is less in the current wave of Covid. So there is an opinion that it would be better to carry on daily life by following the Covid guidelines. The experts are examining it. They are set to present a comprehensive picture at the meeting to be held on Friday. A suitable decision would be taken after getting clarity about the issue.”He was addressing the media in person after almost 10 days as he had tested positive for covid-19 last week and went into isolation. The statements come even as Karnataka reports record daily infections, raising apprehensions of more stricter restrictions to contain the spread of the virus. The restrictions that are in force currently include night and weekend curfews as well as limits on the number of people who can assemble for any events like marriage or other get-togethers. Bengaluru registered 24,135 new infections in a 24-hour-period, according to the state health minister on Wednesday. The positivity rate in the state came down to 18.80%, Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said . The active caseload rose to over 267,000 with Bengaluru accounting for 184,000, he added. There were 21 more deaths due to the virus with five in Bengaluru. These are some of the highest single day infections in Karnataka and its capital Bengaluru since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. However, hospitalisation has been lower, fuelling speculation of possible relaxations or not additional restrictions to those already in place which continues to adversely impact lives and livelihoods of the population. “Experts who have studied the trend in various states have estimated that the Covid wave in the state could peak by January end of February first week. The Chief Secretary has already ordered booking of cases and legal action against those who violate Covid rules. There will be no bias against any person or organisation,” the chief minister said. “We will take a decision on restrictions once we get the report from experts,” Bommai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-review-covid-19-restrictions-in-state-on-friday-with-experts-bommai-101642620503693.html
20-01-2022||India||Karnataka revises Covid-19 guidelines for testing and home isolation||Bengaluru: The Karnataka government on Wednesday issued new guidelines for the testing and home isolation of Covid-19 patients in the state in line with the central government’s protocols. According to a fresh order, all symptomatic people will be required to undergo a rapid antigen test (RAT) and if the test shows a negative result, it will be followed up by an RT-PCR, as per ICMR protocols.All primary contacts of Covid-19 patients will be tested for the infection even if they are asymptomatic and irrespective of their age and comorbidities.Whoever tests positive for the virus will have to undergo home isolation and will be released after seven days if they have not experienced fever for three preceding days. “There is no need for re-testing after the home isolation period is over,” said the order.The primary contacts will also be required to quarantine at home for seven days.Health care workers who show any signs or symptoms of Covid-19 will be tested for the infection. Health care workers who are asymptomatic or exhibiting mild symptoms will have to isolate themselves for five days at home or a hotel.“If asymptomatic during the preceding three days with oxygen saturation greater than 94% at room air, they will be released from isolation with an advisory to strictly wear a mask or PPE when people are around for the next five days,” said the order.Their primary contacts will have to undergo home or institutional quarantine for three days and if asymptomatic, may be released thereafter without any testing.This comes days after the ICMR said that anyone who has come in contact with a Covid-infected patient does not necessarily need to take the Covid-19 test unless the person is in the ‘high-risk’ category based on age or comorbidities.In the advisory on ‘Purposive Testing Strategy for Covid-19’, ICMR stated that people who need not be tested include “contacts of confirmed cases of Covid-19 unless identified as high risk based on age or comorbidities”.Besides, asymptomatic individuals in community settings, patients who stand discharged as per home isolation guidelines, patients discharged from a Covid-19 facility as per revised discharge policy and individuals undertaking inter-state domestic travel need not be tested, ICMR has said.But individuals with cough, fever, sore throat, loss of taste or smell, breathlessness and other respiratory symptoms should be tested, the government body said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-revises-covid-19-guidelines-for-testing-and-home-isolation-101642620383549.html

We came to know from others in the group, who escaped, that he was abducted by PLA from the Indian side,” Shashvat Saurabh, deputy commissioner of Upper Siang, said.“As soon as we came to know of the matter, we informed Indian army authorities that operate in the region. Continuous efforts are underway to rescue the youth at the earliest,” he added.BJP Lok Sabha member Tapir Gao took to Twitter to highlight the incident and sought help from Indian agencies to step up efforts for his early release.
20-01-2022||India||Experts predict third wave will peak by end of month, says K’taka CM||BengaluruKarnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday said experts in the state have predicted that the third wave of the pandemic will peak between the last week of January and the first week of February. “Experts who have studied the trend in various states have estimated that the Covid wave in the state could peak by January end or February first week. The chief secretary has already ordered booking of cases and legal action against those who violate Covid rules,” said Bommai said. “The number of Covid-19 cases has increased, but there is not much load on hospitals. We need to concentrate on improving out-patient department (OPD) facilities. All this will be discussed with the expert committee,” he said. According to experts, during the peak of Covid-19, cases in the state could be anywhere between 70,000 to 150,000. “This is as per the projections that have been very clearly made by the Indian Institute of Science and the scientists at Indian statistical Institute, Dr Shiva Athreya and Dr Rajesh Sundaresan,” said Dr N Ravi, a virologist.“They have modelled, and they have given the best and worst-case scenario. And the best and worst-case scenarios are not in the hands of the government. It is in the hands of the people. You can’t blame the government for putting restrictions, or the spread. The best-case scenario is that it would be 70,000-75,000 infections per day towards the end of this month. The worst-case scenario is 1.5 lakh new infections every day for one or two days in the first or second week of February,” Dr Ravi told Hindustan Times.Meanwhile, the officials of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) have predicted that in the capital city the cases will peak by January 25, and it would be as high as 35,000 a day. This information was conveyed to the chief minister during the Covid-19 review meeting held on Tuesday. BBMP has projected that Covid cases saw a jump of 250 per cent in just a week’s time in Bengaluru. The projection is based on the week-on-week increase in Covid cases, said a senior official. The BBMP officials further said that the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is driven by the Omicron variant.

20-01-2022||India||Seer arrested for demanding mosque demolition||Bengaluru: A seer was arrested on Tuesday for his alleged statement demanding demolition of the Jamia Masjid in Srirangapatna, located around 125 km from Bengaluru, police said. The seer had uploaded a video on his Facebook account claiming that the historic mosque was a hanuman temple, and that it should be demolished like the Babri Masjid. A case was registered against the seer, police said.Seer Rishi Kumara Swami of Arsikere-based Kalika Mutt in Hassan was arrested from Chikkamagaluru district, based on a complaint by Yathiraj, a security guard of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). According to police, the seer made the video when he visited Srirangapatna to attend the last rites of a child artist, who had died in a road accident on Saturday. In the video, he states that the sculpted pillars on the outer wall of the masjid belong to a temple. “The building of a temple in Srirangapatna has been converted into a mosque. Hindus should wake up now. This is one of the mosques that should be demolished soon like the Babri Masjid of Ayodhya,” he is seen stating in the video. The Jama Masjid or Masjid-e-Ala with two minarets was built by Tipu Sultan in 1794. The mosque is now maintained and administered by the Bangalore circle of Archaeological Survey of India. The mosque has a madrasa and a cloister for rooms. Following this arrest, the seer told the media that he stands by his statement that the structure is a temple and not a mosque. He claimed in the video that the pillars, walls and kalyani (water body) inside the premises of the mosque symbolise Hindu architecture. Rishi Kumara had courted arrest earlier for his controversial statements on varied issues. He has also acted in a feature film and has participated in a television reality show. During the bail hearing, the counsel for the seer argued that the statements made by his client are not controversial and that they expressed his anguish over the remains of the temple inside the mosque. The counsel for the government argued that his bail petition should not be considered, saying his release could lead to communal disharmony and destruction of evidence. The court has reserved the judgment for Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seer-arrested-for-demanding-mosque-demolition-101642620083743.html
20-01-2022||India||TN farmers take out anti-Mekedatu rally, slam Karnataka Cong for padayatra||Farmers belonging to a Tamil Nadu ryots association took out an anti-Mekedatu rally here on Wednesday, hitting out at the Karnataka Congress for its padayatra campaign seeking the dam project implementation, and they were prevented by the police on the inter-State border from proceeding further.The Tamil Nadu Cauvery Vivasayigal Sangam (TNCVS), which led the march, slammed both the Congress and the BJP over the Mekedatu issue and demanded that chief minster MK Stalin and AIADMK leader K Palaniswami “break their silence” on the issue.Christened ‘Mekedatu Besiege Protest,’ the rally, led by TNCVS general secretary P R Pandian, demanded justice for the State, its farmers and people on the Mekedatu issue. After police disallowed the rally to proceed further on the highway towards Bengaluru, about one km ahead of the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border, Pandian told reporters that the padayatra went against the Supreme Court judgment on the inter-State river water issue. It was against the law and Tamil Nadu, he said.The march, though halted, is only aimed at garnering political mileage and capturing power again in the 2023 Assembly election to be held in Karnataka, the farmers leader alleged. As the DMK is in alliance with Congress in Tamil Nadu, the ruling party and the government led by it has not condemned the ‘conspiracy’ of the Congress vis-a-vis the Mekedatu issue, he claimed.“We condemn them and all the political parties.” Pandian wanted both Chief Minister Stalin and Leader of Opposition Palaniswami to ‘break their silence’ on the issue as silence meant giving up hard won rights over the Cauvery issue. Stalin, continuing his ‘reticence’ on Mekedatu, considering DMK’s alliance with Congress is not acceptable, he said.“The Chief Minister should immediately intervene. We are calling all political parties out to come out to protest against Mekedatu. If we take rest, entire Tamil Nadu will be destroyed.”Indirectly, the ‘Central government’ was backing the Congress party in the Cauvery issue and despite the pandemic, the BJP regime in Karnataka had shown that it was ‘afraid’ to reject permission to Congress for its march, he claimed. Both the BJP and Congress in Karnataka are trying to build the Mekedatu dam and it would not be allowed, he said.The Tamil Nadu Congress Committee chief K S Alagiri is ‘belittling’ the protest of Tamil farmers on Mekedatu issue, he alleged. Farmers of Tamil Nadu would never accept deprivation of their rights notwithstanding such a move of ‘Alagiri’, he said.According to the farmers body, the rally was against the Mekedatu project proposal and the recent march of Karnataka Congress to mount pressure on the BJP government to build the dam. Though they had planned to conclude their protest at ‘Mekedatu area,’ they were stopped by police. The farmers launched their rally at Tiruvarur on Tuesday and took out rallies in other towns of the Cauvery delta region including Thanjavur before arriving here to proceed to ‘Mekedatu’.Also, it was to urge the Central government to ‘withdraw’ its permission accorded to Karnataka to prepare a Detailed Protect Report (DPR) for the dam. If built, the Mekedatu dam would deprive farmers and people of Tamil Nadu of their rights over Cauvery water, the ryots association said. Led by Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee chief D K Shivakumar, the padyatra sought implementation of Mekedatu Balancing Reservoir-cum-Drinking Water Project.On January 13, the Karnataka Congress halted the padayatra at Ramanagara following High Court observations, a surge in COVID cases and related government curbs. The padayatra began at Sangama, the confluence of Cauvery and Arkavathi rivers at Kanakapura in Ramanagara district, on January 9 and the distance that was scheduled to be covered before it reached the Karnataka capital was 139 km.The Mekedatu Project DPR was submitted to Central Water Commission by Karnataka in January 2019 and its copies were forwarded to Cauvery Water Management Authority for obtaining consent of co-basin States, including Tamil Nadu, which has been staunchly opposing the project ever since it was proposed by the neighbouring State years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-farmers-take-out-anti-mekedatu-rally-slam-karnataka-cong-for-padayatra-101642619963479.html

Balakrishnan’s statement is part of an agenda to make Riyas as the next Chief Minister,” Muraleedharan told reporters here.Taking a dig at CPI(M), Muraleedharan said Riyas as state chief minister was not digestible for many in that party and the Congress was not responsible for that. “We have no problem in CPI(M) making Riyas as Chief Minister but that should not be done on the account of the Congress party,” the senior Congress leader said, responding to Balakrishnan’s allegation that leaders belonging to minority communities were neglected and sidelined in the Congress in line with the party leader Rahul Gandhi’s speech in Jaipur calling for establishing “rule of Hindus” in the country after ousting the “Hindutva” government at the Centre.” Senior CPI(M) leader E P Jayarajan termed as “immature” the remarks of Muraleedharan and said the Congress has become a group of people making sub-standard statements on political issues.“These statements reflect the lack of standards of the Congress. Therefore, there is no response to the immature views of the Congress leaders,” Jayarajan said, adding that if the Congress discusses politics, it can respond to it.Talking to reporters in Kannur on Tuesday, Balakrishnan had alleged that the Congress even sidelined its prominent minority faces, including Ghulam Nabi Azad, Salman Khurshid and K V Thomas, from the national-level leadership as part of the party’s new policy.Accusing the Congress of discontinuing the representation of people from minority communities in the Congress’s Kerala leadership, Balakrishnan had sought to know whether the move was part of the new policy announced by Gandhi in Jaipur.Addressing a rally against inflation in Jaipur last month, Rahul Gandhi had said India is a country of Hindus and not Hindutvadis who want to be in power at any cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpim-has-agenda-to-make-vijayan-s-son-in-law-next-kerala-cm-alleges-cong-mp-muraleedharan-101642619906201.html

Several members of Yediyurappa’s cabinet had alleged that Vijayendra was running a parallel administration at the behest of his father.His successor, Basavaraj Bommai, has also been accused of corruption, including allegations that he and several other BJP leaders and senior government officials laundered dirty money using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. There are also allegations that the officials and elected representatives demand around 25-30% commission to award tenders for public works.“Interestingly the total measurement/extent of the lands in the sale deed bearing doc. No. 7878/20/21, dated 01/02/2021, is falsely shown as 9 acres and 23 guntas,” according to the complaint.The complainant alleges that the actual market price of the land was over ₹33 crore.“While ₹10,20,00,000 was paid through cheques, (the) remaining ₹23,05,00,000 was allegedly paid in cash by M/s Davalagiri Property Developers, belonging to the family members of the then chief minister Shri BS Yediyurappa, attracting Section 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act,” according to the complaint.The office of Yediyurappa refused to comment on the allegations.

The data is contrary to the state government’s claim of inoculating 100% eligible adults in the state with the first dose. Till January 15, about 68% (71,180) government school employees had been inoculated with both doses. Haryana has 14,160 government run schools in 22 districts of the state and 1,04,162 employees (majority of them teachers). While 16,167 teachers have taken only the first dose, 16,815 teachers have so far not ventured out to take the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, according to official data. Education minister Kanwar Pal said on Wednesday hit out at the teaching fraternity saying such vaccine hesitancy is not an inspiring example. “Teachers are role models and an inspiration for students, who aspire to follow the footsteps of teachers more than their parents. We cannot force them to vaccinate themselves in view of recent court orders,” the education minister said, pointing out that on the other hand, there was enthusiasm for vaccination among students. Till January 18, about 51 % students in the age group of 15-18 had been administered the first shot.The data showed that every district has teachers who have not taken the first dose. For example, at least 438 teachers in Panchkula, 467 in Ambala, 947 in Rohtak, 1,309 in Bhiwani, 411 in Karnal, 1,327 in Sonepat and 1,515 in Sirsa are among those 16% teachers who have not received the first dose. Jhajjar district, with 526 schools and 3,857 teachers, maintains a 94 % vaccination (single as well as both doses including) rate among the teachers followed by Karnal (93 %), Rewari and Yamunanagar (92 %) and Gurugram with (90 %). Nuh district, on the other hand, has the lowest vaccination among the school staff at 60%. The district has 834 schools and 4,675 employees, out of whom 1,067 have taken the first dose and 1,734 have been fully vaccinated while 1,874 are yet to take the first vaccine shot. In Ambala district 89 % school staff has been vaccinated, Bhiwani 77%, Charkhi Dadri 84 %, Faridabad 89%, Fatehabad 88%, Hisar 78%, Jind 82%, Kaithal 89%, Kurukshetra 83%, Mahendergarh 88%, Palwal 88%, Panchkula 85 %, Panipat 86 %, Rohtak 76%, Sirsa 75%, and Sonipat 77% . “I hope the 16 % teachers, who have so far not taken the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, will inoculate themselves. The good results of the vaccine and how it has saved lives are before all of us,” Pal said.

The woman, a resident of Pathanamhitta, told the police that the accused raped her on the pretext of marriage. The woman had initially posted about her ordeal on social media and a week later she formally filed a complaint against Vettiyar at a police station in Kochi. Police said Vettiyar was absconding after the case was registered. In her social media post, the woman said that Vettiyar was an acquaintance and had invited her to a flat, in February last year, in Kochi on the pretext of celebrating his birthday where he raped her. She said that he later promised to marry her but was incommunicado later. She said after she posted about her experience on social media, a couple of other women also shared their experience, following which she approached the police. “He manipulated me several times to ensure that I don’t reveal about the crime. The mental trauma I have faced in last couple of months is unexplainable. The criminal involved in the crime is roaming around freely and he gives lengthy lectures on liberalism and modern attitude,” said the woman in her post in Malayalam. She also alleged that he took money from her on several occasions. A senior officer from the central police station in Ernakulam said Vettiyar was booked under Section 376 (2) (rape) of the Indian Penal Code.

20-01-2022||India||Tableau row: DMK govt resorting to ‘Republic Day Tool Kit’: TN BJP chief||Chennai: Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai on Wednesday accused the DMK government of resorting to a ‘Republic Day toolkit’ and of being incompetent for failing to get the state’s tableau qualified for the parade, adding to the row over the matter.“When the same officers were able to get our tableau qualified in 2019, 2020 and 2021 by going through the same competitive process, why can’t they do that now? The simplest answer is because of an incompetent government running the show in the state,” tweeted Annamalai.After the union government rejected Tamil Nadu’s tableau, chief minister M K Stalin wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking his intervention. To this, defence minister Rajnath Singh responded that Tamil Nadu was eliminated after the third round. On Tuesday night, Stalin announced that the rejected tableau will be displayed during the Republic Day celebrations in Chennai. Annamalai alleged that the DMK government was resorting to a ‘Republic Day toolkit’ to hide its mismanagement of the Pongal gift hamper that was distributed to more than 20 million ration card holders. The Pongal gifts to the beneficiaries had 21 grocery items, including 100 gram of ghee produced by the state-owned Aavin, varieties of dal, and a full sugarcane which is an integral part of the three-day festival that concluded last week. The BJP has alleged corruption in distribution of the gifts. “The jaggery is melting and filled with chemicals and is inedible,” Annamalai had said in a statement and posted a video on his Twitter account where people are seen complaining about items in the Pongal package. DMK’s spokesperson and advocate A Saravanan said the BJP and its ally the AIADMK were resorting to such criticism because of the support the government has been receiving. “Toolkits are the handiwork of the BJP government and not of the DMK,” said Saravanan. “BJP doesn’t have freedom fighters in their party and now everyone has understood how they insult freedom fighters of this country. Rani Velu Nachiyar is the first woman freedom fighter in the country and that (the tableau showing her) has not been given a stage.” He said the allegation of corruption in the Pongal hamper is a “manufactured crisis.”For the Republic Day parade, Tamil Nadu had submitted a theme “Tamil Nadu in the Freedom Struggle”, depicting renowned freedom fighters from the state V O Chidambaranar and poet Subramania Bharathiyar. The rear of the tableau had been designed to showcase a statue of Rani Velu Nachiyar riding a horse with a sword in hand and with women soldiers.
20-01-2022||India||Andhra govt employees up in arms against pay revision||Agitated against the pay revision announced by the state, the government employees have decided to launch an indefinite strike here, said an official on Wednesday.The employees have stated that the revised pay scales would result in reduction of their present salaries, instead of enhancement. An emergency executive meeting of the Andhra Pradesh State Government Employees’ joint action committee was held at Amaravati on Wednesday to discuss the pay revision orders issued by the state government.“We will finalise our plan of action on Thursday and serve the strike notice on the government on Friday. There is no question of holding any talks with the government unless it withdraws the orders,” joint action committee (JAC) chairman Bandi Srinivasa Rao said.Employees’ association president K Venkatrami Reddy said that the secretariat employees had staged demonstrations wearing black badges on Wednesday. “We are demanding that the government immediately roll back the order and hold talks with us,” he said.On January 7, chief minister (CM), Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, had announced a 23.29% increase in salaries, besides release of five dearness allowance arrears pending since July 2019 and increase of retirement age from 60 to 62 years.The JAC chairman, however, said 23% salary hike was way below the 27% interim relief the government had been paying since July 2019. “At the same time, the government has done away with the city compensatory allowance (CCA) and reduced the house rent allowance (HRA),” he pointed out.The JAC demanded that the benefits given to the state government employees at the time of shifting from Hyderabad to Amaravati be continued. Their other demands include continuation of additional pension to the staffers who crossed 75 years and declaration of probation to village and ward secretariat members.State chief secretary Sameer Sharma, however, allayed the apprehensions of the employees that they would get lesser salaries due to pay revision. “The gross salary will go up, though there might be cuts in HRA or removal of CCA,” he said.He said the government was trying to balance the revenue and expenditure while implementing the pay revision. “They cannot compare the interim relief of 27% with salary hike of 23%. Interim relief is not part of the salary and it was given to the employees only as a relief till the pay revision is worked out,” he said.BLURB On January 7, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy had announced a 23.29% increase in salaries||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-employees-up-in-arms-against-pay-revision-101642619543300.html

In the first phase, issues of six of the 12 disputed areas will be resolved, people familiar with the development said. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Meghalaya counterpart Conrad Sangma will meet Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on Thursday to hand him details of the proposal and request for further action. Deliberations between the two states, including the two chief ministers, have been going on since last year. Recently, regional committees of both states submitted their reports on the six areas that will be resolved in first phase. “The proposals submitted by the regional committees, which were agreed upon at the chief ministerial level, were today (Wednesday) approved by the state cabinet,” Sarma said after a cabinet meeting held at Halflong, the headquarters of Assam’s Dima Hasao district. “Cabinet has approved the recommendations of all 3 regional committees as process to resolve the Meghalaya-Assam border issue. The recommendations of both states would be submitted to MHA (ministry of home affairs). Along with CM Sarma, we will meet Home Minister Amit Shah for further action,” Sangma tweeted on Wednesday after a cabinet meeting in Shillong. The six areas that will be taken up for final settlement in the first phase are Hahim, Gizang, Tarabari, Boklapara, Khanapara-Pilingkata and Ratacherra. The other six areas, where the disputes are more complicated, will be taken up later. On Tuesday, during an interaction with various political parties in Assam, Sarma said that as per the recommendations of the regional committees, the state will get 18.51 sq km of the total 36.8 sq km disputed area while the remaining 18.29 sq km will go to Meghalaya. He also said that as per agreements between both states, once the border dispute in all the 12 areas are resolved, Meghalaya will not be able to make any further claims on Assam territory. Meghalaya was carved out of Assam in 1972 and both states share a 733-km boundary. Over the years, the two neighbouring states have witnessed several skirmishes between various communities inhabiting the border areas. Meghalaya will celebrate its 50th statehood day on January 21 and the governments of both states are trying to forge an understanding on some of the disputed borders before the golden jubilee celebrations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-meghalaya-clear-give-and-take-formula-to-resolve-border-dispute-101642619426507.html

She said the government was doing everything possible to limit the damage and notion of Omicron being mild was wrong. She said in last four weeks, there was a four-fold increase in cases triggered by Delta and Omicron variants. She, however, said there was no unusual rush in hospitals and bed occupancy was almost half now.The minister said the state government’s effective intervention delayed the peak and curtailed the need for hospitalisation to an extent. “Now, both Delta and Omicron variants are contributing to the surge. Some people are giving a wrong impression that Omicron is mild and it was not that dangerous. They are wrong. Whatever be the variant basic characteristics of SARS-Cov 2 were same and people should take all steps to keep the disease at bay,” she said. People will have to be more careful about post-Covid complications, she added. The minister admitted that infectivity rate was high during the third wave. “Omicron is at least 5 to 6 times infectious than Delta. We expect cases will peak in a week before flattening. We have to be extremely careful at this stage and all will have to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour,” she said. Action will be taken against those who spread misinformation about the virus, sahe said while asking all, cutting across political lines and other differences, to help contain the disease. The state on Wednesday reported 34,199 new Covid cases after 91,983 samples were tested with a test positivity rate of 37.17 per cent. It also reported 49 deaths taking total to 51,160, according to the state health ministry data. Active cases also went up to 168,383.Erankulam and Thiruvananthapuram districts topped with 5,953 and 5,684 cases, respectively. Statistics also show about 40 per cent of the infected have taken both doses of vaccine. The core committee on pandemic is meeting on Thursday and it is expected to announce severe restrictions to contain the surge. CPI(M) meet a super spreader The ruling CPI(M)’s three-day district conference in Thiruvananthapuram which concluded on Sunday has turned out to be super spreader as more than 100 delegates, including educationminister V Sivankutty and two legislators, were tested positive. The mega Thiruvathira dance programme in which more than 500 women participated had invited enough flak and later the party state committee admitted it was wrong to conduct such a programme. The opposition Congress has sought strict action against organisers of the event.“The party is reduced to merchants of death. It shows the ruling party can do anything and get away easily with it. Despite widespread criticism it went ahead with the programme infecting many delegates. The party owes an explanation for this criminal negligence,” said Congress state president K Sudhakaran. He said the Congress has postponed all its programmes in view of spike in Covid cases. CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said the party has taken permission for the ongoing district conferences and public meetings were avoided due to the surge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-omicron-variants-cause-covid-rise-in-kerala-health-minister-101642619423264.html
20-01-2022||India||PM Modi to host India-Central Asia Summit on January 27||India on Wednesday announced that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will host the first India-Central Asia summit in a virtual format on January 27 as part of the country’s engagement with the extended neighbourhood. The development follows the government’s decision to go ahead with Republic Day celebrations on January 26 without any foreign leader as chief guest because of a surge in Covid-19 infections. Earlier, the Indian side had invited the leaders of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to be chief guests, though no formal announcement was made by any of the countries. The external affairs ministry said the presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan will participate in the virtual summit, described as the “first engagement of its kind between India and the Central Asian countries at the level of leaders.” The summit reflects New Delhi’s growing engagement with the Central Asian states, part of India’s “extended neighbourhood”, and is symbolic of the importance attached by leaders of India and Central Asia to a comprehensive and enduring partnership, the ministry said. At the summit, the leaders are expected to discuss steps to take India-Central Asia relations to newer heights, and exchange views on regional and international issues, “especially the evolving regional security situation,” the ministry added. Modi had visited all the Central Asian states in 2015, and there have been exchanges at high levels at bilateral and multilateral forums. The India-Central Asia Dialogue at the level of foreign ministers, the third meeting of which was held in New Delhi in December, has given impetus to relations between the two sides. “The participation of the secretaries of National Security Councils of Central Asian countries in the Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan held in New Delhi on 10 November 2021 outlined a common regional approach on Afghanistan,” the external affairs ministry said. This is the second year in a row that the Republic Day celebrations have been affected by the fallout of the pandemic. The rapid spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in the past few weeks and recent violent protests in Kazakhstan, which resulted in the death of over 220 people, were factors that went against the participation of the Central Asian leaders, said people familiar with the matter. Last year, India went ahead with truncated Republic Day celebrations without a chief guest after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called off his visit at the last minute because of the rapid spread of a Covid strain in Britain. It is extremely rare for the Republic Day celebrations, seen as a high point in the country’s diplomatic calendar, not to have a chief guest.

The incident took place on Monday when Nargund resident Shamir Shahapur and his friend, Shamshir were returning home after closing their business. The duo was attacked with lethal weapons during which Shahapur was killed and Shamshir sustained serious injuries. Shamshir is undergoing treatment at KMC Hospital, Hubli, the police said. A senior police officer in Gadag said, “The actual case relates to an alleged incident which took place about two-three months ago when a Muslim boy was accused of eve-teasing a Hindu girl. This case is under investigation. Following this, the Bajrang Dal members went the area and tried to pick a fight.”Following this incident, Nalavadi made a provocative speech in front of the police station on January 17, where he dared the police to arrest him and his associates. The police booked a case against the leader, but instead of the speech, he was booked for violation of Covid-19 rules. They were let off with a fine for the violation. “They murdered the 19-year-old the same night after leaving the police station,” said the officer. Police said the Bajrang Dal leader and his three associates was arrested on basis of CCTV footage. Police said that they are still probing if there is any connection between the murdered youth and the eve-teasing incident.
20-01-2022||India||Blast in INS Ranvir took place in AC compartment: Officials||The blast aboard Indian Navy destroyer INS Ranvir, in which three sailors were killed and 11 injured on Tuesday, took place in the ship’s air conditioning compartment and was possibly linked to Freon gas leak, officials familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.Freon is used as a refrigerant in AC plants.The three men who were killed were in an adjacent compartment when the explosion took place on Tuesday evening, the officials said.In a statement, the Indian Navy on Wednesday identified the deceased men as Master Chief Petty Officer (MCPO) I Krishan Kumar, MCPO II Surinder Kumar and MCPO II AK Singh. An MCPO I is equivalent to a Subedar Major in the army, while an MCPO II is equivalent to a Subedar.Navy chief Admiral R Hari Kumar and all personnel of the Indian Navy extended their condolences to the families of the three men, the statement said. “We fully stand by with the families in this difficult time,” it added.The incident took place at the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai. The ship’s crew responded immediately and quickly brought the situation under control, the navy said on Tuesday, adding that no major material damage to the destroyer was reported.INS Ranvir was on cross-coast operational deployment from the Visakhapatnam-based Eastern Naval Command since November 2021 and was due to return to its base port, officials said. The navy has instituted a board of inquiry to investigate the cause of the accident.Manned by a crew of 30 officers and 310 sailors, INS Ranvir was commissioned into the Indian Navy in April 1986.The destroyer, built in the erstwhile Soviet Union, has a displacement of 5,000 tonnes, length of 146 metres, beam of 15.8 metres and top speed of 30 knots. It is armed with a variety of weapons including surface-to-surface missiles, surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes.INS Ranvir is among the warships commanded by Admiral Kumar in his 38-year military career.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blast-in-ins-ranvir-took-place-in-ac-compartment-officials-101642618884010.html
20-01-2022||India||Two IndiGo flights avert mid-air collision, DGCA orders probe||Two IndiGo flights averted a mid-air collision over Bengaluru airport just after take off earlier this month, prompting the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to initiate a probe into the matter, officials said. The incident took place at Kempegowda International Airport on January 7 when IndiGo flights 6E 455 (to Kolkata) and another flight 6E 246 (to Bhubaneswar) were reportedly given the mandatory clearances from the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) at the same time. As per guidelines, some time difference needs to be maintained during clearances for safe and smooth operation of flights.“We are investigating the matter and will take strictest action against those found delinquent,” DGCA director general Arun Kumar said.The airport in Bengaluru comprises two parallel runways – north and south. Officials familiar with the case said the north runway was in use for departures while the south was looking after arrivals on the morning of January 7. “The south runway was shut later in the day but the change was reportedly not communicated to the south tower controller. The north runway, meanwhile, was being used entirely for flight operations,” an airport official said, seeking anonymity.As the change in runways was reportedly not communicated, the south tower controller gave the required approval to the Kolkata-bound flight for departure. At the same time, the north tower controller gave permission to the Bhubaneswar-bound aircraft to take off from the north runway, the official said. “It was when both the aircraft after departure were converging, that luckily, the approach radar controller (in the air traffic control) noticed them moving towards each other and immediately instructed both the pilots to diverge and avoid a mid-air collision,” the official said. “It was due to the pilots’ last minute divergence that a collision was averted, “ the official added.The incident was neither recorded in any logbook nor was it reported by the Airports Authority of India (AAI), the official claimed. IndiGo did not comment on the matter. AAI, on the other hand, remained unavailable for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-indigo-flights-avert-mid-air-collision-dgca-orders-probe-101642618704539.html
20-01-2022||India||Centre seeks info from states to monitor tiger reserves||As part of an initiative to centrally monitor tiger reserves in the country, the Central government has written to states asking them to compile information on all 50 reserves, officials familiar with developments said on Wednesday. The Union environment ministry is compiling a database on a management information system (MIS) with the information, national tiger conservation authority (NTCA) officials said. The information sought includes relocation of villages from core area, digitisation of reserve boundaries; and status of forest staff. The MIS is expected to be implemented this year officials said and interactions with tiger reserves have already started. India now has 2,967 tigers, or 7 out of every 10 big cats in the wild in the world, according to the All India Tiger Estimation Results released in 2019. The number reflects a 33% increase over 2014 when there were 2,226 tigers in the country. That number itself was an improvement over 2010 (1,706) and 2006 (1,411). During the launch of the ‘India State of Forest Report, 2021’ on January 13, environment minister Bhupender Yadav had said the Centre has written to all principal chief conservators of forests about collating and submitting the information related to their divisions on forests, biodiversity, human animal conflict and others. He also said that the Centre will take up the second phase of ‘Green India Mission’, which is focused on increasing forest cover and that India will also have to meet its nationally determined contribution (under Paris Agreement) of creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. “We want to improve the quality of our forests and increase green cover with community participation,” he had said. “The MIS will involve digitising the boundary of reserves; status of staff both contractual and permanent; arms and ammunition; anti-poaching activities; information on tiger mortality; forest cover and voluntary relocation of villages and people,” said a senior NTCA official familiar with the process. “Expenditure on various schemes and programmes will also be monitored,” he added, requesting anonymity. “As far as relocation of villages and people from core area is concerned, it is voluntary but it is also mandated in the wildlife protection act that core tiger reserve area should be inviolate. The status of relocation will also be transparently documented through MIS,” the official said. The wildlife protection act states that the core or critical tiger habitat areas of national parks and sanctuaries are required to be kept inviolate for the purposes of tiger conservation, without affecting the rights of the Scheduled Tribes or such other forest dwellers, and notified as such by the state government in consultation with an expert committee constituted for the purpose. The state government after obtaining the consent of scheduled tribes and other forest dwellers inhabiting the area and in consultation with an independent ecological and social scientist familiar with the area has concluded that impact of people on wildlife in the core area is irreversible and reasonable coexistence is not possible, can recommend relocation of people from a tiger area under Project Tiger. According to NTCA’s protocol for voluntary village relocation from critical tiger habitats, a minimum inviolate area of 800-1200sq.km is required for a viable population of tiger (20 breeding tigresses). The environment ministry had come out with a consultation paper in October last year on amending the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, to bring significant changes to forest governance, including facilitating private plantations for harvesting. It also said that the ministry is considering introducing a provision in the forest conservation act to keep certain pristine forests “showcasing rich ecological values” intact for a specific period. “The environment minister has emphasized on the need for community participation in forest conservation. This idea can also be extended to the manner in which the information system on tiger reserves is being put together by the ministry. Both recognition of rights in tiger reserves and design of what is “voluntary” in a relocation process continues to be a highly contentious issue. Therefore, the management system should not only rely on government data to ascertain the nature and extent of compliance with the legal procedures. The process can gain significantly by on ground research and experiences that can be corroborated with government data,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-seeks-info-from-states-to-monitor-tiger-reserves-101642618703370.html
20-01-2022||India||Panel pitches full market nod for Covaxin, Covishield||The subject expert panel (SEC) of the national drugs regulator on Wednesday recommended full market authorisation for both Covaxin and Covishield under certain conditions, according to people familiar with the developments.These vaccines were till now approved for use under emergency circumstances – from a regulatory point of view, this referred to the pandemic – and full approvals typically take time. While the conditions laid down by the CDSCO subject expert committee were not immediately clear, full licensure often means that a product can be sold in regular market, although whether that happens during a pandemic and in the case of an essential biological remains to be seen.“SEC of CDSCO has recommended for upgrade of covishield and covaxin status from restricted use in emergency situations to grant of new drug permission with conditions In adult population, DCGI (Drugs Controller General of India) will evaluate the recommendations and give its decision,” Central Drug Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) tweeted from its handle.As per the process, the drugs controller general of India takes the final call on granting the approval based on the expert panel’s recommendations.Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech International Ltd, manufacturers of Covishield and Covaxin respectively, separately applied to the central drugs standard control organisation (CDSCO) to seek full market authorisation stating that more than a billion vaccine doses have been administered to beneficiaries under the national Covid-19 immunisation programme.Experts also that the government should consider granting full licensure now.“There is adequate data available now from the real-world also that has further established safety and efficacy; therefore, high-time that the vaccines should be given complete market authorization,” said Dileep Mavalankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health, GandhinagarAt least 1.37 billion doses of Covishield, and about 210 million Covaxin doses have been administered under the programme to date.Full market authorisation is granted when there is enough data to demonstrate that the vaccine is safe and effective for most people who receive it, while an emergency approval is often based on the premise that the benefits of using a product immediately outweigh its known harms.SII locally manufactures the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine under the brand name Covishield; and Covaxin has been developed and manufactured by Bharat Biotech International Ltd in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Medical Research (ICMR).Both the vaccines were granted approval for restricted use in emergency situation by the drugs controller general of India, VG Somani, on January 3, last year, and both the vaccines have been the mainstay of India’s covid immunisation programme.
20-01-2022||India||Cabinet extends tenure of National Commission for Safai Karamcharis till 2025||New Delhi: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the extension of the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis (NCSK) for three years with effect from April 1 this year. Announcing the decision, Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur said, “The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the extension of the tenure of the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis for three years from April 1, 2022. Now it will remain in effect till March 31, 2025.”Modi government is determined to work for the welfare of safai karamcharis, Thakur added.“The commission is responsible for giving recommendations to the government regarding specific programmes for welfare of safai karamcharis, study and evaluate the existing welfare programmes for safai karamcharis, investigate cases of specific grievances,” he said. The commission was established in 1993 as per the provisions of the NCSK Act till March 31, 1997. The validity of the Act was first extended for five years and then again for two years till February 29, 2004. Since then, the tenure of the commission has been extended as a non-statutory body under the ministry of social justice and empowerment. The tenure of the commission has been extended from time to time through government resolutions. The present tenure is valid till March 31, 2022.“The total implication of the extension for three years would be approximately ₹43.68 crore,” the government said in a statement.The major beneficiaries under the commission are the safai karamcharis and identified manual scavengers in the country. As per the government data, there were 58,098 manual scavengers in the country as on December 31 last year.“Though the government has taken many steps for the upliftment of the safai karamcharis, the deprivation suffered by them in socio-economic and educational terms is still far from being eliminated. Although manual scavenging has been almost eradicated, sporadic instances do occur. Hazardous cleaning of sewer/septic tanks continues to be an area of the highest priority for the government. Hence, the government feels that there is a continued need to monitor the various interventions and initiatives for welfare of safai karamcharis and to achieve the goal of complete mechanisation of sewer/septic tanks cleaning in the country and rehabilitation of manual scavengers,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-extends-tenure-of-national-commission-for-safai-karamcharis-till-2025-101642618404633.html
20-01-2022||India||ED completes raids on Channi’s nephew, Punjab CM launches attack||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) said on Wednesday that it seized ₹10 crore in cash from the premises of Bhupinder Singh, the nephew of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, and his business partner after raids in connection with illegal sand mining in the state. Channi, who is hoping to return to power after assembly elections next month, alleged that the raids, which began on Tuesday, were an attempt to frame him. ED officials said they seized a total of ₹10 crore from Bhupinder Singh and his partner, Sandeep Kumar, in addition to gold worth ₹21 lakh and a Rolex watch worth ₹12 lakh. The raids began on Tuesday when the ED searched 10 locations, including those linked to the CM’s nephew, in Chandigarh, Rupnagar, Ludhiana, Pathankot and Mohali. The agency’s probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) is based on a 2018 case registered by Punjab Police on illegal sand mining in the border state. The central agency lodged an ECIR (Enforcement Case Information Report) at its zonal office in Jalandhar in November last year after taking over the probe. Channi condemned the raids and called it an attempt to put pressure on him ahead of elections. Punjab goes to the polls on February 20. He said Bhupinder Singh was tortured by the agency as part of a conspiracy to target the Congress. “I have learnt that those who had come to interrogate talked about the PM’s visit, saying they will not let us file our nomination papers or contest the elections,” he added, referring to the security breach during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Punjab earlier this month. Calling the ED raids a “planted exercise”, Channi said his nephew was not even named in the 2018 FIR. “This is a conspiracy to trap me in this case. They are taking revenge because I stood with Punjab and people of Punjab during the Prime Minister’s visit to Ferozepur,” he said. ED officials said that Bhupinder Singh was a director in a firm set up by the main accused in the case, Kudrat Deep Singh. The ED is probing money-laundering charges against them as it suspects the proceeds from illegal sand mining was laundered through the company.The FIR names 26 accused, including Kudrat Deep Singh.The case was registered on the complaint of the Punjab mining department that found sand quarries being run without approval during its raids in 2018. The mining department impounded 30 vehicles and other machinery used for illegal mining. The FIR said the mining was done outside the designated area and the operators used forged slips not issued by the mining department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-completes-raids-on-channi-s-nephew-punjab-cm-launches-attack-101642618283408.html
20-01-2022||India||Arunachal teen abducted by China’s PLA: Officials||A 17-year-old resident of Arunachal Pradesh has allegedly been abducted by China’s Peoples’ Liberation Army (PLA) from the state’s Upper Siang district, officials aware of the matter said on Wednesday.The man identified as Miram Taron, a native of Zido village in Upper Siang district, was abducted on Tuesday by the PLA, said the police. The district authorities said the youth along with others were hunting in the border area between both countries when the incident took place.“The youth was among a group of local hunters. Other members of his group who were able to escape informed us that he was abducted by the PLA from the Indian side,” Shashvat Saurabh, deputy commissioner of Upper Siang, said.“As soon as we came to know of the matter, we informed the officials of the Indian Army that operate in the region. Continuous efforts are underway to rescue the youth at the earliest,” he added.Meanwhile, BJP MP from Arunachal-East, Tapir Gao, took to Twitter to highlight the incident and sought help from Indian agencies to step up the efforts for his early release.“Chinese PLA has abducted Miram Taron, 17 years, of Zido village yesterday January 18, 2022 from inside Indian territory, Lungta Jor area (China built 3-4 kms road inside India in 2018) under Siyungla area (Bishing village) of Upper Siang district (sic.),” the MP posted on his social media on Wednesday evening.“His friend escaped from PLA and reported to the authorities. All the agencies of Govt of India is requested to step up for his early release (sic.),” Gao added.This is not the first such incident. In September, 2020, five youths from Tagin tribe, who used to work as porters for Indian Army, had gone missing from Upper Subansiri district from the Indian side of the McMahon line, bifurcating Arunachal Pradesh and Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) of China.Following their disappearance, one of the abducted youth’s brother had posted on the social media about the ‘abduction’ by PLA. The same accusation was made by BJP MP Tapir Gao and Congress MLA from Pasighat Ninong Ering.It was later revealed that the youths had strayed across the border during an expedition to hunt and collect medicinal herbs. They were handed back to India after 10 days by the Chinese authorities.The Indian Army had informed then that it was the third such incident where youths from Arunachal Pradesh living near the Indo-China border had “strayed inadvertently to the other side of line of actual control (LAC)” during “adventurous forays”.
20-01-2022||India||Centre to rank states on rapid green nods||The Union environment ministry plans to rank states, specifically state environment impact assessment authorities (SEIAAs), on the speed with which they accord environmental clearances (EC) to development projects, a move that has drawn criticism from experts and activists who say this could result in more projects being cleared without proper due diligence.The criteria for the ranking was detailed in an office memorandum sent by the ministry to all SEIAAs on January 17, and HT has reviewed a copy of it. “It has been decided to incentivise the states through a star-rating system, based on efficiency and timeliness in grant of EC. This is intended as a mode of recognition and encouragement as well as for prompting improvements where needed,” it added. Such a ranking system, the memo said, was first tabled during a meeting chaired by the Cabinet Secretary on November 13 to discuss actions taken by the ministry to facilitate “ease of doing business”.As per the proposed ranking system, SEIAAs will be graded between 0 and 1 on five parameters, and 0 and 2 on one. These are: the average number of days taken by an SEIAA to accept proposals seeking either EC or terms of reference (ToR) for projects; the number of complaints addressed by the Authority; the percentage of cases for which site visits are carried out by either SEIAAs or state expert appraisal committees (SEACs); the percentage of cases in which the Authority seeks additional information from project proponents more than once; the disposal percentage of proposals seeking fresh or amended ToRs that are older than 30 days; and the disposal percentage of proposals seeking fresh or amended EC that are older than 120 days.While the parameters are fine, it is the way the scoring is to be done that is worrying. For example, if the SEIAA conducts site visits for more than 20% of the total cases placed before it for approval, it will receive 0 marks. However, if it conducts site visits for less than 10% percent of total cases considered, it will be awarded one mark. Similarly, if the SEIAA seeks essential details from project proponents more than once in above 30% of cases, it will receive 0 marks, but it will be awarded one mark if essential details are sought in less than 10% t of the cases. “This sets a dangerous precedent because it will clearly discourage authorities from carrying out site visits to gauge whether environment impact assessments have been properly carried out,” said Stalin D, environmentalist and director of Mumbai-based NGO Vanashakti.Sujit Kumar Bajpayee, joint secretary, MoEFCC directed queries to the environment ministry’s media cell, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The one parameter on which the SEIAA will be awarded up to 2 points is the average number of days taken by it to accord EC for projects. Should a particular SEIAA take less than an average of 80 days to grant EC to all projects considered, it will be awarded two marks. If the time frame exceeds more than 120 days, it gets 0. States which collect between 7-8 marks as part of this system will be given a five star rating, while states that collect less than 3 marks will be given a zero star rating. These ratings will be updated twice annually, on the basis of the SEIAA’s functioning during a six-month period.Environment lawyer Ritwick Dutta remarked that the plan runs counter to the environment ministry’s statutory duties. “Ease of doing business cannot be the yardstick by which the environment ministry, or environment departments at the state level, are judged. Their job is to protect the environment, not make things easier for industries. Such a ratings system has no place in the application of the precautionary principle, which takes time. The ministry is undermining its own safeguards and weakening the authority of the SEIAAs by imposing time limits on their functioning. This rating system is the equivalent of judging teachers for how well their students are able to cheat in an examination, or judging policemen on how efficiently they allow criminal activity to continue because it is good for business.”If an environment clearance is not accorded to a project within 80 days, Dutta explained, it is likely to be because the proposal lacks adequate data. “For instance, there might be serious gaps in a particular proposal’s EIA report. An SEIAA should be rightfully concerned about these, and it is within its power to seek clarity from the proponent. This is of course good for the environment, but bad for business, and so now regulatory agencies will be judged for subverting their own responsibilities.”Dutta added that this rating system is in violation of both the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 as well as the Constitutional responsibility of the Central Government to protect the environment. “A perusal of the Criteria reveals that greater weightage is given for projects where due diligence is less. Thus, if the SEIAA members conduct ‘site visits’ to ascertain the local conditions and ecology, marks are attributed for the same – and ironically the more the members visit the field to see the ecology less marks they get... The aim is clear, SEIAA members should sit in the confines of conference rooms and take decisions and earn high marks. This process will ensure that SEIAA’s aim will be to clear projects at the shortest possible time. It is pertinent to point out that the task of SEIAA under the EIA Notification is to undertake a ‘detailed scrutiny’ of the EIA Report and all other relevant information including minutes of the public hearing. Such ‘detailed scrutiny’ takes time. Besides, the SEIAA also has the right to reject projects – something that the OM has been silent on.”Experts also said that such a rating system stands to reduce the SEIAA to a ‘rubber stamps authority’ where there performance will be judged by the speed with which they facilitate environmental degradation and jeopardising of community livelihoods. “This Office Memorandum in contrary to the environmental rule of law; violates article 21 and is an arbitrary exercise of power to benefit only business at the cost of environment and people. At a time when India has the world’s worst air and water quality, this office memorandum will, if applied, reduce environmental law compliance to a mere formality. It needs immediate withdrawal,” Dutta said.This view was echoed by other experts. Kanchi Kohli, a researcher with the think tank Centre for Policy Research, claimed that such a move will severely constrain the mandate of the SEIAAs under the Environment Protection Act and the Environment Impact Assessment notification. “These authorities are meant to uphold environmental protection. If the Centre wants to assess the performance of SEIAAs, the criteria for the same should step from this mandate, which is drawn from Section 3(3) of the Environment Protection Act. This ratings system could lead to a further dilution in the quality of environment impact assessments and it only demonises the regulatory process, whereas it is the state of the economy at large which has arrested the growth of business. It’s not like such a move will suddenly allow projects to start taking off.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-rank-states-on-rapid-green-nods-101642618107029.html
20-01-2022||India||Variant watch: Why symptom link is key to Omicron||Why does the Omicron variant of Sars-CoV-2 spread significantly more readily than other variants of the coronavirus?For weeks now, it was thought to be the intrinsic traits scientists discovered when they tested the virus on human (or human-like) tissues. They found the variant multiplied significantly faster in upper air passages, thriving in parts of the body where, it was assumed, the virus was better placed to be exhaled or coughed out. Once it’s in the air, and makes it way to another host, its superior ability to latch on to cells – also demonstrated in the lab – gives it greater advantage.But two new studies now call into question whether these factors are indeed the reason for Omicron’s rapid spread.The first, by researchers from Harvard’s TH Chan School of Public Health, analysed the results of routine testing on National Basketball Association (NBA) staff between July 5, 2021 and January 10, 2022 – a period when Delta and Omicron outbreaks affected these people. Using the cycle threshold (CT) values from the tests and contact tracing, they found that the peak viral load in people who contracted Omicron was lower than those who had a Delta variant infection and that the rate at which the virus was cleared out from the nose and throat was quicker in the case of the newer VOC (variant of concern).Also read | Omicron variant poses limited downside to Indian economy: EconomistsViral load is often seen as a proxy for how infectious someone is.“…These results suggest that Omicron’s infectiousness may not be explained by higher viral load measured in the nose and mouth by RT-PCR,” they said in their pre-print study, which is yet to be peer-reviewed. But there are two caveats that apply here.First, as the authors note, it is unclear what role immunity difference between these two periods may have played; it could be that the people tested simply had more immune defences, as a result of prior exposure or vaccination, or both.Second, RT-PCR CT values are not a perfect measure of infectiousness.A second study offers a new explanation for why Omicron might spread so rapidly: It is more likely to lead to asymptomatic infection, thereby many are spreading it without knowing, the study reasons. Conducted by a team led by researchers from University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, the study found that there were far higher numbers of asymptomatic Covid-19 in case of Omicron infections than the other variants.The study was based on the mandatory testing of all people who came to get their vaccine doses. None of these people showed symptoms. The researchers found that during the Omicron wave, close to 30% of the people who turned up had an asymptomatic infection. In contrast, during the Beta and Delta wave, only 2.6% of the asymptomatic people who were tested were found infected.“These findings strongly suggest that Omicron has a much higher rate of asymptomatic carriage than other VOCs and this high prevalence of asymptomatic infection is likely a major factor in the widespread, rapid dissemination of the variant globally, even among populations with high prior rates of Sars-CoV-2 infection,” the authors added.
20-01-2022||India||Bracing for crude oil above $100 in a demand deficient economy||On January 17, the price of India’s crude oil basket (COB) was at $85.6 per barrel; that number is higher than the monthly average COB since September 2014.Brent crude prices – it is the international benchmark for crude oil prices in the world – breached the $87 level on January 18, touching the highest point since 2014. Goldman Sachs expects crude prices to breach the psychological barrier of $100 per barrel in the third quarter, Bloomberg News reported.These developments will be watched with concern in both the finance ministry and RBI. The former must be busy giving final touches to the 2022-23 Union Budget and the latter will see Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members huddling together a week after the Budget has been presented.Oil prices have been higher in the past, but the current rally might be here to stay.If crude oil were to breach the $100 barrier – such forecasts have been made earlier too and have not materialized – it will not be a first. India’s average COB price was above $100 for three years beginning 2011-12.While the latest oil price spike has been driven partly by growing unrest in west Asia, an important oil producing region, there are reasons to believe that oil prices will stay elevated in the near future.“Energy investment is running at half the level needed to meet the ambition to reach net zero by 2050. Spending on renewables needs to rise. And the supply and demand of dirty fossil fuels needs to be wound down in tandem…But legal threats, investor pressure and fear of regulations have led investment in fossil fuels to slump by 40% since 2015”, The Economist wrote in October 2021. This is not good news for a country such as India.Also read | Chinese reliance on Middle East oil increases: ReportWhat does a crude price shock mean for India?A January 2019 Mint Street memo published by RBI summarized the effect of a rise in crude oil prices for India. “We find that if a crude price shock hits the Indian economy, the CAD (current account deficit) to GDP ratio will rise sharply irrespective of a higher GDP growth; and a $10/barrel increase in oil price will raise inflation by roughly 49 basis points (bps) or increase the fiscal deficit by 43 bps (as a percentage of GDP) if the government decides to absorb the entire oil price shock rather than passing it to the end users”, the authors said in the memo. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.The high oil-price phase a decade ago was also a period of considerable economic pain the country with inflation reaching very high levels, growth slowing, and the external balance becoming precarious.Elections have offered a temporary cushion against rise in crude pricesFuel prices are also a politically sensitive matter. The biggest proof of this fact is that the otherwise deregulated pricing regime is always suspended when an election is around the corner. For example, petrol-diesel prices have not been changed since December 2, 2021 even though crude prices have increased significantly;from $70.56 to $87.51 per barrel, during this period. To be sure, diesel prices have remained unchanged from November 4, 2021 onwards which is when the union government announced a reduction in union excise duty on fuels. Petrol prices fell further on December 2 when the Delhi government slashed its value added tax (VAT) on petrol. Elections to assemblies in five states are scheduled between February 10 and March 7.If the Budget does not bring down taxes on petrol-diesel and crude oil does cross the $100 barrier, fuel prices will be significantly higher than what they were when crude was above $100 a decade ago. This is because taxes on petrol-diesel are significantly higher today. This will generate additional tailwinds for inflation.The difference between current and previous episodes of high inflationA higher retail price of petrol-diesel due to higher tax component is not the only difference between the economic situation now and what existed a decade ago. An even bigger difference is the state of capacity utilisation or ability of the economy’s installed production capacity to cater to demand in the short run. In the long run investment can always increase the production capacity of an economy.A comparison of GDP deflator – it is the difference between nominal and real GDP growth and a holistic measure of inflation for the economy and not just households which is what the Consumer Price Index measures – and levels of capacity utilisation from RBI’s quarterly order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS) captures this clearly. The high inflation phase (as seen in the GDP deflator) in the last decade was accompanied by very high levels of capacity utilisation – it was never below 75% -- whereas the recent rise in the GDP deflator’s value has come along with capacity utilisation rates which are much lower. “Recent trends in domestic goods demand show that, after reaching pre-pandemic levels, it (capacity utilisation) has stagnated. The Production Linked Incentive scheme was meant to enable firms to cater to global demand, but rising import tariffs are coming in the way”, HSBC India Chief Economist Pranjul Bahndari said in a research note dated January 18.What should be the policy response?Should RBI then raise interest rates – most private analysts expect it will this year – at a time when aggregate demand is lacking, and may dip more with higher borrowing costs? This is a question which lies at the core of India’s economic policy regime. In the normal course, it is monetary policy which is tasked with maintaining a balance between growth and inflation. There is now growing consensus that it is fiscal policy which should play a more proactive role at the moment.“For much of the pandemic, fiscal and monetary policy have actively complemented each other to help mitigate the growth damage from COVID. But in the third year of the pandemic, with inflation remaining above 5%, inflation expectations hardening by 200 bps over the last 18 months, and the current account deficit widening to the 2% handle, policy support will have to start becoming selective, with fiscal and monetary slowly having to evolve from complements to substitutes”, Sajjid Chinoy J.P. Morgan’s Chief India Economist wrote in a note issued earlier this month, calling for a tightening of monetary policy but a gradual fiscal consolidation path in the Budget.
20-01-2022||India||Amid lockdown, digital divide left migrants’ kids out in the cold||In May 2020, Sushma, 13, the daughter of migrant labourers, was a Class 8 student in a government school in Narela, Delhi. As India imposed a harsh lockdown in the wake of the first wave of Covid 19, her parents found themselves with no source of income.The month that followed was hard. For days, Sushma, her parents and two younger siblings lugged around everything they owned, struggling to find a way home to Medinipur in West Bengal, where at the very least, there would the solace of a roof above their heads, and no rent to pay. That wasn’t easy. Then, around the end of April came news of special trains for registered migrant workers.For four days, the family of five sat outside registration centres for migrant workers such as them, braving the heat, hunger, thirst and never ending queues. By the third night, they had run out of food, and began to live on the largesse of relief workers. At night, they lived under a flyover. Then finally, on the fifth day, as the pandemic raged, the family was on a packed shramik train heading back to Bengal. It was early May.The story of Sushma and her family was not uncommon in 2020. For days after India went into complete lockdown, India’s migrants were on the roads, walking, jostling into trucks and buses, struggling to return to their villages with their lives in the big city completely upended. Along with them, went their children, sitting on their parents shoulders, or if they were a little older, carrying luggage disconsolately. It was the beginning of what has been almost two years of a life that has been stop-start — going back to the villages, then returning, and in many cases, after the second wave, going back again.Also read | Why lockdowns won’t work in the current waveFor children such as Sushma, it has meant one other, very significant thing. For long stretches, they were not in school.Sushma’s parents lived in a rented one-room tenement in Narela, and both worked at a shoe factory nearby. They left in May, but were back in Delhi by September, as industries began to restart gingerly. In those four months in Medinipur, the 13-year old had no access to a smartphone. The family didn’t own one. “Someone donated us a mobile phone in November but by then the teachers had completed a large part of the syllabus. It was incredibly difficult to catch up with my peers,” she said.There was one smartphone between three children; her two younger siblings are in classes 5 and 6. But in the blink of an eye, the family was uprooted again. Their factory shut again in April 2021, as the second wave spread. They left again and only returned to Delhi in September 2021. But even if Sushma had a smartphone this time, she still couldn’t study. With no income, paying for a data package was a luxury beyond her parents.In the fourth part of this series on how the pandemic affected schools and India’s children, HT looks at the effects of the migrant crisis. How on the margins of India’s metropolises, as the medium of education shifted online, the children of the urban poor were left behind.Displaced and disconnectedIn its report titled “Impact of Covid 19 on Rising Unemployment and Loss of Jobs/Livelihoods in Organised and Unorganised Sectors”, the parliamentary standing committee on labour said in August 2021 that as many as 1,14,30,968 migrant workers returned to their home states in the first wave of the Covid 19 lockdown between March and May 2020. The states which saw the highest volume of returning migrants were Uttar Pradesh(32,49,638), Bihar (15,00,612) and West Bengal (13,84,693). During the second wave, the report said, enforced between April 2021 and May 2021, 5,15,363 migrant workers returned to their home states.A 2021 United Nations (UN) report said that migrants and displaced children would be disproportionately affected and suffer long after the public health crisis ended. “For many learners living in displacement, their education will now be more limited or disappear completely,” it predicted. In India, that has not been far from the truth.Aman Singh, 16, a Class 11 student at the government boys senior secondary school in Dallupura, said he had sleepless nights last year thinking about his Class 10 board exams. “I was promoted to class 10 during the first lockdown. Even before I could start my studies, my family had to return to our village in Almora.My father, who worked as a driver in a transport company, hoped that my younger sister and I could stay in Delhi and focus on studies. But we exhausted all our savings within two months of the lockdown and had to return to our village in May leaving my entire life behind,” he said.Singh’s village of Baliya is in the Uttarakhand mountains and even if there was a smartphone, the terrain doesn’t boast good connectivity. “I resumed my studies only after we returned to Delhi in November 2020. I was so happy when Class 10 board exams were cancelled in 2021 because I was not prepared at all. But studies are still a struggle, because my concepts are not clear despite now, in Class 11,” Singh said.According to the data collected by the Union education ministry from 24 states and Union Territories (UTs) until June, 29 million school students did not have access to digital devices. In cities such as Delhi, the urban poor are particularly affected.The family of Ehtasham Alam, a Class 7 student at the Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Burari for instance has never owned a smartphone. His father, a daily wage labourer earned just enough to feed his family of five, Ehtasham being the eldest of three siblings. There was never room for luxury, and until May 2020, a smartphone was just that. In May 2020, the family returned to their village in Bihar’s Siwan. “It was impossible for us to buy a phone for our children at a time when we were even struggling to arrange food and water. We returned to our village in May and it was difficult to convince our children that things would go back to normal. I cannot forget the days when my children slept on an empty stomach. Who will think about studies in a situation like that?” asked Afsana Khatoon, Alam’s mother.The family returned to Delhi after more than a year in June 2021. “But the children have lost interest in studies after spending more than a year being completely out of contact with their teachers. It will take a lot of time to bring them back on track,” she added.Sonal Kapoor, founder of Protsahan India Foundation, a Delhi-based Child Rights NGO, said that Covid-19 has uprooted children from spaces where they generally used to find their sense of belonging, joy and sense of safety. “Thousands of children faced severe deprivation of core basic rights, due to severe income losses in their families. They witnessed circumstances where survival became the priority and everything else, including education, took a backseat.”Over the past 20 months, states and UTs have reopened schools and then shut them down again, with waves of the pandemic rising and ebbing. For instance, in Delhi, schools were reopened partially in January and February 2021 after almost 10 months of being closed. However, as the second wave of pandemic shook the country in April, the Delhi government again shut schools that month. In September, the state government again reopened schools for classes 9 to 12 and in November for all other classes. Within weeks, the schools again shut down due to the rising pollution levels and now due to the increasing cases of the Omicron variant of covid-19.Teachers said that this discontinuity has affected marginalised children the most, exacerbated by migration. “A majority of these students were completely out of contact with their teachers due to the lack of smartphones. Those, who were living in Delhi amid the lockdown, were at least getting hardcopies of worksheets and notes from their schools. But for those who had returned to their villages in the hinterland, this option didn’t exist. This made the situation more difficult specifically for children who were already deprived,” said Arvind Kumar Jha, a mathematics teacher at a government school in Jhilmil Colony.Jha added: “When schools were briefly reopened last November, I noticed that some of my students, all migrant kids, had completely lost the habit of writing. They had forgotten basic spelling and pronunciation. It showed that they had been r completely disconnected from studies for months. These kids did not have anyone at home to help them with studies.”According to a survey report released by the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) in September, 15% more migrant parents and 9% more ST (Scheduled Tribe) parents reported that their children were learning less than before.Way aheadAddressing the educational issues of children such as the ones Jha is talking about will take some doing. Gargi Kapoor, national manager (mission education) Smile Foundation, said all stakeholders including the government, civil society organisations and communities will have to come together to discuss and bridge the gap.In January 2021, the Union Ministry of Education issued guidelines for the “identification, admission and continued education” of migrant children in India, tominimise the impact of pandemic on school education in the country. The ministry asked all states and Union Territories to identify such kids and ensure they attend schools. Officials at the Delhi government’s education department said that several steps have been taken to ensure that every child returns to school including door-to–door campaigns, and mailing letters and learning material to the students who left Delhi during successive lockdowns. “The government will also come up with a 100-day plan to bridge the learning gap among students. It will be implemented once schools reopen again and special attention will be given to each and every student,” said a senior official at the department who asked not to be named.Educationist Meeta Sengupta said that such “bridge courses” must be designed to mitigate learning loss among marginalised children. “Migrant children live in a state of constant learning loss and catch-up programs being designed for pandemic learning loss should be made a regular part of the academic year to ensure support. The double whammy of the pandemic and migrant movement hurt these children the most and makes them vulnerable to exploitation if we do not do more. This means community learning mechanisms, creating multiple support hubs with para teachers mentored by seniors, teaching vans and similar schemes that take learning to the children wherever they are.”As Omicron looms over the national capital, physical classes in schools were shut again in late December with little clarity on when they will reopen. In her one room home in Narela, for Sushma that means a return to online study, the battle over the family’s one smartphone with her two siblings, and the fear of harsher lockdown restrictions which will impact their livelihood. “I was heartbroken when schools were closed again. It has become a never ending cycle. All day, the three of us stay home and fight over the use of the phone. But I don’t want to go back to the village. That I am clear about,” the 13 year old said.In Burari, Ehtesham Alam’s mother fears Omicron because she fears another lockdown. She knows that the choice to stay in the big city, or return to the village is out of her hands. She also knows the costs that come attached for her son, with very little escape. “Till there is work, we will stay. When if our jobs are stolen, no option exists. I know the children are exhausted. And I am afraid that if it continues like this, they may lose education forever.”
20-01-2022||India||Over 50% eligible kids get jabs in two weeks||More than half of the estimated 74 million children in the 15-18 age group have now received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to government data on Wednesday, with officials now expressing optimism that by next month, “most eligible children, if not all” will be covered.Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the milestone as encouraging news and Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said it marked a big day for India’s fight against Covid-19.“Young and youthful India showing the way! This is encouraging news. Let us keep the momentum. It is important to vaccinate and observe all COVID-19 related protocols. Together, we will fight this pandemic,” Modi said in a tweet from his account, responding to an earlier tweet by Mandaviya.Data analysed by HT showed that while the pace has been impressive, especially in the first four days after the vaccination was opened for this age group, there has been a significant slowdown recently.This is not unusual, to be sure, since the launch of a new phase of vaccination is when most enthusiastic uptake typically happens. But it means that if the first half were covered in 16 days, it does not mean the next half will take the same amount of time.At its peak, between January 3 and 6, on average 5.67% of the eligible population took doses every day – at that rate, the full cohort should have been covered in 13-14 days. But the rate has slowed, and in the last five days, this pace was 1.58% a day.Encouragingly, however, at least half of the population will now be fully vaccinated by mid-February, in time for what is typically the examination season in the country. This is because these children right now are being administered Covaxin, the full course of which is given at a gap of 4-6 weeks.“The response has been excellent in children; and by next month we would hopefully have covered most eligible children with first dose, or probably all,” said a senior official in the health ministry, asking not to be named.Experts too said the response has been good.“The response has been good from Day 1. It could also do with the fact that the numbers (of infection) suddenly started to rise again and it probably brought people out of their comfort zone that many were in. We should see further rise in vaccination numbers in coming weeks,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, senior paediatrician, and group medical director, Apollo Hospitals.But, seeing the drop-off, the next half might need more convincing and the government will need to keep a watch for vaccine hesitancy. “When it comes to immunisation, last mile of the target is always the most difficult to achieve. People who come forward first are usually the vaccine eager ones, and once that rush settles down then comes those that could be hesitant and may not readily come forward,” said Dileep Mavalankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar.The response has also not been uniform across the country, with some states reporting as high as 90.6% (Andhra Pradesh) coverage of their eligible adolescent population while others showing as low as 9% (Punjab). Punjab, however, is very distant outlier at the bottom. No other state for which population projections are available has vaccinated less than a quarter of the 15-18 age group.Of the 23 states for which population estimates are available (north-eastern states other than Assam are clubbed together in these estimates), 16 have vaccinated at least half of their eligible teenagers, with 10 of them having covered 50%-60%.Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra – where the 15-18 population is the highest and the third highest in the country – have also vaccinated around 45% of the age group, suggesting that a large teenage population is not necessarily a roadblock to coverage.The decision to open up vaccination among children was precautionary, people familiar with the matter told HT. “The disease does not take severe form in most children but this is the most vulnerable group as it moves around much, which is why this group was chosen first,” said an official in the drugs controller’s office, on condition of anonymity.A second key factor is that children in these age groups have social contact patterns similar to adults. “This is largely the age in which children socially interact. It has been seen that adolescents largely behave like adults,” Dr NK Arora, chair, Covid-19 working group of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisations, said when the decision was announced.Expanding vaccination coverage to this age cohort also reduces the risk of infections among more vulnerable family members, a second expert added.“Children may show mild symptoms largely but they can bring infection home and elders and sick family members could be at risk. It was a good idea to open up vaccination for children,” said Dr JS Bhasin, director and head, department of paediatrics, BLK Hospital.
20-01-2022||India||BJP ties up with Apna Dal, Nishad Party in UP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday announced that it will contest all 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh “jointly” with its allies the Apna Dal and Nishad Party. The BJP also used the occasion to burnish its pro-Other Backward Classes (OBC) credentials; both the Apna Dal and the Nishad Party are built around a core OBC base. .Announcing the decision, BJP president JP Nadda said the party will contest with its “NDA partners just as it has done for the Lok Sabha elections”.While he did not specify the details of the seat-sharing agreement between the allies, Nadda said discussions on how elections would be fought and won were carried out without rancour.Anupriya Patel of the Apna Dal and Sanjay Nishad of the Nishad Party, who were present, spoke about the steps taken by the BJP governments at the Centre and in the state for the empowerment and uplift of the socially and economic marginalised communities.The party has been on an overdrive to dispel perceptions that its social engineering model built around support of non-dominant OBCs has come undone following the exit of three OBC ministers and several legislators over the past week.Uttar Pradesh goes to the polls in seven phases starting February 10 and ending March 7. Votes will be counted on March 10.The party is also tight-lipped about why it chose not to include the Janata Dal (United) in the coalition. The BJP and the JDU run a coalition government in Bihar but have chosen to contest elections separately in UP. “There was no word from the BJP on seat sharing so we chose to go alone. But the BJP must answer why it did not take along an ally that is also essentially an OBC party. Bihar CM Nitish Kumar being a Kurmi (OBC) would have added to the party’s pro-OBC claims,” a JDU leader said on condition of anonymity.A BJP leader in Delhi declined comment on the issue.Referring to the achievements of the BJP government in the state, Nadda said: “We have seen how the double engine government has given momentum to development in the state. When we say double engine, it means support from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and implementation of the work by chief minister Yogi Adityanath that has helped us bring change on the ground. We have seen a new picture of development emerge.”Nadda counted improved road and highway connectivity, and better education and social indicators, as examples of UP’s development. He said that unlike in the past, people do not migrate from the state anymore and UP has emerged as an “investment destination.”“Women and youth have been at the focus (of our policies). As far as law and order is concerned, we’ve seen it has vastly improved. When we see the scenario five years ago, there was migration, life came to a standstill post 7 pm., and there was a nexus between the government and the mafia. Today there is rule of law,” Nadda said.Patel, for her part, said the alliance government led to a mix of development and social justice. The Apna Dal has significant support among the OBC Kurmi community.Referring to the government’s pro-OBC policies she said it was the BJP that gave constitutional status to the OBC commission; made provisions for OBC reservation in NEET, and in government run Navodya and Sainik Schools.Patel , who is part of the Union cabinet, also expressed hope that the alliance will address pending issues such as her party’s demand for a separate ministry for OBCs.Nishad credited the BJP government for empowering the socially and economically marginalised and the fishermen’s community that he comes from. “Whatever the BJP says, it fulfils sooner than later whether it was abrogation of article 370 of the construction of Ram Mandir,” he said. He also added that the discussion with the BJP was on how to wining the elections and not seat sharing.While the official seat sharing announcement is awaited, people familiar with development said the two parties are likely to get more seats in proportion to their existing legislators and more than the last election.In 2017 the Apna Dal was an ally of the BJP and contested 11 seats, winning 9. The BJP’s other ally, the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, which contested 8 seats and won 4 has since left the alliance and joined hands with the SP. The Nishad Party fought the 2017 elections alone and joined the National Democratic Alliance in 2019.
20-01-2022||India||Explained: US 5G issue and its implication for India’s carriers||Air India announced it was cancelling some of its most popular direct flights to and from cities in the United States and some of the aviation sector’s biggest names globally have sounded alarm at the expansion of 5G mobile services in American cities.The threat stems from the risk these airwaves pose to aircraft instruments, impacting at least some commonly used jets like the Boeing 777, which will need to undergo retrofitting to avoid the issue. The issue is unlikely to be a problem in Europe and Japan, where there have been enough changes in 5G deployment to ensure there is no interference, or in India , where the frequency band is different.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation in India said on Wednesday the issue is challenging for all stakeholders, and Boeing and Airbus last month warned that US operators alone could face revenue losses of up to $2 billion. US telecom majors AT&T and Verizon on Tuesday announced they were postponing activating 5G networks near airports for the time being.HT takes a look at the issues involved, the implications for India’s carriers and the country’s own plans for the 5G upgrade.Instrument interference riskAt the heart of the issue is the frequency at which the US telecom operators will run their 5G networks. AT&T and Verizon use the 3,700megahertz (mhz) and 3,980mhz frequencies in what is known as the C bband.The concern of the aviation industry is that this frequency band is very close to the 4,200 MHz – 4,400 MHz (4.2GHz to 4.4GHz) frequency that aircraft use for equipment and communications -- particularly in a device known as radar altimeters. “5G interference could adversely affect the ability of aircraft to safely operate,” wrote Dave Calhoun, CEO of Boeing and Jeffrey Knittel, CEO of Airbus, in a joint letter to the US Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, in December.Radio altimeters are critical for low-visibility landing, such as during spells of fog or heavy rain. They minimise the risk of accidents or collisions by accurate readings of the proximity to the ground.Arun Kumar, director general of DGCA said: “It (rolling out of 5G communications in the US) is challenging for all concerned. We hope some amicable resolution takes shape sooner than later.”Is India’s 5G plan also at risk?Several telecom companies, Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vi, are expected roll out 5G services later in 2022. “In the post-pandemic world, connectivity is an important issue and a bigger asset for the economy. It is essential that the country has the required spectrum to meet the escalating demands for wireless connectivity as they will form an integral part of the growth of the nation,” said Lt Gen Dr SP Kochhar, director general, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI).At this time, India’s plans are unlikely to be affected because the band of radiowaves Indian telecom operators will use are further from the American C band, meaning there will be a large buffer to avoid interference.“It has been decided by the government that spectrum in the frequency range 3,300-3,670 MHz should be made available to telecom service providers for international mobile telecommunications (IMT) and 5G,” said the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) in the latest consultation paper.“In general, we believe this will be the starting point (mid-band spectrum) since it offers good 5G performance, though lower than high-band spectrum,” said Sriram Rupanagunta, co-founder and senior vice president of Aarna Networks, a company that has expertise in private 5G networks.Rupanagunta added that several countries use 5G without such concerns and there are ways to address risks, such as by “reducing the power of the networks near the airports.”.The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) and Air India did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vi declined to comment, indicating that the COAI is the authorised body for dealing with these concerns.Approach by other countriesThe 5G implementation, including power levels of transmitters, frequencies, and proximity to flight operations have varied according to local guidelines, and there are differences with how more than 20 European Union countries have deployed 5G wireless transmitters near airports, compared with the US.“Multiple countries around the world are deploying C-Band 5G in a way that has much less risk of interference with radar altimeters. The reasons include the fact that other countries are using reduced power-level limits or increasing the frequency spectrum spacing between 5G and radar altimeters,” said Captain Joseph DePete, president of the Air Line Pilots Association International (ALPA), in a statement.Three main elements stand out. The transmitters (in Europe) have power capped at 613-watts, whereas rules in the US allow these to transmit at 1,585-watts—that’s two and a half times more. Second, transmitter deployment must give airports a buffer zone of 96 seconds of flight time, landing or take off. In the US, temporary guidelines factor in about 20 seconds as buffer.“In France, the government required that antenna must be tilted downward to limit harmful interference. Similar restrictions do not apply to the US deployment,” the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has noted.Similar guidelines for 5G networks in India, are yet to be finalised.CTIA, or Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, in its latest report points out that Japan has deployed 5G base stations up to 4100 MHz, with no interference with aviation services in the country. That means just a 100 MHz buffer zone.“ ACMA considers that a 200 MHz guard band between WBB and radio altimeters is sufficient,” noted the Australian Communication and Media Authority in the latest guidelines for the use of the 3,700 MHz to 4,200 MHz band for 5G services.Wide disruptions feared at presentAccording to FAA, there are 137 aircraft in the United States and 1,010 worldwide that still stand to be affected due to the risk of the frequency overlap, and will require either retrofitting or the use of alternative methods during low visibility landing.An initial delay of the 5G roll-out, FAA said on January 3, allowed the aviation community and wireless companies to reduce the risk of delays and cancellations by getting more data, and identifying the nature of devices than can remain effective.Since last week, FAA began issuing restrictions that airlines and other aircraft operators will face at many airports with the launch of new 5G wireless service. “Aircraft with untested altimeters or that need retrofitting or replacement will be unable to perform low-visibility landings where 5G is deployed,” the agency had said in a statement.FAA, on January 16, cleared around 45% of the US commercial fleet to perform low-visibility landings at many of the airports where 5G C-band will be deployed. The agency also approved two radio altimeter models that are installed in a wide variety of Boeing and Airbus planes.The airplane models approved include some Boeing 737, 747, 757, 767, MD-10/-11s and Airbus A310, A319, A320, A321, A330 and A350s.Aviation safety expert Mohan Ranganathan said the situation was “definitely a threat to the aircraft but only when one uses any procedure or any equipment that involves the use of a radio altimeter”.“However, CAT I (category I) on the instrument landing system (ILS) or LNAV (lateral navigation) and VNAV (vertical navigation) approach, which is satellite based and doesn’t use radio altimeter to determine height, is not affected,” he added. .“By doing this (using these methods), they don’t have to cancel flights unless the weather conditions at the destination airport are bad. There is no need to panic,” Ranganathan said.“Unfortunately, DGCA has not really implemented a procedure for LNAV and VNAV use in India, unlike other parts of the world, hence we do not have satellite based approaches,” he added.The way forward: Frequency and equipment testingThe advantage that telecom players in India will have is the much wider buffer gap (around 530 MHz) between the highest range of the commercial C-Band for 5G and the lowest range of the C-Band used by aviation equipment. The other categories, which is low band 5G and mmWave networks, don’t at all interfere with aviation frequencies.It is expected that India will likely open mmWave frequencies at a later time for 5G networks, but not in the first phase of the rollout..
20-01-2022||India||Covid hospitalisations drop in Mumbai, Delhi’s plateau||In the ongoing third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, Mumbai seems to have gotten over the worst with hospitalisation numbers steadily dropping by the day, and Delhi seems to be getting there, with hospitalisation numbers plateauing.The two cities that were earliest urban hot spots of the Omicron wave, but in recent days, they have seen their case trajectories start to dip. And despite the reputation of Omicron causing relatively milder infections, both cities saw a spike in absolute number of hospitalisations, although those numbers have now declined in Mumbai and seem set to in Delhi too.Also read | Delhi reports 13,785 Covid cases, positivity rate at 23.86%In Mumbai, the seven-day average of daily infections was 8,816 cases a day for the week ended Wednesday – a drop of 50% from the peak of 17,523 average cases a day for the week leading to January 12. In Delhi, this peak came three days later, as average daily cases soared to 23,529 for the week ended January 15. Since then, this number has dropped 21%, with 18,607 new infections reported for the week ended Wednesday.From 1,874 beds occupied in Mumbai on December 30 (the earliest that this data is available), hospitalisation soared to 7,432 Covid patients admitted to hospitals on January 9, according to data released by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Since then, however, this number has dropped nearly every single day. As on Wednesday, only 5,058 beds are occupied by Covid patients in the city’s hospitals – a drop of 32% in 10 days.Also read | Maharashtra sees a spike over 4,000 Covid-19 cases, Mumbai records marginal dipIn Delhi, meanwhile, early signs of a peak in hospitalisations have started to emerge with the number of occupied beds stabilising. On Tuesday, the number of patients hospitalised with Covid dropped for the first time since the start of the Omicron wave -- from 2,784 (the highest so far in the latest wave) on Monday to 2,730 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, this saw a marginal increase to 2,734. And because the city’s peak came a few days after Mumbai’s , this number appears set to improve in the coming days.To be sure, hospitalisations in the Omicron surge still remained a fraction of what has been seen in previous waves.Further, neither of the cities ever looked like they were on the cusp of facing a crisis at the hospital level. Despite the rapid rise in daily infections (and even hospitalisations), authorities were able to add hospital beds in order to create a comfortable cushion of available beds.In Mumbai, on December 30 (the earliest that this data is made available by the BMC) there were 24,195 vacant beds in the city – the lowest this number has touched. In the three weeks since, this has consistently been improving. As on January 19, there are 33,051 beds available for Covid patients in the city – 37% more than the respective figure three weeks ago. In fact, bed availability in the city never dropped below the 25,000-mark.It is a similar story in Delhi. There were 8,646 beds available in the city on December 30, according to the Delhi government’s health bulletin. In the three weeks since, this number has swelled 49% and stands at 12,869 on January 19.And even in terms of the proportion of overall bed availability occupied, even as cases picked up in the two cities in the Omicron wave, they always had at least around 80% of beds available at all times. Bed occupancy peaked at 21.4% in Mumbai on January 8 when 7,234 of the 33,803 hospital beds available in the city were occupied. In the 11 days since, this number has now dropped every single day (see chart). In Delhi, the highest proportion of beds occupied was on January 17 when 18% of the city’s 15,505 available beds had patients.This meant that throughout the surge in cases, the two cities had a large enough safety net in place to deal with hospitalisation rates several times the worst they have faced so far.“We are in the third week of the third wave, and we had anticipated the trends that we are seeing now,” said Mumbai’s additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “We recorded a higher number of cases during the first two weeks. The cases went down in the third week, but we had anticipated that a small number of people who will progress to severe disease will require ICU or ventilator care,” he said.A senior official of Delhi government’s health department said that while hospitalisations in the city have stabilised over the last four days, it is still too soon to confirm at a downward trend. “The hospital admissions have stabilised but we are yet to see a visible declining trend. However, since the hospitalisations were lower even during peak infection period in Delhi, it is a promising position.”Experts said that the number of people requiring hospital admission has been consistently low in recent weeks.“Patients are turning afebrile within a span of 4-5 days, and very few are requiring admissions,” said Dr Sujeet K Rajan, a respiratory medicine specialist from Bombay Hospital. “But some number of sicker patients requiring intensive care have started coming in over the past few days,” he said.Dr KK Talwar, former head of the Medical Council of India, who was also heading the Punjab government’s expert group on Covid during the second wave of the pandemic, said that Delhi is around two weeks behind Mumbai in its infection trajectory and is likely to follow similar patterns in infection and hospitalisations in the coming days. “Delhi is likely to follow similar patterns as Mumbai, just as Mumbai followed the patterns seen in South Africa. This fits into the clinical pattern of the Omicron spread,” Dr Talwar said. That’s a rapid spike in cases, few hospitalisations, and an equally sharp fall in cases.(With inputs from Soumya Pillai in Delhi and Jyoti Shelar in Mumbai)
20-01-2022||India||UP elections: Mulayam’s daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav joins BJP, praises Modi||Ending days of speculation, Aparna Yadav, the daughter-in-law of Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in Delhi on Wednesday in the presence of Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev, both OBC leaders from the poll-bound state.“Aparna is welcome in BJP family,” tweeted chief minister Yogi Adityanath.During the joining ceremony, Yadav praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, spoke of being drawn to BJP’s “India first” ideology and said she will commit herself to “rashtra ki aradhana” (worship of the nation).Her entry into the BJP comes within days of the high profile exits of 14 important leaders, mainly OBCs, from the BJP to the Samajwadi Party.While welcoming her into the party, BJP leaders ensured that Aparna was repeatedly referred to as “adarniya neta Mulayam Singh ji ki putra vadhu (honourable leader Mulayam Singh ji’s daughter-in-law)” to make the point of having won over a key member of the Samajwadi Party’s first family.In Lucknow, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said ‘netaji’ (Mulayam Singh Yadav) had spoken to Aparna and attempted to stop her from joining BJP, but that he wished her well. The BJP however, wasted little time in targeting him.“First of all, I would like to congratulate and extend best wishes. I am also happy that our socialist ideology is expanding. I hope that our ideology will reach there and work to save the Constitution and democracy,” the SP president told reporters in his first response on the issue.Aparna Yadav too refrained from directly attacking her half-brother-in-law and said she would continue to be the “bahu (daughter-in-law)” of the Yadav family. “I will continue to be the bahu of the family and will fulfill all responsibilities,” she said, adding that the BJP leadership would take a call on from where she would contest and regions she may be sent to for campaigning.However, the BJP played up the family issue.“Akhileshji is not successful even in his family,” deputy CM Maurya tweeted.Swatantra Dev said Aparna Yadav joined the BJP as she knew that the party cared about the safety of women.With a diploma in international relations, Aparna Bisht Yadav is the wife of Prateek Yadav, Mulayam’s son from his second wife Sadhna and is now expected to contest on a BJP ticket, though the seat is still being discussed by party leaders who have assembled in Delhi to discuss candidates. In 2017, Aparna Yadav contested the elections from Brahmin-dominated Lucknow Cantt seat as a Samajwadi Party candidate but lost to BJP’s Rita Bahuguna Joshi.OBC communities played a significant role in the BJP’s win in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls and 2017 state elections.During Aparna Yadav’s induction ceremony, several OBC leaders were present. It is being seen as the party’s outreach to OBCs amidst reports that they were leaning towards the SP.UP BJP vice president Daya Shankar Singh, who accompanied Aparna Yadav to Delhi, admitted that her induction had been in the works for the last 25 days, a period that coincided with heightened rebel activity within the BJP. After her formal induction, Aparna Yadav met other senior party leaders, including BJP president JP Nadda.(With PTI inputs)
20-01-2022||India||Akhilesh hints at contesting UP elections||Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday hinted that he may contest the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, the first time he will be doing so.“If I decide to contest, I will contest (2022 assembly elections) with the permission of the people of Azamgarh, who got me elected to the Lok Sabha,” Yadav, the parliamentarian from Azamgarh, told reporters at SP HQ in Lucknow.If he does contest, it won’t be from Azamgarh. Responding to a question on whether he would be doing so, Yadav said he would likely pick a constituency that goes to polls before Gorakhpur, from where chief minister Yogi Adityanath will contest his first assembly election. Polling at Azamgarh will take place in the seventh phase (March 7) while Gorakhpur will go to polls in the sixth phase (March 3).“I will request the people of Azamgarh (for permission) and contest the poll from where the party decides. The election to seat (from where I contest) should be held before Gorakhpur so that I contest the poll before Yogi Ji,” said Yadav.Elections for the 403 assembly constituencies in Uttar Pradesh will be held in seven phases on February 10, 14, 20, 23, 27 and March 3 and 7. The counting of votes will take place on March 10.Adityanath, who is also the chief priest of the Gorakhnath Math in Gorakhpur, is currently a member of state legislative council. Adityanath has won the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat five times.The SP chief had earlier indicated that he would not contest the assembly elections. When he was chief minister of Uttar Pradesh from 2012 to 2017, Yadav was member of the legislative council.With Adityanath in the fray, this will be the first time in 15 years that a serving chief minister will contest the assembly election. Last time, it was former SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, who contested and won the Gunnaur assembly seat in 2007. His party lost to the BSP in that election, though.On Wednesday, Akhilesh Yadav also announced his party’s plan to re-launch the Samajwadi Pension Scheme if voted to power.“We launched the Samajwadi Pension Scheme for the poor when in government. We will relaunch the scheme and give them ₹18,000 per annum in place of ₹6,000 per annum paid earlier. This scheme provided financial support to 5 million families,” Yadav said.Meanwhile, talking about his sister-in-law Aparna Yadav’s decision to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the SP chief said he wants to convey his good wishes to her. He added that SP patriarch and his father Mulayam Singh Yadav made efforts to convince her to stay back.“First of all, I will congratulate and extend my good wishes. I am happy it’s expansion of the Samajwadi Party’s ideology. I hope our ideology will help save democratic institutions. Netaji Mulayam Singh Yadav made all efforts to convince her to stay back… I am happy they (BJP) are giving ticket to the ones who are not able to get a ticket from the Samajwadi Party,” he said.Uttar Pradesh BJP spokesperson Avnish Tyagi said, “By saying that he (Akhilesh Yadav) needs permission of people of Azamgarh Akhilesh Yadav is trying to evade contesting assembly elections. He does not have faith in people and thus making efforts not to contest assembly elections.”
20-01-2022||India||Will not contest Uttarakhand elections: Trivendra Singh Rawat||Former chief minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Trivendra Singh Rawat on Wednesday expressed his unwillingness to contest the Uttarakhand assembly polls next month.In a letter to BJP national president JP Nadda, Rawat wrote that he wanted to dedicate his time “to ensuring the return of BJP in power in the 2022 polls”.The letter, which was widely circulated on social media on Wednesday, came on the day BJP was holding its central parliamentary board meeting in New Delhi to decide on the list of candidates for the upcoming elections. Uttarakhand assembly polls are scheduled to be held on February 14 and the counting of votes will take place on March 10.HT has seen a copy of the two-page letter dated January 19.“There has been a leadership change in Uttarakhand with the appointment of young leader Pushkar Singh Dhami as its CM. Hence, under the changed scenario, I think I shouldn’t contest the polls. I had already apprised the senior leadership about it earlier also,” Rawat wrote in the letter, while thanking the party leadership for giving him the opportunity to serve as the Uttarakhand CM.“Though, I will always remain the member of BJP. By not contesting the polls, I want to put all my efforts to ensure the return of party to power under the leadership of Dhami. Hence, I request you to accept by decision and allow me to dedicate fully for the above-mentioned cause.”Rawat also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “his support and blessings on the people of Uttarakhand while he was the CM”.The letter further read, “I am also grateful to the people of Doiwala constituency who elected me their representative in 2017 elections and gave me the opportunity to serve them,”Rawat resigned from the post of chief minister in March 2021, less than a year before the assembly polls, after serving the state for almost four years. Last year, he was replaced by Tirath Singh Rawat as CM. Since then, Tirath Singh Rawat has also been replaced by Dhami. (CHECK). Rawat’s exit was seen as an effort by the party to tackle anti-incumbency.Despite several attempts, Rawat couldn’t be contacted for a comment, but his media advisor Darshan Singh Rawat confirmed the authenticity of the letter. “Former CM Rawat doesn’t want to fight the polls as he wants to work for the party as a member only,” the media advisor told HT.When asked if the former CM wanted to contest from any other seat, Darshan said, “That can never be the case as Doiwala is his stronghold and has carried lot of development works there. However, the letter will be taken into consideration in the ongoing parliamentary board meeting, where if the senior leadership directs him to fight, then he will follow directions.”The BJP swept the assembly elections in 2017, winning 57 seats in the 70-member Uttarakhand legislative assembly. Congress won 11 seats.BJP state general secretary Kuldeep Kumar said, “The party has been apprised of the letter but as it has been addressed to the national president, a decision will be taken by the central leadership only.”
20-01-2022||India||India and US discuss Ukraine, Covid-19 in ‘wide-ranging talks’||Even as the confrontation between the United States (US) and Russia escalates over the situation in Ukraine, US deputy secretary of state, Wendy Sherman spoke to Indian foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Wednesday on a range of global and bilateral issues.In a brief statement on the talks, state department spokesperson Ned Price said, “They discussed a broad range of issues including Russia’s concerning military build-up on Ukraine’s borders and regional issues.”Price noted that the two agreed to “remain closely coordinated on shared goals and priorities and reiterated the importance of a strong US-India partnership to mitigate the Covid-19 Omicron variant’s rapid advance”.In a tweet late on Wednesday night, the ministry of external affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said that Shringla had a “wide-ranging telecon” with Sherman. They reviewed, among other issues, “upcoming bilateral engagements and the Covid pandemic, including supply of vaccines, and exchanged views on Indo-Pacific, Middle East, UNSC, India’s neighbourhood etc.” The Indian readout of the talks did not mention Russia or Ukraine.FS @harshvshringla had a wide ranging telecon today with US @DeputySecState Wendy Sherman.Inter alia reviewed upcoming bilateral engagements and the COVID pandemic, including supply of vaccines, and exchanged views on Indo-Pacific, Middle East, UNSC, India’s neighborhood, etc.The conversation between Sherman – who has been a key figure in talks with Russia and met her Russian counterparts in Geneva and Brussels last week – and Shringla comes a day after the White House warned that Russia could launch an attack on Ukraine “at any point”.Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Kiev where he reassured Ukraine of US support, and is scheduled to travel to Germany to discuss a “unified response” to Russia’s actions with European allies and partners. He is also meeting his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, on Friday in Geneva in an effort to find common ground. The US has maintained that Russian de-escalation along Ukraine’s borders must be the first step to defusing the crisis, while Russia has sought broader guarantees on European security, including a commitment to limit NATO’s expansion and membership.For India, which enjoys a close strategic partnership with both US and Russia, the renewed tension between the two countries has been a matter of concern. This is particularly so at a time when New Delhi is hoping that the Joe Biden administration would waive off sanctions that would otherwise apply to India under the Countering America’s Adversaries through Sanctions Act for its acquisition of S-400 missile systems from Russia.
20-01-2022||India||SC to states: Ensure Covid ex-gratia claims resolved||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked states to make sure people are aware of the ex gratia being paid to the kin of those who lost their lives on account of Covid-19, and to ensure that claims were not rejected on technicalities. The affidavits filed by many of the states showed that they had received claims far in excess of the recorded Covid-19 deaths. For instance, Gujarat, which recorded 10,094 Covid-19 deaths according to government data, received 91,810 claims, of which, 5,761 were rejected while payment was made against 59,000. A similar jump was also witnessed by Maharashtra which recorded 141,835, the highest to be recorded by a single state in the country, but received 217,151 claims. Of this, the state government rejected 49,113 claims and paid against 100,271 claims, with the process still on. Passing a common order for all states, the bench of justices MR Shah and Sanjiv Khanna said: “No claim should be rejected on technical grounds and if there is any lacuna in the claim, the reason must be communicated to the concerned claimants and opportunity be given to rectify the mistake to ensure compensation is paid to them.” Similar increases were also seen in the affidavits of Andhra Pradesh (14,471 deaths according to the state and 41,292 claims), Telangana (3993 deaths and 28,969 claims), Tamil Nadu (36,825 deaths and 57,147 claims), Uttar Pradesh (22,928 deaths and 33.958 claims), and Chhattisgarh (13,600 deaths and 21,035 claims) . Madhya Pradesh and Odisha too saw increases, but marginal ones. But the court noted with concern that in many states, the number of claims failed to reach the actual figure of deaths recorded by them. The bench observed, “Our only anxiety is to see that no person should be deprived of compensation... If the applications received are less than the actual deaths it is a matter of concern. Figures in some states have shown phenomenal increase. But the very fact you have received less applications means there is less publicity by states/UTs. It may be the poorer section of the society which may be deprived of this information.” This was evident in the affidavits of Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Haryana, and Bihar , and also West Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, and Himachal Pradesh. Kerala with reported deaths of 49,300 received 27,274 claims (23,652 paid), while Punjab received only 8,786 claims against 16,557 deaths. Finding it unfortunate that states were not complying with its earlier orders asking them to give wide publicity about the ex-gratia scheme, the bench said, “It is most unfortunate for us to call each state and ensure our order is complied with. Every state believes we are at their mercy, the people are at their mercy. In these matters, a proactive approach is needed as the payment must be made immediately and nodal officers appointed to ensure applications are processed soon.” Advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal, on whose petition the Court ordered payment of ex-gratia on June 30 and October 4, informed the Court that another bench of the Supreme Court is dealing with the case of children orphaned due to Covid-19. This information, he said, was available with the national commission for protection of child rights (NCPCR) which operates a centralized database n this regard on Bal Swaraj portal. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati appearing for Centre informed the Court that 10,000 children across the country lost both parents due to Covid-19. The bench directed the states to supply information about these children to the state legal service authorities (SLSA) and told states, “There has to be greater care by states to ensure the payment reaches to these children and not anyone else.” The Court also considered involving SLSAs to speed up filing of claims in states which have not showing promising figures. An order in this regard will be passed later, the bench said, while adjourning the matter to February 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scto-states-ensure-covid-ex-gratia-claims-resolved-101642617263212.html
20-01-2022||India||Goa elections: Shiv Sena, NCP declare alliance; say Congress not interested||The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena on Wednesday announced an alliance for next month’s assembly elections in Goa and added that the Congress did not respond to their proposal of fighting the polls together. All the three parties are part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in Maharashtra. Addressing reporters, Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut and NCP leader Praful Patel said the two parties are also hoping for a post-poll arrangement with parties other than the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“We had thought that we should extend the MVA from Maharashtra to Goa. We thought that the Congress should play the major role and we (NCP and Shiv Sena) would contest some seats,” Patel said.“Up to 2012, Congress used to leave seven seats for the NCP in Goa. So, Sanjay Raut made a similar offer. We even conceded that the Congress will be the main party in fighting the elections jointly. To this proposal of ours, they never said no, but they never said yes… they never gave us an adequate number of seats or spoke of seats we were strong or capable of contesting, so it was an exercise where we felt the Congress was not giving us the due respect which we deserve,” he added. Patel continued: “I wish the Congress would have appreciated the larger picture and accommodated all the like-minded parties.” “We (Sena and NCP) had tried to make an alliance like the MVA in Goa too. But we did not get any positive response from the Congress,” Raut said. The two parties are looking at contesting around a dozen of the 40 assembly seats in the upcoming polls. “In Goa, there is a lot of confusion on the ground. There’s BJP, Congress, Trinamool Congress (TMC), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and other parties and in this overall confusion, the NCP and Shiv Sena thought that though we may not be in a position to form a government, we will have a respectable number of seats and can play an important role in the formation of the government,” Raut said. “We will decide on the seat arrangement and the list of candidates in the next few days,” he added.The state NCP leadership is hopeful of signing a poll pact with the Congress, with party leader José D’Souza claiming that talks remained stalled after initial progress in the matter. “Talks between the Congress and the NCP were not held at the local level but were at the central leadership level. We are not privy to the talks and the reasons why they did not work out,” Congress working president Aleixo Sequeira said.Both the NCP and Congress had fought the 2012 and 2017 assembly elections together. The NCP’s presence in the state, however, has dwindled ever since it was reduced to zero seats between 2012 and 2017 and won only one (Benaulim) seat in 2017.In 2017, the Congress had emerged as the single-largest party in Goa by winning 17 seats in the 40-member House, but could not come to power as the BJP, which bagged 13, allied with some independents and regional parties to form the government under Manohar Parrikar (now deceased). The Sena, on the other hand, has never won a seat in the state despite contesting successive elections either as independent or through an alliance. The electoral battle for Goa has become multi-cornered with the entry of Mamata Banerjee-led TMC and aggressive campaigning by the AAP. So far, poll tie-ups were forged between the regional Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and TMC, and between the Congress and the Goa Forward Party (GFP). Taking a swipe at Congress, TMC co-in-charge of Goa Sushmita Dev said: “Congress keeps complaining about the division of Opposition votes that will benefit the BJP. If that concern was genuine, it should have worked towards consolidating the anti-BJP votes in Goa.”Dev was referring to former Union minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram’s recent remarks that the Congress and BJP were the main contenders in Goa and that the AAP and the TMC would split the non-BJP votes if they decided to field their respective candidates.“It’s clear that the Congress has double standards. Let me add that in the Goa elections, the TMC has the people’s support while the Congress is seen as weak due to its failure to form the government in the past. We don’t work on the basis of conjectures. We have done ground surveys,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-elections-shiv-sena-congress-declare-alliance-say-congress-not-interested-101642617203374.html
20-01-2022||India||UP elections: Hindu Yuva Vahini enters campaign mode after 5 years of dormancy||The Hindu Yuva Vahini (HYV), founded in 2002, when he was an MP, by Yogi Adityanath, has emerged after five years of dormancy, with the likely trigger being the the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) decision to field Adityanath from his and its base, Gorakhpur, in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections.The HYV played an important role in Adityanath’s election campaigns in 2004, 2009 and 2014 and also propagated the message of Hindutva in rural areas of eastern UP. After Adityanath became chief minister in March 2017, units of the HYV in various districts of Gorakhpur were disbanded at the request of the BJP leadership over fears that it would function as a parallel political outfit. Its office-bearers and members who protested this move were expelled from it. This included HYV’s then state president Sunil Singh.Over the following five years, the HYV withdrew from political activities to focus on social issues, including ration distribution, building awareness about Covid-19 and Japanese Encephalitis, assisting migrant workers, and assisting local authorities in the implementation of development and welfare schemes.The announcement that CM Adityanath will be fielded from the Gorakhpur urban seat has charged members of the HYV. Though polling on this seat will be held in the sixth phase of UP polls on March 3, the HYV has already launched an intensive campaign to ensure Adityanath’s victory.In view of Covid-19 guidelines implemented by the Election Commission of India (ECI), the HYV has decided to organise door-to-door meetings, digital meetings, and strengthen its organisation at the booth level across the assembly segment, said PK Mall, general secretary, HYV.HYV office-bearers will hold a meeting with the chief minister over the election strategy and campaign when he arrives in Gorakhpur, Mall added.“Political activities of the HYV were dormant for around five years, but the organisation has been reactivated with the announcement of Yogi Adityanath’s candidature from the city seat. The outfit will hold meetings in all the wards and also campaign for BJP candidates in other assembly segments on the direction of the CM,” said Ram Laxman, a senior HYV leader and former students’ union leader of DDU Gorakhpur University.In the 2017 assembly elections, HYV leader Raghvendra Pratap Singh contested from Domariyaganj seat in Siddharthnagar. In a close contest, he defeated BSP candidate Saiyada Khatoon by a margin of 171 votes. In the 2022 assembly polls too, several HYV leaders are aspiring for BJP tickets.Adityanath raised the HYV in 2002 after his relationship with the BJP soured due to differences over ticket distribution in the assembly election. He challenged the BJP leadership by fielding Dr Radha Mohan Das Agarwal on a Hindu Mahasabha ticket against BJP candidate Shiv Pratap Shukla. Agarwal defeated Shukla, establishing Adityanath as the unchallenged leader of eastern UP, said Satyadeo Singh, a teacher in a government college in Gorakhpur.Soon, HYV volunteers were also entrusted with the task of propagating the Hindutva agenda promoted by the Gorakhnath mutt headed by Adityanath. From 300 members in 2002, the strength of the HYV increased to 1.5 million in 2017. In the Gorakhpur division alone, around half a million joined the outfit as it opened offices in villages.However, the activities of the HYV did not go down well with local BJP leaders who considered the outfit a “private force of Adityanath”. They urged the party leadership to curtail the activities of the HYV after Adityanath became CM, Singh added. 
20-01-2022||India||SC declines to recall order staying quota for OBCs in local body polls||No state or Union territory can be permitted to hold local body elections with 27% reservation for other backward classes (OBCs) without empirical data on the population and representation of OBCs, the Supreme Court held on Wednesday as it declined to recall its December 2021 order staying OBC quotas for Maharashtra local polls.The order comes after the apex court suspended OBC quotas for local body polls in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh for want of adequate data last month, and the Odisha high court cited the top court order to stay panchayat polls in Odisha for the same reason.“We are not going to recall our orders. States can’t provide reservation for OBC if they have not complied with the constitution bench judgment of this court, which was reiterated by a three-judge bench in its judgment last year. All states and Union territories (UTs) will have to complete the exercise of gathering empirical data, which will then be examined by the dedicated state commissions,” said a bench, headed by justice AM Khanwilkar.“There is no quarrel that the reservation has to be provided if the dispensation so provides, but this has to be in compliance with the judgment of the constitution bench and the three-judge bench. If the states have not acted after the 2010 constitution bench judgment, they will have to satisfy the triple test now. Until then, there cannot be any reservation for the OBC and election will have to be done on those seats as open category seats” emphasised the bench, also comprising justices Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar.The 2010 constitution bench verdict laid down a triple test for reserving seats in local body polls: Setting up a dedicated commission to conduct contemporaneous rigorous empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of the backwardness with respect to local bodies, specifying the proportion of reservation in light of the commission’s proposals, and not exceeding the 50% quota cap as laid down by the top court in a landmark 1992 judgment.A three-judge bench relied on this five-judge bench verdict in March 2021 while holding that the triple test is a precondition for reservation to OBCs in local bodies.Wednesday’s order deals a blow to the efforts of several state governments that were looking to provide quotas to OBCs in local body elections, which currently only have seats set aside for scheduled castes (SCs) and scheduled tribes (STs), apart from women.State food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal said: “Until today, there was no way ahead except completing the triple test exercise. But today, the apex court allowed the state to submit the data to MSBCC and further allowed the commission to submit its interim report to the state government, which is a positive development.”In its order, the bench noted that it was for the respective state backward commissions to examine the data on OBCs as submitted by states and UTs, and then take a suitable view. It directed that the state election commission (SEC) will have to notify all OBC seats as open category seats for future elections to local bodies if states and UTs fail to satisfy the triple conditions laid down by the top court.“This observation must also govern the dispensation in all states which intend to hold elections by providing reservation for the OBCs. Without compliance with the triple test, state election commissions shall ensure that seats to future elections be notified as open category seats,” said the court.It also turned down a request made by the Union government to allow states and UTs to defer the local body elections until they could gather data on OBCs and have it vetted by the commissions.“We are not going to say ‘don’t hold elections’. We will not say until this exercise is complete, administrators will continue for an indefinite period. Where the term of the administrators have expired, we cannot allow them to continue indefinitely,” the bench told additional solicitor general KM Nataraj, who represented the Centre. Meanwhile, Chandrakant Bavkar, executive president, Jan OBC Morcha, said: “I don’t see it as a positive development and the way the state government is going ahead in this matter, I doubt that OBCs will get reservation in the upcoming local bodies’ electionsIn December 2021, the Supreme Court relied on its 2010 and March 2021 orders to decide that local body elections in Maharashtra will be held without any reservation for OBCs as the state failed to collect empirical data on OBCs. It directed the stat election commission to issue a fresh notification, declaring 567 seats out of a total of 2,100 as general category seats instead.Days later, the court also stayed the election process on seats reserved for OBCs in the municipal polls in Madhya Pradesh, asking the SEC to renotify the OBC seats as general category if the polls were to go on.The Maharashtra government moved the Supreme Court earlier this month, seeking a recall of the December 2021 order. The state government pointed out that the elections to 34 out of 37 zilla parishads, 313 out of 351 panchayat samitis and 9,000 village panchayats were due by March this year. “ OBC candidates will not get representation in the local bodies in the state for the next five years,” said the state’s plea.Similar applications were moved by the Centre and the Madhya Pradesh government, urging the court to recall its December order in the Madhya Pradesh case. Those pleas have not yet been heard.On Wednesday, senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, appearing for the Maharashtra government, urged the bench to recall its December order and instead allow the state to hold future elections on the basis of information and data already available with the states concerning the OBCs.The bench, however, made it clear that the triple test was to be complied with by the state and that the Supreme Court could not examine the correctness or otherwise of the data that the state seeks to reply upon.It then passed an order asking the state backward classes commission to vet the data being cited by the state government within two weeks and then make appropriate recommendations to the state government and the SEC.“The data and information may be furnished before the dedicated commission to enable the latter examine it and submit interim recommendations, which can be acted upon in terms of the law. This obviously would not obviate the triple test which had to be completed by the state under the 2021 judgment before providing reservation of seats for OBC in local bodies,” added the bench in its order.
20-01-2022||India||Goa elections: AAP declares Amit Palekar as CM face||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday announced the name of lawyer-turned-politician Amit Palekar as the party’s chief ministerial face for next month’s assembly elections in Goa.A prominent lawyer, 46-year-old Palekar will contest the February 14 Goa assembly elections from St Cruz constituency, which is currently represented by Antonio Fernandes from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The constituency covers Palekar’s village, Merces.Announcing the party’s CM candidate in Panaji, Kejriwal said it chose an “honest man”. “We promised to give Goa a chief ministerial candidate whose heart beats for Goa and who is willing to give his life for Goa. Amit Palekar is the one who is ready to even give his life for Goa. He is an honest man,” Kejriwal said.“Goa wants a change and AAP has been getting a tremendous response in the coastal state. People are impressed with the Delhi model of governance,” Kejriwal, the Delhi chief minister, said.Palekar, who joined the AAP in October, 2021, is making his debut in electoral politics. His name has been doing the rounds as the party’s CM candidate ever since Kejriwal said in November that the party would pick someone from the Bhandari community. Palekar belongs to the community, classified under the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in Goa.“You have seen the dirty politics of the last five years and in the last two months you have seen it fall to such a level that the Goans have begun to feel ashamed. We have entered politics to change this and are asking for one chance to bring a change,” Palekar said.His reference is to the state of defections seen in the state. As a lawyer, Palekar handled several prominent cases, including defending former minister Francisco “Mickky” Pacheco, who was on the run from the police in connection with the death of his family friend Nadia Joelle Torrado, who died by suicide in 2010. More recently, Palekar represented liquor licence holders, who were battling the Supreme Court’s order banning sale of liquor in the vicinity of national highways. He also represented one of the parties demanding better healthcare facilities during the peak of the second Covid-19 wave in Goa in May last year.“Other parties have sold Goa. Check their balance sheets. They have only indulged in corruption. People want clean and corruption-free governance. Do we want the same corrupt people who have been running the government or do we want clean faces that can take Goa forward,” Palekar said, while thanking party leader Kejriwal for “this opportunity”. AAP has already announced it will contest all 40 seats in Goa, which will go to the polls on February 14. The counting of votes will take place on March 10.“Palekar needs to show some body of work -- social work -- to really be considered a viable person who can represent the community. He has nothing to show for it. Few can’t fire a few fireworks and say that it is actual work and support yourself as the Chief Ministerial’ face,” BJP’s Anil Hoble, who is also a leader from the Bhandari Samaj, said.Congress leader Amarnath Panjikar said announcing a “CM face had no meaning” when the party wasn’t going to win a single seat. “They do not have a base in Goa and as such, announcing a CM face holds no significance. Instead, they are only trying to foment divisions in society through claiming justice for the community,” Panjikar said.“It remains to be seen if AAP will come up to a number of MLAs where they will be in a position to decide who will be the CM, let alone from their own party. I am not necessarily concerned about AAP appointing a Bhandari CM but their announcement of the same has opened a debate where Bhandaris are wondering about their political position and representation in the legislature,” independent analyst Kaustubh Naik said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-elections-aap-declares-amit-palekar-as-cm-face-101642616183021.html
20-01-2022||India||Covid ex gratia roll-out: SC summons chief secretaries of AP and Bihar||Taking exception to the slow pace at which Covid-19 ex gratia is being rolled out by some states, the Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the chief secretaries of Bihar and Andhra Pradesh to appear before it, stating that people cannot be left at the mercy of the executive.Andhra Pradesh had recorded 14,471 Covid-19 deaths, but following the orders by the Supreme Court in June and October for providing ex gratia compensation of ₹50,000 for all Covid-19 deaths, the criteria for recording deaths was relaxed and fatalities that occurred within 30 days of a person testing Covid positive was entitled to compensation. As a result, Andhra received 36,205 claims as on January 16. However, the state succeeded to pay compensation to only 11,464 persons.Unhappy over the slow pace by the state, a bench of justices MR Shah and Sanjiv Khanna said, “It is unfortunate that despite our earlier directions to pay compensation to kin or family members of persons who died due to Covid-19, and time and again directions issued, there is total callousness and negligence on part of Andhra Pradesh.”Advocate Mahfooz Nazki appeared for Andhra Pradesh and informed the top court that about 31,000 claims had been found in order and will be paid shortly. The bench recorded this figure in its order and said, “It appears the state is not at all serious on compliance of this court’s order and directions issued. No justification has been shown by the counsel for not making payment to those whose applications are found to be in order. This will tantamount to disobedience of our earlier order for which the chief secretary is liable for action under the Contempt of Courts Act.”The court had directed the chief secretary to be present at 2pm. Nazki requested the court not to issue a show cause notice and sought time to report full compliance. The bench said, “It is unfortunate that directions of this court are taken so lightly. Your chief secretary and chief minister are not above law. People are not at your mercy. This is an order by the court and you are not obliging us by following it.”Bihar, too, came in the line of fire as despite recording deaths of 12,009, the state received only 11,095 claims while payment was made only to 9,821 persons.The bench said, “In these matters, payment has to be made immediately as these families are in need of money. A proactive approach is needed by the administration by appointing a nodal officer to ensure claims are processed at the earliest.”The Supreme Court had directed the chief secretary of Bihar to be present at 2pm. Advocate Akshay Shrivastava, appearing for the state, told the court that according to the latest figures, payment has been made to 10,782 persons out of more than 12,000 deaths.“We are not ready to believe that only 12,000 persons died in Bihar. What is the actual figure? Now in many states, the actual death figure has increased because now they are honest. Tell your chief secretary to remain present,” the bench observed.The court is examining the implementation of state-wise Covid-19 ex gratia roll-out and had been insisting on wider publicity of the scheme to ensure the benefit reaches the targeted beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-ex-gratia-roll-out-sc-summons-chief-secretaries-of-ap-and-bihar-101642587019826.html
20-01-2022||India||Need a system with no place for discrimination, says PM Modi||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday kicked off the “Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav” commemorating 75 years of India’s Independence by stressing the need for “a system in which there is no place for discrimination and a society that stands firmly on the foundation of equality and social justice”.“Light a lamp in the heart of every citizen of the country - the lamp of duty. Together, we will take the country forward on the path of duty, then the evils prevailing in the society will also be removed and the country will reach new heights,” Modi said at an event of the “Brahma Kumaris”, a spiritual organisation.He added that in the last 75 years, the conversation has revolved around “rights, fighting for rights, fighting, wasting time”. “Speaking of rights, to some extent, for some time, maybe true in any one circumstance but forgetting one’s duties completely has played a huge role in keeping India weak,” he said.Modi hit out at those attempting to “tarnish the country’s image” abroad by publishing “misinformation”. “We cannot get away from this by saying that this is just politics. This is not politics; this is the question of our country. Today, when we are celebrating the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, it is also our responsibility that the world should know India properly,” he said.The commemoration of 75 years of Independence will begin with the Republic Day celebrations. The celebrations will, from this year, start on January 23 instead of January 24 to include the birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose as part of the government’s “focus to commemorate important aspects of our history and culture”.Modi paid tribute to the women, who played a key role in India’s freedom struggle. “From Kittur’s Rani Chennamma, Matangini Hazra, Rani Lakshmibai, Veerangana Jhalkari Bai to, in the social sphere, Ahilyabai Holkar and Savitribai Phule.... It is because of these women that today the country’s daughter can join the armed forces,” he said. “Even in the country’s democratic setup, women are playing a bigger role. Women outvoted men in the 2019 polls. Now, society itself is guiding such change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-a-system-with-no-place-for-discrimination-modi-101642668809716.html
20-01-2022||India||PM to launch India-assisted projects with Mauritius counterpart Jugnauth today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Mauritius counterpart Pravind Kumar Jugnauth will jointly inaugurate an India-assisted social housing project in Mauritius during a virtual event on January 20. The two leaders will also launch the civil service college and an 8-MW solar power project in Mauritius that are being undertaken with India’s development support, the external affairs ministry said on Wednesday. An agreement on extending a $190-million line of credit from India to Mauritius for the Metro Express Project and other infrastructure projects, and a memorandum of understanding for implementing small development projects will be exchanged, the ministry added. The development comes close on the heels of Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s visit to Indian Ocean states such as Sri Lanka, Comoros and the Maldives, during which the Chinese side unveiled several economic projects. Mauritius is a key part of India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy and New Delhi has extended support for a wide range of projects in the African island nation. India also supported Mauritius in the initial stages of the Covid-9 pandemic by providing vaccines and medical supplies.In February last year, India and Mauritius signed a free trade agreement that was aimed at making the island nation a hub for Indian investments in the region, and New Delhi extended a $100-million line of credit to fund purchases of defence hardware. At the time, the two sides also signed two other pacts for leasing a Dornier aircraft and a Dhruv advanced light helicopter for monitoring the exclusive economic zone of Mauritius. The comprehensive economic cooperation and partnership agreement (CECPA) signed with Mauritius was India’s first free trade agreement with any African country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-launch-india-assisted-projects-with-pm-jugnauth-in-mauritius-today-101642615763050.html
