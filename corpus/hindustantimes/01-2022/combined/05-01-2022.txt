05-01-2022||Pune||Approval for proposed site for airport at Purandar rejected by MoD?||Pune: The proposed international airport at Purandar may have hit another roadblock, in terms of clearance for a new site by the state government. Clearance for the new site, believed to be in the same tehsil, is stuck with authorities, Sudhir Mehta, president of Maratha Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), claimed on Wednesday. Mehta said that he was informed by officials about the proposal getting rejected by the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Confirmation from the MoD is awaited. “It appears that the site clearance for the proposed Pune airport at the new location in Purandar has been cancelled by the MOD, which effectively means that the project is dead. Request the state govt to clarify about plans for a new airport at Pune??,” Mehta tweeted on Wednesday. He later told Hindustan Times that an official from Ministry of Defence informed him, with documents, about the proposal getting rejected. Mehta refused to share why the Ministry of Defence denied clearance. When contacted, officials from district administration did not respond to phone calls and text messages. A senior Maharashtra Airport Development Corporation (MADC) official hinted that clearance may not come for the site suggested by the government. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh while responding to a text message seeking clarity about the issue replied saying, “We have not received any communication”. An MLA from Purandar, Sanjay Jagtap said he too has learnt about the being rejected. “There are six land options. I too have heard about the rejection of the site by the Ministry of Defense, but did not get any official information. Once the information is received, we will be able to get details. MP Supriya Sule (MP) and myself, are both firm on the airport in Purandar only, where there are six land options,” Jagtap said. Sources said the ministry has refused to issue a no-objection certificate (NOC) two months back, for the same site, which the state government proposed after the first site was cancelled. Earlier in 2021, Ajit Pawar had said that a report had been submitted to the Central government regarding the new site for Purandar airport. The originally proposed site for the Pune International Airport was changed because of opposition from the villagers in Purandar tehsil. Then a revised proposal, with the changed location was submitted to the Centre for approval. Opposition has emerged for the new site as well. Even if the Centre gives a go-ahead, the land acquisition process will not be a cakewalk for the administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/approval-for-proposed-site-for-airport-at-purandar-rejected-by-mod-101641406583744.html
05-01-2022||Mumbai||BMC asks 142 pvt hospitals to prep with full capacity to handle Covid-19 surge||Mumbai Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal has directed all 142 private hospitals in the city to prepare for the surge in Covid-19 cases. Chahal has asked all private hospitals to prepare beds anticipating a further spike in infections in the coming days. The third wave of Covid-19 is expected to last in the city for four to five weeks on the basis of trends from South Africa where the Omicron variant was first detected, BMC officials said. According to civic officials, as the maximum number of cases is being reported from Mumbai high-rises, there is a surge in demand for beds at private hospitals.Chahal in his message to 142 private hospitals of the city has said, “Considering the fact that approximately 10-12% patients are symptomatic every day, the requirement of hospital beds is likely to increase sharply now. Since more than 95% cases are being detected from non-slum areas, there is tremendous demand for beds in private hospitals only. Patients are reluctant to go to Covid Jumbo Hospitals and BMC hospitals.”“It has come to my notice that symptomatic Covid-19 patients have already started complaining of shortage of Covid-19 beds in private hospitals. Therefore, all private hospitals are hereby directed that they shall immediately spruce up the number of Covid-19 beds to the highest level which existed during the peak of the second wave in 2021,” Chahal addedAccording to the directions issued by the Mumbai Municipal Commissioner, all private hospitals shall restore their peak level Covid-19 beds by January 10, following which the BMC staff will start inspecting private hospitals from January 11, 2022 onwards to cross check if the number of Covid-19 beds in each private hospital has been restored to its peak level. Referring to the third wave of infections, Chahal in his message further told the private hospitals that, “I wish to place on record that private hospitals have done outstanding work in the management of the Covid-19 pandemic in Mumbai since May 2020. Therefore, I request all private hospitals to rise to the occasion and maintain their credibility in the eyes of citizens of Mumbai. I would also like to mention that the present third wave of Covid-19 in Mumbai may not last for more than 4-5 weeks as per experience of South Africa.”Dr Gautam Bhansali of Bombay Hospital, who is the nodal officer of all private Covid-19 hospitals in the city said, “There are 142 private hospitals in the city that have around 5,000 beds active at the moment. At Bombay Hospital, we have 45 beds empty as on Wednesday afternoon. However, in the coming days private hospitals will be able to offer 11,000 active beds for handling COVID-19. Considering the turnaround time is very less, we will be able to discharge every patient within 4-5 days. Hence, bed availability will not be an issue.”On the third wave not lasting for more than 4-5 weeks, Dr Rahul Pandit of Fortis Hospital who is also a member of the Maharashtra Covid-19 Task Force said, “We also feel the same considering that is how the behaviour of the virus has been so far in the past. There is high chance that the same pattern might be true this time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-asks-142-pvt-hospitals-to-prep-with-full-capacity-to-handle-covid-19-surge-101641406464986.html
05-01-2022||Mumbai||Mumbai hospitals face staff crunch as doctors, nurses are Covid positive||Mumbai: With the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, city hospitals are faced with a shortage of staff as several doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers across public and private facilities have been infected with the coronavirus. Hospitals are reporting a staff shortage of anywhere between 5% to 30%.Healthcare workers are experiencing breakthrough infections (infection which occurs after being fully vaccinated) and re-infections, which has led several private hospitals to hire doctors and nurses on a temporary basis.On Wednesday, Bandra’s Lilavati Hospital reported a 30% shortage of nursing staff and doctors due to Covid. “Some of them are admitted with us with moderate symptoms, while others are isolating at home,” said Dr V Ravishankar, chief executive officer of the hospital that has a staff strength of 550 doctors and 300 nurses. “I have started hiring doctors and nurses on a temporary basis to ensure smooth functioning,” he said. At Wockhardt Hospital in Mumbai Central, at least 30 of their staff are currently Covid positive, including 17 doctors and nurses — 5% of the 350-odd nurses and doctors. Data shared by the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) showed that as of Wednesday, 265 residents were down with Covid-19 in public hospitals including 73 in JJ hospital, Byculla, 80 in Lokmanya Tilak Medical General (LTMG) hospital, Sion, 60 in KEM, Parel, 45 in BYL Nair, Mumbai Central and seven in Cooper hospital, Vile Parle. “This is a drastic increase since January 3, when we counted 70 infections,” said MARD president Dr Avinash Dahiphale. “None of the doctors have a serious disease. Most of them and in mild to moderate category,” he said. In addition to the resident doctors, many faculty members in these hospitals are also infected. The JJ Hospital, for instance, has nearly 100 infected staff, including 21 faculty members and other hospital workers besides the residents mentioned above. The hospital’s dean Dr Ranjit Mankeshwar is also infected with the virus and is currently admitted at St George’s Hospital.In LTMG hospital, four faculty members besides the resident doctors mentioned above are infected with Covid. “A few nurses are also infected,” said the hospital’s dean Dr Mohan Joshi, adding the workload is manageable at the moment due to the shorter isolation period and less severity of the infections. However, the situation may become difficult as hospitalisations increase, the dean said. Covid bed occupancy in Mumbai’s public and private hospitals (including jumbo centres) has seen a jump since December 20, when it was 6.25% (the number of Covid beds at the time were 13,830) to 23% on January 5 (the number of beds currently stand at 22,098). This has also led to some concern about the delay that at least a fraction of healthcare workers will face in receiving their booster dose. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 26 had announced that all healthcare workers will receive “precaution doses” — or booster shots — starting on January 10. According to a mandate issued by the Centre itself, there should be at least a three month’s gap between recovery from the infection and vaccination. “It would have been ideal if booster doses were started for healthcare workers a couple of months back. It may have prevented the widespread infections to a certain extent though with Omicron in circulation [this remains to be seen],” internal medicine specialist Dr Anita Mathew from Fortis Hospital. “Many of the healthcare workers will not be able to take the booster shots immediately due to recent infections,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital. the government is yet to give detailed guidelines on booster shots.On December 31, additional chief secretary Pradeep Vyas issued guidelines stating that the isolation period for healthcare workers and other staff could be reduced to five days from the earlier seven-day mandate, considering the Omicron variant may infect large numbers in a short time and there will be need of trained staff to be available. “We are following the 5-day isolation protocol for all staff and most turn negative within that period,” said Dr Parag Rindani, chief executive officer of Wockhardt Hospital. Hospital authorities said that healthcare workers have been testing positive routinely, but they began seeing a higher number of infections starting the last week of December. “Healthcare workers are in the frontline are bound to have more infections as we are in a middle of a wave driven by a highly transmissible variant,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the Covid-19 task force. “It is important for hospitals to wait for a negative RTPCR before calling the doctors back on duty,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-hospitals-face-staff-crunch-as-doctors-nurses-are-covid-positive-101641405383503.html

The initiative is part of the ongoing modernisation plan under which Indian Railways, in collaboration with the postal department, is introducing a train reservation facility at the post offices. Officials said the facility would be a boon in minimising the passenger load at the railway stations.North Eastern Railway (NER ) officials said the facility would be made functional from January 6 onwards. Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnav is likely to inaugurate the reservation facility along with other facilities here in the state capital on Thursday.Initially, the ticket booking facility would be made available in around 9147 post offices across the state. “The facility would save a lot of time for people as they won’t have to visit the station or their agents to get their train tickets booked,” said the official.Other than inaugurating the facility, the railway minister would also inaugurate the entry of Gomti Nagar Station that is being developed as a satellite station and would flag off a Delhi-bound train and two trains to Vaishno Devi and Kamakhya Temple.Pankaj Singh, chief public relations officer (CPRO), NER, said the railway minister is scheduled to be at the Gomti Nagar station at around 9 am on Thursday and would also open many other facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/now-book-train-tickets-from-post-offices-railway-officials-101641403943474.html

05-01-2022||Lucknow||UPPCB to develop mega recycling hubs for plastic, medical, e-waste||The state pollution control board is planning to develop five dedicated mega hubs for waste recycling, focusing on plastic, e-waste and non-biodegradable medical waste like single-use PPE kits, gloves masks etc. These hubs will be able to recycle all kinds of plastic, e-waste and single-use medical waste as per the existing modern scientific methods with minimum impact on the environment. According to the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) officials, plans are to set up these facilities in at least five places across the state. UPPCB chief environment officer RK Singh said, “The mega hubs will house over 50 facilities each to recycle medical plastic with different modern methods. These facilities will be operated by private partners, while the government will provide the basic infrastructure, making it a public-private partnership (PPP) work model.” The plan was proposed on suggestions from environmental experts and researchers, who apprised the board about the spike in the single-use medical plastic and e-waste during Covid-19 times. “Electronic waste accounts for 40% of lead and 70% of heavy metals found in our landfills. These pollutants are responsible for groundwater contamination, air and soil pollution,” said Shalini Sharma, CEO of Sanshodhan, an E-Waste Exchange programme. Sharma added that the real issue is the way the e-waste is recycled. “Nearly 95% of recycling of electronic waste is carried out by the unskilled informal sector that poses a threat to both the recycler and the environment. It is the prerogative of the state government to formalise this sector by providing training and required infrastructure.” The situation has become alarming, considering that Uttar Pradesh is among the leading producers of e-waste in the country. Moreover, as per UPPCB estimates 40K tonnes of biomedical waste was generated, across the state, in the last two years. Almost one-third of which was in form of disposable PPE kits, masks, testing swabs, pipettes etc... used in the management of Covid-19 patients. The location of these hubs is yet to be finalised, but Moradabad, Ghaziabad, Aligarh, Kanpur and Prayagraj are among the most probable locations, according to senior officials of the board. “Moradabad and Ghaziabad are already major hubs for e-waste recycling in the state. They process almost one-third of the total e-waste generated in the state,” said a senior member of the board. UPCCB officials are also reaching out to researchers and companies currently working in the recycling industry for guidance in the development of these mega hubs. Research institutes under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) are also being roped in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uppcb-to-develop-mega-recycling-hubs-for-plastic-medical-ewaste-101641403343571.html

But accomplishing this seems to be a herculean task for the winter is quite severe. What’s coming in handy in such a scenario is the blessing of Nature that comes in the form of medicinal plants that help strengthen immunity and tide over mild infections. And seeing the rise in demand for such plants, nursery owners in Delhi-NCR say they have stocked up on Holy basil (tulsi), giloy, aloe vera, stevia, ajwain and others that are beneficial in fighting seasonal irritants. ‘Sales are up by 15-20%’Gaurav Sureka, owner of Rohini-based Balaji Nursery says, “Kaafi buyers aane shuru ho gaye hain. People are now confirming with us about which plant is of giloy and stevia since many don’t know ajwain ka paudha kaisa dikhta hai, but unko pata hai ki iske kaafi benefits hain, toh log dhundte huye aate hain ise humare paas. Last week, there was been a 15-20% increase in sale of such plants. Last time jab Delhi me Covid badha tha tab bhi log yehi plants leke jaa rahe the, toh ab bhi jaise hi cases badhne shuru huye, we made sure we had enough planters. Besides, air-purifying plants are also selling like hot cakes.”It’s the season of kadhaRaj Kumar, a nursery owner in Sector 69, Gurugram, says whenever Covid-19 peaks, people come asking for plants that are useful in making kadhas. “Pehle lockdown mein log khoob khareed kar gaye tulsi aur giloy. Iss baar bhi enquiries ke liye phone bajne shuru ho gaye hain. Along with these usual ones, people are showing interest in growing a permanent plant of lehsun (garlic) and adrak (ginger) for their kitchen gardens, so that they don’t have to rely too much on the vegetable vendors. Among other plants, snake plant, which is also being potted a lot, it looks good as a house plant and is superb for cleaning your air also.”‘Hard to find tulsi in winter’Punit Saini from Gautam Nagar-based Saini Plant Nursery says, “Sardiyon mein tulsi ki care na karo toh kharab ho jaati hai. That’s why one doesn’t find tulsi in too many nurseries around this time. However, I’ve stocked up on the different types of basil, including stevia (called mithi tulsi). Stevia is good for people who have blood pressure and blood sugar problems, so people are picking up this plant a lot. People are walking in, to buy more of these plants, now because there’s a confusion between common flu and Covid among many. So many think ki khaasi-zukaam na hi ho, toh behtar hai; warna baat Covid tak pahunch jayegi agar immunity low ho gayi. Giloy ki branches ke liye bhi kaafi calls aa rahi hain. Earlier we used to source giloy from nearby parks — since it’s a climber and grows around trees — aise hi giloy tod kar de dete the koi mangta tha toh. Par iss baar humne iski bel ko properly rakhna shuru kar diya hai.”Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tulsi-giloy-back-in-demand-nurseries-stock-up-on-medicinal-plants-101641401903412.html

05-01-2022||Chandigarh||Knitting love and warmth into an everlasting bond||It’s not the yarn or the pattern or the colour, it is akin to engulfing myself in the warmth of my Ma’s love as I put on the hand-knitted cardigan on the chilly, foggy winter morning. Many colleagues complimented on the intricate pattern and dextrous skill. What struck me most was the admiration for a forgotten skill. Knitting, once a favourite activity across northern India, has lost its glory. The brand conscious nouveau riche middle class has relegated pullovers and cardigans to oblivion. Hoodies, jackets, sweat shirts have caught the fancy of the new generation. The onset of winter augured hectic activity. Fluffy, woollen balls of myriad colours and multiple knitting needles adorned prominence in every home. Post morning household chores, women would flock at a strategic location, basking in the winter sun while hands busily engaged in knitting. Patterns, trends, nuances – a veritable tutorial for all. In fact, all through the winter season women hardly put down their needles. Fingers flew, needles clicked while they watched television or gossiped gleefully. Almost a similar pattern was followed across all homes. One would wear a light without sleeves sweater as the evenings turned cool, especially when we went to watch Ramleela, late October. Then as the mercury dipped, a full-sleeves as well as a hand knit vest. In peak winter, one would wear a matching set: A sleeveless and a cardigan, caps, mittens/gloves and muffler. New season, new trend! Cables this year, delicate holes last year; pure wool/trendy velvet or feather; two-toned/ multi-coloured; raglan sleeves, slant pockets, collar/ high neck/ turtle neck. I fondly remember umpteen visits to Sianco, Sector 17, Chandigarh, for the ‘in-colour’ or the allusive accessories: Right size needle – 7/8 number for thick wool and 11/12 for thin, double-sided for neck, specific crochet hook for an intricate pattern, even a U-shaped needle, Pony only or an extensive hunt for matching, fancy buttons. Buying the latest edition of Stitchcraft or ransacking the special knitting edition of a women’s magazine for the perfect pattern. Knitting meant social bonding. On special occasions like birthday or wedding, helping hands pitched in. One would knit sleeves, the other the back and the third the front. A pullover ready quickly! At times the activity was carried surreptitiously, away from prying eyes. A masterpiece knit clandestinely! The wearer would strut proudly, out of reach lest the pattern be copied. Ma is a wizard at knitting. She can copy any pattern effortlessly. Friends and acquaintances flock around to learn – pearl, knit, drop, carry, loop. She knit out-of-the-world baby sets when my daughter was born. Soft, cosy ones, with delicate dolls, beads embellished. She has gifted tokens of her love to all of us and till date her fingers cannot sit idle in winter. Hand-knitted stuff were prized possessions of yesteryears handed down to the next generation. The art has lost its popularity in the contemporary world yet the warmth continues to live on in our hearts. kalrasuruchi@yahoo.com The writer teaches English at Hindu Girls College, Jagadhri||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/knitting-love-and-warmth-into-an-everlasting-bond-101641400883281.html

The action came after deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar made the announcement about strict Covid norms being implemented in the city to combat the rising number of Covid cases. Apart from masks, ₹1,000 is the fine for spitting in public. Strict checking and action was taken by the Pune police department and Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) flying squads. “The Pune city police started fining on the roads or in public places for no masks from today. Just nine days ago, the number of Covid infection cases was under 100. Gradually, the number is increasing in the city and on Tuesday, over 1,000 persons tested positive for the virus. On Wednesday, over 1,800 cases were detected,” said joint police commissioner Ravindra Shisve. “People were a bit relaxed in last few months as the number of cases were low. Many people neglected the norms of wearing masks, social distancing and sanitising their hands. However, now police have started action against people who will not wear masks and will not maintain social distancing in public places,” he said. The local police stations will keep an eye on motorists without masks and will fine them. Secondly, the police will visit public places and ask people to follow social distancing. “I appeal to people to cooperate with the police”, he added.

05-01-2022||Ranchi||J’khand lynching: Wife says he was killed in police presence; 13 booked for murder||A day after a man was lynched in a village in Jharkhand’s Simdega district, his wife on Wednesday alleged he was killed by the mob in the presence of police who did nothing to save him despite her repeated pleas.Sanju Pradhan, in his 30s, was thrashed and set on fire by a mob in Besrabazar village under Kolebira police station in Simdega district on Tuesday. He was allegedly involved in illegal felling of trees and trading in stolen wood. As per police records, Pradhan had three cases against him for his alleged links with Maoists. “The police had reached the spot even before the mob had started beating him. I kept pleading before them to protect my husband, but they did nothing to save him,” Pradhan’s wife Sapna told reporters. Sapna said a 500-strong mob was present at the spot, but only four people had come to their home to take her husband away. “I don’t know the name of those four persons, but I can identify them if I see them,” she said. Simdega superintendent of police Shams Tabrez said a case has been registered with Kolebira police station on the complaint of the victim’s family members. “In all, 13 people have been made named accused and around two dozens as unnamed accused. We have identified those involved in the crime. Raids are on to apprehend them,” said Tabrez. The SP said the accused have been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. Incidentally, the Jharkhand assembly, in its winter session in December last year, had passed a special law against lynching incidents. The law, though, is yet to be identified. On Sapna’s allegations of the lynching incident occurring in presence of the police, Tabrez said deputy commissioner Kumar Saurav has formed a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the entire incident. “If any lapse is found on part of the police in the SIT report, we will take appropriate action,” the officer said. Both Tabrez and Saurav visited the village and met the victim’s family on Wednesday. Sources in the district police, however, said a police patrol had reached the village soon after getting information that a mob had assembled there. “But they were only five policemen who found themselves helpless against a 500-strong mob. They informed the district headquarters and teams from at least four police stations reached the spot. But, it was too late,” an officer said.Meanwhile, opposition BJP alleged a conspiracy behind the killing and said Pradhan was an active booth-level party worker. “On December 28, a meeting was held in the village, which was also attended by elected representatives belonging to the ruling party,” said Laxman Baarik, president of BJP’s Simdega unit. Baraik, however, refused to name the elected representatives who participated in the meeting, saying they would come up with facts at an opportune time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jkhand-lynching-wife-says-he-was-killed-in-police-presence-13-booked-for-murder-101641399804774.html

HT had reported on June 2, 2021, that between January 1 and May 29, 2021, the state saw 0.1 million cases within the 0-10-year age group, including 18,000 cases among those aged four and below. However, this rise in the number of cases among children is in proportion with the overall rise in the number of cases in the state. During both waves, the age group of 31-40 years was the most affected. During the second wave of the infection which ranged in Pune between January to May last year and peaked in April, the state close to 100,000 new cases among those aged less than 10 years and of these 118,000 were reported among those aged less than four years. However, this rise in the number of cases among children is in proportion with the overall rise in the number of cases in the state. As per data with the Pune district administration, the 113 Omicron cases reported in the district are driving up the numbers to rise by about 29% between the third and fourth week of December. The number of reported Omicron cases are distributed among all age groups. Of the 113 Omicron cases reported in the district, 20 are from those aged below 15 years, 25 are among those aged 18 to 30; 23 among the 30-40-year age group; 21 in the 40-50-year age group and 24 in the 50-plus age group. Dr Ashish Bharti, PMC’s chief health officer said, “We are reporting cases in the younger population more in this wave, i.e those aged 18 to 40 years. It would be too soon to say that more children are affected by this wave. However, they could be more vulnerable as the age group below 15-18 years is just getting vaccinated and those below 15 years of age are yet to get vaccinated. Omicron is spreading faster and children could be vulnerable which is the reason why schools were shut down in the first place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/1080-of-total-covid-cases-in-pune-are-of-those-below-20-years-101641399623220.html

The transportation would also continue like before," Yathiraj said.  However, all institutes should set up Covid-19 help desk, which will enable provision of any information related to coronavirus for people, he said.            Yathiraj said the Integrated Covid Command Centre (ICCC) is active 24 hours a day and the district administration is in constant touch with resident welfare associations and apartment owners associations regarding any case of Covid-19 patient.  He added that the capacity at the ICCC control room–18004192211–has been increased to address more queries.            Monitoring cells have also been activated to provide immediate support to any person in need, he said, adding the ICCC can be contacted at 18004192211 and anyone in need can get details about vaccination, hospitalisation or even telephonic consultation with doctors.            The rate of transmission of the virus in this new wave is high but symptoms or need for hospitalisation among patients is low, the official said.            "If we look at the figures in the district only, we have 1,110 active cases today of which no one is in a condition for additional oxygen support. If we look at our Covid-19 hospitals, we have 400 patients there which include some foreign-returnees and some people who do not have adequate facilities for home isolation," Yathiraj said.            "No patient currently is in ICU. There are a few but those are only the cases with co-morbidities," he added.Covid-19 sampling in Gautam Buddh Nagar, he claimed, is among the highest for any district in the national capital region. He said the sampling size if 3,000 to 4,000 per million population per day in the district.  Yesterday itself, 7,500 samples were taken only by government facilities in the district which include both antigen-based tests and RT-PCR tests, he said.  The positivity rate in antigen tests ranges from 0.5 per cent to 2 per cent on some days, while that of RT-PCR tests ranges from 4 per cent to 7 per cent.  "The figures fluctuate and we look at the weekly figures. Generally, the positivity rate of RT-PCR tests remains three to four times higher than antigen-based tests," Yathiraj said.  He said a successful measure against the infection would be early tracing and isolation of the infected person, noting that on an average 18 contacts of an infected person are traced in Gautam Buddh Nagar but the health department has been instructed to take this number to up to 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/stricter-covid-curbs-in-noida-from-thursday-dm-101641398987336.html
05-01-2022||Mumbai||Highest single-day spike in city at 15,014||Mumbai Mumbai recorded its highest-ever single-day spike as the daily case tally breached the 15,000-mark on Wednesday.The city recorded 15,014 fresh infections in the last 24 hours, making it the highest single-day count. Earlier, 11,206 fresh infections were reported on April 4, 2021, which was then the single-day highest case tally after the pandemic outbreak. The city also recorded 100 Omicron cases on Wednesday, taking the tally to 508. Out of the 15,166 infections reported on Wednesday, 13,195 were asymptomatic and the bed-occupancy level stayed at 14.4 per cent, with 5,104 out of 35,487 beds occupied.Besides this, three deaths were reported in Mumbai on Wednesday taking the total death tally to 16,384.On Wednesday, a total of 60,014 tests were conducted. Mumbai’s Dharavi, which became a Covid-19 hotspot last year, recorded 81 cases on Wednesday, which is also the highest since April 4, when the slum cluster recorded 99 cases.Senior BMC officials stated that in comparison to the rising case tally, the demand for hospital admission is not very high. However, experts stated that they need to wait for at least ten more days before coming to any conclusion.Dr Rahul Pandit, director of critical care in Fortis hospital and member of the national Covid-19 task force and the Maharashtra Covid-19 task force said that the nature of the spread shows characteristics of the Omicron variant.“While the spread is similar to the characteristics of the Omicron variant, we will have to wait for the genome sequencing report before making any concrete comment,” said Pandit.“Also it’s too early to comment on the rate of hospital beds occupancy. The cases started to spike from December 20 and we will have to wait and watch the situation till January 15 because it usually takes the variant of a virus two-three weeks to show up its actual symptoms,” Pandit added.Dr Om Srivastava, who is also a member of the state Covid-19 task force, said that it is likely that along with Omicron the presence of Delta and Delta plus variants are still valid in the fresh cases.“The cases are rising steadily and we can anticipate more cases in the coming days. We will only be able to know the intensity of the Omicron variant and how well it has spread once more samples are tested for genome sequencing. But as of now, we are sure that there is not just Omicron but Delta and Delta plus is also there,” said Srivastava.Meanwhile, the BMC said that out of the cases that are being reported daily, 90 per cent are from high-rise buildings. The number of active sealed buildings also increased rapidly in just 10 days. At present, the K/West ward presently has 4,564 active cases, which is the highest in city followed by H/West ward (Bandra west), K/East (Andheri east) and D ward (Malabar Hills).Speaking to HT, Prashant Gaikwad, ward officer from D ward, said that most of the fresh cases are coming out from contact tracing of the high-risk contacts.“During the first and second wave, for every one positive patient, one high-risk contact would test positive. Now, for every positive patient, there are at least two high-risk contacts, who are testing positive,” said Gaikwad.The BMC’s K/West ward office on Wednesday issued a circular to the high rises and housing societies stating that rampant testing will be conducted.Vaqar Javeed, assistant municipal commissioner of form R/Central ward, which also has a significant number of active cases, said that cluster cases are being reported in buildings that have joint families living inside them.“As most of the fresh patients are fully-vaccinated, the symptoms that are very mild and the rate of hospital admissions is also very low,” said Javeed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/highest-single-day-spike-in-city-at-15014-101641398783471.html

The court also levied a fine of ₹50,000; failure of payment will invite five years of additional punishment. The convicted man was identified as a 46-year-old native of Chitrakoot, Uttar Pradesh. The survivor was 13 years of age in 2018, when she reported the crime to the police. The conviction was awarded by District Judge KK Jhagirdar with public prosecutor Arundhati Bramhe and investigating officer Ashwini Patil, with police staff havaldars Sachin Shinde and Vishal Madne. “After considering the submissions of both parties, no doubt, the accused being the father of the victim, it is his duty to protect her in all difficulties and he has to protect the girl from the bad elements from society and he has to do all the things for the development and benefits of his daughter, but he has committed a heinous crime of rape upon his own daughter, not only repeatedly, but continuously for the period of three years, and when the torture of the sexual harassment of accused became unbearable to the victim, she herself rushed to the police station and lodged the complaint”, read one of the concluding remarks of the district judge. The district legal service authority (DLSA), Pune, was directed to provide compensation to the victim under the Victim Compensation Scheme framed by the state government of Maharashtra, known as the Manodhairya Scheme. The girl lost her mother in 2014 after which the father moved her and her elder brother to Pune from UP. He started working as a watchman in a building. The mother of the child had passed away 7-8 years before the crime was committed, according to the court order. Therefore, the brother of the survivor and the survivor are solely dependent on the accused for livelihood. The man was a habitual drinker and often came home drunk before abusing the children physically and verbally. It was a few years after the death of the survivor’s mother that he starting molesting and then abusing her. “He repeated assaulted her right until the time when the FIR was registered. It started when she was barely 10 years of age. He used to threaten to harm her brother if she did not comply. We examined nine witnesses including the complainant, the doctor who examined her, and the investigating officer,” said PP Bramhe. The defence lawyer, provided by the DLSA, claimed that the girl has made up the case because she was caught stealing from houses in the building where her father worked. The lawyer claimed that the girl levelled false allegation to seek revenge after her father reprimanded her for theft. However, the doctor’s examination proved otherwise. The girl had come to the police station in February 2018 after the man had assaulted her for five days in a row. She narrated the incident to the police, but was scared and crying. The police called for a social worker who helped her lodge a complaint. The conviction was awarded for crimes under Sections 376 (2)(n)(I), 376(3), and 506 of Indian Penal Code and Section 3 punishable under section 4, 5(l)(n) punishable under section 6 of Protection of children from sexual offence (Pocso) Act, 2012 registered at Bharati Vidyapeeth police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/46yearold-gets-life-imprisonment-for-raping-minor-daughter-101641397882916.html

The ambitious project was undertaken by the Prime Minister’s flagship Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav (commemoration of 75 years of India’s independence ) initiative which is being implemented by the ministry of director general of defence estates department under Ministry of Defence. The natural spring has been in existence at the plot for a long time and over the years had become a repository of dirt, filth and silt. The board administration during the past two months carried out a mammoth clean up drive in the area and pressed bulldozers and silt removing machines at the site wherein 60 truckloads of silt was extracted from the water body area. Also, specialsed labour force were deployed to ensure that entire area was cleaned from the indepths aimed at increasing the sustainability of water in the area.The entire area has now been fenced and a gate will be constructed in the next few days as part of the completion of the phase I of the programme. The second phase includes a garden and a bridge to cross the water body for the visitors , which will start soon.PCB CEO Amit Kumar said, “There was already a cantonment board resolution in place for taking up the project. Funds were made available and the natural spring in the A 1 defence land which was till recently a spot of neglect has been rejuvenated. It is a perennial source of natural water and the beautification of the entire place has been undertaken as per the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav programme. There was very thick vegetation all over the waterbody and it was a marshy place. Our engineering team carried out a professional job rejuvenating the natural spring. The work was carried out as deep as 50 feet to ensure that the natural ecosystem is rejuvenated successfully.”Assistant executive engineer Sukhdev Patil said “ For two months , a team of over 25 persons worked relentlessly to clean the waterbody. We have used all natural materials to ensure the natural sanctity of the ecosystem is maintained. Besides, stone pitching has been done along the side to preserve the area.”Former PCB vice-president Vinod Mathurawala said “ The project will lead to conservation of the water body and further increase in green cover of PCB area. Such citizen centric initiatives by the board will result in long term conservation and preservation of the environment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pcb-rejuvenates-british-era-natural-water-spring-as-part-of-75-years-of-country-s-independence-programme-101641397709160.html

Modi’s Punjab visit was cut short after a “major security lapse” as he was stranded on a flyover for 20 minutes due to a blockade by protesters, prompting the Union Home Ministry to seek an immediate report from the state government and strict action against those responsible.“The breach in security of Prime Minister reflects on mismanagement and poor state of affairs in Punjab. The Congress and Punjab government should tender an apology to the people of India,” said the chief minister in a video statement. Yogi said “The Congress has been undermining the constitutional institutions and India has seen yet another example of the same. This also reflects on the Congress and Punjab government’s conspiracy. The people of India would never allow such conspiracies to succeed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/congress-punjab-govt-should-apologise-for-lapse-in-pm-s-security-yogi-101641397288055.html

05-01-2022||Mumbai||Physical classes in colleges, varsities suspended till February 15||Mumbai Due to a surge in Covid cases, the Maharashtra government has decided to shut down physical classes in colleges and universities till February 15. The state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant made the announcement on Wednesday.He said that the examinations scheduled till February 15 will also be conducted online, except for three universities — Gondwana, Jalgaon and Nanded — where power supply is an issue.The state government also decided to allow only 50% of teaching and non-teaching staff to attend offices at colleges and universities on a rotation basis. The rest of the staff will have to work from home. This is being done to ensure they are not infected, Samant said in a virtual address on social platforms.The decision has been made applicable to all universities that include deemed, self-financed and private universities, according to the higher and technical education minister.The daily cases in Maharashtra crossed 18,000 on Tuesday. Going by the projections of the state health department, the active cases will breach 2,00,000-mark in the third week of this month and 3,00,000-mark by the first week of February.“The safety of students, teaching and non-teaching staff is of utmost importance for us. Following the directives of the chief minister, we have decided to stop physical classes in colleges and universities until February 15. The exams scheduled in this period will also be held online. The decision on the examination scheduled to be conducted post February 15 will be taken in the coming days,” Samant said while making the announcement.On Tuesday, he held a review meeting of the Covid situation with district collectors and divisional commissioners along with the vice-chancellors of the universities to understand the ground situation.Samant stressed on the need for vaccination of students between the age group of 15 to 18 years and teaching and non-teaching staff who are yet to be vaccinated. “Those teaching and non-teaching staff who are yet to be vaccinated will be directed to get inoculated as early as possible. Since the Centre has allowed children between 15-18 years of age, it means colleges and polytechnics need to ensure their first and second-year students are vaccinated. This can be done by holding vaccination camps in consultation with district collectors,” the higher and education minister.“We want to reopen colleges and varsities after February 15 and want students, parents, teachers and non-teaching staff to cooperate with the state government by following all Covid norms so that third wave can subside at the earliest,” he added.City colleges welcome moveThe state government’s decision has brought cheer and relief to students as well as colleges, many of who have personally contracted Covid in the last one week.While the official announcement by the state government came only on Wednesday, several colleges had already decided to move their physical classes into online mode amidst rising cases. “We reached out to the education department and enquired if the college principal can take a call to shut college and conduct online classes instead. Immediately, a decision was taken and staff and students were informed that classes, as well as ongoing practical exams, will be conducted online only,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal KC College, Churchgate. Post-Christmas break, all classes starting January 3 have been conducted online and the non-teaching staff has been requested to attend college at 50% attendance only.“Every second person in our college was under the weather and symptoms are so similar to flu, no one was sure what they had. Post-Christmas, we decided to move classes online because only a handful of students were ready to come for physical classes. I’m glad the government took the call to shut college campuses,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College Bandra. She herself is currently unwell and is awaiting her test results, she said.In October 2021, state education minister Uday Samant announced the reopening of colleges in hybrid mode and requested colleges to bring back fully vaccinated staff and students for physical classes in a phased manner starting October 20. All MU affiliated colleges had been conducting hybrid classes since then and a handful of institutes have been conducting offline exams for smaller batches.Recently, a handful of colleges came under fire for conducting offline classes as well as exams in January. Students of Mithibai College, Narsee Monjee College as well as the Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS) have been raising objections against the decision of respective college managements for conducting physical exams amidst rising Covid-19 cases among students and staff.“There have been cases where students have caught the virus by attending lectures and despite bringing this to the notice of college authorities, nothing was changing. We are glad the government finally gave clarity in this matter and shut down college campuses,” said the parent of a student of NMIMS.Krutika Desai, principal of Mithibai College in Vile Parle told HT that the institute has been taking all necessary steps to ensure students’ safety. “Every protocol on paper is being followed religiously and despite that, a student tested positive after failing to avoid public functions a day before exams. Our college has been insisting on physical exams for the advantage of students but now with the latest announcement, we might have to opt for postponement of offline exams,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/physical-classes-in-colleges-varsities-suspended-till-february-15-101641394343067.html
05-01-2022||Chandigarh||Theaterisation of armed forces cannot be left to military alone||The death of General Bipin Rawat in a helicopter crash on December 8 has brought the discussion of military modernisation to our drawing rooms. There is an apprehension that the demise of the chief of defence staff (CDS) of the Indian armed forces may cause a setback to military modernisation, which is not without reason. The department of military affairs is a new set-up and the CDS had his plate full. An important issue under modernisation has been theaterisation of the military. The Kargil committee report had recommended the need to have a permanent CDS for better jointmanship. Theaterisation is a step beyond that. It implies the distribution of the army, navy and air force component on theatre basis, under a single commander. World over, theaterisation of the military has been a sticky issue because of the inter-service perceptions and turf issues. The US Government had to pass an Act called Goldwater-Nicholas Act to make its military agree to theaterisation. Our politicians are not so well-versed with military intricacies. The government assumed that the CDS should be able to take care of all inter-service issues, including theaterisation. However, according to the initial charter, the CDS had no operational role, which was left to the service chiefs. General Rawat in due course came to a conclusion that the theatre commanders may have to report to the CDS, which indeed makes the CDS an operational commander. This arrangement could put the entire military under one military man, the CDS. In the US, the theatre commanders report to the defence secretary (defence minister), not to the chairman joint chiefs of staff, who is the equivalent of our CDS. US model has some good lessons In the theaterisation context, the US model has some good lessons, especially for a big military like ours. The US army consists of 4.8 lakh personnel on active duty, air force 3.3 lakh, navy 3.36 lakh and US marines 1.8 lakh. The air force and navy are equipment heavy forces; therefore, manpower figures only indicate their size, not actual capability. However, these figures are useful, when we compare them with our military. We have the third largest military in the world, 12 lakh army personnel, 1.4 lakh air force personnel and 70,000 navy personnel. The US has no land disputes like ours but its military operates around the globe. Though their active commitment at all times is not as much as the Indian Army’s, the US has divided its military into six theatre commands and five functional commands. Only the US Marines are a truly integrated force that operates around the globe, its nucleus is from the infantry. The US has managed its theaterisation concept by decentralising the command and control, and increasing the number of 4-star Generals. The US army has 15 four-star Generals, air force 11, navy nine and marine corps three. The senior most 4-Star General is chairman joint chiefs of staff. He has the chiefs of the army, air force, navy and marines under him. He is the adviser to the defence secretary (defence minister) and the President. However, the chairman JCS has no operational responsibilities. The respective service chiefs too have no operational responsibilities. They primarily look after training, equipment and manpower issues. The chain of operational command in the US military flows directly from the President and defence secretary to theatre commanders, who are also 4-star Generals or equivalent. Division of military area of responsibility The Indian military does not operate around the globe like the US military but our land borders are long and disputed. Therefore, India has a big military, particularly army. Indian military has just three 4-star Generals and a CDS. We possibly cannot fit our theaterisation model under just four Generals. One way to solve this problem is, the way the US has done. Division of military area of responsibility into theatres, not only makes it more manageable, it becomes easy to decide whether a particular theatre should be commanded by the army, navy or air force officer, because that gets decided to a large extent at the time of creation of the theatres, which is based on the nature of operations in that particular theatre. For example, in the US, the Indo-Pacific Command has always been commanded by the navy, space command and transportation command by the air force. The Central, African, Southern and Special Operations Commands have been mostly commanded by the army or marines. To satisfy all its services, the US had initially conceived that chairman JCS would be in rotation. In actual fact, of the 20 chairman JCS so far since 1949, 10 have been from the army and two from the marines. One man can’t be master of all 3 services Our biggest disputes being land-centric, it was logical for General Rawat to have concluded that the Indian military needs to have two theatre commands for China and Pakistan borders, one maritime theatre command and one air defence command. China and Pakistan theatres will need to be commanded by army officers, maritime theatre by a naval officer and air defence theatre by an air force officer. A little problem with our theaterisation model conceived by General Rawat is, our corps commanders and equivalent are 3-star, our army commanders are also 3-star and our theatre commanders too have been envisioned to be 3-star. They are unlikely to make a happy functional hierarchy. If we are to cut army commanders out, none of the services will be happy. The promotion pyramid in the military is already too steep. This problem can be solved if our theatre commanders are made 4-star like the US military. It is not clear if the Government of India will be comfortable making all theatre commanders report to one military man, the CDS. It may also not be the most professional option because it is not possible for one man to become a master of all three services. The theatre commanders could report directly to the defence minister like the US. The variation from the US model could be that the CDS may also be present during such briefings. In that case, whether the CDS is from the army or air force or navy, it really wouldn’t matter. This kind of model could solve most of our problems. This major inter-service issue had been entrusted to the CDS in the past. The CDS could not have taken such far-reaching decisions on his own. If we don’t make theatre commanders 4-star and the operations continue to be under the service chiefs, the army chief in particular will have a lot on his hands, including the theatre air component, which may nullify the theaterisation advantage. According to the present indications, if the CDS appointment is to be rotated between the three services, then the service chiefs or the theatre commanders will need to accompany the CDS, when he goes to brief the defence minister. There is no harm in that. A single point adviser is a mirage. US chairman JCS appears to be so, but actually he is not a single point adviser because the theatre commanders are reporting directly to the defence secretary. Our present CDS model is meant for small militaries. The Kargil Committee had worked on a limited mandate, which did not include theaterisation. The government needs to take the call before this issue delays the modernisation any further. npshira@gmail.comThe writer retired as deputy chief of army staff.

05-01-2022||Dehradun||Uttarakhand high court asks EC to consider ban on large rallies amid Covid surge||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday asked the Election Commission of India (ECI) to consider banning large public meetings and allowing only virtual rallies for the state assembly elections expected to be held next month. “Let the Election Commission of India consider issuing appropriate directions prohibiting a large public rallies for ensuing the election for the Uttarakhand State Legislative Assembly. The Election Commission shall also consider for issuing appropriate directions for campaigning in virtual mode. We also request the Election Commission of India to consider the alternative of virtual voting in future,” a division bench comprising chief justice Sanjaya Kumar Mishra and justice Alok Kumar Sharma said on an oral prayer by a petitioner, Sachdanand Dabral, during a hearing on management of Covid-19 cases in the state.“The ECI has been directed to file its response by January 12, when the matter has been listed for next hearing”, said lawyer Shobit Saharia, who represented the election commission.Also Read: Omicron variant watch: Fast, even if not as furious, needs disciplined responseThis is the second time in less than a fortnight that a high court has nudged ECI to consider barring public rallies against the backdrop of growing concerns over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus disease. On December 23, the Allahabad high court advised ECI and Centre to defer elections to the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, and in case it decides to go ahead, to ban rallies and public meetings. The election commission decided to stick to its schedule on UP elections after a meeting with political parties in the state.Chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra told reporters on December 30 that a decision on curtailing big political rallies and holding virtual rallies will be taken according to the Covid graph.Last year, ECI came in for severe criticism over the conduct of assembly elections in West Bengal -- Covid protocols were not followed by all parties involved for much of the campaign -- which coincided with the second wave of the pandemic.Lawyer Shiv Bhatt, who appeared for petitioner Sachdanand Dabral, said he argued for postponing the elections or allowing political parties to hold only virtual rallies in view of the rising Covid cases.Bhatt said he told the court that 97 elections have been postponed across the world. “I also apprised the court about Arvind Kejriwal’s public rally in Dehradun after which he tweeted, he was Covid-positive”, he said.Bhatt said ECI was made a party in the case on December 29, and its lawyer told to obtain instructions from the commission on the plea.Uttarakhand has 654 active Covid-19 cases including 8 cases that have been confirmed to be of the Omicron variant.Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Dehradun based Social Development for Communities (SDC) Foundation said it is a welcome development. “And by the time ECI comes up with its response, political parties should also come up with their stand on how they want to proceed at a time when cases are rising. They should also come up with their own guidelines for safe political activity and campaigns so that political rallies don’t emerge as the epicentre of Covid-19 spread,” he said.

Also read: Punjab CM denies lapse in security during PM Modi’s Ferozepur visit“Apne CM ko thanks kehna, ki mein Bathinda airport tak zinda laut paaya (Say thanks to your CM that I was able to return to Bathinda airport alive),” Modi was quoted by news agency ANI as having told state government officials at the airport before flying back to New Delhi. Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, however, denied any security lapse, saying that PM Modi’s decision to take the road route from Bathinda to the martyrs’ memorial at Hussainiwala near Ferozepur was taken at the last moment about which his government was not aware. The home ministry has taken cognisance of the “serious security lapse” and has sought a detailed report from the state government. The state government has also been asked to fix responsibility for this lapse and take strict action. The Home Ministry said in a statement that PM Modi landed at Bathinda on Wednesday morning from where he was to go to the National Martyrs Memorial at Hussainiwala by helicopter. Due to rain and poor visibility, the Prime Minister waited for about 20 minutes for the weather to clear out. The statement said that when the weather did not improve, it was decided that he would visit the National Marytrs Memorial via road, which would take more than two hours. The Prime Minister proceeded to travel by road after necessary confirmation of security arrangements by the Punjab Police chief Sidharth Chattopadhyay. Around 30 km from the National Martyrs Memorial in Hussainiwala, when the Prime Minister’s convoy reached a flyover, it was found that the road was blocked by protesters. The Prime Minister was stuck on the flyover for 15-20 minutes. “This was a major lapse in the security of the Prime Minister. The PM’s schedule and travel plan was communicated well in advance to the Punjab Government. As per procedure, they have to make necessary arrangements for logistics, security as well as keep a contingency plan ready,” the statement said. “Also in view of the contingency plan, the Punjab government has to deploy additional security to secure any movement by road, which was clearly not deployed. After this security lapse, it was decided to head back to Bathinda airport,” it added. BJP chief JP Nadda said, “The state police was instructed to prevent people from attending the rally. A large number of buses were stranded because of the high-handedness of the police and in connivance with the protesters.” Nadda also slammed Channi and said he “refused to get on the phone”. “To make matters worse, CM Channi refused to get on the phone to either address the matter or solve it. The tactics used by the Congress government in Punjab would pain anyone who believes in democratic principles,” Nadda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/apne-cm-ko-thanks-kehna-ki-mein-bathinda-airport-tak-zinda-laut-paaya-pm-modi-101641385642517.html

Due to rain and poor visibility, the PM waited for about 20 minutes for the weather to clear out.”“When the weather did not improve, it was decided that he would visit the National Martyrs Memorial via road, which would take more than two hours. He proceeded to travel by road after necessary confirmation of necessary security arrangements by the DGP (director general of police) Punjab Police,” it added.The statement went on to say that “around 30km away from the National Martyrs Memorial in Hussainiwala, when the PM’s convoy reached a flyover, it was found that the road was blocked by some protesters”, resulting in the convoy being stuck there for 15-20 minutes, which was a major lapse in his security.Modi was scheduled to address a rally in Ferozepur and lay the foundation stone of multiple development projects worth more than ₹42,750 crore.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president J P Nadda accused the Congress government in Punjab of using “all tricks to scuttle” PM Modi’s programmes, including the Ferozepur rally.Fearing a resounding defeat at the hands of the electorate, the Congress Government in Punjab tried all possible tricks to scuttle the PM @narendramodi Ji’s programmes in the state.He said in a series of tweets that Modi’s rally was called off and another programme disrupted as protesters blocked his route breaching the security protocol. He termed the security lapse as “extremely worrisome” incident.“Protesters were given access to the Prime Minister’s route while the Punjab CS (chief secretary) and DGP gave assurances to SPG (Special Protection Group) that the route is clear. To make matters worse, CM (Charanjit Singh) Channi refused to get on the phone to either address the matter or solve it. The tactics used by the Congress government in Punjab would pain anyone who believes in democratic principles,” Nadda said in a tweet.The BJP president alleged the state police was instructed to prevent people from attending Modi’s rally and a large number of buses were stranded because of the high-handedness of the police in connivance with the protesters.“In doing so, they did not bother that the prime minister was to pay tributes to Bhagat Singh and other freedom fighters, and lay the foundation stone for key development works,” the BJP president said.“By their cheap antics, the Congress government in Punjab has shown that they are anti-development and have no respect for freedom fighters too” he added, alleging that it was done as the ruling party in the state fears a resounding defeat in the upcoming assembly polls.Elections in Punjab are likely to be announced shortly.“It is sad that the PM’s visit to launch development projects worth thousands of crores for Punjab was disrupted. But we will not let such cheap mentality hinder progress of Punjab and will continue the effort for the development of Punjab,” Nadda tweeted.Senior Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala hit back at Nadda for his comments in a series of tweets. He wrote, “Stop losing cool and all sense of propriety. Please remember… 10,000 security personnel were deployed for the PM’s rally. All arrangements were made in tandem with SPG and other agencies. The route was carved even for all buses of BJP workers from Haryana and Rajasthan.”Dear Naddaji,Stop losing cool & all sense of propriety.

05-01-2022||Pune||Sutradhara’s Tales: When rhinoceros, tigers and elephants roamed Pune city’s grounds||You might think that I am referring to really old prehistoric era here when such animals might have roamed in Pune’s environs; and that should not surprise anyone. But hold on, I am not talking about some ancient past, but merely three century old Pune’s landscape. And though Pune might have been greener than today, it would not sustain natural population of rhinoceros back then. So, which animals am I referring to? I am referring to Shikharkhana of medieval period in 18th century situated right in the heart of the Pune city. Medieval kings, nobles and commanders are particularly known for practicing hunting as a sport and maintaining elaborate menageries for purpose of entertainment and curiosity. Hunting as a sport trained kings, commanders and soldiers to effectively practice for war. May it be tracking the wild animals, launching ambush, close combat with animal, alert surveillance and monitoring, sport of hunting offered many avenues to keep one’s reflexes and rigour sharp for the battlefield. The act of heroism and sense of achievement provided for entertainment and leisure. Tender meat of various animals was coveted, too. In areas bordering large wilderness and wildlife populations, culling of vermin and wild animals such as wild boar and wolves was required by the farming people. Hunting as a sport is a great indicator of participants’ temperament, flexibility, reflexes on ground and courage. It also helped in building trust amongst troops and singled out the cowards who would be most likely to deflect. And yet, many treatises on statecraft advise against excess indulgence in gaming and hunting. Mughal emperors such as Akbar and Jahangir are particularly fond of hunting as well as collecting various animals. We come across rich repository of medieval miniature paintings from Jahangir’s court illustrating various birds and animals, including some as extraordinary as a “Dodo” bird. Raja Shri Shahu Chhatrapati I who was brought up in Delhi court was particularly fond of gaming and would spend majority of time in hunting camps across forest country. Ministers would seek his council in such camps from where he is known to have operated crucial state affairs. Of the eighteen operating factories (karkhana) of the state, “Rajya-vyavahar-kosh” authored by Raghunath Pant Amatya enlists “Shikarkhana” as important unit. Many areas in kingdom were reserved as gaming sanctuaries eg Radhanagari wildlife reserve. Fish pools were specially reserved and guarded for fishing season. Bajirao Peshwa I had issued a hunting ban and appointed guards in area between Jejuri to Purandar to specially reserve the wildlife stock for Chhatrapati Shahu’s customary visit in 1731. Nanasaheb Peshwa personally writes to Chimaji Appa to gather Patils in Pratapgad region for Chhatrapati Shahu’s gaming adventure. Peshwa archival records are full of references to various wild animals procured and trained as keepsake and hunting aid. Daily diaries of Peshwa notes “Two Baaj (peregrine falcons) and one Chitta (cheetah) were send as a gift to Shahu maharaj” by Bajirao Pehshwa I. Pure breeds of hounds were specially sought out by Shahu maharaj and Peshwas have known to send as many as 40 hounds in one package to be trained as hunting dogs. Peshwas are known to have fetched some extremely rare animals and birds such as Kasturi mriga (Alpine deer) and Himalayan variety of pheasants to Shahu through contacts in the northern states. The belief prevalent in those days that the” shadow of Himalayan pheasant bird ensures kingship” made Tipu Sultan install a replica of Himalayan pheasant on umbrella above his royal seat. Though Nanasaheb Peshwa is not known for his particular hunting prowess, one finds eloquent references to Shikarkhana established by him at Pune, in various Marathi Powadas (heroic eulogised poetry) of local bards. Shahir Shivram Pimpalgaonkar describes choicest of wild fauna in Nanasaheb’s Shikharkhana such as rhinoceros, fierce tigers, sambar, deer, blackbucks and falcons specially trained for hunting, lions and other creatures. The vacant plot between Sarasbaug, Lotan baug, Parvati hill and Vitthalwadi was then assigned to Shikarkhana by Nanasaheb Peshwa. Island in Sarasbaug lake was already home to various cranes and migratory birds. “Pilkhana” of Peshwas stocked the elephants which would be put to use in battles as well as hunting expeditions. Letters were dispatched all across India to fetch wild animals and birds of most extraordinary nature to populate the Shikarkhana. A letter to Vitthal Shivdeo mentions orders fetching bird called “Chakor” who is mythically known to feed on moonlight. It is in reality the “Chukar”, a rock partridge and gaming bird found in temperate belt of India. Karnaji Shinde, commander of fort Mahuli, was ordered to capture young ones of peacocks, Indian Gaur and wild boars and transferred to Pune. Special events of wild combat were hosted for entertainment of state’s guests. Record from elder Madhavrao’s wedding ceremony informs us of a special event of tiger-elephant combat hosted by Nanasaheb Peshwa which resulted in death of one tiger. The archives also list number of occupations related to Shikarkhana and their wages where various animal trainers are named as Kabutarbaaj (pigeon trainers), Kuttewan (dog trainers), Chhitewan (Cheetah trainers), Haranbaaj (deer trainers), Mirshikar (falcon trainers), Shahagoshwale (carcal and lynx trainers), Fadaitwale (noose and trap makers) and so on. The details of “khurak” (daily feed) for large animals such as tigers, lions and elephants find mention along with the expenses. These records reflect keen understanding of breeding, general behaviour and upkeep of various animals, bird species and signify the particular utilitarian association with wildlife. Skins of tigers, lion, rhinoceros and crocodiles were curated for display purposes or making of expensive artefacts. Other ministers and Peshwa family members are known to own their smaller and personal menageries near their residence. Beautiful birds and small mammals were kept as pets by female folks. Shikarkhana at Pune suffered a heavy damaged during Nizam’s attack on Pune in 1763. Madhavrao Peshwa resurrected Pune and re-established Shikarkhana, but he himself was too busy in campaigns to seek past time at Shikarkhana. It was during Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa’s term that Shikarkhana at Pune enjoyed its golden days. We shall delve on Sawai Madhavrao’s special affection towards wildlife in the next column.

It said that the six who were arrested include a fugitive wanted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Haryana Police.The arrests were made following raids in Mumbai, Delhi, Gurugram and Jaipur. Fifteen laptops and nine mobile phones were seized from the arrested persons, the IFSO said.Deputy police commissioner (IFSO) KPS Malhotra said one of the arrested people, Raj Teotia, carried ₹1 lakh reward on his head by the Haryana Police. The racket allegedly helped a candidate score 780 out of 800 in the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). Teotia allegedly took the help of Russian hackers to access examination portals, said Malhotra.“Teotia was in touch with Russian hackers and also visited Russia in 2018. Russian hackers stayed at his place during the [Covid-19] lockdown,” said Malhotra. He added the alleged racket accessed the examination through remote access and downloaded the disguised remote access software, which was not detected by the safety measures. They developed a tool to remotely access the online examination system developed by a reputed IT company.“Members of the syndicate connived with lab owners, got the tool installed through LAN, and later accessed the systems through remote access. They opened several online examination labs for this purpose,” said Malhotra.The Delhi Police were expected to later hold a press conference on the racket.

05-01-2022||Chandigarh||Drugs case: No interim protection for Akali leader Majithia for now||Shiromani Akali Dal leader and former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia, 46, failed to get interim protection from the Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday. Also read: Punjab govt trying to book Majithia in another fake case: YAD chiefThe high court bench of justice Lisa Gill heard his plea for one-and-a-half hours but did not pass an order on interim protection and sought response from the Punjab government by January 10, lawyers said. The detailed order is awaited. Supreme Court advocate Mukul Rohatgi appeared for Majithia and former Union minister P Chidambaram for the state government. Mohali court had dismissed Majithia’s bail plea On December 24, a Mohali court had dismissed Majithia’s plea, observing that though his claims are of political vendetta but he himself was a powerful person in state politics till 2017 during the Shiromani Akali Dal’s rule. Majithia was booked by Punjab Police on December 20 under cognizable sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, including Sections 25 (punishment for allowing premises), 27 (A) (whoever is financing any activities pertaining to narcotic drugs) and 29 (party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence). Majithia’s whereabouts are not known. The plea says the FIR is an “election stunt” and for the purpose, the government has changed three Punjab Police chiefs in three months The Bureau of Investigation has also seen three departmental heads change. It also accuses Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu of indulging in “unwarranted propaganda” and deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa of demonstrating “intense hatred” towards Majithia. While rejecting his plea, the Mohali court had observed that the delay in lodging the criminal case against Majithia cannot be a ground to presume that the whole case is false. His name cropped up in 2014 and the SAD was in power till February 2017. Special judge Sandeep Kumar Singla also said that the FIR has been registered on the basis of a report that prima facie shows the “involvement” of the applicant in the drug trade and harbouring of accused involved in the drug mafia. The question on legality of the criminal case, whether it is borne out of political vendetta or not, cannot be a ground for granting anticipatory bail, Singla had held. Plea cites ‘political interests’ of rivalsThe plea claims Siddharth Chattopadhyaya was given the additional charge of DGP only to act as a “tool to advance the political interests” of the present government. The plea also referred to the controversy involving ADGP SK Asthana, claiming that he refused to investigate the matter and raised questions whether the matter can be investigated, STF report being sealed before the court; superseded by other reports and whether investigation can be initiated without the permission of the court. The plea says the report of the special task force (STF), which is the basis of the FIR, was either superseded or merged with the subsequent report of a state government committee. But this fact was ignored and the FIR was registered. Moreover, in the entire lengthy FIR no fresh evidence has been collected or statement recorded, it says, adding that in all drug cases registered, trials have been concluded with the acquittal of some accused and the conviction of others. None of the accused made any reference of the petitioner, it says.

Check new timings||Taking stock of rising Covid-19 cases, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has decided to extend the night curfew timings in the state by two hours. The night curfew in Uttar Pradesh has now been revised as 10pm to 6am, instead of the earlier 11pm to 5am.The decision was taken in a late-night meeting on Tuesday which Adityanath held with Team 9 - a group of top officials constituted by the chief minister to devise a plan to keep Covid-19 under check - as the number of coronavirus disease infection crossed the 3,000-mark.The night curfew was imposed on December 25 and will remain effective till January 14, as per the latest guidelines.Additionally, restrictions have been decided for public spaces in any district reporting more than 1,000 cases.“Public places like gyms, spas, cinema halls, banquet halls, restaurants etc should be operated at 50% capacity in districts where the minimum number of active cases exceeds 1,000,” said chief minister Yogi Adityanath at the review meeting.From January 6, in marriage ceremonies and other events, not more than 100 people will be permitted in closed places at a time. “The presence of people in excess of 50% of the total capacity of the ground should not be allowed in open space.

05-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiites shift wedding venues to NCR amid curbs||As per the restrictions under yellow alert in Delhi, a maximum of 20 guests are allowed at wedding events, organised in court or at home only. This has many rushing to shift their weddings to the NCR and other cities without such curbs. Raghubir Singh from a Delhi-based event company, shares, “Delhi mein kaam thap hai. Many are shifting venues to NCR or opting for cities like Jaipur.” This has led to shortage of venue options in NCR, too. Salil Chaudhry, an event planner from Delhi, says, “About 80-99% business has been shifted out of Delhi. But the saaya is so heavy from January 15 to February end that venues aren’t available now!” Destination weddings seem more feasible to some, amid these issues. Take for instance, Ramesh Dagar, a businessman from Delhi, who says, “I shifted my daughter’s wedding to Udaipur (Rajasthan). A gathering of 200 people is allowed there.” Meanwhile, city-based wedding planner, Jivika Mehra, says, “People have cancelled most functions for January. Even for February, they’re holding back planning till mid-January to decide about changing their venues.”Some have even booked non-saaya dates (January 1-13) to accommodate the last minute changes. Rudhir Sharma, an event planner from Gurugram, says, “Guests from Delhi are choosing non-saaya dates for weddings in the NCR as saaya dates were already booked. The rush for wedding venues in the NCR has surged since the restrictions were announced in Delhi, as people don’t want to wait to get married any more.” “We are at the end of two financial years and Covid has crippled the industry and Haryana has been lenient in terms of giving those small numbers to the industry. Either people are postponing their events, or they are doing it in small numbers and shifting it out of Delhi. It’s a 50-50, wherein some are holding their functions outside of Delhi with a good pomp and show, and some are doing it at home wherein they just want to finish the formalities,” says Puneet Gupta, MD Tivoli Gardens/Tivoli Garden Resort Hotel.

05-01-2022||Mumbai||3rd wave won’t overwhelm Mumbai hospitals: TIFR model||The cases in the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic driven by the Omicron variant will peak between January 6 to 13 in Mumbai, and the fatalities by February, according to a modelling and data analysis carried out by scientists at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR).The analysis showed that in comparison with the second wave, the third surge will be manageable for the city as it will not overwhelm the medical facilities in terms of hospitalisations and oxygen requirements.The simulator model has been developed by Sandeep Juneja and Daksh Mittal from the School of Technology and Computer Science, TIFR. While they have used this model to make projections during the first and second waves, the current analysis has been carried out after introducing the Omicron variant into the simulator.The model has projected a timeline of the peak, but the scientists have refrained from projecting the number of cases. “It’s difficult to project the numbers because they largely depend on the testing strategy and who is getting tested, but our modelling shows that the peak hospitalisations will be about 50% to 70% of what we saw during the Delta wave,” said Juneja. He added that they have taken into account the bed occupancy in Dedicated Covid Hospitals and Dedicated Covid Health Centres as around 18,000 during the peak of the second wave.Also Read | Maharashtra reports massive spike with over 18k new cases, Mumbai tally up too“The fatalities too will be around 30% to 50% of what we saw during the peak in the second wave,” he said. He added that they have taken into account 90 deaths as the highest single-day toll of the second wave. “So, we may see somewhere between 30 to 45 deaths in a peak day in this wave,” he said.Based on available international data, their analysis assumes that the chances of hospitalisation with Omicron will be reduced by 70% among those who were fully vaccinated as well as had a previous Covid-19 infection compared to the susceptible. The chances were reduced by 55% for those who were fully vaccinated but were uninfected. The susceptible in turn is much less likely to be hospitalised in comparison to Delta. There are also 20% fewer chances of getting symptoms when infected with Omicron compared to the delta, the analysis said.Juneja highlighted certain caveats. Besides taking into account the data released by the civic body, they have based their assumptions on data from South Africa and the UK. “We don’t really have Indian data. We are assuming that 35% of people who have recovered from the disease are amenable to reinfections. But it’s just one of the many scenarios that have been considered in South Africa which we are going by. We have also assumed that Omicron is two times more infectious than the Delta variant, an assumption that is not fully established as yet,” said Juneja. He added that these points should be considered as caveats.“It would be ideal to have time series of Indian data on what percentage of the new cases are fully vaccinated or vaccinated with a single shot or those who were previously infected. That data would have helped us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3rd-wave-won-t-overwhelm-mumbai-hospitals-tifr-model-101641356718566.html

05-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiwale: The peepal you should meet||It is an old city with many katras and kuchas. Each kucha has many gallis. Each galli has many havelis and homes. And each home is as intricate as any old city with its own domestic katras and kuchas.Such is the comprehensiveness of this peepal tree. A giant landmark standing on platform No. 1 of central Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station, the peepal is without doubt the grandest sight at the rail terminus. It is taller than Route Relay Cabin, the three-storey concrete edifice that soars just behind it. In fact, the building’s staircase runs perpendicular to the tree, as if it were expressly built to mount the tall leafy giant.The tree starts its long journey upwards (and sidewards) from a thick broad trunk, which bifurcates into a series of branches. Each of these branches have fashioned itself after the parent trunk and bifurcates into several more branches. Everyone of those branches, in turn, splits into sub-branches. Indeed, this tree is like the sacred Ganga — a single stream in the Himalayas culminating into the Bay of Bengal as a latticework of tributaries.No doubt, there must be other rail stations in the Delhi region with extraordinary trees. Gurugram railway station has quite a few of them, and among them the densest is a banyan on platform No. 2. That tree is a delight, not just for humans. Squirrels race with one another along its narrow, twisty sub-branches. The foliage constantly swells with bird sounds, but you can barely spot the birds in the dark leafy jungle.The banyan of Gurugram station is majestic. But this peepal at Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station has its majesty enhanced by its extraordinarily lean if twirly grace.Since the tree stands far beyond the limits of the station’s tin shed, it receives direct sunshine, and at certain times in the afternoon, it turns into a kaleidoscope of ever-changing iridescence. Winter mornings are ideal for lounging under the sun-entangled canopy.The peepal is so huge that some of its branches extend almost towards the rail tracks. Centuries ago, the Yamuna flowed along the path of these very tracks. Can this peepal be ancient enough to have stood on the banks of the river that has now drifted east? This chilly evening, a train to Kurukshetra is waiting to depart. After some minutes, the only human left in the vicinity is restroom attendant Mr Narender. Stationed outside the “Pay-and-Use Deluxe Toilet”, his face is turned away from the tree.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-peepal-you-should-meet-101641342408703.html

Her application was rejected multiple times stating that the father's caste certificate is not present.Aam Admi Party (AAP) MLA Vishesh Ravi had been pursuing this matter with the Revenue Department, Social Welfare Department and Department for the Welfare of SC/ST of Delhi. He wrote a series of letters to the Revenue Department officials and had multiple meetings with officials.He had also raised this issue in the Delhi Legislative Assembly highlighting the suffering of single SC/ST mothers in 2020. The circular to amend the procedure for the issuance of the SC/ST caste certificate based on the single mother's caste certificate was issued on July 20, 2020, with the prior approval of the Revenue Minister of GNCT Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/manish-sisodia-hands-over-first-caste-certificate-issued-on-mother-s-credentials-101641340440497.html

At least 15,000 pilgrims visited the cave shrine on Tuesday. “Only seven to eight sorties were possible this morning and thereafter poor visibility compelled the operators to suspend the helicopter service to the shrine,” an official said. A white blanket of snow covered the higher reaches of hills in Doda and Kishtwar while the temperature dipped across the region. Low visibility behind flight cancellationAs many as 42 flights which were scheduled to take off or land at Srinagar International Airport were cancelled on Tuesday owing to low visibility due to snowfall, which prompted former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah to point out lack of ‘proper landing aids’ at the facility. Officials of the Airport Authority of India said majority of the flights were cancelled after snow and rain lashed Srinagar and other parts of Kashmir valley, thus reducing visibility. “Forty-two flights were cancelled out of the scheduled 44 due to low visibility at the airport owing to bad weather. The remaining two flights are scheduled for late evening and we will see whether they can be operated,” said Srinagar airport director Kuldeep Singh. The mass cancellations drew harsh reactions from many, including National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah.“Our international airport has no landing aids that enable the runway to remain open when visibility dips. We make such a big deal about tourism & investment promotion now imagine the plight of those tourists who’ve sat all day outside the terminal & watched their flights get cancelled (sic),” Abdullah said in a tweet.He claimed that travelling in and out of Kashmir was not a pleasant experience.“Not to mention the locals who will have their tickets cancelled & be told to buy fresh ones with fares that touch the stratosphere. Travel into & out from the valley in winter is not a pleasant experience,” he tweeted.The airport is under the operational control of the Indian Air Force (IAF) while the Airport Authority of India controls only the boarding and lodging operations. Some people said that the airport authorities have failed to deliver.“Only divine intervention can help people fly in and out of Kashmir in bad weather. @SrinagarAirport has failed to deliver on its tall claims of international standards,” said a radio host, Nasir Khan.Srinagar airport, meanwhile, in a series of tweets said, “Continuous snow fall and poor visibility resulted in 42 cancellations today across all airlines. The visibility has now improved and the flights are operating.” “All the passengers of the cancelled flights shall be rescheduled in the next available flight of the concerned airlines. There will be no extra charges for rescheduling. The passengers may also opt for full refund at their convenience (sic).”Important helpline numbersThe Jammu administration has issued a list of important helpline numbers.

05-01-2022||Chandigarh||Panchayat in Shimla district wages a war on ‘chitta’ and its users||At a time when drug addiction is on the rise, villagers in quaint Jharag have waged a war on ‘chitta’, a highly addictive synthetic drug made from heroin and other substances. The panchayat of Jharag in Shimla district’s Jubbal and Kotkhai assembly segment has brought a resolution to reward people providing information about drug peddlers active in the area. Jharag is famous for its local deity Nageshwar Devta’s temple and has a population of about 1,800. The panchayat comprises five villages. “For quite some time, reports have been pouring in about drug peddlers from nearby areas trying to lure the youth from our panchayat to buy drugs. Some unknown vehicles which do not belong to the locals have been frequenting the villages as well,” said panchayat pradhan Ashok Sarta, adding that drug addiction was certainly a cause of concern“The panchayat passed a resolution with unanimity to fight the drug menace and also expose the peddlers from nearby villages and panchayats,” he said. “The panchayat will reward those giving information about the drug peddlers. We have also formed a team of teenagers from different wards to keep tabs on the addicts as well as the local smugglers and suppliers,” Sarta added. The use of drugs has increased manifolds in the urban as well as rural regions of the state. According to a survey of the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, the prevalence of the usage of charas and ganja is 1.2% in the country, while it’s higher than the national average at 3.2% in Himachal Pradesh. Similarly, the use of opioids is 2.8% in Punjab, 2.5% in Haryana, 2% in Delhi and 1.7% in Himachal Pradesh against the national average of 0.7%.But a dangerous trend in recent years has been the shift of the users to chemical drugs. According to the health department’s reports, there are nearly 1,170 patients (drug users) lodged in 27 de-addiction centres in HP. The count of those addicted to chitta (also called diacetylmorphine, a semi-synthetic adulterated form of heroin) has surpassed that of cannabis (charas) and other hard drugs as 34.61% of the addicts in the centres are chitta consumers. Another major cause for concern, according to the same report, is that the highest number of addicts are in the age group of 15-30 years. “There been a significant rise in the consumption of synthetic drugs among the youths. Not only boys, but girls too are falling prey to addiction,” said Dinesh Sharma, head of psychiatry department in the state’s premier institute Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC). The hospital runs a special outdoor patient department (OPD) for addicts on Saturdays. “The trend of using injectable drugs is growing among the youth, particularly in the age group between 17 and 25 years,” he said. It is also leading to increase in liver-related diseases like hepatitis C, he added. With illicit drug trade on the rise, Himachal Pradesh Police had re-devised its strategy to catch smugglers and keep track of addicts. HP director general of police Sanjay Kundu added ‘Register 29’ in all police stations to track addicts and offenders booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The station house officers (SHOs) concerned maintain the register and create a database for analysis and better prevention of drug trafficking. The prevalence of drug addiction and trafficking is more among those aged between 26 and 35 years, who comprise 37% of the total people booked under the NDPS Act.

Taking this initiative forward, the SDMC has decided to set up a sports cell to generate interest in sports among students and provide them with high-quality training. In this series, the football training programme will begin in the Najafgarh zone. We have invited applications for football coaches on a contract basis,” he said.He also said that minimal sports infrastructure is available for students of SDMC schools. “To meet this shortfall, the education department is chalking out a plan to develop a sports complex or stadium and large playgrounds on a design, construction, operation and transfer basis. We have also decided to include sports in the curriculum at the primary level, which will ensure the physical development of our students,” he said.Bharti also said to implement the initial project, a sports cell has been formed in the SDMC, under the chairmanship of the additional commissioner (education). “The pilot project for the football training programme is going to start in Karkarola, Jharoda, Pochanpur and Surhela in the Najafagarh zone.

05-01-2022||Delhi||Indians violated orders by housing foreign Tablighi Jamaat members during pandemic: Cops to Delhi HC||The Delhi Police on Tuesday told the Delhi high court that Indian nationals, accused of housing foreign Tablighi Jamaat attendees, had violated prohibitory orders imposed on movement of persons to contain the spread of Covid-19 and had contributed to the spread of the life-threatening disease.Opposing a bunch of pleas by Indian nationals seeking to quash FIRs registered against them for housing foreigners, the city police told justice Mukta Gupta that the members of the Jamaat were supposed to be residing in Nizamuddin Markaz from March 26, 2020 to March 31, 2020 but were found to be present in Chandni Mahal area in Central Delhi on April 1, 2020.The investigating agency said that the persons accused in the present set of FIRs admitted and accommodated the members of the Jamaat on their premises after the prohibitory order on movement was issued by authorities.The information was given in a status report in response to the earlier query of the court where it had sought to know about any prohibitory orders in effect during the housing of the foreign nationals.However, counsel for the petitioners Ashima Mandla refuted the claim and said that the factual stand of the investigating agency was “incongruous”.The judge granted time to the petitioners to file a rejoinder to the police’s status report and listed the case for next hearing on February 28.“File rejoinder and written submissions on legal and factual aspects of each case. If facts are disputed, it may be a matter of trial,” the court stated.In the present set of matters, while some pleas pertain to quashing of FIRs by individuals who had provided refuge to the foreigners in their homes, others concern persons like managing committee members or caretakers of different mosques who provided housing facilities in the mosques under the jurisdiction of Chandni Mahal police station.The FIRs were registered for alleged commission of offences under Section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), Section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection) and other offences under the Indian Penal Code.In the status report filed in one of the cases, the police stated that a charge sheet had been filed in the case and informed that numerous inspections were carried out in Nizamuddin Markaz during March 26-31, 2020 in connection with another FIR and the foreign nationals in question were found to be residing there.However, in early April, it received information that several foreign nationals were residing in the Chandni Mahal area and after investigation, “it became clear that the members of the Jamaat had moved from the Markaz in Nizamuddin” which was in derogation of the prohibitory orders by the local authorities, the police claimed.It added that by accepting and allowing them to reside in the local mosque without any social distancing, the accused also breached the Delhi government order on closing religious places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/indians-violated-orders-by-housing-foreign-tablighi-jamaat-members-during-pandemic-cops-to-delhi-hc-101641330785159.html
05-01-2022||Delhi||Consider early re-testing of Covid-19 positive international travellers: Delhi HC to govt||The Delhi high court on Tuesday asked the city government to take instructions on the issue of early re-testing of international travellers who test positive for Covid-19 on arrival in case there are no guidelines by the Centre on this aspect.Justice Rekha Palli, while hearing a petition by a mother whose 18-year-old son from the United Kingdom was admitted to a private hospital here for isolation after testing positive for the virus upon his arrival, also asked the Delhi government why the genome sequencing report of the patient -- who was stated to be positive for the omicron variant-- cannot be shared with him.The judge noted that during the pendency of the petition, the petitioner’s son tested negative and was discharged from Fortis Hospital.The petitioner, however, told the court that although her son was now with her, several other patients were being held up in various health facilities for days as the hospitals were not conducting Covid-19 re-tests periodically. It was also contended that the mother has the “right to know” and should thus be given the genome sequencing report of her son.Following this, the court said, “It is expected that in case no guidelines are issued by the Union of India, the Delhi government will expeditiously consider the matter so that patients, like the petitioner’s son, do not suffer. Delhi government will also inform why the genome test report can’t be made available.”The petitioner, represented by lawyer Vikram Hegde, had moved the court last month seeking to know the outcome of the genome sequencing test carried on her son.The counsel for the hospital stated that while the Covid-19 test report has been given to the patient, the genome sequencing report, which disclosed the presence of Omicron variant, was not given to him as the same was only with the government authorities.“We don’t have a copy of the genome report. We get an excel sheet (from the authorities),” said counsel Arjun Dewan, appearing for Fortis.In response to the petitioner’s assertion that the hospital did not administer a re-test upon her son when he was admitted, the lawyer said that the hospital administration was only following the Delhi government directive that international travellers who test positive for the virus have to be re-tested on the tenth day of the first test or after three days of being asymptomatic, whichever is later.Delhi government counsel Arun Panwar said the directive was in line with the guidelines issued by the Centre and sought time to seek instructions.Central government counsel Bharati Raju stated that there was no ban on repeat RT-PCR in their guidelines.The petitioner had alleged that her son who tested positive for Covid-19 at the airport here after coming from the United Kingdom was not being discharged by the hospital for lack of clarity on the virus variant.She had claimed that in spite of her son having a mild case of Covid-19, the private hospital had not re-tested him.The matter will be heard next on January 14||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/consider-early-re-testing-of-covid-19-positive-international-travellers-delhi-hc-to-govt-101641330487133.html
05-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi court dismisses plea against NPCI, PM, imposes cost of ₹25k||A Delhi court dismissed an application filed by a man against National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI), the Prime Minister of India and other constitutional functionaries, alleging that NPCI announced the draw of a daily lottery, which is banned according to the law.According to the complaint, NPCI selected 15,000 winners in the daily and weekly draw for making digital transactions between November 9, 2016 to December 21, 2016.It was stated that the NPCI has no legal right as per law to announce the draw of daily lottery. It was further submitted that the Delhi government has already banned the lottery.On Monday, chief metropolitan magistrate Dr Pankaj Sharma imposed a fine of ₹25,000 against the man and said precious judicial time had been wasted by the complainant.The court said it is apparent that the grievance articulated by the complainant is unfounded as the persons who have been given cash incentives did not purchase lottery tickets.“It is pertinent to note that the complainant has named Constitutional functionaries as respondents which includes the Prime Minister of India also.First, he withdrew his allegations against the Constitutional functionaries, however, later on, filed an application under Section 8 of the Representation of People Act seeking their disqualification. The complainant has failed to establish his ‘locus standi’ for filing the present complaint and the subsequent application,” it said in an order on January 3.It added that cash incentives for promoting cashless transactions are a policy decision which falls within the domain of the Executive and as such interference by the court in that regard is improper.The court observed that the complaint and the subsequent application has been filed to somehow gain cheap popularity by levelling baseless allegations against Constitutional functionaries.“The complaint has no substance and the same is evidently filed and pursued with an oblique motive of hogging undue limelight for unwarranted publicity under the false pretence of public interest,” the court said while dismissing the complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-court-dismisses-plea-against-npci-pm-imposes-cost-of-25k-101641330305262.html

05-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab DGP: UPSC panel ready, Chattopadhyaya is out of top cop race||Sidharth Chattopadhyaya, the officiating director general of police (DGP), is out of the race for the post of top cop in Punjab with the Union Public Service Commission on Tuesday finalising a panel of three officials --- Dinkar Gupta, VK Bhawra and Prabodh Kumar. The UPSC is likely to send these names to Punjab government in a day or two, it is learnt. The state government will then have to choose one name for the coveted post. The names of the three officers were finalised in a meeting at the national capital. The meet was attended by Punjab chief secretary Anirudh Tiwari. Bhawara, a 1987-batch officer --- who was DGP (intelligence) during Captain Amarinder Singh’s tenure as CM --- has emerged as the frontrunner for the post. While Prabodh, a 1988- batch officer, has already written to chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi for the central deputation, Dinkar, also from the 1987 batch, was removed as the DGP by the new Congress dispensation on October 4. Also, when Prabodh was the head of the SIT formed by Amarinder government to probe the 2015 sacrilege cases, he was criticised by a section of Congress leaders for writing to the CBI to continue its inquiry despite a clean chit to dera men allegedly involved in the sacrilege by the central agency. Chattopadhyaya, a 1986-batch officer, who was being backed strongly by Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) chief Navjot Sidhu’s group and was posted as DGP on December 17 in a sudden move by replacing Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota, was desperate to be in the panel. The Supreme Court guidelines make it mandatory for the state to consider only those officers for the post of DGP who are left with minimum six months of service. In order to ensure that Chattopadhyaya’s name was on the list, the Channi government had retracted from its earlier stand conveyed to the UPSC about making October 4, 2021, as the cut-off date for the DGP’s appointment. The UPSC, however, stuck to its stand and took October 4 as the cut-off date citing that it was on this date the vacancy ( for DGP’s post) was created with the removal of Dinkar Gupta. Since Chattopadhyaya is due to retire on March 31, the October 4 cut-off has put him out of the race. There are unconfirmed reports that the Channi government is planning to challenge the UPSC’s move as it has ignored the state’s request to consider September 30 as the cut-off date. Other officers who were considered by UPSC included Sahota (1988-batch), Sanjeev Kalra and Parag Jain (1989-batch) and BK Uppal (1991-batch).

In a circular issued on Friday, the university said that starting Monday, only employees who had taken at least one dose of the vaccine will be allowed entry to their respective departments and offices. It referred to the order issued by the Delhi government in October that restricted unvaccinated government employees from entering offices. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority order issued in October made it mandatory for all Delhi government employees to get at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine by October 15. “The period of absence from duties of such employees shall be treated as ‘On Leave’ till the administration of the first dose Covid19 vaccine,” wrote university registrar Nazim Hussain Jafri in the circular.

The state government has contributed only marginally in this project. The industry is a major contributor, while both Union and state governments have given ₹15 crore and ₹7 crore grants respectively for the project,” Grewal said.“A few days ago, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu had inaugurated Pakhowal road rail under bridge, but it had to be closed by the municipal corporation later as it was incomplete,” said the SAD leader. Industry bears ₹12 cr addl cost due to delayAs the project has been inaugurated seven years after the foundation stone was laid in 2014, industrialists rued that the government is also responsible for the delay, which led to industry bearing around ₹12 crore additional cost. An industrialist, requesting anonymity, said the project commenced in 2014 but was put to halt in 2016 as the state government failed to release the subsidy. The project was then restarted in 2019 and the cost of the project increased by around ₹12 crore while it was completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianas-new-cetp-project-inaugurated-with-eye-on-punjab-elections-sad-101641329584938.html

05-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Focal Point effluent treatment plant finally inaugurated||After missing multiple deadlines, the 40 MLD Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP), for treating waste discharge of dyeing units in Focal Point, has finally seen the light of the day with its inauguration on Tuesday. The project, for which the foundation stone was laid in 2014, is aimed at reducing the pollution levels of Buddha Nullah. Cabinet minister of industries & commerce, information technology, science & technology, Gurkirat Kotli, MLA Sanjay Talwar and councillor Mamta Ashu inaugurated the project.Established at a cost of ₹96 crore, the plant will treat the waste of 62 dyeing industries in Focal Point area. Industrialists stated that around 20 MLD waste from 48 units is already being treated at the plant and rest of the units will also be attached with the plant soon.Previously, the untreated waste of the dyeing industry was flowing into Buddha Nullah through MC sewer treatment plants (STP), adding to the pollution in the seasonal stream. The MC also alleged that the defunct STP at Jamalpur had stopped functioning properly due to dumping of industrial waste in MC sewer lines. MLA Talwar said operationalising the plants will reduce the burden on MC sewer lines, which used to remain choked in the past due to excessive waste dumped by industry.Officials said only treated water will now be discharged into Buddha Nullah. They further said they are working on different proposals to use the treated water for other uses such as irrigation etc.Punjab pollution control board (PPCB) chairman Adarsh Pal Vig said establishing the plant is not less than establishing a religious building as they are working to clean the environment. Three CETPs have been proposed for the city – on Bahadurke road, Tajpur road and Focal point area. While the Bahadurke road plant has already been made operational, trials for the 50 MLD plant for Tajpur road dyeing industry are also going on and the plant will also be inaugurated soon.Minister Kotli said that CETPs are a step forward towards the aim of making ‘Green Textile’. Initiated in 2014, the project was put to halt in 2016 after the industry rued non-payment of subsidies by the government. The project was restarted in 2019 and has now been completed after missing multiple deadlines. The union and state government provided ₹15 crore and ₹7 crore each, while the rest of the amount has been spent by the industry.Industry seeks relief in terms of lease, penalty:Punjab dyers association chairperson Ashok Makkar sought a relief in the lease amount of around ₹3 crore levied on the industry for the land on which CETPs have been established. He also demanded that the department should waive off the penalty imposed on dyers for delay in completing the CETP project.‘Project will improve image of industry’One of the directors of Focal Point Special Purpose Vehicle, Rahul Verma stated that the plant will remove the blot on the image of dyeing industry that it pollutes Buddha Nullah. Further, more corporate houses and multi-national companies will want to do business with the industries here, as these will no longer be polluting the environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-focal-point-effluent-treatment-plant-finally-inaugurated-101641328925131.html
05-01-2022||Noida||Bird count in Dhanauri wetland almost double than 2021, species reduced: Survey||The third Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) for the National Capital Region (NCR), which started at the Dhanauri wetland in Greater Noida on Tuesday, recorded an increase in water birds (nearly double the last year) but a decreased number of species, said officials. The team of officials, including volunteers and forest department officials, recorded 2,459 birds and 40 species on Tuesday. These included 20 species of resident birds, and 20 species of winter migratory birds including five species of threatened birds. In 2021, the AWC recorded 1,344 birds of 48 species, which included 20 species of resident birds, and 28 species of winter migratory birds including four species of threatened birds.Some of the IUCN red-listed ‘threatened species’ recorded at Dhanauri were Black-necked Stork, Wooly-necked Stork, Sarus Crane, Black-headed Ibis and Common Pochard, said the officials. Unlike the Okhla Bird Sanctuary and the Surajpur wetland, Dhanauri wetland is an independent site, which sees a lot of winged winter visitors, but it does not enjoy any official protection from the forest department. However, the extended monsoon this year has helped the wetland in recording more birds, though the overall neglect has led to a reduction in the total number of species arriving there, added the officials.Dhanauri is a small wetland spread over an area of 101.21 hectares with crop fields, and is surrounded by several villages. Birders say “it is a good habitat for water birds” and especially for Sarus Crane (the state bird of Uttar Pradesh).“This area was explored by local birders a few years ago, but the wetland’s existence depends mainly on a good monsoon season. It often almost dries up before summer and turns into a small pond as it does not have an independent water source. The wetland revived a bit due to good rainfall last year, but it is still largely covered by water hyacinth, except a smaller open surface in the middle of it, which is now only habitat for approximately 1,300 migratory ducks and geese,” said TK Roy, Delhi state coordinator of AWC. He also said that the outer periphery of the wetland has turned into a marshland, mostly covered by aquatic weeds, and some of the areas are totally dried up and have a tall dry grassland. So, there is hardly any more space in the wetland to accommodate more water birds, Roy said.He said that the “reduced number of species” in the wetland this year could be because of several reasons such as wetland surface being covered by water hyacinth, a shrinking surrounding area, a dried-up resting area of the marshland, and cattle grazing on the grassland of the dried wetland. The AWC is one of the largest annual waterbird censuses in Asia, conducted by the Wetlands International in January in coordination with the WI South Asia and Bombay Natural History Society.

The Centre had asked UT to complete all the projects before March 2022.The major health infrastructure projects at government hospitals will take at least one more month for completion. Under the ECRP scheme, the health department is coming up with a 32-bed dedicated paediatric ICU centre at Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, which will have 12 ventilator beds and 20 beds with medical oxygen facility. Similarly, an advanced lab to conduct RT-PCR tests is also being set up.“At present, the engineering work of the building is underway and we have already procured most of the equipment. As soon as it is complete, the facility will be open to the public. Work to start RT-PCR testing at the hospital is also speeding up and both projects are expected to be complete in a month”, said Dr Suman Singh, director, health services.To increase the number if ICU beds in the city, proposals have been approved to set up 20 additional ICU beds each at civil hospital in Sector 22 and Manimajra. All of them will have a medical oxygen facility. “A memorandum of understanding has already been signed with a private firm to set up ICU beds. However, this project will be completed by March 2022,” said Dr Singh.‘Ready to tackle the surge’Dr Suman further said, “As recommended by the Centre, the UT health department had already procured and stocked up eight essential Covid-19 related drugs at a cost of ₹45.8 lakh, keeping in view the possible third wave. We have enough medicines, ICU beds and ventilators at the government hospitals to tackle the surge.” She added that the government and private hospitals have adequate medical oxygen to meet the requirement.Another ECRP scheme project, IT-hub, has been completed through which all health and wellness centres are connected to civil hospitals for tele-consultation, which will further be linked with GMSH-16 and Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32. These two hospitals are then linked to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) for tele-consultation.“The project has already started and through this facility, patients are connected with doctors, who are then connected with specialists for the consultation,” said Dr Suman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ecrp-scheme-as-covid-cases-surge-chandigarh-speeds-up-pending-projects-101641326768566.html

But later the apex court allowed the reconstruction of the temple.Devotees say that Guru Ravidas visited this place in 1509 during the reign of Sikander Lodhi.Channi said the Delhi Development Authority had recently asked the Guru Ravidas Vishram Dham Mandir Chamarwala Johar Tughlakabad Committee to deposit ₹4.33 crore for acquiring 400 square metres of land, according to an official statement.Since the amount was quite hefty, he said various delegations approached him for seeking requisite contribution from the state government.As the Punjab government is already following the ideology of Guru Ravidas in the right earnest to ensure well-being of one and all, it has now decided that it will bear the entire expense for procuring the land to construct the temple at Tughlakabad if the committee desires so, the chief minister said.Channi said he would be the most fortunate and blessed one in case the committee wishes to bestow service to the state government led by him.Terming this gesture as a humble tribute by the Punjab government to Guru Ravidas, Channi said Guru Ravidas made tireless efforts for bringing social awakening through ethos of equality and harmony.Referring to ‘bani’ of Guru Ravidas included in sacred Guru Granth Sahib, the repository of knowledge, faith and learning for the entire mankind, Channi said it is the moral duty of the state government to uphold the glorious legacy of the great guru for coming generations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-bear-cost-of-land-to-construct-ravidas-temple-in-delhi-channi-101641326104865.html

Of the 49, 26 were infected over the last 24 hours. At Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, 15 doctors tested positive, at Hindu Rao 20 tested positive and at Ambedkar Hospital, eight doctors tested positive over the last week. “Since junior doctors are interacting more with the patients, the chances of them getting infected are also higher. All doctors here who are showing symptoms have isolated themselves,” said Dr Amit Malviya from AIIMS resident doctors’ association. Meanwhile, AIIMS issued an order on Tuesday cancelling the remaining winter vacation for its faculty. Doctors have been asked to join duty immediately as the number of Covid-19 cases is seeing a surge. Delhi recorded 5481 cases on Tuesday. Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said that over the last few days, 187 reports of genome sequencing have been released--of these, 152 people tested positive for the Omicron variant.“Omicron is now the dominant variant in Delhi; around 81% of cases in Delhi are of the Omicron variant. The people arriving at Delhi Airport coming from abroad are being tested and are being sent to isolation facilities if tested positive and are being treated accordingly,” said Jain. The minister said that the government has made adequate arrangements to handle the surge in cases. “There is no need to panic. The best way to stop coronavirus is to wear a mask at all times and follow all the Covid appropriate protocol at all times,” he said.

Additional district and sessions judge Harbans Singh Lekhi dismissed four applications filed by former Moga senior superintendent of police Charanjit Singh Sharma and other accused claiming that the court found no merit in the applications and the accused cannot seek details of the ongoing investigation. The matter was adjourned to January 18. In December, Sharma had filed an application asking the court to give directions to the special investigation team (SIT) to file a status report with regard to the investigation carried out in FIR 129 (registered against protestors) and FIR 130 (registered against cops) to the date. SIT had told the court that further investigation in both the FIRs registered in connection with the Behbal Kalan firing is underway. In another plea, citing the Punjab and Haryana high court decision to grant exemption to former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini from personal appearance till February 2022, the accused cops had urged the trial court to defer framing of charges against them and adjourn the matter till then. Sharma had also filed an application seeking direction to police to conduct a further investigation with regard to injuries suffered by cops as well as damage to public property at Behbal Kalan on October 14, 2015. The court also dismissed Sharma’s application claiming that SIT has not supplied complete copies of three supplementary challans presented by the police against the accused suspended IGP Paramraj Singh Umranangal, former DGP Saini, SP Bikramjit Singh, sub-inspector Amarjit Singh Kular, Suhail Singh Brar and Pankaj Bansal. Modi should resolve issues of Panth: Daduwal President of the Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (ad hoc) Baljit Singh Daduwal said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should resolve issues of the Sikh Panth as the state government has failed to provide justice in 2015 firing incidents and sacrilege cases. Daduwal joined Sukhraj Singh, son of 2015 Behbal Kalan police firing victim Bhagwan Krishan Singh, who is continuing his sit-in on the 20th day at the incident site in Faridkot on Tuesday. “We appreciate PM Modi for resolving some issues, which include the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor and repealing of farm laws on the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev. There are also some other issues of Sikh Panth that need to be addressed by the government of India, such as the release of prisoners who have completed their sentences, the Bargari sacrilege, the Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura firing incidents, relaxation in conditions for visits to gurdwaras in Pakistan and special courts for drug trafficking cases,” he added.

The arrest was made by the special staff team of the outer north district. The case is being investigated by the west district police.Police said that the two employees, Lucky Mehra and Harvinder Singh, were riding a motorcycle with a bag containing ₹50 lakh that they had collected from property dealers in Vikaspuri at the behest of their employer Nirmohan Singh. They were at the Tilak Nagar flyover, when two motorcycle-borne men waylaid them, fired two rounds in the air, and assaulted the duo with helmets before robbing them of the cash bag. The mastermind of the robbery is on the run along with his two accomplices, including the financier’s employee who tipped off the gang about the cash collection, said deputy commissioner of police (outer north) Brijendra Kumar Yadav.“Our special staff team received information about the suspects in the case. The suspects changed their mobile phones frequently and would only make encrypted calls through the Internet.

Officials said that the teams are being deployed based on number of active cases under a primary health centre. Currently, over 2,300 patients are under home isolation in Gurugram, with areas under urban primary health centres of Tigra (186) and Chanderlok (288) have the highest number of active cases. “We have constituted nine mobile health teams, in addition to rapid response teams, as Covid-19 cases are increasing in the district and most of the patients are under home isolation. These teams will take updates regarding the vitals of the Covid-19 patients as part of monitoring through daily calls and visit the patients with doctors if needed,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. According to the officials, each team has two doctors, one pharmacist and one ANM (auxiliary nurse midwife) worker. These teams will further work in collaboration with rapid response teams that include ASHA workers, ANM workers and multi-purpose health workers. The health department already has 300 rapid response teams deployed for the monitoring process. Of these teams, 180 focus on urban areas and 120 on rural areas, the officials said. “Most of the patients with mild symptoms are under home isolation and we ensure daily tele-calling to these patients. Many patients do not want the doctor to visit them unless the conditions start deteriorating, that is where these teams help in large scale monitoring of Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Isha Narang, deputy civil surgeon, who is managing monitoring of patients under home isolation in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nine-mobile-teams-for-monitoring-covid-cases-in-gurugram-101641325624850.html
05-01-2022||Chandigarh||Covid norms go for a toss as residents throng vaccination centres in Ludhiana||Ludhiana The rapid rise in the number of Covid cases and the latest restrictions imposed by the Punjab government, allowing only fully vaccinated people at public places from January 15, has culminated in large and unmanageable crowds thronging the vaccination centres over the last few days.Huge gatherings were witnessed at the urban community health centre, Jawaddi on Monday. Residents, many of whom had come to the centre without wearing masks, could be seen pushing each other while standing in the long queues. The situation was not much different at the vaccination centre in the civil surgeon office either, with people violating the social distancing norms.As the health department struggled to manage the crowd, given the limited strength of the deployed staff members at the entry gate, the public was quick to criticise the department for mismanagement and even harassment at the centres. Several people rued having to make multiple trips to the centres to their doses.Shanti, a Vikas Nagar resident, claimed that she has received the second dose of vaccine on after making three separate trips, saying, “I have been standing in queue since 9am and now again at around 1pm, the staffers at the centre have started saying that only a few more residents will be able to get the vaccine today and the rest will have to come some other day.” “This is harassment and the administration should find a solution for the problem. The department should vaccinate all the visitors on that particular day when they report at the centre,” she added.Similarly, Sushma, who works as a housekeeper who was waiting in the queue to receive her second dose, said it was very difficult for her to ask for leave from her job to make multiple trips to the centre. “The department has been urging residents to get the second dose but no proper arrangements have been made. If I am not able to get the dose today, then it will get delayed as I will not be able to come again soon. The administration should increase the number of counters in a centre looking at the number of visitors”, she said. The authorities, meanwhile, said they have made regular appeals to the residents to follow the social distancing norms and keep themselves safe.Civil surgeon Dr SP Singh, who also visited the Jawaddi centre at the commencement of vaccination for children of age group 15-18 years on Monday, said, “The visitors are appealed to follow the norms and centre’s staff has also been deployed to ensure social distancing and wearing of masks.” “But heavy rush was witnessed at the centre and the centre authorities were asked to take help of police if required. The department is also working to set up more centres in the nearby areas to streamline the process,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-norms-go-for-a-toss-as-residents-throng-vaccination-centres-in-ludhiana-101641325566113.html
05-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi Assembly adopts panel’s report on services questions||The Delhi Assembly on Tuesday adopted the first report of the Committee of Privileges, which recommends that HoDs of the Delhi government departments be held responsible and proceeded against if answers to House queries are not given. In its report tabled in the assembly on Monday, the committee underlined that departments were not even giving answers to House questions which were available under RTI (Right to Information). Akhilesh Pati Tripathi, chairman of the Committee of Privileges, observed that all information available under RTI must be given to the House. The report said that all instances wherein information sought by a minister for a reply in the House is denied constitute a serious breach of privilege and contempt of House. The Committee recommended that in such cases the administrative Secretary/Head of Department concerned shall be personally held liable and responsible and proceeded against as the House deems fit because it amounts to breach of privilege and contempt of House. Saurabh Bharadwaj, a member of the committee, moved a motion stating that the House agreed with the first report of Committee Privileges presented to the House on January 3, 2022. The motion was put to vote and adopted by voice-vote. “The House has unanimously decided to refer matters related to unsatisfactory answers to questions asked by the members to the Privileges Committee. Many questions were not answered during Question Hour in the Assembly on Tuesday,” Bharadwaj stated. According to the Constitution, three key subjects -- public order, police and land -- are administered by the lieutenant governor (L-G). The committee also said: “The Committee further recommends that Government of NCT of Delhi should take necessary action in coordination with the Central government to introduce an amendment in the Parliament in order to legislate or make laws on subject matter related to Public Order, Police, Land of the State list under Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.” The committee, in its report, pointed out that the members of the House raised questions on subject matters related to public order, police and land, and replies to questions on these subject matters were being furnished since the inception of the Assembly in 1993. “However, as a covert manner in order to curtail the powers of the Delhi assembly and privileges of the Assembly, replies to subject matters noted above are not being provided to the Assembly since 2018 in view of the letter (from L-G),” the committee stated in its report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-assembly-adopts-panel-s-report-on-services-questions-101641325564774.html
05-01-2022||Other||Gurugram: Installing gates on internal roads allowed with rider||Residents living in various sectors and those in private colonies can now install gates on internal roads provided they don’t block the movement of traffic and are manned by security guards. The department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Tuesday said that it was decided by a district-level committee headed by deputy commissioner that gates would be allowed on internal roads that intersect 18-metre and 24-metre roads on a conditional basis. The decision was taken after considering several proposals submitted by various resident welfare associations (RWAs) and home owners’ associations, officials said. RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said it has been decided that any new gates must be manned 24x7 and CCTV cameras should be installed to ensure the local residents don’t face any trouble in the night. “Several RWAs and condominium associations had submitted proposals, which were considered and permissions were granted on case by case basis. The general rule is that movement of residents and traffic should not be hampered. Keeping in view the need for enhanced security, permissions were granted,” he said. The DTCP officials said that in case of plotted colonies, the permission was granted locally but in case of group housing societies, the proposal would be sent to director, DTCP, in Chandigarh as any change in layout plan is only approved at the headquarters. “The proposal to install gates on revenue roads was, however, rejected as they can’t be blocked as per rules,” said Bhath. The department allowed the installation of gates in Uppal Southend, Palam Vihar A block, sectors 47/50, and Sector 30. The permission to erect gates in Uniworld Garden in Sector 47 and Palms Apartment in South City 1 will be sent to the headquarters for approval, said the officials. “After detailed deliberation, the committee decided to allow the gates. Further to provide sense of security to the residents without hampering inter-colony and intra-colony movement, the gates are allowed with the condition that they shall be manned by guards 24x7 and CCTV cameras be fixed by governing body of the colony,” stated an order issued by the department. RK Yadav, president of Sector 46 RWA, said that the permission to erect gates is a positive development as it will help improve the safety and security of residents. “We are facing rising cases of theft as movement of people can’t be controlled. With these gates in place, we can certainly keep a check who enters the sector, particularly during nights,” he said. The issue of installation of gates has been a bone of contention in some areas as several residents have opposed the installation of gates as they hamper the movement of people. In another development, the enforcement wing of the DTCP carried out demolition in four illegal colonies spread in 10 acres in Bhorakalan village on the outskirts of the city. Bhath said that they are taking action against illegal colonies that are in initial stages of development. “We had received information about these illegal colonies and after giving notices, action was carried out on Tuesday. Our team demolished 10 under construction houses, 59 plinths sewage lines and a road network. These colonies were being developed without any permission,” he said.

Instead of honouring the promise to create 70 lakh jobs, this government took away 2 crore jobs. Paper leak is the new normal in this government,” they said.“In contrast, the SP government had specially focused on youth empowerment. The 18 lakh laptops that were distributed then are still used for skill development and livelihood,” said Neha.She said that under SP government there was special focus on women empowerment through various schemes. “As chief minister, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav played an important role in shaping the future of the students and youths. During SP regime, more than 20 higher educational institutes were opened, new medical colleges with more seats were set up. Under ‘hamari beti, hamara kal’ scheme ₹30,000 annually was provided to continue studies after high school,” Neha said.“For women safety schemes like ‘Women Powerline 1090, Rani Laxmibai award, Dial 100 were successfully implemented. There were other schemes that focused on health through initiatives like ‘Hausla Poshan Mission’, ‘108 ambulance service’,” said Arpit Sachan, Samajwadi Chatra Sabha spokesperson.“Under this campaign, all the office bearers and members of the committee will hold a discussion on ‘Ayenge Akhilesh, Banayenge Khushhal Uttar Pradesh’ in all universities, colleges and hostels of the state in days to come,” Arpit said.

05-01-2022||Chandigarh||Don’t mislead women by promising sops: Ashu’s wife to parties||Ludhiana: A day after Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu promised to provide ₹2,000 and eight cooking gas cylinders to women homemakers if Congress is voted to power in the state, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu’s wife Mamta Ashu on Tuesda appealed the political parties to stop placing bids on women.Tagging Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Sidhu, Congress state in-charge Harish Chaudhary, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi among others, Mamta, who is a Ludhiana municipal councillor, tweeted “Please Hamari Boli na lagayein” (please stop placing bids on women).She further stated: “Please stop taking Punjabi women for a ride by offering money We feel proud in our womanhood and if anyone wants to provide us something, then provide us equality, safety and self respect.”This has again brought to fore the rift between the state Congress leaders as earlier Ashu had opened a front against Sidhu for throwing a spanner in the government’s efforts and creating confusion in the party and urged the high command to discipline him. Ashu and Sidhu have been at loggerheads over different issues in the past too.After taking digs at his own party’s government and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for offering “lollipops” ahead of polls, Sidhu had on Monday jumped into the race to lure voters with freebies by promising to give ₹2,000 per month and eight free cylinders to every homemaker woman and incentives for school and college going girls, if the party retains power in the state. The announcements were made by Sidhu during a rally in Barnala.Earlier the AAP had announced to give ₹1,000 per month to every woman above the age of 18, if it is voted to power in the state. Meanwhile, accusing minister Ashu for sheltering Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) MLA Simarjit Singh Bains in a rape case, former cabinet minister and SAD leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal took a sarcastic dig at Mamta Ashu. “Mamta is worrying about a price being put on support of women, but she is turning a blind eye to the support being extended to a rape accused (Bains) by her husband. Everyone is aware that Ashu continues to support and shelter Bains in the rape case. Ashu even arranged a meeting between Bains and CM Charanjit Channi a few days back,” said Grewal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dont-mislead-women-by-promising-sops-ashu-s-wife-to-parties-101641324785984.html

The suspect, identified as Anoop Kumar from Jhajjar, has been arrested, said police, adding that Kumar was living with his wife at her parents’ house in Rajiv Nagar. According to police, Kumar’s wife Deepika Gaur received a WhatsApp message on Sunday stating that her husband has been kidnapped, following which she filed a complaint at Sector 29 police station. Gaur, a resident of Rajiv Nagar, said that she had spoken with her husband on Sunday around 6.40pm when he was at his workplace. “Around 7.15pm, I received a message from his mobile phone that my husband was with the suspects, and if I wanted to see him alive then I should transfer ₹2 lakh to a bank account. They threatened me against reporting the incident to police,” she said. Gaur said the suspects called her several times and tried to pressurise her to transfer the money, but she approached police. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that they registered a case under Section 364-A (kidnapping or abduction for ransom) of IPC on Sunday evening and started investigation. “The number was put on technical surveillance and its location was traced. A team from Sector 29 police station arrested the suspect from IMT Manesar on Monday and was shocked to find that he had staged his own kidnapping,” he said. Sangwan said he was messaging his wife as he thought she would not report to police and would transfer money as she had savings. “The suspect lived with his wife in her parents’ house in Rajiv Nagar and worked in a beer café in Sector 29 for the past five years. He wanted to go on a vacation with his friends but had no savings. So he planned his abduction,” he said. Police said he parked his car in a five-star hotel’s parking lot and walked down to his workplace on Sunday afternoon. After spending a few hours, he left the beer cafe and sent a message to his wife and later switched off his mobile phone. Sangwan said Kumar was produced before the court on Tuesday that sent him to 14-day judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-man-fakes-his-own-kidnapping-demands-2-lakh-ransom-from-wife-101641324784648.html

05-01-2022||Delhi||State council of ministers ignored advice on ration scheme: L-G to Delhi HC||The Delhi Lieutenant Governor (L-G) on Tuesday told the Delhi high court that his repeated advice to the Delhi government to address the violation of National Food Security Act (NFSA), as flagged by the Union government in the implementation of the doorstep delivery of ration scheme, have not been considered by the state council of ministers. Arguing before a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, advocate DP Singh, read out a file noting of March 20, 2018 by the L-G to the state government’s finance department, in which he had advised them to refer the scheme to the union government with full details including all implementation issues before a final decision is taken.In the same noting, the L-G had also said that the proposal of the doorstep delivery of ration scheme is “worth considering”.Opposing the doorstep delivery of ration scheme, the L-G through his counsel said that he has not tried to usurp any powers and wanted to ensure that the Delhi government shall adhere to provisions of the NFSA, 2013 while implementing the scheme even if it comes out with a separate scheme for ration delivery to the citizens.The submission was made during the hearing on a plea by the Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh, a group of FPS owners, in which they have challenged the doorstep ration delivery scheme, and demanded that it should be declared ultra vires (beyond one’s legal power or authority).The scheme has become a flashpoint between the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government and the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi, with the former saying that the plan violates the provisions of NFSA and will deprive migrants of foodgrains, and the latter pointing out that it will root out the ration mafia and ensure that all beneficiaries get their ration.Advocate Singh also read out a noting where the L-G had pointed out that no approval has been granted by the Centre to the scheme and it was advised again that the matter be kindly referred to the union government for approval in accordance to the NFSA.In response to this, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that the scheme is not before the LG for approval, and it has already attained finality.Appearing for the Delhi government, its counsel Gautam Narayan said that he would want to advance some arguments to rebut the submissions made by the L-G.The court posted the matter for Wednesday when it would continue hearing arguments.In an affidavit before the high court, the Delhi government in November said that no one will be deprived of food grains even after the introduction of the door to door step ration scheme and the fair price shops will continue to exist.“Beneficiaries who opt for doorstep delivery but miss the scheduled delivery or wish to collect the packages SFAs on their own will be able to collect it from the circle level FPS set up by the DCCWS. Beneficiaries who do not opt for home delivery will be able to collect their dry ration from the existing FPS. Therefore, it is a misconception that the GNCTD is seeking to do away with FPS,” the city government said in the document filed on November 18.The state government said the petitioner association is entirely mischievous in its contentions in respect of implementation of the scheme. It also said that not a single beneficiary has questioned the mode and manner of implementation of the scheme, and an overwhelming majority of the target beneficiaries have opted to receive food grains at their doorstep.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/state-council-of-ministers-ignored-advice-on-ration-scheme-l-g-to-delhi-hc-101641324664627.html

These sammelans would be organised in association with Kashi Vidvat Parishad, Akhara Parishad and Vishwa Hindu Parishad.“We want to tell such politicians who have their own political commitments in doing such criticism to not attack Hindutva and Hindus for their politics. The sant community will not tolerate it and through these conferences and drive in villages, such pseudo socialists and Congress leaders who are continuously making unrestrained statements on Hindus and their traditions will be exposed,” he added. “In these meetings the saints will take a resolution to expose those criticising Hindu society and Hindutva in debates on various platforms.

05-01-2022||Chandigarh||British Sikh Army officer first Indian-origin woman to trek solo to South Pole||London: Captain Harpreet Chandi, a 32-year-old Indian-origin British Sikh Army officer and physiotherapist, also known as Polar Preet, has created history by becoming the first woman of colour to complete a solo unsupported trek to the South Pole.Chandi announced her history-making feat on her live blog on Monday at the end of Day 40 after travelling 700 miles (1,127 kilometres) while pulling a pulk or sledge with all of her kit and battling temperatures of minus 50 degrees Celsius and wind speeds of around 60mph.“I made it to the South Pole where it’s snowing. Feeling so many emotions right now. I knew nothing about the polar world three years ago and it feels so surreal to finally be here. It was tough getting here and I want to thank everybody for their support,” she wrote.“This expedition was always about so much more than me. I want to encourage people to push their boundaries and to believe in themselves, and I want you to be able to do it without being labelled a rebel. I have been told no on many occasions and told to ‘just do the normal thing’, but we create our own normal,” Chandi said.She uploaded a live tracking map of her trek and also posted regular blogs of her journey to the snow-capped region.“Day 40 – Finished. Preet has just made history becoming the first woman of colour to complete a solo expedition in Antarctica,” reads the final entry of her blog.“You are capable of anything you want. No matter where you are from or where your start line is, everybody starts somewhere. I don’t want to just break the glass ceiling; I want to smash it into a million pieces,” she said.As part of a medical regiment in the northwest of England, Chandi’s primary role is to organise and validate training for medics in the Army as Clinical Training Officer.Currently based in London, she is completing her master’s degree in sports and exercise medicine, part-time, at Queen Mary’s University in London and had dragged around two large tyres over the past few months for her polar training as a substitute for the heavy sledge she has been dragging along in Antarctica.“It definitely feels colder in the last degree where I’m at higher altitude. I haven’t seen anyone here in the last degree and now I’m 15 nautical miles from the South Pole. I can’t believe I’m almost there,” read her entry from Sunday, a day before her milestone.She also used her time in the cold to think about wedding plans for when she returns to England, having been engaged to Army reservist fiancé David Jarman before setting off on her expedition.The couple are expected to be reunited in Chile when she returns from the South Pole later this month.“I read somewhere that when you ask people to be your bridesmaids it’s nice to do it in a special way, so all the way from Antarctica I would love nothing more than for you to be my bridesmaids. Sonia Chandi, Rachel Tucker-Norton, Kamal Dhamrait, Tig Bridge, Hannah Sawford (or Hannah Smith now) and Collette Davey,” Chandi wrote.“I love you all and would love you to be my bridesmaids. I think at least three hen do’s are required. That’s normal right? But even if it’s not normal that’s never been anything to stop me,” she added.Chandi says she has always been keen to push the human body to its limits and sees her latest mission as part of this wider research.As an “endurance athlete”, she has run marathons and ultra-marathons and, as an Army officer, completed large-scale exercises and deployments in Nepal, Kenya and most recently a six-month United Nations peacekeeping tour to South Sudan. “Anything ambitious can feel out of reach at the beginning but every bit of training I complete brings me closer to my goal. My training expeditions in Greenland and Norway have helped prepare me and my goal is now in reach,” she declared before setting off for the South Pole in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/british-sikh-army-officer-first-indian-origin-woman-to-trek-solo-to-south-pole-101641324425219.html

The members of the Allied Liquor Association met the deputy excise and taxation commissioner (DETC) and handed over a memorandum requesting change of timings and to waive off the liquor licence fees. Subhash Bansal, general manager of Discovery Wines and a member of the association, said that 80% of liquor sales is achieved from 6pm to 11pm. “Due to the present timings, we will have to incur a heavy loss. Besides, we will find it difficult to submit the license fees which are paid in advance,” he said. Sujan Singh, another member, said, “It was illogical to give permission to bars/restaurants to open till 11pm and put restrictions only on us.” The protesters said that the government should also waive off their licence fees and just charge them 10% with the restrictions. Rohit Yadav, a shop owner, said that the liquor shops are the highest revenue generators for the state. “The new restrictions will lead to smuggling of liquor, and people involved in illegal trade of liquor will flourish. We are ready to follow all Covid-19 protocols, but please don’t ruin our business,” he said. There are 280 liquor shops across the city, most of which are situated on MG Road, Golf Course Road, Sohna Road and Golf Course Extension Road, according to an official data. Anirudh Sharma, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (west), said the department agreed that the timings should change and forwarded their memorandum to the headquarters in Panchkula. “People usually visit liquor shops post 6pm. The timings of these establishments should be considered till 11pm. Since liquor shops in Delhi are open till 8pm, people will buy from the national capital leading to the loss for Gurugram shops,” he said. Haryana deputy chief minister, Dushyant Chautala, who also holds the portfolio of excise and taxation, said, “We have received their representation and are trying to help them in every possible way.” Chautala further said that the liquor shop owners should appeal before the deputy commissioner also who will send recommendations to the government.
05-01-2022||Delhi||Most Omicron patients asymptomatic, but fatigue, throat rash common: Doctors||Most patients infected with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in Delhi are showing symptoms similar to the Delta variant but with milder intensity, doctors said on Tuesday. While a majority of these patients are asymptomatic, symptomatic patients are complaining of fatigue, throat rash and mild fever, they added. Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak Hospital, the largest Covid-19 hospital in Delhi, said that till Monday 138 Omicron patients had been admitted to the facility. Of them, 105 had already been discharged. He also said that a majority of them were asymptomatic, and the others showed mild symptoms. “Omicron patients are exhibiting mild symptoms for around three or four days. We have already discharged 105 patients,” Dr Kumar said. “Since all Omicron cases are being institutionally isolated at the moment, many patients complain of fatigue and tightness in the throat. In cases where patients complain of fever, it lasts for around two days. But it is too early to say that these are the only symptoms of Omicron. We will require more data to say for sure,” said a senior doctor at Lok Nayak Hospital. Senior officials of Delhi government’s health department said that since Omicron is the dominant variant in the city currently, majority of the detected cases are testing positive for this variant. Health minister Satyendar Jain on Monday said that over the last few days, 81.28% Covid-19 cases detected in the national capital tested positive for the Omicron variant. “Until now, the symptoms of Omicron are mild and that is also the trend that we are seeing globally. Our appeal to the public is to not panic and get vaccinated. From yesterday (January 3), we started the vaccination drive for teenagers between 15 and 17 years. Please get your children also inoculated so that even if you catch the infection, its intensity is low,” said a senior Delhi government official. Delhi government data shows that on Tuesday, 531 hospital beds were occupied by patients, of whom 14 were on ventilator support, 168 showed moderate symptoms and 308 were either asymptomatic or showed mild symptoms. This figure also includes 41 suspected cases. 
05-01-2022||Lucknow||Amid Covid surge, UP schools up to Class 10 shut till January 14||LUCKNOW All government and private schools up to Class 10 will remain closed till Makar Sankranti (January 14) and the night curfew will be imposed from 10pm to 6am from Thursday, the Uttar Pradesh government announced on Tuesday, following a sharp surge in Covid cases. The vaccination of children in the 15 to18 age group would, however, continue during this period, officials said. The state government had on December 25 implemented night curfew from 11pm to 5am. UP reported 992 fresh Covid cases in the last 24 hours, taking the active case count to 3,173 on Tuesday.“Public places like gyms, spas, cinema halls, banquet halls, restaurants etc should be operated at 50% capacity in districts where the minimum number of active cases exceeds 1,000. In marriage ceremonies and other events, not more than 100 people will be permitted in closed places at a time. The presence of people in excess of 50% of the total capacity of the ground should not be allowed in open space. Masks and sanitisers should be made mandatory,” said chief minister Yogi Adityanath while reviewing the Covid situation at a high-level meeting here.Adityanath directed officers to make Covid help desks functional with immediate effect in all government, semi-government, private institutions, companies, historical monuments, offices, religious places, hotels/restaurants and industrial units of the state. Entry to the premises will be not permitted without screening and sanitisation, he added. It has been made mandatory to bring a negative RT-PCR report (not older than 48 hours) for devotees visiting the Magh Mela in Prayagraj.“There is need to follow Covid protocol strictly. People should not panic or get distressed, alertness and caution is needed. They should be encouraged to wear masks, take vaccine and practice social distancing,” said the state government in a press statement. Genome sequencing for the identification of new Covid variants confirmed the Omicron variant in 23 people, it said. Experts believe that the new Covid variant is less harmful than the earlier ones. It is not a major threat to healthy people who have taken the vaccine cover, the state government said. In view of Covid surge, the state government also decided to conduct a minimum of three to four lakh sample tests daily. People without vaccination will be identified with door-to-door visits by health department teams and the list will be handed over to the district administration, said officials. The Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre (ICCC) set up in all the districts will be kept active 24×7. A panel of specialist doctors will be posted at these centres. Along with tele-consultation facility, ambulances will be in 24×7 active mode in all the districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/amid-covid-surge-up-schools-up-to-class-10-shut-till-january-14-101641324244628.html
05-01-2022||Delhi||Reserve 40% of beds in private hospitals for Covid-19 patients: Delhi govt||The Delhi government on Tuesday directed all private hospitals and nursing homes in the national capital having a bed capacity of 50 or more, to reserve at least 40% of their total beds for Covid-19 patients.The order, released on Tuesday evening, said the decision was taken in view of Omicron variant of the coronavirus leading a surge in fresh infections.“...The keepers of all private hospitals and nursing homes having total bed capacity of 50 beds or more are directed to reserve at least 40% of their total bed capacity (40% of ward bed capacity and 40% of lCU bed capacity) for Covid patients,” the order said.Delhi has been witnessing an uptick in Covid infections over the last two weeks, with the number of cases jumping to 5,481 on Tuesday—positivity of 8.37%--from Monday’s 4,099 infections, which resulted in a positivity rate of 6.46%. On December 31, the positivity rate in the city was 2.44%.According to Delhi government’s covid dashboard, Delhi has a total of 21,701 Covid beds across the city. Of these, 1,313 were occupied as of Tuesday, with 20,388 still available. Of the total vacant beds, 7,945 beds with oxygen support and 1,321 ventilator beds were available.A senior official of the Delhi government’s health department said the city has entered the “community spread” stage and under the current circumstances even though the severity of infections are mild, all of the Capital’s resources will have to be made available for patient care.“The infections might be mild but this variant is still highly infectious and we will need to make provisions for as many beds as we can have to ensure that patients requiring hospital care do not suffer when the cases rise further,” the official said.Health experts reacted with caution to the latest order. Some said that reserving beds will help, considering the high transmission rate of Omicron, others said reserving beds in the same hospital where other patients were also being treated, will result in greater chances of the virus spreading to non-Covid patients.Dr Vikas Maurya, a pulmonologist at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, said, “The decision is not misdirected because Omicron cases are highly infectious and the way the cases are rising we will need maximum beds. Currently, all the ICU beds at our hospitals are full and even patients that are coming for non-Covid ailments are testing Covid positive. We will need maximum resources.”Dr JA Jayalal, former president of the Indian Medical Association, said reserving beds in all private hospitals will only lead to greater chances of non-Covid patients being infected with the virus.“What can be done is reserve some hospitals completely for Covid patients, because this variant is highly infectious and if there is intermixing of Covid and non-Covid patients, the possibility of transmission becomes higher. The focus at present should be on home isolation and home care,” Dr Jayalal said.

Akshay Tripathi, vice chairman of the development authority, gave a presentation of three detailed project reports (DPRs) out of the four prepared. The LDA will execute the 21-km long project for which separate DPRs have been prepared for all its four phases. During the presentation, the LDA vice chairman apprised the chief secretary how the project would ease commuting from one end of the city to another. Tripathi also apprised the chief secretary about the land issue related with the project. These pieces of land are related with the Lucknow Municipal Corporation, irrigation department and “Nazul” (government land). “To kick-start the project, the chief secretary has also agreed to make available ₹25 crore from the state government and ₹25 crore will be provided by the development authority,” said the LDA vice chairman. “With this initial corpus of ₹50 crore, the development authority will soon start the project,” said Tripathi. The phase one of the project spans from IIM road to Hardinge Bridge. In the Green Corridor project, a four-lane road will be constructed on both sides of the embankment on the river Gomti.

05-01-2022||Delhi||Govt says weekend curfew, not lockdown, as Delhi logs 5.4k cases||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday said that the weekend curfew imposed in the Capital in view of the spike in Covid-19 cases should not be treated as a lockdown, and the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) decided against sounding a “red alert” under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap).Delhi reported 5,481 latest Covid infections in the last 24 hours, pushing the positivity rate to 8.37%, the highest in since May 17 when it was 8.41%, according to the government data. Fresh cases have also pushed the number of active cases in the city to 14,889, the highest since May 27 when it was 16,378.The Delhi government’s daily health bulletin said only 531 of the 9,042 dedicated Covid beds in the city were occupied, and these included some patients only “suspected” of having contracted the infection.Experts have in recent days called for the hospitalisation rate to be used to judge the severity of the outbreak since the variant is likely to lead to milder disease and curbs that are disproportionate to the threat could end up hurting more than the epidemic.DDMA on Tuesday held a review meeting of the ongoing curbs under the “yellow alert” of Grap in view of the steep growth in number of cases and the positivity rate. The agency added weekend curfew to the ongoing restrictions, but allowed 100% seating capacity in public transport in view of crowding which could have triggered faster transmission of the virus.Talking to reporters about the latest DDMA order, Jain said, “A weekend curfew was being imposed in view of rising Covid cases, and it should not be considered as a lockdown. The curfew has been imposed as not much activity happens in that two-day period, and there is no need to panic.”Currently, a night lockdown is in effect in Delhi between 10pm and 5am. The weekend curfew will begin at 10pm on Friday and end at 5am on Monday, according to the DDMA order.On December 28, the DDMA announced closure of schools, colleges, movie theatres and gyms, and ordered markets and shopping malls to operate on an odd-even basis in view of the gatherings expected on New Year’s Eve.However, despite the high infections, the hospitalisations so far have stayed low with more than 20,000 beds for Covid patients being vacant as of Tuesday, according to the Delhi government’s Covid dashboard.On Monday, Jain said Omicron is now the dominant variant of Covid-19 in the capital, as many as 152 samples out of 187 sent for genome sequencing were found to be infected with the Omicron variant. “There are adequate number of hospital beds available in Delhi and there is no need to panic,” Jain said.Oxygen monitoringThe Delhi government on Tuesday announced to install 100 telemetry devices — instruments that tell the real-time stock in liquid medical oxygen tanks — across at least 53 government and private hospitals in the city.In a statement, the government said that while reviewing the supply of oxygen and keeping in mind the third wave of Covid-19, it was decided that telemetry devices in liquid medical oxygen tanks will be installed to monitor how much oxygen is available in which hospital, so that stocks can be replenished immediately.“During the last wave of Covid-19, it was seen that there was a sudden shortage of oxygen in hospitals across the country and many hospitals sounded emergency when they started running out of medical oxygen. The government found it difficult to decide which hospital should be provided oxygen first and which hospital needed it the most,” the statement said.It added, “At that time, the process of allocation of oxygen was being controlled by the central government, due to which it became very difficult to arrange oxygen for all the states.”Liquid Medical Oxygen is high purity oxygen, used for medical treatment.“The telemetry device will help in transmitting the live information of the amount of oxygen present in each liquid medical oxygen tank to the war room of the Delhi government. This will help in finding out how much oxygen is left in which hospital so that oxygen can be delivered to that hospital in time,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-says-weekend-curfew-not-lockdown-as-delhi-logs-5-4k-cases-101641323831754.html

This is the first time since May 21 (623 cases) that Gurugram has crossed 600 daily cases in a single day. The active case tally was over 2,000 last on May 28 (2,199 active cases). On Tuesday, no new cases of Omicron variant were reported from the district, said Dr Jai Prakash, district Covid-19 surveillance officer. The district has reported 39 cases of Omicron variant so far with two active cases at present. Of the 2,311 active cases, 12 patients are hospitalised in the district and 2,299 are under home isolation, said the health officials. On Tuesday, the health department collected 7,027 samples for testing, which takes the total testing numbers to 2,324,054, shows the data. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, 7,489 children aged between 15 and 18 years were vaccinated with the first dose in the district. A total of 6909 doses were administered at government sites and 580 at private vaccination sites, the officials said. Long queues for vaccination by parents of adolescents were noticed even on Tuesday outside government-run vaccination centres. At every vaccination centre, 100 doses are being given with 80 doses assigned for walk-in and 20 for online booking. Harshita Srivastava, a 17-year-old girl who got vaccinated at Civil Hospital Sector 10, said, “I had to wait for half an hour to get a dose of Covid vaccine. I got my registration done on the spot itself, and the vaccination process was smooth after the registration.” According to the health department, on Tuesday, 31,212 people (including 15-18 age group) received Covid-19 jabs, of which 18,382 took their first dose and 12,860 the second dose. With this, over 4.34 million doses have been administered in the district. On Wednesday, vaccination for teenagers will be conducted at 39 government health centres where 4,000 slots will be available and 56 government and private schools with 5,600 slots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-634-cases-active-caseload-crosses-2-000-mark-in-gurugram-101641323585406.html
05-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi CM Kejriwal tests Covid-positive: In isolation, symptoms mild||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday announced on Twitter that he has tested positive for Covid-19, and that he was isolating at home since he has mild symptoms.“I have tested positive for Covid. Mild symptoms. Have isolated myself at home. Those who came in touch wid (with) me in last few days, kindly isolate urself (yourself) and get urself tested,” Kejriwal posted at 8.11am.The AAP chief has undertaken several trips to poll-bound states Uttarakhand and Punjab to campaign for his party. On Monday, he addressed AAP’s ‘Nav Parivartan Yatra’ at Parade Ground in Dehradun. Amit Rawat, media coordinator for AAP in Uttarakhand, said after Kejriwal announced that he tested positive, nearly 20 state leaders who shared stage with him or met him during or before the rally have been isolating at home. “Col Ajay Kothiyal (retd) (AAP’s chief ministerial candidate) has got a Covid test done, and others are getting it too,” he said. Sanjay Bhatt, spokesperson of Uttarkhand AAP, said all leaders and party cadres who came into close contact with Kejriwal on Monday have been asked to get tested and isolate themselves. Suryakant Dhasmana, vice president of Uttarakhand Congress, slammed Kejriwal for being a part of the rally, and for not wearing a mask. “Despite coming from Delhi which is witnessing a spike in Covid cases, he (Kejriwal) didn’t wear a mask on the stage. That was highly irresponsible of a senior leader like him,” he said. Between December 30 and January 1, Kejriwal was in Chandigarh and Punjab. He led a “victory march” atop a crowded truck along with AAP’s Punjab unit president Bhagwant Mann, state affairs co-in-charge Raghav Chadha, Chandigarh AAP president Prem Garg, and party’s 14 newly elected councillors. The road show was joined by about 5,000 party supporters. The Delhi chief minister later held a closed-door meeting with the councillors. Kejriwal and Mann also held a “peace march” in Patiala, which was attended by a large number of party workers and leaders. Before the march, Kejriwal and others laid wreaths at the memorial of Mahatma Gandhi. The Delhi CM also paid obeisance at Kali Devi Temple and Gurdwara Dukhniwaran along with workers. Senior AAP leader Balbir Singh, who is also the AAP candidate from Patiala Rural, said they have appealed to people to follow Covid protocols but there was heavy rush and some of them may not have adhered to norms. “We always ask people to maintain social distancing and wear masks,” he said, adding that those who attended a party gathering on New Year’s Eve have been asked to get tested. In April last year, Kejriwal’s wife Sunita tested positive for Covid-19, after which the chief minister isolated himself.Delhi has been witnessing a surge in Covid-19 infection on the back of the new coronavirus variant Omicron. Omicron is now the dominant variant in the capital, as 81% of the samples sent for genome sequencing found evidence of the heavily mutated virus, Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain told the state assembly on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cm-kejriwal-tests-covid-positive-in-isolation-symptoms-mild-101641323464658.html
05-01-2022||Bhopal||Congress leader sues Shivraj Chouhan for defamation, asks court to order FIR||JABALPUR/BHOPAL: Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Vivek Tankha has filed a criminal defamation complaint in Jabalpur court against Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, BJP state president VD Sharma and the state urban development minister Bhupendra Singh for their “incorrect statements” on the OBC reservation case in the Supreme Court.Chouhan and other BJP leaders blamed Tankha for the Supreme Court ruling last month that blocked Madhya Pradesh’s effort to hold panchayat elections in the state with reservation for other backward classes (OBC).Former advocate general Shashank Shekhar, who appeared for Vivek Tankha said chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and other BJP leaders, VD Sharma and Bhupendra Singh, “made objectionable statements” about Tankha which tarnished his image.The case has been filed in the Jabalpur district court demanding that a first information report be registered against the three persons under section 499 (defamation) of IPC, he said.Earlier on December 19, Tankha sent a legal notice to Chouhan and others seeking an apology over their attempt to belittle Tankha on and off social media by “propagating incorrect facts” of the court proceedings on the OBC reservation case.The top court stayed OBC quota in panchayat polls in Madhya Pradesh after Congress leader Manmohan Nagar, president of Bhopal Jila Panchayat, moved the SC, claiming that the state government violated constitutional provisions on reservation rotation and delimitation for Panchayat polls.Tankha represented Nagar in the top court.BJP leaders targeted Tankha and the Congress, saying that the top court verdict which they said, led to injustice against OBCs was delivered because the Congress went to the court in the first place.Madhya Pradesh BJP media in-charge Lokendra Parashar said, “We will continue to work in the favour of different communities with exposing the real face of Congress leaders. They are free to do anything to save their image but now they have exposed themselves in front of common men.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/congress-leader-sues-shivraj-chouhan-for-defamation-asks-court-to-order-fir-101641322869706.html
05-01-2022||Mumbai||Mumbai cases breach 10k-mark; 80% of Covid beds in city unoccupied||Mumbai: The Covid bed occupancy in Mumbai’s private and public hospitals stood at 20%, with at least 17,784 beds — or 80% — vacant even as the daily caseload in the city rose to 10,606 on Monday. Civic authorities said most admissions were on account of an “abundance of caution” to break the chain of infections, and were made up of Covid-positive patients with co-morbidities, who fell within the high-risk category but had having mild symptoms. “Hospital admissions are increasing but it is also because we are being abundantly cautious,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner and incharge of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s response to the pandemic.“Our jumbo centres are not shying away from admitting people with the mild disease but who are in the high-risk category. This not only helps in breaking the chain of infection but also keep a check on the progression of the disease and fatalities,” Kakani said. The city has 22,205 Covid beds in both public healthcare facilities and private hospitals. Government facilities include tertiary hospitals like KEM hospital in Parel and BYL Nair hospital in Mumbai Central, as well as nine jumbo facilities spread across different wards of Mumbai. The total number includes beds that are attached to ventilators as well as those that oxygen support.The city also has the capacity to expand the number of beds by another 80,000 beds.Apart from this, Mumbai also has 227 Covid Care Centres (CCC) for Covid positive patients with extremely mild symptoms or who are asymptomatic but need to isolate themselves from their families on account of a lack of space in their homes. On Tuesday, there were 972 Covid patients in these facilities, up from 311 on December 20. To be sure, Covid bed occupancy has seen a jump since December 20, when it was 6.25% (the number of Covid beds at the time were 13,830). However, according to Dr Shashank Joshi,a member of the state’s Covid task force, only a small percentage of hospitalised persons are patients with serious underlying conditions who need close monitoring. At least 20% of the hospitalisations are of international travellers who tested positive for Covid and are awaiting their Omicron reports.At the beginning of December, the civic body issued a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on international travellers arriving from at-risk countries, including the UK, South Africa, Botswana among others, which included a strict seven-day institutional quarantine after an RT-PCR test to track the spread of the Omicron variant of concern (VOC).“The first category includes patients who take mandatory Covid tests before undergoing other medical procedures. As the circulation of the virus has increased, nearly 70% of such patients are testing positive and are hospitalised before they can undergo their medical procedures. The second category, which accounts for about 20% of admissions, includes international travellers awaiting their Omicron reports. The last category is of patients who are highly vulnerable with other serious underlying conditions and need to be in the hospitals for close observation. These account for only 10% admissions,” Joshi said. Currently, of the 4,491 hospitalised patients, 1,374 (30.59%) are on oxygen support; 507 (11.28%) are in ICU; 320 (7.12%) are on ventilators. BMC chief Iqbal Chahal said that only symptomatic patients are being hospitalised as per the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research at the start of the pandemic. At jumbo centres, symptomatic patients are being admitted even if they have mild disease. “Many of these patients live in smaller houses and are directed to us by the ward war rooms. Some even walk-in directly because they are worried about spreading the infections to others in the family,” said Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of the NESCO jumbo facility in Goregaon. Experts warn that while the hospital bed occupancy is low, people must follow Covid-appropriate behaviour by masking up and avoid crowds.“Each hospital will have to assess their facility in terms of how many admissions they can take, and be in touch with the ward war rooms constantly to avoid any kind of chaos,” said infectious disease experts Dr Om Srivastava. “On the other hand, people should also play their part in fighting this surge by avoiding crowds, wearing masks and following Covid appropriate behaviour.”More admissions in private hospitalsWhile the occupancy in public facilities is about 18%, private hospitals have a higher occupancy at nearly 30%. For instance, Bandra’s Lilavati Hospital had full occupancy in its 100-bed Covid ward and 22 bed ICU. “We have been getting a lot of patients with full-blown symptoms who are getting admitted mainly because of their underlying conditions,” said Dr V Ravishankar chief executive officer of Lilavati Hospital. He said that all the patients are fully vaccinated. “Patients who are deteriorating are those who have very bad oxygen saturation levels,” he said. Andheri’s Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital had an occupancy of 15 to 20 patients in the first week of December. The hospital began seeing a rise from December 20 and its occupancy was 50 on Tuesday. “The occupancy has been driven by two main categories of patients — those with concerning underlying issues like cancer, heart disease, lung ailments and those with persisting symptoms,” said Dr Santosh Shetty, chief executive officer of the hospital. While the recent round of BMC’s genome sequencing has revealed that 55% of the samples were of the Omicron variant, doctors said that Delta and Delta derivatives could also be driving some number of hospitalisations. The PD Hinduja Hospital in Mahim has been carrying out the RT-PCR tests with the help of the kits that look for the S gene dropout, which is an indirect way to detect the Omicron variant before the sample is sent for genome sequencing for confirmation. Dr Joy Chakraborty, chief operating officer of the hospital said that about 35% of the samples have the S gene dropout indicating the presence of Omicron. “This tells us that Delta still has a role to play in all these hospitalisations,” he said. The hospital has 70% occupancy of the Covid beds. Dr Shashank Joshi said that patients with moderate disease, those in the high-risk category and those who have desaturating oxygen levels should be red-flagged for admissions. “There is definitely some panic due to the increasing numbers but unnecessary hospitalisations are very unlikely. In fact, most people want to avoid hospitals as much as possible,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-cases-breach-10k-mark-80-of-covid-beds-in-city-unoccupied-101641322867204.html
05-01-2022||Other||11 O2 plants, 50% more beds: Gurugram readies to fight Covid||As Covid-19 cases continue to rise in Gurugram, officials said that the health infrastructure in the district has been improved with the installation of at least 11 oxygen plants and more than 50% increase in Covid-19 beds. According to officials from the district administration, Gurugram at present has a capacity of producing 4,150 litres per minute (LPM) of oxygen daily as 11 oxygen plants were set up since the second wave of the pandemic. During the second wave in April-May last year, the daily oxygen requirement of Gurugram was about 60 metric tonnes (MT) and the district did not have any oxygen plants. It was dependent on neighbouring districts and states for its oxygen needs, the officials said. Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said, “To ensure the supply of life-saving oxygen in the district, oxygen plants of 4,150 litres per minute (LPM) capacity have been installed at 11 different government hospitals and health centres in the district. We are well prepared to deal with rising Covid-19 cases and there is enough capacity to convert normal beds also to oxygen support.”The 11 health centres and government hospitals where these plants have been installed include Civil Hospital Sector 10, Subdivisional Hospital (SDH) Pataudi, SDH Sohna, ESIC Hospital Sector 9, ESIC Hospital Sector 3 Manesar, Polyclinic Sector 31, Community Health Centre (CHC) Ghanghola, CHC Bhangraula and CHC Farukhnagar. During the second wave in Gurugram, private hospitals grappled with a lack of liquid oxygen supply due to a sharp rise in demand -- from around 25 MT a day to almost 60 MT in a short span. The officials said that the bed capacity has also been increased in the district and almost doubled since the second wave. As per covidggn.com, district administration’s website for tracking details related to Covid-19, there were over 3,800 beds during the second wave. “We have 5,833 beds in total at present in both government and private hospitals. These include 3,759 oxygen beds, 400 intensive care unit (ICU) beds with ventilators, 997 ICU beds and rest are normal beds for treating Covid-19 positive patients. Besides, there are makeshift Covid care centres at Tau Devilal Stadium and Sector 67 (M3M medical facility) with 100 beds each. Also, several hotels in the district can be taken over for isolating patients if needed,” said Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer. In the district, the number of ambulances available with the health department has also been increased since the second wave. During the second wave, many residents had complained of overcharging by ambulance services due to shortage of such vehicles. At present, the Gurugram health department has 37 ambulances, as against 21 ambulances earlier, the officials said. “Apart from advanced life support ambulances, ambulances equipped with state-of-the-art facilities are also available with the health department. The district now has enough beds available with oxygen support. Around 350 cylinders of oxygen can be supplied daily from the plant at the Civil Hospital in Sector 10,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram. Several private hospitals in Gurugram have also installed oxygen plants on their premises. Dr Devlina Chakravarty, managing director of Artemis Hospitals, said, “We have installed three oxygen plants to become self-sufficient in oxygen supply. Understanding the need for more beds and also to isolate the Covid patients, we have come up with a new tower.” Arpita Mukherjee, senior vice-president for operations at Max Hospital, Gurugram, said, “We have a new oxygen plant, eight bed portable unit outside the hospital to isolate Covid patients and adequate supplies across the hospital with respect to oxygen ports, ventilators, Bipaps and oxygen concentrators.” Experts said that it’s too early to say that the district has enough health infrastructure to deal with any possible third Civid-19 wave. Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of department of community medicine and school of public health at PGIMER Chandigarh, said, “We have to wait for another one week to 10 days to see if the oxygen capacity that the district has built is enough or not, as hospitalisation numbers are still quite low. Similarly, for ambulances, the numbers have increased, but currently most patients are under home isolation. The third wave is very likely, but we have to see how it affects our country and whether there would be a need for oxygen, hospital beds or ambulances, as was the case during the second wave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/11-o2-plants-50-more-beds-gurugram-readies-to-fight-covid-101641322624529.html

05-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi may see rain today, cleaner air this week: IMD||Delhi may witness rain on Wednesday and Saturday this week, with faster winds that are expected to blow away some pollutants and improve air quality in the city, the India Meteorological Department said on Tuesday. RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said peak rainfall activity is currently forecast for two days – Wednesday and Saturday -- with the latter expected to record wind speed of 30-40 km/hour. “Delhi is expected to see two back-to-back western disturbances (areas of ‘disturbed’ or reduced air pressure, moving from the west to the east, carrying moisture associated with rainfall, snowfall and fog in northern India), the first of which is already bringing rain and snowfall to parts of northern India from January 3-5, while the second will impact Delhi from January 6-9,” he said. “A yellow alert is currently in place for Wednesday and Saturday. Both days will see light rain, gusty winds and the maximum temperature will therefore drop to around 18 degrees Celsius,” Jenamani added.A yellow alert is generally issued by the IMD asking the general public to “be aware” of a weather situation developing in the next 24 to 48 hours. According to IMD’s weather bulletin, widespread rain, isolated hailstorm and low day time temperatures are also likely over northwest India at least for next seven days.The two consecutive active western disturbances (January 3-5, and January 6-9) are also likely to affect northwest and adjoining central India, it said. Fairly widespread moderate rainfall/snowfall is very likely over western Himalayan region during January 4 to 6. Scattered to moderate rainfall is likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, north Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh and west Madhya Pradesh during January 4 to 6, the bulletin said. Isolated heavy rainfall is very likely over Punjab on January 5 and isolated thunderstorm activity accompanied with hailstorm is likely over Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan on January 5, it added.Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality improved slightly on Tuesday, but remained in the higher end of the very poor category, with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 378 recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily 4pm bulletin. The Capital’s AQI reading was 387 (very poor) on Monday.According to a forecast by the Early Warning System, Delhi’s air quality is expected to improve to the “poor” category on Thursday, remaining in the same range for the next five days. The capital recorded a maximum temperature of 23.2 degrees Celsius on Tuesday – four degrees above normal, while the minimum temperature was recorded at 8.5 degrees, one degree above the normal. Jenamani said under the influence of the western disturbance, the minimum temperature could rise to 11 degrees Celsius by Wednesday, however, the maximum temperature could hover around 18 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature is then expected to remain over 10 degrees Celsius for the rest of the week until Sunday, making nights fairly warmer. “We will see a reversal now, making nights warmer and days to be harsh, with the maximum to remain below 20 degrees Celsius until Sunday,” Jenamani added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-may-see-rain-today-cleaner-air-this-week-imd-101641321184638.html
05-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi Teachers University Bill sails through assembly||The Delhi Assembly on Tuesday passed the Delhi Teachers University Bill, which seeks to set up a teachers’ training university. The campus of the Delhi Teachers University is coming up at Bakkarwala in east Delhi, and the government has said that it will enrol 5,000 students starting this year. The university will offer four-year integrated teacher education programmes such as BA-BEd, BSc-BEd among others.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, had introduced the Bill in the House on Monday. During a discussion on the Bill on Tuesday, Sisodia said that the university will set a new benchmark for teachers’ training in the country and enhance the quality of education. While taking a potshot at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sisodia said that the upcoming sports university in Meerut was being modelled on the same lines as the sports university in Delhi. “It is pleasant to see that the sports university in Meerut, where the foundation stone has been laid, is being developed exactly like the sports university of Delhi because till date neither Gujarat nor any other Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-governed state has created any such model from where they could copy. Therefore, the UP government and the Prime Minister are copying the Kejriwal model,” said Sisodia. Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, meanwhile, accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government of not opening any new colleges in the city. Bidhuri said that the AAP government was only announcing universities for publicity. “The government announced a sports university and even appointed a vice-chancellor, but nothing is known about it,” said Bidhuri. He said that no new college had been opened by the AAP government and an attempt was being made to “rob existing colleges” by giving them the “shape of a university”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-teachers-university-bill-sails-through-assembly-101641320825274.html
05-01-2022||Delhi||Twin towers proposed at ITO as Delhi govt’s new office address||The Delhi chief minister, his cabinet colleagues, and senior bureaucrats in the Delhi government may move into new offices in 30-35 storey twin towers proposed be constructed by 2025 at central Delhi’s ITO, not far from the current seat of the Delhi government at the Players’ Building in Indraprastha Estate, according to government documents and officials aware of the matter.One tower is proposed to come up at the Vikas Bhawan plot, and the other at the MSO and GST Building plot, on a total 53,603 square metres area at an estimated cost of ₹1,910 crore, the officials said. The buildings will have dedicated stilt and basement parking areas, including electrical charging points for vehicles, they added.Apart from offices for the chief minister and ministers, the twin towers will have offices for the chief secretary, additional chief secretary, principal secretaries, secretaries and their support staff. The towers will be green buildings and will have state-of-the-art infrastructure, auditoriums with capacity for 2,000, 1,000 and 500 people, seminar rooms and conference halls, libraries, crèche, community halls, canteen, cafeteria, food court, gym and landscaping, according to the tender document, a copy which HT has seen. “The Delhi government intends to construct an iconic twin building at ITO comprising 30 to 35 storeys on three plots of land i.e. Vikas Bhawan-1, MSO Building and GST Building, with one tower in Vikas Bhawan-1 and another tower in MSO and GST Building. The work involves architectural planning for the work of the new office building at ITO. The new office building is proposed to be constructed as per the detail and norms of Delhi government,” the tender document, floated by Public Works Department on Monday, said.The facilities will include Wi-Fi, CCTV cameras, access control, escalators, centralised air conditioning, audio/video systems for conference halls, meeting room, common areas, a sewage treatment plant and facilities for rainwater harvesting. The consultant has to plan maximum utilisation of permissible floor area ratio (FAR) according to Master Plan 2021.Currently, the chief minister, cabinet ministers, chief secretary and several top Delhi government officials function out of Players’ Building, popularly known as Delhi Secretariat. The Players’ Building was planned and built as a hotel to accommodate players for the 1982 Asian Games, but it was not ready on time. During Sheila Dikshit’s tenure as the chief minister [WHICH YEAR], the secretariat of the Delhi government was shifted to Players’ Building from Civil Lines to provide better facilities to ministers and officers.The existing Delhi Secretariat, however, does not have the required space to accommodate all the top officials of the Delhi government. Offices of the revenue commissioner, labour commissioner, GST commissioner, education secretary, transport commissioner, excise commissioner, secretary food and civil supplies, and several senior officers are located at different locations outside the Delhi Secretariat.“Due to their offices being located in different areas, officers end up wasting time in travel and traffic congestion whenever they are required to visit the Secretariat for meetings. Things are more difficult for officers holding charges of multiple departments. They are often required to visit different and often distant places for discharging their duties. If the offices are located in the same building or at least at the same location, officers will save time,” said a senior Delhi government official, who asked not to be named.A former chief secretary of Delhi, who asked not to be identified, said the integration of offices was necessary for increasing speed and efficiency.Currently, offices of food and civil supplies, excise department, minority commissioner, public grievance commission and others are located in Vikas Bhawan. The office of the PWD is located in the MSO Building and the department of trade and taxes functions from GST Building.A PWD official, requesting anonymity, said the consultant will have to prepare architectural and layout plans of the new office building in such a way that a minimum number of existing structures that house various offices of the Delhi government is demolished. “One or two-storey temporary porta-cabins and temporary structures will be added to the existing buildings in these places for accommodating offices that exist in the buildings being demolished,” the official said.The Delhi government did not comment on the matter.AK Jain, a former planning commissioner at DDA, said it was a good move to redevelop the government offices because many of them are in a dilapidated condition.“The new office buildings, however, will significantly increase traffic volume at ITO, which is already congested. The government should pay attention to developing a comprehensive urban design scheme according to MPD 2021. And they should take advantage of mixed land-use which permits 30% of the area to be used for residential activities so that traffic can be reduced,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/twin-towers-proposed-at-ito-as-delhi-govt-s-new-office-address-101641320644357.html

Covid norms tighten in Pune||PUNE On Tuesday, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar announced that the district administration in Pune would strictly implement Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, as the city’s positivity rate has hit 18%. The administration also said that the state is likely to bring in more restrictions following a state review meet held on Tuesday. Pawar said, “Despite more than 100% of the eligible population in the district having got the first dose, only 74% in the district have taken their second shot and the rest despite completing the mandatory 84-day gap, have not yet taken the second dose. If people don’t come forward, we will be forced to take extreme measures. Fully vaccinated people even if infected showed only mild symptoms.” Pawar further added that those not wearing the mask would be penalised ₹500, while those spitting would be penalised ₹1,000. He further said, “We have done multiple appeals to citizens to get fully vaccinated, however, over 35% of the eligible population in the district is yet to get the second jab. However, now that people are still not coming forward we have to take extreme steps.” Pawar explained that those without complete vaccination would not be able to enter public places or restaurants, hotels and theatres. “There is no need for anyone to object to this now that we have given enough time to people to get themselves vaccinated. In addition to this those who are not fully vaccinated would not be co-operated with at government offices. We will follow a no-mask no-entry policy at public places. Experts even beleive that cotton masks or even a tw-ply mask would not be enough to stop the spread and that people should go for a three ply surgical mask,” he said. Pawar further added that as of now it is not important to know whether it is an Omicron variant or another variant as the number of cases are exploding and treatment should begin as necessary. The doubling rate of the city is noe almost at three days, added Pawar. State health minister Rajesh Tope said, “We have appealed to the centre that they must set a standard operating procedure for the treatment of Covid-19 patients across the country. Also, it is important to stock Molnupiravir which has been approved for the treatment of those with mild Covid-19 symptoms and the centre must provide us with enough stocks. We also appealed to the centreto bring down the cost of the anti Covid-19 monoclonal antibodies treatment which is very expensive as of now.” Pawar said, “As of now we have decided on the restrictions which could be taken at a local level. We have set up a meeting on Wednesday wherein we will take decisions for the state where if required, we will push for more restrictions at the state level.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/nomask-no-entry-policy-at-public-places-rs1k-fine-for-spitting-covid-norms-tighten-in-pune-101641317284635.html
05-01-2022||Lucknow||Previous regime in UP was worshipper of Kans: CM Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday launched a veiled attack on Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, accusing him of not doing anything for Mathura and other religious places associated with Lord Krishna, and termed the previous regime in UP as “the worshipper of Kans.”He accused the previous government of creating a ‘Kans’ that resulted in the Jawahar Bagh incident in which 29 people were killed in June 2016 when police forcibly tried to evict squatters who were backed by Ram Vriksh Yadav.The CM hit out at the Samajwadi Party president, saying that Lord Krishna would be cursing him for unleashing riots during his rule, firing on Ram devotees by his party and asked him to tender an apology for it.“Lord Krishna might be questioning the opposition party leaders in dreams as to why they could not do for UP what BJP government is doing for the state,” said the CM while addressing a public gathering in Aligarh after inaugurating a 660 mw Harduaganj Thermal Power plant costing ₹7,000 crore“We used money collected as tax in development work, but the previous regime in the state used to get it stored. The money is now being dug out from walls by our government using bulldozers,” said Adityanath to justify the I-T raids on those allegedly having links with the Samajwadi Party.Adityanath’s comment came a day after Akhilesh Yadav claimed that Lord Krishna comes to his dreams every night to tell him that he would form the government in the upcoming assembly polls and establish “Ram Rajya” in UP.He said: “While I am inaugurating the power project here, some people are dreaming in Lucknow. Lord Krishna would be coming in their dreams, and tell them to shed tears over their failures. The work that they have not been able to do, the BJP government is doing it.”Adityanath claimed that the power corporation accomplished a major task by increasing production, which paved way for the electrification of 1,21,000 villages in UP. According to him, the previous government in UP used to enter into power purchase agreement at exorbitant prices, leading to hike in electricity charges for the consumers.Nearly 2,000 students were given smart phones and tablets by the CM at the venue in Aligarh’s Kasimpur where UP energy minister Shrikant Sharma was also present. Adityanath shared that the state government would soon make “digital access with good content” available for those who couldn’t afford operational cost of their devices.The CM also laid the foundation stone of UP’s Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) training centre in Saharanpur’s Deoband and launched different projects worth ₹200 crore, including fire stations in different districts across the poll-bound.Spread over 2,000 sq metres, the upcoming ATS training centre is expected to train 100 commandos who would maintain vigil in the communally sensitive western UP. The state government plans to set up similar centres across UP, including Meerut, Bahraich, Shravasti, and Gautam Buddh Nagar.The CM reiterated that his government had a “zero-tolerance policy” towards crime and corruption and the ATS training centre in Deoband would be a strong base for the security of western UP with deployment of 56 commandos who could dig out terrorists “the way Osama Bin Laden was hunted.”Taking pot shots at the SP chief, the CM said that farmers, artisans and youths had given recognition to Saharanpur, but Akhilesh Yadav didn’t visit the place while he had visited it more than a dozen times. “For me, there is no difference between Lucknow and Saharanpur,” he said.“The BJP is building expressways, airports, universities, medical colleges and is going tough on criminals. But this has given pain to the brother and sister in Delhi (Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi), Babua (Akhilesh Yadav) and Bua (Mayawati). They all were not seen during 22 months when the state faced corona crisis, but returned to the masses as elections drew closer,” alleged Adityanath.“Akhilesh Yadav feels hurt when we recover the poor’s money through raids, initiate action against the mafia, allow Kanwar Yatra and construct Ram Temple. We deliver what we promise,” he said and claimed that his government provided benefits of welfare schemes to all without discrimination and followed the objective of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabha Vishwas’.“There was phase of time in history when temples in Ayodhya, Kashi and Mathura were insulted and hands of those who built structures were chopped off. But now this has changed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi showered flower petals and had food with those who were involved in the construction of Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi,” said Adityanath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/previous-regime-in-up-was-worshipper-of-kans-yogi-101641312663664.html
05-01-2022||Chandigarh||PM’s Ferozepur rally: Security up amid farm union’s call for protest at venue||Over 7,000 security personnel from paramilitary forces, Punjab Police and Haryana Police have been deployed at the venue of the Prime Minister’s rally in Ferozepur amid the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC)’s call to its activists to gather at the site on Wednesday to oppose Narendra Modi’s visit.Modi will be visiting the border district of poll-bound Punjab on Wednesday to lay the foundation stones of projects worth ₹ 42,750 crore. The visit is also being projected as the launch of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s election campaign.KMSC general secretary Sarban Singh Pandher said the protest is aimed at opposing the BJP-led central government for adopting anti-farmer policies. He alleged that two large groups of KMSC activists were stopped by police from reaching the rally site.“We demand the immediate removal of Ajay Mishra from the Union cabinet for his role in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case. We will oppose Modi’s visit in a non-violent manner,” said Pandher.Official sources said heavy security arrangements have been made to secure the rally venue. A 10-kilometre radius around the venue, which is located about five kilometres from the city on the Ferozepur-Moga highway, has been sealed for security reasons. The paramilitary personnel have been given charge of the inner ring whereas police have been deployed around the venue. Security personnel have been asked to screen rally attendees to avoid any protest inside the rally event.Unions to burn Modi’s effigies across PunjabFarmers’ unions will also oppose Modi’s visit by burning his effigies at all district headquarters in Punjab.Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) chief Joginder Singh Ugrahan said farmers will also assemble in various towns and burn the PM’s effigies to highlight their pending demands and protest against the Centre’s failure to deliver justice in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case.“We seek action against Ajay Mishra. FIRs against farmers are still pending in Delhi and Haryana. There is no clarity on the committee on MSP that the government had promised to form,” said Ugrahan.Dr Darshan Pal, president of Krantikari Kisan Union Punjab, held a meeting with union members in Barnala on Tuesday. He said over 700 farmers died during the agitation against the three farm laws, but the PM deliberately delayed the decision to repeal these laws and farmers are angry with him over it.Meanwhile, BKU Ugrahan will end its protest against the state government by lifting the dharnas from front of 12 district administration headquarters on Wednesday. Among other demands, the union was seeking ₹3 lakh compensation, government job and debt waiver for family members of farmers and farm labourers who committed suicide. Joginder Singh Ugrahan said the Punjab government has given compensation in most cases, FIRs have been quashed in most districts and affected families got jobs in 180 cases. “The dharnas will end from Wednesday evening,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/modi-in-punjab-farmer-unions-to-burn-pm-s-effigies-101641304442065.html
05-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh mayor: It’s BJP vs AAP as Congress opts out of race||With the Congress opting out of the January 8 Chandigarh mayoral election, the contest for the post will now be between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Also read: As Covid-19 spreads, Punjab imposes night curfew; schools, colleges shutThe AAP has fielded Anju Katyal and the BJP Sarabjit Kaur, both first-timers, as the post is reserved for a woman councillor in the new MC House’s first year.While both candidates filed their nomination papers on Tuesday, the last date to do so, the Congress, which had won only eight of the 35 MC seats, not only opted out of the race, but also announced that it will abstain from voting.In its debut MC election in Chandigarh, the AAP won 14 seats and the BJP strength was reduced to 12 seats from the 20 it had won in 2016.The BJP has fielded Dalip Sharma for the post of senior deputy mayor and Anup Gupta for the post of deputy mayor, while the AAP has fielded Prem Lata for the post of senior deputy mayor and Ram Chander Yadav for the post of deputy mayor. On the selection of candidates, AAP co-in-charge Pardeep Chhabra said, “All our candidates are capable and have qualities for the respective posts. Their names have been decided after reaching consensus.”Arun Sood, president, Chandigarh BJP, said, “Through our candidates, we have given representation to all sections of society. The mayoral candidate represents the semi-urban and village areas, the senior deputy mayor candidate represents the colonies and EWS areas, and the deputy mayor candidate the city’s sectors.”A senior party leader, requesting anonymity, said, “With an eye on the forthcoming Punjab elections, BJP had also decided to put up a Jat Sikh face for the mayor’s post.” Had no time to file nominations, will not vote: CongressMeanwhile, Congress city chief Subhash Chawla, who is currently in Jaipur, Rajasthan, with the party’s seven councillors, said, “There was no time for us to return to Chandigarh and file the nominations. We got to know about it only late at night. We had also finalised our candidates, but it was not possible to file nominations at such a short notice.”Chawla further said, “We will not participate in the mayoral elections and will not vote for any party.” The party councillors, though, may come to the House and then leave without casting their votes. As per a party insider, it is the first time that the Congress has failed to put up a candidate for the mayor’s post. Initially, the party had declared that it would fight for all three posts. Neck and neckIn the December 24 election, the Congress tally had gone up to eight from four in 2016. However, it lost its ward 10 councillor, Harpreet Kaur Babla, to the BJP after she and her husband, Devinder Singh Babla, joined the saffron fold on Sunday. Now, in the full House of 36, comprising one vote of the Chandigarh MP and 35 councillors, the BJP and the AAP have 14 votes each, the Congress is left with seven votes and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has one vote. With the Congress deciding not to participate in the elections, 29 is likely to be the total votes on polling day and the candidates securing the maximum votes will win. In the absence of an anti-defection law, the councillors are not bound to follow any party diktat for voting. Meanwhile, amid strong buzz that the SAD’s lone councillor may also skip voting in the election, a party leader said they will take a call in a couple of days. The party councillor, Hardeep Singh, will meet party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal to decide on the issue. In case Hardeep also abstains, the election might see a tie with both the AAP and the BJP having 14 votes each. Then the candidates will be decided through a draw of lot.“The possibility of a tie is minimal, if the past history of the mayoral elections is considered. The parties have traditionally failed to keep their flocks together and this time too, the prospects of cross voting remain high. Already allegations of horse-trading have been flying high among all parties,” said a senior Congress leader, requesting anonymity.On the BJP’s strategy for the election, Sood said, “We will ask the 35 councillors to vote for development and stability, which only the BJP can provide.”AAP’s Chandigarh president Prem Garg said the party had sought cooperation from everyone, including the Congress and the BJP, to respect the public mandate and let an AAP mayor be elected.“However, we are not entering into any alliance or seat sharing with any party. Both these parties seem to have joined hands to defeat the AAP nominees through manipulation. But Chandigarh residents are aware citizens and understand such political gimmicks. AAP criticises any type of horse-trading or cross voting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mayor-it-s-bjp-vs-aap-congress-opts-out-of-race-101641298372229.html

05-01-2022||Delhi||New excise policy curbed ₹3,500 crore theft, says Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ‘chakka jam’ protest against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s new excise policy in Delhi led to a war of words between the two parties on Monday. While the BJP claimed the new policy will make the capital “a city of liquor” shops, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia alleged that the new policy has jolted the BJP as it has “deep ties with the liquor mafia”. Demanding the immediate roll back of the excise policy, the BJP blocked roads in several areas across the city. In the run-up to the municipal elections due to be held in April this year, the BJP is trying to corner the AAP on its excise policy, which came into effect in November last year. According to the policy, the Delhi government has quit the retail liquor business with nearly 600 government-run liquor vends operating across the national capital shutting shop. It aims at revolutionising the consumer experience with setting up swanky shops and rooting out the liquor mafia. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia hit out at the BJP for opposing the policy, saying that the party is opposing it because the new policy has “stopped the theft of ₹3,500 crore”. “The BJP has deep ties with the liquor mafia in Delhi. The BJP had made such a system that wherever there were no legal liquor shops, they used to operate illegal shops and run them through the mafia. The new excise policy of the Kejriwal government stopped revenue theft of over Rs3500 crores. Both BJP and the liquor mafia were immersed in this loot of ₹3500 crores. The BJP is surely feeling the pain because their theft has been plugged. The Kejriwal government is now using this revenue for public interest.” The Delhi BJP has been opposing the new policy since June last year, when it was notified by the Delhi government. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “All Delhi citizens, including women, are concerned as new liquor vends are being opened in residential areas close to people’s homes. While [chief minister Arvind] Kejriwal talks of prohibition in the poll-bound Punjab, he is hell-bent upon making Delhi a city of liquor shops. Kejriwal government is opening 850 new liquor shops. While Kejriwal has himself written in his book Swaraj that liquor shop can’t be opened in any area without local leaders or officials being bribed.” On Monday, several senior BJP leaders, including South Delhi MP Ramesh Bidhuri, and former East Delhi mayor Harshdeep Malhotra, took to the streets along with party workers to protest against the policy. Responding to Sisodia charge, Gupta said, “He (Sisodia) does not seem to have read Arvind Kejriwal’s book, Swaraj, in which the latter has talked about how the opening of a liquor shop results in corruption. Today, so many shops are being opened by the government. Shops have been opened in residential areas, near religious places, schools, etc.” He said that the BJP will continue to protest against the excise policy till it is withdrawn. Sisodia also slammed the BJP for vandalising public property. He said, “The BJP is upset with our ban on theft that it is troubling the public. DTC buses bought with people’s money are being vandalised, BJP workers are puncturing their tyres. This shows the anti-people mentality of BJP. I strongly condemn the hooliganism that the BJP created on the streets of Delhi today. Amid the ongoing pandemic, it is time to serve the public and not to harass the public and damage government property.” Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor termed Sisodia’s statement as irresponsible. “Nothing can be more irrelevant and irresponsible then Sisodia’s statement about BJP’s ties with liquor mafia. For the past 24 years, the BJP has been out of power in Delhi. BJP leaders had no powers to check or control liquor sale in Delhi be it from the 650 government vends or by illicit liquor sellers.He said that there has been a loot of Rs. 3500 crores per annum through liquor mafia. Obviously, mafia will pay those in government and hence for last eight years the AAP seems to have been receiving this money.” AAP MLA Dilip Pandey slammed the BJP for not supporting AAP government’s “progressive policy”. Political analyst Tanvir Aeijaz, professor of political science at Ramjas College, said, “The BJP has been trying to build a general opinion against the AAP by raising the issue of the excise policy. They are taking the moral high ground, but the real issues affecting people are different. It [civic polls] is about sanitation and basic civic services.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-excise-policy-curbed-3-500-crore-theft-says-delhi-deputy-cm-manish-sisodia-101641232291810.html
05-01-2022||World||HT This Day: Jan 6, 1965 – TS Eliot dead||Reuters, APLondon- One of Britain’s greatest literary figures, American-born poet, critic and dramatist T. S. Eliot, died at his London home last night. He was 76. Mr. Eliot, who won, the Nobel Prize for literature in 1948, lived London since World War I. He was one of the creators of modern poetry and is perhaps best remembered for a line that has passed by now into common usage-"this is the way the world ends....not with a bans but a whimper." Mr Eliot, a native of St. Louis, Missouri, spent most of his adult life in Britain. Mr Thomas Stearns Eliot suffered a heart attack aboard the liner Queen Mary in June 1956 but recovered and married his secretary the following January when he was 68 years old. His bride, 30-year-old Valerie Fletcher, was his second wife. His two most successful plays were Murder in the Cathedral, a dramatization of the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral, and The Cocktail Party, the story of a psychiatrist who helped people find peace of mind. Never a prolific writer, Mr Eliot nevertheless was considered a perfect commentator on both poetry and prose and the theatre. He relinquished his U.S. citizenship in 1927 and became a British subject.Mr Eliot celebrated the loneliness of modern man in his poetry. In his later years his critical essays were more and more concerned with problems of Christianity. He was an outspoken member of the Church of England and one of its leading defenders. Long ago be save his three leading ideals in life as classicism in poetry, Anglo-Catholicism a religion and Royalism in politics. In private life, he was a director of Faber and Faber, one of England's leading publishers. Daily he went to his office, tall, slender and stooped, in a dark suit that made him look like a banker. He avoided London's literary whirl and was a churchwarden in his parish in sedate London district of South Kensington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-jan-6-1965-ts-eliot-dead-101641406220961.html
05-01-2022||World||UK authorities ease Covid testing requirements amid surge in infections||Health authorities across the UK simplified Covid-19 testing requirements on Wednesday, a move designed to cut isolation times for many people and that may ease the staffing shortages that are hitting public services from hospitals to garbage collection amid an omicron-fueled surge in infections.In another effort to bolster the economy, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the House of Commons that pre-departure tests for people traveling to England will no longer be required because the omicron variant is so prevalent that travel restrictions meant to contain its spread are now meaningless. The tests had discouraged people from traveling overseas for fear they would get stuck abroad.The moves came as the Cabinet backed Johnson's decision not to impose any further restrictions despite record Covid-19 infection levels. With indications that omicron is less severe than earlier variants and widespread vaccination curtailing serious illnesses, the government is sticking with light-touch controls imposed in mid-December.“All these measures are balanced and proportionate ways of ensuring we can live with Covid without letting our guard down," Johnson told lawmakers.The UK Health Security Agency said that from Jan. 11 people in England who test positive using a rapid lateral flow test will no longer need to confirm the result with a PCR test if they are asymptomatic.The temporary move, which also was used early last year, will cut the time people who record a positive lateral flow test but don't have Covid-19 symptoms need to self-isolate. They will no longer need to wait for the result of a PCR test and then begin another seven days of isolation.“While cases of Covid continue to rise, this tried-and-tested approach means that LFDs (lateral flow devices) can be used confidently to indicate Covid-19 infection without the need for PCR confirmation," said Jenny Harries, the agency's chief executive.Health authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland quickly followed suit, with Northern Ireland making the change immediately. Scotland and Wales plan to introduce it starting Thursday.Epidemiologist John Edmunds, a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the move made sense.“When the prevalence is high, and it is incredibly high at the moment, almost everyone who tests positive with a lateral flow test will be a true positive," Edmunds said. “There is really no need to confirm this with a PCR, a step that not only wastes time but costs a lot of money and uses up laboratory resources that could be better used elsewhere."But he cautioned that the change will mean authorities have less data about the spread of different variants as PCR swabs are used for genotyping and sequencing to identify different mutations. The change also will mean that daily updates on confirmed cases — which come from PCR tests — "may need more careful interpretation,” he said.Confirmed new infections over the last seven days jumped 40% from a week earlier, according to the latest government statistics.The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, tested positive for the coronavirus and missed the chance to grill Johnson about the government’s Covid-19 policies on Wednesday.A string of National Health Service local organizations have declared "critical incidents" in recent days amid staff shortages. Hospitals in the Greater Manchester region said they would pause some non-urgent surgeries amid the rising impact of Covid-19 and worker absences.Gillian Keegan, a junior minister at the UK Ministry of Health, acknowledged the strain in an interview with the BBC.“Right now, they are under extreme pressure with the omicron variant, with the number of positive cases and the increase in hospitalizations, and at this point in (winter) time when they always have extreme pressure," Keegan said.There have also been cuts to train services and garbage is piling up on some city streets because of sanitation staff shortages.NHS Confederation Chief Executive Matthew Taylor told the BBC he would support the new testing regime if scientists deem it safe.“Hospitals who have declared critical incidents, for example, are essentially reaching out to staff who are on leave, on rest days or even recently retired and asking them to come back to wards, so the situation is desperate," Taylor said. "Any way of getting staff back into hospital is a good thing."An ambulance service in northeast England began advising patients with non-life-threatening conditions over the New Year's weekend to ask a relative to drive them to a hospital as waiting times for ambulances rose because of staff shortages and extra demand.“It is still taking us too long to get an ambulance to patients. Unfortunately, due to this, patients remain at risk, which is unacceptable," North East Ambulance Service medical director Mathew Beattie said Wednesday.He stressed, however, that "we would never ask anyone to drive themselves to hospital with a life-threatening illness.”Opposition politicians and some public health experts have pressed the government to tighten restrictions on business and personal interactions as omicron sweeps across the country. Johnson has resisted their calls after almost 100 of his party’s lawmakers opposed mask requirements and other infection-control measures imposed last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-authorities-ease-covid-testing-requirements-amid-surge-in-infections-101641405556752.html
05-01-2022||World||France allows some Covid-19 positive medics to keep working||France is allowing health care workers who are infected with the coronavirus but have few or no symptoms to keep treating patients rather than self-isolate, an extraordinary stopgap measure aimed at easing staff shortages at hospitals and other facilities caused by an unprecedented explosion in cases.The special exemption to France's quarantine rules being rolled out to hospitals, elderly care homes, doctors' offices and other essential health services testifies to the growing strain on the French medical system by the fast-spreading omicron variant.It is a calculated risk, with the possibility that health care workers with Covid-19 could infect colleagues and patients being weighed against what the government says is a need to keep essential services running.Outside the health sector, for those not covered by the special exemption, France's quarantine rules require at least five days of self-isolation for the fully vaccinated who test positive. For the unvaccinated, self-isolation is at least seven days.Governments and industries have warned that isolation rules are creating staff shortages across a range of sectors as the omicron variant causes surges in infections in many countries. In some places, quarantines have been shortened, including France, to get workers back to their posts.But in Europe, France appears to be alone in now also opening up the possibility for health care personnel to work while infected.There are increasing signs that the variant causes less-severe disease. But the deluge of infections is still sending increasing numbers of people to hospitals, putting those institutions under pressure, especially when medical workers are absent, too.French hospital authorities said the new flexibility from self-isolation would help them plug staffing holes if and when they open up.“If the system becomes very strained and 50% of our staff are positive, the less symptomatic will come to work because the patients will still need to be cared for,” said Dr. Marc Leone, head of anesthesiology at the North Hospital in the southern city of Marseille.“But we're not in that situation yet,” he said.The new rules were detailed in a Health Ministry alert message that was addressed Sunday to hospitals, care facilities and health authorities and was seen by The Associated Press. The changes are being rolled out this week.The ministry alert said France's deluge of virus infections poses “a major risk of disruption to the offer of care.” It described the measure as “exceptional and temporary" and said it will be lifted when the system isn't so saturated with virus cases.The exemption opens the possibility for doctors, hospital staff, and those working with the disabled and other vulnerable people to stay on the job despite testing positive, on condition that they are fully vaccinated and aren't coughing and sneezing.In the Paris region, hospitals said the measure could be applied as a last resort if infected staff are urgently needed to help keep services open and if they volunteer to work.“If they are tired, have a scratchy throat and prefer to stay at home, nobody will force them to come to work with Covid,” said Romain Eskenazi, communications director for two hospitals in the French capital's northern suburbs.Professor Rémi Salomon, a commission president for the Paris hospitals' authority, said that while staff absences are “a major problem,” allowing infected staff to work is “extremely hard to implement.”“Health workers say to themselves, ‘I’m scared of transmitting the virus to patients,'" he told broadcaster France Info.The Health Ministry instructions say that, where possible, the infected workers shouldn't be in contact with unvaccinated patients or those at greater risk of severe illness with Covid-19.The ministry said they also must limit as much as possible their interactions with colleagues and cannot take part in shared activities where face masks are removed, such as breaks for food and drinks.With Europe’s highest number of confirmed daily virus cases, France is in an increasingly challenging position.France’s average daily case load has more than doubled in a week, and the country reported a record 271,686 daily virus cases Tuesday as the omicron variant burdens hospital staff and threatens to disrupt health care, transportation, schools and other services.More than 20,000 people are hospitalized with the virus in France, a number that has been rising steadily for weeks but not as sharply as infection rates.Covid-19 patients fill more than 72% of France’s ICU beds, and the once-renowned health care system is again showing signs of strain. Most virus patients in ICUs are not vaccinated, though 77% of the population has had at least two doses.More than 124,000 people with the virus have died in France, among the world’s higher recorded death tolls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-allows-some-covid-19-positive-medics-to-keep-working-101641404033547.html

Instead, he has bet that a vaccine booster drive and caution among the population will be enough to constrain the latest wave of infections, despite the arrival of the highly transmissible Omicron variant.More than 220,000 Covid-19 cases were recorded on one day in the last week, and the provision of services and testing capacity is increasingly under strain.Many countries still not sequencing Omicron: WHO chief scientistIn England, the estimated Covid-19 prevalence was one in 15 for the week ending Dec. 31 -- over 6% of the population and up from an estimate of one in 25 for the previous week, the Office for National Statistics said.ONS figures also showed record prevalence in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In all, an estimated nearly 3.75 million people were infected across the United Kingdom.The Omicron variant has had the biggest impact in London, where one in 10 people tested positive.Johnson said on Tuesday that England had a chance to "ride out" the surge in Covid-19 infections without shutting down the economy, thanks to vaccinations and evidence that Omicron is milder than previous variants.Despite this, he warned of substantial disruption from staff absences as people self-isolate. He will update parliament later on Wednesday on his Covid-19 strategy.The UK Health Security Agency said on Wednesday that people without Covid-19 symptoms who test positive on a rapid lateral flow test in England will not need to confirm the result with a PCR test that needs to go to the lab for processing, a move designed to ease pressure on the testing system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-reports-record-covid-prevalence-1-in-15-infected-in-england-last-week-101641397357652.html

05-01-2022||World||Veteran Chinese diplomat appointed SCO secretary-general||China’s outgoing ambassador to the European Union, Zhang Ming, has taken over as the new secretary-general of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), an eight-member security bloc that includes India.Zhang, who served for four years as the head of the Chinese mission to the EU, assumed office on January 1.Zhang, 65, will be based at the SCO secretariat in Beijing and took over from Vladimir Norov, a former diplomat from Uzbekistan who had held the office since 2019.Confirming the appointment on Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said: “According to SCO rules and as approved by the Council of Heads of States of the SCO, Zhang Ming has assumed the role of the SG of the SCO for a term of three years from January 1 this year.“He is a veteran diplomat with great experience in multilateral diplomacy. I am sure like his predecessors, he will achieve new progress.”“As the host country of the SCO secretariat, China will continue to support the secretariat and the secretary-general and will work with other parties to uphold the Shanghai spirit, deepen political security, trade, connectivity and cultural cooperation,” Wang said.The SCO comprises eight member states: India, Kazakhstan, China, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.The security-focused bloc also comprises four countries with “observer” status and six more as “dialogue partners”.India and Pakistan joined SCO at the Astana summit in 2017.Zhang, who had served in Yemen, Oman and Israel among other countries, had earlier served as both assistant minister and vice-minister of foreign affairs at the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs.The senior Chinese diplomat’s takers over SCO head in the backdrop of Pakistan’s frequent efforts to bring up the issue of Kashmir, a bilateral one, at the multilateral forum, going against the mechanism’s charter.In September, NSA Ajit Doval walked out of a virtual meeting of national security advisers of SCO states after his Pakistani counterpart, Moeed Yusuf, projected a map, which inaccurately depicted the borders of the two countries.And, in November, external affairs minister S Jaishankar criticised another attempt to bring up bilateral problems at the 20th meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of Government.“It is unfortunate to note that there have been repeated attempts to deliberately bring bilateral issues into SCO. This violates the well-established principles and norms of SCO Charter. Such acts are counterproductive to the spirit of consensus and cooperation that define this organisation and should be condemned,” Jaishankar then said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/veteran-chinese-diplomat-appointed-sco-secretarygeneral-101641388222528.html
05-01-2022||World||Birth rates in 10 Chinese provinces fell below 1% in 2020: Report||Birth rates in ten Chinese provinces, including Henan - the third most populated province in the country with nearly 100 million people - fell below one percent in the 2020 for the first time in decades, new official statistics showed, according to a news report on Tuesday.The data, released by individual provinces in China, corroborates what central official statistics revealed last November: China’s average birth rate fell below one percent in 2020, marking the lowest rate of childbirth since 1978, according to a report in the Global Times.China recorded a birth rate of 8.52 per 1,000 people in 2020, according to the China Statistical Yearbook 2020 compiled and released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in November, the report said.According to the fresh statistics provided by the local government, between 1.1 million to 1.2 million births were recorded each year from 2002 to 2010 in Henan, a central Chinese province. “However, its birth rate for the first time fell to 9.24 per 1,000 people in 2020, and the number of new babies was 920,000, also a new low since 1978,” the Global Times report said.The birth rates in some developed regions such as eastern China’s Jiangsu province was below even the national level, falling to 6.66 per 1,000 people. Beijing and Tianjin, a city located some 100km from the capital, saw rates of 6.98 and 5.99 per 1,000 people, respectively, the report said.Other regions, like Guizhou province in the southwest and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the south, saw birth rates above the national average of 8.52 per thousand people, the report said.Demographers in China say fertility rates are falling because of various reasons, including, bur not limited to, an ageing population, changes in people’s choices, and even the upheaval caused by the Covid pandemic.“China faces challenges including an aging population and changes in people’s choices. Low birth rates will continue due to many factors,” Song Jian from the Centre for Population and Development Studies of Renmin University of China, told the Global Times.China in August last year further amended the Population and Family Planning Law, allowing couples to have three children in an attempt to boost falling birth rates. This measure came after Beijing in 2016 scrapped its decades-old one-child policy to replace it with a two-child limit, which failed to deliver the expected upsurge in births.The decision to allow three children was taken after China’s once-in-a-decade census published in May 2021 showed that the country’s population grew at the slowest pace to 1.41 billion until the end of 2020.The new census figures revealed that the demographic crisis China faced was expected to deepen as the population of people above 60 years grew to 264 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/birth-rates-in-10-chinese-provinces-fell-below-1-in-2020-report-101641378862139.html

The strain has reportedly more mutations than Omicron and 12 cases caused by this variant have already been found. The World Health Organization has acknowledged the variant but said it has not become much of a threat as of now.WHO said the variant was first identified in November and it has been on the radar since then. The virus had a lot of chances to pick up, Abdi Mahamud, a WHO incident manager on Covid, said.Explained: When was IHU variant first discovered and its spreadWHO monitors multiple variants and assesses their risk factors. IHU has not been labelled as a 'variant under investigation' by WHO as of now as the cases are limited to France. Conclusion:🟢 Nothing to panic or worry too much at the moment , given the evidence.🟡But clearly something that needs to be watched closely for the coming weeks.Scientists are of the opinion that Omicron which is spreading at an alarming rate is of a higher concern than IHU as it has already been there for some months. Vinod Scaria, a scientist of Delhi's Institute of Genomic and Integrative Biology, tweeted on Tuesday, "Nothing to panic or worry too much (about) at the moment, given the evidence. But clearly, something that needs to be watched closely for the coming weeks."The variant has popped up in discussions because of a week-old study by researchers from Méditerranée Infection in Marseille, part of France’s Instituts hospitalo-universitaires (IHU, or University Hospital Institutes).According to reports, the variant was identified in 12 people in the southern Alps around the same time when Omicron was discovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-variant-ihu-what-who-said-on-this-101641377249233.html

He said physical masses will take place in other provinces and online masses for devotees in the capital.In prior years, devotees clad in yellow and maroon have thronged the life-sized tatute as it is paraded through the streets of Manila aboard a rope-pulled carriage.The health ministry on Wednesday reported 10,775 new COVID-19 cases, the highest daily spike since Oct. 10, and more then 60 times the 168 cases recorded on Dec. 21.The tally, which was nearly double the day before, brought total cases to over 2.86 million, and deaths to more than 51,600, the second highest COVID-19 infections and casualties in Southeast Asia, next to Indonesia.Acting Presidential Spokesperson Karlo Nograles urged areas outside the capital region to step up vaccinations amid the threat of the Omicron variant which had already prompted the government to tighten curbs this week."The numbers clearly show these can prevent serious cases of COVID," Nograles said in a statement.The Philippines has so far detected 14 domestic and imported cases of the highly contagious Omicron variant that has driven up COVID-19 case counts and dampened New Year festivities around much of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-cancels-black-nazarene-parade-attended-by-millions-covid-concerns-101641376762765.html

It has maintained a strict Covid-zero policy, designed to eliminate all traces of the virus within its borders.The growing number of Omicron cases and a looming expansion of the vaccine mandate has enlivened the city’s stagnant immunisation rollout. While 66 per cent of the city’s population has received a first injection, just 22 per cent of the over-80 population have started the immunisation process.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-among-8-countries-to-face-flight-ban-in-hong-kong-as-covid-spreads-again-check-details-101641371256646.html

Beijing responded with a stern warning that if Taiwan crossed any red line it would lead to "profound catastrophe".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-air-force-stages-drill-to-intercept-chinese-planes-amid-tensions-101641369626064.html
05-01-2022||World||Kazakhstan government resigns after fierce protests over fuel price||Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev accepted the government's resignation on Wednesday, his office said, after violent protests triggered by a fuel price increase rocked the oil-rich Central Asian country.Police used tear gas and stun grenades late on Tuesday to drive hundreds of protesters out of the main square in Almaty, the former Soviet republic's biggest city, and clashes went on for hours in nearby areas.The protests shook the former Soviet republic's image as a politically stable and tightly-controlled nation - which it has used to attract hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign investment into its oil and metals industries over three decades of independence.Tokayev declared a state of emergency in Almaty and the oil-producing western Mangistau province early on Wednesday and has said that domestic and foreign provocateurs were behind the violence.The protests began in Mangistau province on Sunday following the lifting of price caps on liquefied petroleum gas, a popular car fuel, a day earlier, after which its price more than doubled.Speaking to acting cabinet members on Wednesday, Tokayev ordered them and provincial governors to reinstate LPG price controls and broaden them to gasoline, diesel and other "socially important" consumer goods.He also ordered the government to develop a personal bankruptcy law and consider freezing utilities' prices and subsidising rent payments for poor families.He said the situation was improving in protest-hit cities and towns after the state of emergency was declared which effected a curfew and movement restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kazakhstan-government-resigns-after-fierce-protests-over-fuel-price-101641358304556.html
05-01-2022||World||China’s locked down Xi'an city in chaos after Covid app crash||China’s Covid-19 health code system that strictly governs people’s movements crashed in Xi’an this week, worsening conditions in the locked-down city where the country’s worst outbreak since Wuhan has been unfolding.The crash has complicated efforts to weed out cases through mass testing, created hurdles for people seeking care at hospitals and led to the suspension of a top official, the latest among a slew of bureaucrats to be punished as Beijing fumes over the situation.Liu Jun, head of Xi’an’s big-data bureau, was temporarily dismissed over performance failures, the municipal Communist Party Committee said in a statement. While the committee didn’t explicitly lay out the reason behind its decision, it came after Xi’an’s health code system -- which is under Liu’s purview and tracks individuals’ movements and vaccination status -- broke down on Tuesday.The system crash meant that locals were unable to access their Covid infection status after Xi’an embarked on a new widespread round of nucleic acid tests, according to a media report. The provincial government said in a statement later that the system was temporarily paralyzed due to overwhelming traffic, and being fixed. It had also experienced technical issues in December.People must show their health codes -- which prove that they tested negative for Covid -- to enter hospitals. A mother lost her baby after waiting more than two hours as a hospital wouldn’t let her in without the health code showing that she was infection-free, according to a video trending on Weibo. The provincial women’s federation said it was looking into the matter.Similar complaints and criticisms were seen elsewhere on Chinese social media as patients failed to get timely treatment at hospitals already overwhelmed by the virus.  With more than 1,700 cases, the virus situation in Xi’an has triggered shortages of food and medical care amid a lockdown that has banned its more than 13 million residents from leaving their homes without a special reason. The strict measures -- some of the toughest in the world -- come as Chinese authorities race to curtail the country’s Covid outbreak ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics next month, and have led to increasingly vocal frustration among locals.A Dozen Days of Lockdown Spurs Angst in Chinese City of Xi’anChina is the only country left practicing a zero-tolerance Covid strategy, which involves ever-escalating measures to bring infections down to zero. While the Xi’an outbreak is of the delta variant, the more-transmissible omicron strain now roiling the world will challenge the approach even further. Mainland China has not yet reported any community spread of omicron.Two other local officials, including the deputy mayor, were removed this week over their handling of the outbreak.“The Xi’an outbreak is the most severe after the Wuhan lockdown,” Zeng Guang, one of China’s top Covid-19 advisers and former chief scientist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, was quoted as saying by a local newspaper Tuesday. “We hope Xi’an can create a new experience in containing an outbreak in the short-term, after losing control at the very initial stage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-locked-down-xi-an-city-in-chaos-after-covid-app-crash-101641356598371.html
05-01-2022||World||Omicron stays unhindered by most antibody treatments, show early tests||Amid an explosive surge of Covid-19 cases around the world majorly caused by the highly transmissible Omicron variant, studies show that antibody treatments that were effective against the previous coronavirus strains may not be effective against the new variant.According to a report by Nature journal, several pre-print publications tell that Omicron is “totally or partially resistant to all currently available treatments based on these monoclonal antibodies”. As a result, many manufacturers of antibody therapy have already conceded their products due to a much lower potency against Omicron, as compared to other variants.The only two antibodies that show strong evidence, the report stated, were sotrovimab, developed by Vir Biotechnology in San Francisco, California, and GSK, headquartered in London; and DXP-604.Also Read | Covid-19 case counts may be losing importance amid OmicronThe US health officials said that they will ration sotrovimab to various states depending on the Covid-19 severity and number of infections and hospitalisations. However, many countries have no access to sotrovimab at all.Generally, monoclonal-antibody treatments for Covid-19, whether from a single antibody or a cocktail of several, prevent the virus from infecting human cells, reducing the risk of the viral infection by up to 85 per cent.Also Read | The more Omicron spreads, the more likely it is to give rise to new variant: WHOIn the case of Omicron, the concentration of the treatment which should cut viral replication in half, could not even reach the threshold, even with increased concentration, researchers quoted in the report said.“We didn’t expect to see such a shift in the antibodies’ effectiveness,” said Olivier Schwartz, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and a co-author of one of the pre-prints.Sotrovimab is the best available antibody treatment. But the only two antibody treatments that retain some neutralisation power against Omicron are the ones developed by AstraZeneca in Cambridge, United Kingdom, studies found.So far, Omicron has proved to be more contagious but less severe as compared to the highly infectious Delta strain. Although there are fewer hospitalisations from the new variant till now, “if Omicron bites hard, it’ll be a recipe for disaster,” said Stuart Turville, a virologist at the Kirby Institute in Sydney, Australia, and a co-author of one of the preprints.Omicron is the dominant variant in the US. New Covid-19 cases per day have more than tripled over the past two weeks, reaching a record-shattering average of 480,000. Schools, hospitals and airlines in the US are struggling as scores of infected workers went into isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-stays-unhindered-by-most-antibody-treatments-show-early-tests-101641353411537.html
05-01-2022||World||The more Omicron spreads, the more likely it is to give rise to new variant: WHO||Soaring Omicron cases around the globe could increase the risk of a newer, more dangerous variant emerging, the World Health Organization in Europe warned on Tuesday.While the variant is spreading like wildfire around the world, it appears to be far less severe than initially feared and has raised hopes that the pandemic could be overcome and life return to more normality.But WHO senior emergencies officer Catherine Smallwood sounded an ominous note of caution, telling AFP that the soaring infection rates could have the opposite effect."The more Omicron spreads, the more it transmits and the more it replicates, the more likely it is to throw out a new variant. Now, Omicron is lethal, it can cause death ... maybe a little bit less than Delta, but who's to say what the next variant might throw out," Smallwood told AFP in an interview.Europe has registered more than 100 million Covid cases since the start of the pandemic, and more than five million new cases in the last week of 2021, "almost dwarfing what we have seen in the past", Smallwood said."We're in a very dangerous phase, we're seeing infection rates rise very significantly in Western Europe, and the full impact of that is not yet clear," she said.Smallwood also noted that while "on an individual level there's probably a decreased risk of hospitalisation" with the Omicron variant compared to Delta, overall, Omicron could pose a greater threat because of the sheer number of cases."When you see the cases rise so significantly, that's likely to generate a lot more people with severe disease, ending up in hospital and possibly going on to die," she said.Britain on Tuesday faced warnings of an impending hospital crisis due to staff shortages caused by a wave of Omicron infections, as the country's daily Covid caseload breached 200,000 for the first time.Smallwood said she expected that scenario to play out in other European countries as well."Even in well-capacitated, sophisticated health systems there are real struggles that are happening at the moment, and it's likely that these will play out across the region as Omicron drives cases upwards."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-more-omicron-spreads-the-more-likely-it-is-to-give-rise-to-new-variant-who-101641347319603.html

05-01-2022||World||China is not expanding nuclear arsenal: Official||A senior Chinese arms control official denied on Tuesday that his government is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, though he said it is taking steps to modernise its nuclear forces.Fu Cong, the director general of the foreign ministry’s arms control department, said that China is working to ensure its nuclear deterrent meets the minimum level necessary for national defence.“On the assertions made by US officials that China is expanding dramatically its nuclear capabilities, first, let me say that this is untrue,” he said.The news conference was held a day after China, the US, Russia, Great Britain and France issued a joint statement on preventing nuclear war or an arms race. The US defence department said in a report in November that China is expanding its nuclear force faster than previously predicted and could have more than 1,000 warheads by 2030. The US has 3,750 nuclear weapons.“China will continue to modernise its nuclear arsenal for reliability and safety issues,” Fu Cong said.But he said Beijing would “continue to modernise its nuclear arsenal for reliability and safety issues”.China also said Russia and the United States - by far the world’s largest nuclear powers - should make the first move on disarmament. “The US and Russia still possess 90% of the nuclear warheads on Earth,” he said, adding, “They must reduce their nuclear arsenal in an irreversible and legally binding manner.”Tesla criticised for new showroom in XinjiangTesla’s announcement that it has opened a showroom in Xinjiang has attracted criticism from US rights and trade groups on Tuesday. Xinjiang has become a significant point of conflict between Western governments and China in recent years, as UN experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly Uighurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in camps there.China has rejected accusations of forced labour or any other abuses there, saying that the camps provide vocational training and that companies should respect its policies there.The US electric car maker announced the showroom’s opening in Xinjiang’s regional capital, Urumqi, on its official Weibo account last Friday. “On the last day of 2021 we meet in Xinjiang,” it said in the post.On Tuesday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the largest US Muslim advocacy organisation, criticised the move, saying that Tesla was “supporting genocide”.Tiananmen: HK activist gets 15 months in prisonA Hong Kong court sentenced a 36-year-old barrister to 15 months in prison on Tuesday for inciting an unauthorised assembly to commemorate those who died in China’s 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.Activist Chow Hang-tung, of the since-closed Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, was arrested the day before the June 4 anniversary of the crackdown last year.Police have banned Hong Kong’s annual Tiananmen vigils for the last two years, citing coronavirus restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-is-not-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-official-101641347001569.html

05-01-2022||World||US records 1 million Covid cases in a day||The United States recorded more than one million Covid-19 cases on Monday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, as the Omicron variant spread at a blistering pace.There were 1,080,211 new cases in the country, a global record, with the number of cases doubling on the previous week. It comes a day after top US pandemic adviser Anthony Fauci said the country was experiencing “almost a vertical increase” in Covid-19 cases, adding the peak may be only weeks away.Rates of death and hospitalisation in the US have been far lower in recent weeks than during previous Covid surges. With 9,382 deaths over the past seven days, the nation’s death toll has fallen by 10%, week-on-week.In the last seven days, the country has recorded 3.4 million cases at an average of 486,000 per day with a peak on January 3, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.The US record during previous waves was 258,000 cases per day, for the week of January 5 to 11, 2021. Officials have struggled to find a balance that will protect public health without gravely damaging the economy or slamming key services like policing and air travel.Omicron estimated to be 95.4% of variants in USThe Omicron variant was estimated to be 95.4% of the coronavirus strains circulating in the United States as of January 1, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Tuesday.The variant has swiftly spread across the country since its detection on December 1, replacing Delta as the dominant strain and sparking a new wave of infections.The CDC said the variant accounted for an estimated 77% of cases in the week ended December 25, up from the 58.6% projection it had disclosed last week. The Delta variant accounts for 4.6% of all US cases as of January 1, the data showed.New variant in FranceThe World Health Organization said a coronavirus variant found in France hasn’t become much of a threat since it was first identified in November. sThe variant “has been on our radar,” Abdi Mahamud, a WHO incident manager on Covid, said at a press briefing in Geneva on Tuesday. “That virus had a lot of chances to pick up.”The variant was identified in 12 people in the southern Alps around the same time that omicron was discovered in South Africa last year. The latter mutation has since travelled the globe and kindled record levels of contagion, unlike the French one that researchers at the IHU Mediterranee Infection - helmed by scientist Didier Raoult - dubbed IHU.The first patient identified with the variant was vaccinated and had just returned from Cameroon, IHU researchers wrote in a paper published on the medRxiv server in late December where they first drew attention to the atypical mutations.It’s “too early to speculate on virological, epidemiological or clinical features of this IHU variant based on these 12 cases,” they wrote in the article, which hasn’t been peer reviewed.China locks down city of 1.2mn after 3 virus casesMore than one million people in a city in central China were being confined to their homes on Tuesday after three asymptomatic coronavirus cases were recorded in the country’s latest mass lockdown.Beijing has pursued a “zero Covid” approach with tight border restrictions and targeted lockdowns since the virus first emerged. But the strategy has come under pressure with a series of recent local outbreaks and with just a month to go until the Winter Olympics.Yuzhou, a city with a population of around 1.17 million people in Henan province, announced that from Monday night all citizens were required to stay home to control the spread of the virus.Authorities in the northern Chinese city of Xian say they can provide food, health care and other necessities for the 13 million residents under a now almost two-week-old lockdown.But in social media posts and over the telephone, some citizens describe difficulties obtaining supplies and frustration with the economic impact on the giant city.UK sees record 200k casesThe UK government on Tuesday reported a record of more than 200,000 coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours as Omicron surges through the country.It said it had logged 218,724 infections - the highest daily total since the pandemic began.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson sees no need for further restrictions to curb the spread of Omicron his spokesman Max Blain said on ahead of a press conference on Tuesday.The government continues to monitor the data and is prepared to respond if the situation changes, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-records-1-million-covid-cases-in-a-day-101641346230939.html

05-01-2022||World||Covid-19 case counts may be losing importance amid Omicron||The explosive increase in US coronavirus case counts is raising alarm, but some experts believe the focus should instead be on Covid-19 hospital admissions. And those aren’t climbing as fast.Dr. Anthony Fauci, for one, said Sunday on ABC that with many infections causing few or no symptoms, "it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations as opposed to the total number of cases." Other experts argue that case counts still have value.As the super-contagious omicron variant rages across the US, new Covid-19 cases per day have more than tripled over the past two weeks, reaching a record-shattering average of 480,000. Schools, hospitals and airlines are struggling as infected workers go into isolation.Meanwhile, hospital admissions averaged 14,800 per day last week, up 63% from the week before, but still short of the peak of 16,500 per day a year ago, when the vast majority of the U.S. was unvaccinated. Deaths have been stable over the past two weeks at an average of about 1,200 per day, well below the all-time high of 3,400 last January.Public health experts suspect that those numbers, taken together, reflect the vaccine’s continued effectiveness at preventing serious illness, even against omicron, as well as the possibility that the variant does not make most people as sick as earlier versions.Omicron accounted for 95% of new coronavirus infections in the US last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Tuesday, in another indication of how astonishingly fast the variant has spread since it was first detected in South Africa in late November.Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, director of ICAP, a global health center at Columbia University, said the case count does not appear to be the most important number now.Instead, she said, the US at this stage of the pandemic should be “shifting our focus, especially in an era of vaccination, to really focus on preventing illness, disability and death, and therefore counting those.”Daily case counts and their ups and downs have been one of the most closely watched barometers during the outbreak and have been a reliable early warning sign of severe disease and death in previous coronavirus waves.But they have long been considered an imperfect measure, in part because they consist primarily of laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19, not the actual number of infections out there, which is almost certainly many times higher.The daily case counts are also subject to wild swings. The number of new cases recorded on Monday topped an unprecedented 1 million, a figure that may reflect cases that had been held up by reporting delays over the holiday weekend. The seven-day rolling average is considered more reliable.Now, the value of the daily case count is being called into question as never before.For one thing, the skyrocketing increase reflects, at least in part, an omicron-induced stampede among many Americans to get tested before holiday gatherings, and new testing requirements at workplaces and at restaurants, theaters and other sites.Also, the true number of infections is probably much higher than the case count because the results of the at-home tests that Americans are rushing to use are not added to the official tally, and because long waits have discouraged some people from lining up to get swabbed.But also, case numbers seem to yield a less useful picture of the pandemic amid the spread of omicron, which is causing lots of infections but so far does not appear to be as severe in its effects.Case counts have lost relevance, said Andrew Noymer, a public health professor at the University of California, Irvine.“Hospitalizations are where the rubber meets the road,” Noymer said. “It’s a more objective measure." He added: "If I had to choose one metric, I would choose the hospitalization data.”Even hospital numbers aren't a perfect reflection of disease severity because they include patients admitted for other health problems who happen to test positive for the coronavirus.Keeping track of Covid-19 admissions can tell doctors something about the seriousness of the virus and also the capacity of hospitals to deal with the crisis. That, in turn, can help health leaders determine where to shift equipment and other resources.Still, health experts are not prepared to do away with case counts.“We should not abandon looking at case numbers," said Dr. Eric Topol, head of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, "but it is important to acknowledge we’re seeing only a portion of the actual number of cases.”Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, said that for each new infection detected, the U.S. is missing two cases. But he said tracking the number of positive test results is still important as omicron makes its way across the land.Case numbers can point to future hot spots and indicate whether a wave of infection has peaked, Mokdad said.Also, case counts will continue to be important to people who are vulnerable because of age or health reasons and need a sense of the virus' spread in their communities so they can make decisions about precautions, he said. Hospitals, schools and businesses need to plan for absences.“To give up on knowing if cases are going up or down, it’s flying blind. How can we as a country not know the epidemic curve for infection?” Mokdad said.If testing has lost its relevance, he said, it is because the U.S. never developed a way to consistently and reliably monitor infections.“It’s not acceptable to cover failure by changing the rules," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-case-counts-may-be-losing-importance-amid-omicron-101641341373903.html
05-01-2022||World||New Covid records in US, UK, France as Omicron runs rampant||The US, Britain, France and Australia have all announced record numbers of daily Covid-19 cases as the WHO warned Tuesday that Omicron's dizzying spread increased the risk of newer, more dangerous variants emerging.Britain breached 200,000 cases for the first time on Tuesday, Australia posted almost 50,000 and France registered more than 270,000, all three countries easily topping their previous records.But dwarfing even those numbers was the 1,080,211 reported by the United States on Monday, a global record.The country's Monday figures are usually higher due to delays in weekend tallying -- and were likely inflated further after a three-day New Year's holiday weekend.The rolling average over seven days -- which experts see as more reliable -- was 486,000 cases per day as of Monday evening, Johns Hopkins University said.The heavily mutated Omicron variant, the most transmissible to date, accounted for around 59 percent of US cases near the end of last year.Omicron's rates of deaths and hospitalisations have been lower across the world, raising hopes the virus could be evolving into a relatively benign seasonal illness.But the World Health Organization in Europe sounded an ominous note of caution on Tuesday, warning the soaring infection rates could have the opposite effect."The more Omicron spreads, the more it transmits and the more it replicates, the more likely it is to throw out a new variant," WHO senior emergencies officer Catherine Smallwood told AFP in an interview."Now, Omicron is lethal, it can cause death... maybe a little bit less than Delta, but who's to say what the next variant might throw out," she added."Even in well-capacitated, sophisticated health systems there are real struggles that are happening at the moment."'War footing'Such a scenario was feared in Britain, where the government said Tuesday that hospitals have switched to "war footing" due to staff shortages.After the UK hit a record 218,724 cases in 24-hours, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised action to plug staffing gaps in the worst-hit areas, including drafting medical volunteers backed by army support.Johnson also defended his decision not to increase restrictions over Christmas in England -- unlike in other parts of the UK -- and ruled out another nationwide lockdown.Australia, which had previously successfully suppressed infections for much of the pandemic, also smashed its previous caseload record with 47,738.The surging infections have driven a rush on increasingly scarce self-administered rapid antigen kits and created hours-long queues at centres providing more reliable PCR tests."I think at this point we all know somebody who has either got Covid or we have got coworkers off work because they are quarantining or isolating," Australia's deputy chief medical officer Sonya Bennett said.Cyprus also posted a new record of 5,457 cases on Tuesady and now has the highest infection rate per capita, according to AFP figures.Wealthy nations have rushed to give their population third booster shots to counteract the rising cases, while many in poorer nations have not yet been able to receive a first.Ahead of the pack, Israel began rolling out fourth doses last week. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Tuesday that a small Israeli study indicated that fourth coronavirus vaccinations increased antibodies "fivefold".More restrictionsIn China, which has pursued a "zero Covid" approach, just three asymptomatic cases prompted 1.2 million people in the central city of Yuzhou to be confined to their homes.Daily infections have hit a two-month high in the Philippines, which will expand restrictions in Manila from Wednesday to include more than 11 million people living near the capital.Omicron is also fuelling surging cases in India, where authorities said the capital will lock down over the weekend.The sprawling megacity's new restrictions came the same day as its chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, announced he had been infected and was suffering "mild symptoms".Also testing positive on Tuesday were Sweden's king and queen, as well as Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, none suffering serious symptoms.Omicron has also sent the sports world -- only just back on its feet after previous Covid restrictions -- reeling, with many leagues forced to cancel or postpone games.Tennis world number Novak Djokovic -- who has repeatedly refused to confirm whether he has been vaccinated -- said Tuesday that he was heading to the Australian Open after being granted a medical exemption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-records-in-us-uk-france-as-omicron-runs-rampant-101641340888983.html

In a complaint to the police, Bindu Ammini said she was overpowered by a man on the beach who showered blows on her till she fell on the road.Police said they have registered a case and are looking for the attacker after checking CCTV visuals of the area.Ammini said this was not the first attack and blamed Hindu outfits for targeting her. She was admitted to hospital last month after a speeding autorickshaw hit her but police said later that it was an accident.“I arrived on the beach to consult one of my lawyers. All of a sudden, a person came and blocked my two-wheeler, and started abusing me and showered blows on me. He ran away when some of the onlookers intervened. This was a planned attack,” she said.She was provided with police security earlier but it was later withdrawn.Bindu Ammini was one of first two women to enter the temple on January 2, 2019 after the Supreme Court allowed the entry of female devotees of menstruating age in the shrine. Within hours of their daring entry, the Sabarimala temple area turned into a virtual war zone, and the temple authorities closed the shrine to conduct a purification ritual. On the streets of many of Kerala’s biggest towns, mobs set buses ablaze and hurled bombs at the houses of prominent leaders. Over the next few weeks, police arrested nearly 10,000 people in order to stamp down on simmering tensions across the coastal state.In all, the state witnessed five shutdowns and violence after majority of the devotees resisted the move to allow women in the temple. Later the Supreme Court intervened and referred the issue to a larger bench, which is yet to deliver its verdict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bindu-ammini-first-woman-to-enter-sabarimala-temple-says-she-was-attacked-101641405385052.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled programme in Punjab’s Ferozepur was cancelled following what the ministry of home affairs called a major security lapse.While Punjab chief minister expressed regret over the cancellation of PM Modi’s visit, he insisted that there was no security breach. Addressing a press conference, Channi said the Punjab government had no information about the sudden change in route over bad weather conditions, adding that he couldn’t go to Bathinda airport to receive the prime minister as he was in close contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19.“I had to receive the PM at Bathinda today but those who had to accompany me tested Covid positive. Hence, I did not go to receive the PM today as I was in close contact with some who tested positive,” Channi said.In a series of tweets, Nirmala Sitharaman noted the incident in Punjab as a cause of concern, arguing that the explanations by the chief minister “do not add up.” The minister said that PM Modi was on his way to the National Martyrs Memorial at Hussainiwala to pay respects to Bhagat Singh and other freedom fighters and was to launch several developmental programmes.“It is the responsibility of a state’s administration to ensure safe passage for @PMOIndia’s movement. @INCIndia has shown it not only shirks its duties towards the head of Indian government but also cares nothing for his safety,” Sitharaman wrote.“Punjab government claims 10,000 security personnel were deployed. How come they failed to ensure @PMOIndia’s movement? Also CM @CHARANJITCHANNI claimed to isolate himself due to his close aide being COVID +ve,but addressed press in person without a mask? Disgraceful and petty,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-s-explanation-doesn-t-add-up-says-sitharaman-on-pm-modi-s-security-lapse-101641403949293.html
05-01-2022||India||Tamil Nadu adds 4,862 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours, spike of 4.5 times from Dec 28||Tamil Nadu reported a spike in Covid-19 infections as 4,862 people tested positive in the state on Wednesday while only a day ago 2,731 new cases had been reported. On Tuesday too, the southern state saw a massive jump as cases had more than doubled in just a day from January 3, which saw a total of 1,728 new infections. The increase in number isn’t an outcome of increased testing as Tamil Nadu has been averaging more than one-lakh tests everyday with a marginal increase on Thursday. From January 3 to 5, the number of people tested (in lakhs) has been 1.02, 1.03, and 1.17. Chennai remains the hotspot driving the daily surge in cases. From 876 new cases on January 3, the capital city reported 2,481 cases on January 5. The Greater Chennai Corporation has not yet released its testing numbers. Authorities have said that the Omicron variant is leading to rapid transmission. Tamil Nadu has 121 cases of Omicron of which 110 patients have been discharged. After WHO announced Omicron as a variant of concern on November 26, 2021, cases began rising in Tamil Nadu from November 29, the directorate of public health and preventive medicine (DPH) said in a statement. “The state has recorded around 2,731 new cases on January 4, which is almost a jump by 4.5 times in just a week from 619 cases on December 28,” said TS Selvavinayagam, director of the DPH. “The active cases have also risen to 10,364. The trend from other international countries like the USA, UK, France suggest active cases during the peak period may be 3 to 4 times higher than the previous peak period. So, there is a chance that this surge can lead to healthcare infrastructure being strained if not managed systematically.”On Wednesday, the DPH directed all the deputy directors of health services to upgrade primary and community health centres into interim Covid Care Centres. It included guidelines on how to set them up. Health secretary J Radhakrishnan told reporters in Chennai that all Covid-19 infrastructure such as beds with oxygen supply are in place and medicines are in stock for the next six months. “Cases will rise in the next few days before cases decline again. We are taking several steps to break the chain. People should be careful to prevent transmission so that the health system is not pressurised. And I also want to insist that people should get vaccinated,” he said.Tamil Nadu on Wednesday tightened restrictions in view of the rising Covid-19 cases and the government anticipates more cases as the Tamil festival of Pongal approaches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-adds-4-862-new-covid-19-cases-in-24-hours-spike-of-4-5-times-from-dec-28-101641405083892.html

The silver lining of the present situation is that 90% of the cases are asymptomatic and among the rest 10%, only one or two per cent require hospitalisation, the minister said. “The Task Force has used the term augmented restrictions, which means if the cases rise like this...we don't have to use the term lockdown. Hundred per cent lockdown is not certainly required as of today,” the minister said.“Wherever crowding takes place, there have to be restrictions, but it is not the case that it (curbs) should be brought today," the minister said after a meeting with the state's Covid-19 task force and the officials of the health, planning and finance departments. The recommendations of the task force will be discussed with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the minister said. The health minister's assertion comes a day after Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said if the daily Covid-19 cases cross the 20,000-mark, a lockdown will be imposed in the city as per the Union government's rules. She had also suggested that people wear triple-layer masks while travelling by public buses and local trains. Maharashtra on Wednesday reported 26,538 fresh coronavirus positive cases, including 15,166 in Mumbai, the highest-ever daily count in the metropolis. Compared with Tuesday, the fresh cases in Maharashtra rose by 43.71 per cent or 8,072 in absolute numbers on Wednesday. Mumbai's overall coronavirus infection count jumped to 8,33,628, while the death toll increased to 16,384, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said in a bulletin.Some restrictions have already been in place since Christmas and New Year eve.

PM Modi, during his visit to Tripura on Tuesday, launched new terminal building of Maharaja Bir Bikram airport, Mission 100 Vidyajyoti school scheme and Mukhyamantri Tripura Grameen Samriddhi Yojana. While hailing the Tripura government, PM Modi in his speech accused the former Left Front government of applying “brakes” to development and not to corruption in their regime. Reacting to PM’s speech, Sarkar said that the modernisation of the airport, development of internet and other connectivity services such as broad-gauge train and Indo-Bangla international railway connectivity through Agartala-Akhaura route came following prolonged movements of the Left organisations. “We were the first to propose to modernise the airport. We had arranged the land and spent ₹35 crore from our own funds. Relocation of 30-33 families for expansion of the airport, excavation and other works began during our regime. Even the third internet gateway was started in our period. How PM is saying that we had applied brakes to development,” said Sarkar at the CPI(M) headquarters on Wednesday. He claimed that PM Narendra Modi’s statement was concocted and said that the Bharatiya Janata Party didn’t have any role in India’s freedom movement, adding that PM Modi’s predecessors worked as agents of the British. Regarding Mission 100 Vidyajyoti school scheme, Sarkar said that it would put the educational scope of poor students in danger. Tripura information minister Sushanta Chowdhury condemned Sarkar’s comments and said, “The former chief minister attempted to pose himself as equal to Prime Minister. People very well know whether BJP or communist party had role in India’s freedom movement. The Left had opposed the freedom that India got in 1947. And did they have any proof of corruption in PM’s cabinet? We all know that Manik Sarkar’s cabinet ministers were involved in corruption.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doubleengine-govt-s-tyres-punctured-manik-sarkar-after-pm-s-tripura-speech-101641402623566.html

05-01-2022||India||Tripura MLA disqualified two months after joining Trinamool Congress||AGARTALA: Tripura Assembly speaker on Wednesday disqualified Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Ashish Das as member of state assembly, two months after he switched over to the Trinamool Congress. Das won the 2018 Assembly polls on BJP ticket from Surma constituency in Dhalai district. He joined Trinamool Congress on October 31 during visit of the party’s general secretary Abhishek Banerjee to the state. Das was sent a notice under anti-defection law soon after he joined the Mamata Banerjee-led party. “Ashish Das joined Trinamool Congress and is involved in different party-related activities. He didn’t respond to the show cause notice even after he was given enough time. After considering pros and cons and different aspects of the constitution, the Assembly decided to cancel his membership,” assembly speaker Ratan Chakraborty told reporters at Agartala. He added that they would soon send required documents to Election Commission to disqualify him. In the first week of November 2021, the state government changed pension rules scrapping entitlements such as basic facilities and allowances of ex- legislators if they don’ complete their five-year term.Ashish Das first made headlines in October last year after he shaved his head and took a dip in Ganga and offered prayers at Kalighat temple in Kolkata as mark of penance. He said he made a mistake by believing that BJP would end the alleged two-decade old misrule of the erstwhile Left Front government. “I will keep my head shaved till BJP rule is eradicated in 2023,” he said in Kolkata. Das, who has been in Kolkata for the last three days, earlier praised Bengal chief minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee saying that she has emerged as the face of the opposition for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls after her victory in Bhabanipur by-poll.

The topmost echelons of the Congress owe an apology to the people of India for what they have done," he further wrote.Modi was scheduled to visit Ferozepur earlier in the day to lay the foundations for multiple development projects worth more than ₹42,750 crore. According to a MHA statement, the PM landed at Bathinda in the morning from where he was scheduled to go to the National Martyrs Memorial at Hussainiwala by helicopter.Due to poor weather and lack of visibility, the PM had to wait for about 20 minutes, following which it was decided that he would visit the memorial via road and the travel time would be more than two hours.The PM then proceeded to travel by road after necessary confirmation of required security arrangements by the Punjab Police. About 30 km ahead of the memorial in Hussainiwala, when the Prime Minister's convoy reached a flyover, it was found that the road was blocked by some protestors. Modi was stuck on the flyover for 15-20 minutes.Following this, he returned to Bathinda airport and his address had to be cancelled.The incident led to massive uproar with the BJP and Congress indulging in a blame-game. Punjab is scheduled to see Assembly election in the next few months and the BJP is hoping to oust the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government in the state with the help of allies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-seeks-detailed-report-on-pm-modi-s-security-lapse-in-punjab-101641392621531.html

The spike has been termed as exponential by the Centre. Given this trend, doctors said the next two weeks will be crucial as the surge is likely to reach its peak by the coming two weeks. Talking to news agency ANI, Dr Ashish Khattar, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine at Delhi's Venkateshwar Hospital said the infections are doubling each day. "In the last three days, we have seen doubling of Covid-19 cases and even more than that. Definitely, over the next two weeks, we can see a certain spurt in COVID-19 cases. By end of January, a major population would have been affected," Dr Khattar said.Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar also said the next four to six weeks are crucial.R-value 2.69, higher than peak of 2nd wave: What Centre said on 3rd wave in India | 7 pointsSeveral scientific projections have claimed that the peak of India's ongoing surge will take place between January last week and February first week. As Dr Sudhakar said in other countries it has been observed that the wave, driven by Omicron, rose very quickly, followed by a quick dip. In South Africa, where the variant was first detected is also believed to be over the wave.Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul acknowledged the global scenario and said that it is a fact that surge driven by Omicron in other countries has come down quickly but that can not be conjectured about India as the characteristics of a surge depends on many factors including vaccine coverage. "Like in the UK, Denmark, it is receding now. In South Africa too, it stayed for a month. But we can't say anything clearly as it depends on our population density, vaccination coverage. So we can't extrapolate that this wave will come down soon, but we can say what we are seeing," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-alert-doctor-says-next-two-weeks-crucial-here-s-why-101641391107848.html
05-01-2022||India||Calcutta HC urges Bengal govt to consider plea to ban Ganga Sagar Mela||Amid an alarming rise in Covid-19 cases in West Bengal, the Calcutta High Court has sought a response from the Mamata Banerjee led administration on whether the state wants to impose a ban on this year’s Ganga Sagar mela or go ahead with it with restrictions. In another development the state government decided to postpone the 27th Kolkata International Film Festival. The week-long KIFF was scheduled to take off from January 7. “Having regard for the severity of the spread of the Covid-19 virus, we expect that the state will seriously consider the plea to ban the mela this year,” the court said. A division bench of the high court, headed by Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava was hearing a PIL filed by a doctor, Avinandan Mondol who contended that the Covid-19 infection may spread further if millions of pilgrims are allowed to converge at Ganga Sagar to take the holy dip at the confluence of River Ganges and Bay of Bengal on the occasion of Makar Sankranti on January 15. The court directed the state government to take a decision while considering certain aspects such as possibility of spread of the virus through water when millions of pilgrims, some of whom may be infected, take the holy dip. “The state government has been asked to file an affidavit on Thursday when the matter comes up for hearing again,” said Srijib Chakraborty, advocate representing the petitioner. The daily count of Covid-19 cases has shot up more than 16 times in the last ten days in the state. On Tuesday, West Bengal reported 9,073 new Covid-19 cases up from the daily count of 544 reported on December 26. In Kolkata, 4,759 new cases were reported on Tuesday, the highest among all districts in the state. North 24 Parganas with 1,391 fresh cases came second. Experts have blamed it on the huge congregation of people in Park Street and its surrounding areas on Christmas. Videos and pictures, which went viral, showed thousands of people gathering on Park Street with no regard for Covid-19 safety norms. The state government had relaxed the night curfew (11pm – 5am) from December 24, 2021 to January 1, 2022 in view of Christmas and New Year celebrations. On January 2, however, the West Bengal government imposed stricter restrictions till January 15 by closing schools and colleges, limiting the workforce across offices and restricting flights from Delhi and Mumbai. Swimming pools, spas, gyms, salons and beauty parlours, entertainment parks and tourist places will remain closed, while shopping malls, markets, restaurants and bars will be allowed to operate with 50% capacity till 10 pm. Night curfew, from 10 pm to 5 am, has been re-imposed. But despite the looming threat, the West Bengal State Election Commission has said that elections in four municipalities in the state would be held on January 22 as per schedule. The poll panel has also allowed political meetings with a maximum capacity of 500 people in large open grounds. The Bharatiya Janata Party has postponed the visit of the party’s national president JP Nadda ahead of the municipal polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-hc-urges-bengal-govt-to-consider-plea-to-ban-ganga-sagar-mela-101641390922588.html
05-01-2022||India||‘Who leaked PM route info’: Smriti Irani jabs Punjab govt over security breach||The BJP on Wednesday lashed out at the Congress government in Punjab for failing to secure the route that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cavalcade was to take to address a rally in the state. Union minister, Smriti Irani said there is a need to answer questions on who gave a false go-ahead to the security cavalcade and who leaked information about the route that the PM was to take. “The question we as BJP workers and the nation needs to ask the Congress government in Punjab is why did the DGP give an all clear to the PM‘s security detail for the route that he wanted to take? Who in the Punjab government gave information about the prime minister‘s route to individuals who planted themselves atop the flyover? Video evidence now publicly available brings such questions to the fore,” the minister said addressing the media. Referring to the security breach that forced the PM to return to the Capital without addressing a scheduled rally, she said never before in the history of our country has the state failed to secure the safety of the PM. “When the PM‘s security detail contacted Punjab police about the circumstance of the prime minister‘s cavalcade atop the flyover that there was a 20 minute exposure and a breach of security of the Prime Minister, why did those who lead the security arrangements not respond to any call for efforts to secure the prime minister,” the minister questioned. Sharpening her attack at the administrative lapse, she said, “I am sure the nation shares our outrage at this incident. We know that the Congress party hates PM Modi but today they tried to harm the Prime Minister of India. Such is the breakdown of law and order in the state of Punjab that the DGP police claims he is incapable of providing security support to the Prime Minister‘s security detail.” The Punjab government for its part claimed the Prime Minister was to travel by air but because of the rain, his plan was changed. “The PM decided to travel by road from Bathinda to Ferozepur suddenly. There was no prior information. I worked till 3 am to convince farmers to clear all routes. All roads were cleared by Wednesday morning. There was no programme of the PM’s travel by road. Had they told us about the road travel in advance, we would have made proper arrangements,” Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi told the media. The minister, however, lashed out at the state administration and said the security detail that is a protocol administratively to be followed by the state was dismantled so that the PM could be brought to harm. “What enrages people like us is this that when the PM had his security breached Congress leaders erupted with joy, asking him how his Josh was.” She was referring to a tweet by Congress leader BV Srinivas who tweeted, “Modi ji, How’s the Josh?” The minister also said that the MHA has asked for a report on this issue, “…And my hope is that those who try to bring the prime minister physical harm are met with justice.”

Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) chief Jagat Prakash Nadda earlier alleged that the Congress-led Punjab government tried “all possible tricks” to scuttle the prime minister’s programme “fearing a resounding defeat” in the upcoming Assembly polls.Nadda said that protesters were given access to the prime minister’s route despite assurances from the Punjab chief secretary and director-general of police that the route was clear.Responding to BJP chief’s, Surjewala said that 10,000 security personnel were deployed for the prime minister’s scheduled rally and all arrangements were made in tandem with the special protection group (SPG) and other security agencies. The Congress spokesperson said that PM Modi’s decision to opt for a road journey to the National Martyrs Memorial at Hussainiwala was not part of his original schedule.“Kisan mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) has been protesting against PM’s visit & Union Min, Gajendra Shekhawat has held two rounds of negotiation with them,” Surjewala wrote on Twitter.PM Modi's Ferozepur rally cancelled, home ministry blames ‘major lapse in security’Listing the reasons for the protest, Surjewala said the protesters are demanding minister of state (Home) Ajay Misra Teni’s resignation over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and withdrawal of criminal cases against farmers in Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. He said the central government has chosen to totally ignore the promises of forming a committee on minimum support price after the end of farmers’ agitation.“Finally, the reason for canceling rally is that there were no crowds to listen to Modiji. Stop blame game & introspect on BJP’s anti-farmer attitude. Hold rallies but listen to Farmers first!” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-crowds-to-listen-to-modiji-congress-on-pm-s-rally-cancellation-over-security-lapse-101641380923923.html
05-01-2022||India||Same vaccine to be administered as ‘precaution’ 3rd dose: Centre||The Centre on Wednesday said the same vaccine will be administered as the third dose of booster or precaution dose of vaccine and no mix and match will be allowed as of now.  This means those who have received Covishield as their first and second dose will receive Covishield as their third dose. Similarly, those who have received Covaxin in their first two doses will receive Covaxin in the third dose, Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said during the press briefing of the health ministry. The government has not taken any decision on the mix and match of vaccines in India though Dr Paul had earlier said that there was no problem in principle to mix and match.  As more data is received about a heterologous approach in the administration of vaccines, decisions will be taken going forward, the Centre said. What is ‘precaution dose’ for Covid? Which vaccine will be administered? What all we knowPrime Minister Narendra Modi on December 25 announced the major upgrade of the Centre's vaccination policy which has included teens for their first two doses and frontline staff and senior citizens with comorbidities for booster doses. While vaccination for the population belonging to 15 to 18 years has already started from January 3, the administration of booster doses, being termed as precaution dose in India, will start from January 10. The government so far has not made it clear which vaccine will be administered as the booster shot. India's decision to administer the third dose comes amid an Omicron alert. On the lines of booster doses being administered in their countries, the government has chosen the most vulnerable section for the third dose.The Union health ministry on Wednesday issued a revised guideline for home isolation of mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 cases. It said patients under home isolation will stand discharged after at least seven days from testing positive and no fever for three successive days, in revised guidelines for home isolation of mild or asymptomatic cases. It also advised people not to rush for self-medication, blood investigation or radiological imaging like chest X-ray or CT scan without consultation of treating medical officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/same-vaccine-to-be-administered-as-precaution-dose-centre-101641380801239.html

"If we remain cautious for at least four to six weeks, we will be able to control it. As we have observed worldwide, it is declining in five to six weeks. This wave will not be for too long, like in the first and second wave that was for three to four months," Dr Sudhakar said.From this week onwards, Karnataka will come under curfew on weekends. All schools, colleges, except classes 10,11,12, medical and nursing colleges, will remain closed from tomorrow and only online classes will be held. The night curfew has also been extended in the state.Karnataka was the first state in India to have recorded Omicron cases. Dr Sudhakar said Omicron is not entering the lungs and this is the reason why the cases requiring oxygen, ventilators and ICU are very less this time. "But, its effect may be more on those who have not taken both the doses of Covid vaccination. So, I request people with folded hands to get vaccinated with both doses mandatorily," Sudhakar said.The Union health ministry on Wednesday said Karnataka is one of the eight states where the Covid-19 situation is emerging as concerning. The other states are Maharashtra, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand and Gujarat. Karnataka on Tuesday reported 149 new Omicron cases which took the state tally of Omicron cases to 226. On Tuesday, the state reported 2,479 fresh Covid cases, 288 recoveries and four deaths recorded in the last 24 hours.While scientists and experts are saying the third wave has set in, the Union health ministry on Wednesday issued revised guideline for home isolation of mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 cases. According to the guidelines, patients under home isolation will stand discharged and end isolation after at least seven days have passed from testing positive and no fever for three successive days, but they shall continue wearing masks. Earlier, the duration of home isolation ended after 10 days of onset of symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-3rd-wave-won-t-last-long-4-6-week-crucial-says-karnataka-health-minister-101641379652907.html

He added prior to Diwali, the crude oil price in the international market dropped by ₹8 per litre but the government reduced the excise duty on petrol by only ₹5 per litre.Vallabh referred to fuel prices in 2014. “If the government can maintain the excise duty which was levied in 2014 on fuel, then the price of petrol will reduce to ₹26.42 per litre and diesel price to ₹25.24 per litre.”Bharatiya Janata Party spokespersons were unavailable to comment on the matter.Over the last month, petrol and diesel prices have remained unchanged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-slams-centre-for-failing-to-reduce-fuel-rates-101641379582077.html

05-01-2022||India||Mild, asymptomatic Covid patients, including Omicron-infected, can home-isolate||NEW DELHI: All mild and asymptomatic Covid patients, including those infected with the highly transmissible Omicron variant, can now isolate at home, the Centre announced on Wednesday as it revised the isolation guidelines.The time for home isolation has been reduced to seven days from testing positive for Covid-19 with no fever for three successive days, compared to 10 days earlier.People with confirmed or suspected Omicron infection were mandatorily isolated in hospitals or placed in home isolation for 10 days until Wednesday’s announcement.“The new home isolation guidelines relate to all Covid-19 cases. Omicron as well a Delta is part of these cases... hence, these home isolation guidelines apply to all Covid-19 cases,” said the Union health ministry in a statement.As per the revised guidelines, home isolation is not recommended for immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV-positive, transplant recipients, cancer patients, etc. Elderly patients aged 60 and above, and those with comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, chronic lung, liver and kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, etc shall only be allowed home isolation after proper medical evaluation.The Centre also said there should be requisite facilities at homes to quarantine family contacts and ideally a caregiver should be fully vaccinated against Covid-19. The rest of the guidelines are largely the same as those released last year.The asymptomatic are lab-confirmed patients, who are not experiencing any symptoms and have oxygen saturation at room air of more than 93%. Clinically assigned mild cases are patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms with or without fever, without shortness of breath, and having oxygen saturation at room air of over 93%.Also, there is no need for re-testing after the home isolation period is over. Asymptomatic contacts of infected individuals need not undergo Covid-19 tests and can monitor health in-home quarantine.The revised guidelines have been issued after consultation with the subject experts as a number of Covid-19 cases have been rising exponentially across the country primarily driven by the heavily mutated and highly transmissible Omicron variant.“The way the cases are rising and which is expected with the new variant, institutional isolation does not make sense any longer. Experts were consulted and after detailed deliberation, it was decided that those who are mildly symptomatic, or asymptomatic, should be allowed home isolation under certain conditions,” said a public health expert with the government.

The Omicron-infected persons include four women and a man, who were traced to the city of Shillong and Ri-Bhoi district.

All our [Covid-19 situation] stations are in place and fully operational. It’s a continuing process and we have not let our guard down at any point of time, which is why we are able to contain it thus far,” War said. “I urge everybody to cooperate with the government, follow prescribed protocols, and don’t avoid completing vaccination.”Meghalaya’s principal secretary of health Sampath Kumar said, “We were quick to confirm [it was Omicron] since we are one of the few states that have their own genome sequencing facilities, at the Pasteur Molecular Lab in Shillong.

In a series of tweets, Nadda alleged that the Punjab government tried “all possible tricks” to scuttle the prime minister’s programme “fearing a resounding defeat” in the upcoming Assembly elections.PM Modi was scheduled to pay tributes to Bhagat Singh and other freedom fighters and lay the foundation stone for multiple development projects during his programme. Nadda said that the Congress-led government in Punjab has shown that they are “anti-development” and have “no respect for freedom fighters”. He alleged that protesters were given access to the prime minister’s route despite assurances from the Punjab chief secretary and director-general of police that the route was clear.“To make matters worse, CM Channi refused to get on the phone to either address the matter or solve it. The tactics used by the Congress government in Punjab would pain any one who believes in democratic principles,” the BJP chief tweeted.PM Modi's Ferozepur rally cancelled, home ministry blames ‘major lapse in security’After Modi’s visit was cancelled at the last moment, the ministry of home affairs said in a statement that the prime minister’s convoy was stuck on a flyover for 15-20 minutes as the road was blocked by some protestors. Modi landed at Bathinda Wednesday morning to go to the National Martyrs Memorial at Hussainiwala by helicopter. Due to rain and poor visibility, it was decided that he would visit the memorial via road, a journey of more than two hours, according to MHA.“Around 30 kms away from the National Martyrs Memorial in Hussainiwala, when the Prime Minister’s convoy reached a flyover, it was found that the road was blocked by some protestors. The Prime Minister was stuck on a flyover for 15-20 minutes. This was a major lapse in the security of the Prime Minister,” the statement read.Nadda alleged that Punjab police was instructed to prevent people from attending the rally, adding that a large number of buses were stranded because of the “high-handedness of the police” and “connivance with protestors.”“It is sad that the PM’s visit to launch development projects worth thousands of crores for Punjab was disrupted. But we will not let such cheap mentality hinder progress of Punjab and will continue the effort for the development of Punjab,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-pm-modi-s-rally-cancelled-over-security-lapse-bjp-chief-blasts-channi-govt-101641375846463.html

The investigation team has completed its probe into the crash of the Russian-origin Mi-17V5 helicopter near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu, the people said on condition of anonymity. There was no official word on the development. The court of inquiry into the crash was headed by Air Marshal Manavendra Singh of the Indian Air Force (IAF). A senior helicopter pilot of the Indian Navy and an army officer were part of the investigation team. Singh, who heads the IAF’s training command in Bengaluru, is considered a leading air crash investigator. Reports have suggested that the crash didn’t happen due to a technical fault in the IAF helicopter. According to the reports, the helicopter was flying at a low altitude while following a railway line when it suddenly encountered thick clouds.

The clashes broke out over the use of 'ring net' in the restricted area of the Bay of Bengal.Police commissioner Manish Kumar Sinha told news agency ANI that prohibitory orders under section 144 of the CrPC have been imposed in Vasavanipalem and Jalaripeta areas, where violence took place.According to the police, the fishermen attacked each other in their mechanised boats and started chasing each other in the waters. Many of them also fell off the boats.A large group of policemen rushed to the spot to pacify the fishermen and prevent further incidents. Police pickets have also been set up to prevent further clashes between the two groups.Earlier too, such clashes have taken place between fisherfolk who use traditional nets and those who use ring nets. While ring net fishing is banned within eight kilometres of the coast, the practice continues unabated.A ring net is a long net that is used to surround fish with a 'wall' of netting. It is similar to purse seine but without any running purse line. It is usually used on a smaller scale, to capture shoal fish.The fishermen are opposed to the use of these nets because it captures everything that it encloses. They say that the ring net used by trawlers leaves local fishemen with no catch.The ban on using the ring nets was announced by the Andhra Pradesh government in December, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7-injured-as-fishermen-clash-over-use-of-ring-net-in-visakhapatnam-101641347072380.html

These included limiting incoming flights from Delhi and Mumbai, which have been majorly affected by the outbreak of the new Omicron variant.Initially, flights from the two cities were allowed to operate twice a week in West Bengal, but the decision was reviewed and in a fresh letter, the state government on Tuesday informed that the same has been changed to thrice a week.Issued by West Bengal's additional chief secretary BP Gopalika, the letter said that the state government is “extremely sensitive towards the inconvenience" that passengers may face but the “restrictions are absolutely essential for containment of Covid cases in the state”. The letter was addressed to the secretary of the Civil Aviation ministry, Rajiv Bansal.The restrictions on flights from Delhi and Mumbai come after the West Bengal government last week announced a ban on all international flights coming to Kolkata from the United Kingdom. The suspension order, which came into effect on January 3, will remain in place until further orders.On the decision, Banerjee said that a majority of the Omicron cases are being detected in individuals coming on flights from the UK. “It's a fact that the Omicron carriers are coming via international flights,” she added.As per the new directive by the West Bengal government, all international passengers need to undergo Covid-19 tests upon arrival at the Kolkata airport. The airlines have been asked to “randomly" select 10% of the passengers for RT-PCR test while the remaining 90% will have to undergo Rapid Antigen Test.West Bengal, especially Kolkata, has witnessed a 14-fold surge in Covid-19 cases in the last few days. On Tuesday, as many as 9,073 infections were logged, of which Kolkata accounted for 4,759. This was a jump of 2,995 cases in only a day after the state reported 6,078 infections on Monday.Meanwhile, Delhi and Mumbai recorded over 5,000 and 10,000 Covid-19 cases, respectively, on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flights-from-mumbai-delhi-can-reach-bengal-thrice-a-week-from-today-101641340703374.html

The commission chairperson also said it will leave people rescued from child marriages in the 19-21 age group in the lurch as existing laws only support vulnerable children up to the age of 18 years.“Acts like Juvenile Justice Care and Protection Act and schemes like Integrated Child Protection Scheme have scope to extend support to vulnerable children only up to the age of 18. In such circumstances, there will be no space to provide support to a child bride or groom between the age of 19 to 21 if rescued from child marriage,” Sandhyabati Pradhan, who leads Odisha’s child rights panel, said in a letter to Vinay P. Sahasrabuddhe, chairperson of the parliamentary standing committee on education, women, children, youth and sports that is examining the Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021.Pradhan also underlined that laws such as the child sex abuse law, Pocso only bars consensual sex up to the age of 18. “This implies that someone may have sexual act after 18 but won’t be able marry till 21 which will create new sets of issues like increasing unwed mothers and foeticide thereafter,” she said in her letter.Pradhan underlined that change of legislation in isolation will never be able to stop child marriages unless there is socio-behavioural change among parents and community.“The National Crime Record Bureau data says that only 785 cases have been registered under Prohibition of Child Marriage in 2020 which is 523 in 2019 and 501 in 2018. On the other hand, 23.3% girls are marrying before the legal age as captured by NFHS-5 (National Family and Health Survey),” she said.Pradhan said factors such as distress and poverty, patriarchal norms and practices, lack of opportunity for schooling, employment and the like are still contributing to the prevalence of child marriage to a large extent. “There is also a need to strengthen families by providing appropriate livelihood opportunity,” she said.OSCPCR, a statutory body, is a key stakeholder of the state government is spearheading the campaign to end child marriage in the state by 2030. A high power committee at the state has been formed to facilitate the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rise-in-foeticide-unwed-mothers-odisha-child-rights-panel-opposes-marriage-age-law-101641325804966.html
05-01-2022||India||5,644 drug peddlers held in city in 2021, say Bengaluru police||On August 17, 2021, the central crime branch of the Bengaluru police had raided a drug manufacturing unit in Bengaluru and seized 4kg MDMA, a psychoactive drug.For police who are used to seeing drugs coming in from outside state and country to Bengaluru, witnessing a manufacturing unit in city was new.According to police, the raid was a part of the renewed effort from the police department to crackdown on drug peddlers in city for the past two years. The data released by the city crime records bureau shows that the efforts have shown results.In 2021, the Bengaluru police have arrested 5,644 drug peddlers in 4,275 cases and seized drugs worth around ₹59 crore. This has been the highest narcotics-related arrests and recovery in the city police’s history so far. In comparison, 2,766 cases were registered with 3,673 suspects being arrested in 2020. The figure was of 768 cases and 1,260 arrests in 2019.According to data, of the 4,475 cases registered in 2021, 4,275 cases were related to seizure of marijuana, followed by 103 cases of MDMA, 39 cases of synthetic drugs and other narcotic substances ecstasy, hashish and LSD.Total 3,641.756kg drugs worth ₹592,775,690 were seized in 2021 against 3,912.826kg drugs worth ₹213,856,550 in 2020, and 1053.188kg drugs worth ₹34,686,700 in 2019.In 2021, 173 foreign nationals were arrested and 137 cases were booked against them of which, 105 accused were Nigerian. In 2019, 38 foreign nationals were arrested and 33 cases were booked; and in 2020, 84 foreigners were arrested with 66 cases being registered against them.According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), in 2020, Bengaluru had reported the highest number of cases related to narcotics in country. “These numbers are the result of a campaign started by the Bengaluru police early in 2020. We have been cracking down on drug suppliers in city. We are confident that the numbers will be much higher in the coming days as we have increased the intensity of operations,” said Karnataka police chief, DG&IGP Kamal Pant.Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant said in the last two years, there was an emphasis on cracking down on drug rackets in the city. “All DCPs were asked to give special focus on drug cases. We were constantly in touch with other departments and central agencies to track inter-state peddlers,” said Pant.According to a CCB official, in the last two years, police have been focusing on drug purchases through the dark web as well. “We have found that many criminals have procured synthetic drugs from abroad, especially the Scandinavian countries. First, we cannot track who is purchasing what from the dark web. Second, it is hard to track them when they arrive in country. To give an example, in a case of LSD, also known as acid, it is a sheet of paper. When the order arrives at an airport in India, it is difficult to find it among other larger consignments. But we have been improvising to tackle such cases,” the officer added.On November 18, while interrogating eight men who were arrested for possessing hydro-marijuana, police learnt that a man had helped the gang procure the drug from Amsterdam.The arrest of hacker Srikrishna, who procured these drugs via the dark web, had opened the Pandora’s box and resulted in political controversy.
05-01-2022||India||State has entered third wave of Covid 19: Karnataka health minister||Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar on Tuesday said the third Covid-19 wave has set in the state, and Bengaluru will be an epicentre this time. Sudhakar said the Covid-19 infections went up to 1.6% from a mere 0.4% in the state, of which 90% cases were reported in Bengaluru. “What’s the present scenario? Isn’t it the third wave? For six months, Karnataka did not have 0.1% cases. If it has gone up to 1.6% on a single day, this is the beginning of the third wave,” Sudhakar said. Karnataka logged 2,479 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, of which 2,053 are from Bengaluru. While the positivity rate increased to 2.59%, the state also witnessed four deaths. The state had on Monday recorded 1,290 infections, out of which 1,040 were reported in Bengaluru. Over the last week, Karnataka, particularly Bengaluru, has been witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases with daily cases crossing over the 1,000 marks in the state and in the city. The state has reported 149 new cases of Omicron variant of coronavirus. As of now, the state’s Omicron tally is 226, said the health minister.The minister said since Bengaluru has an international airport and many people arrive in the city, which is why there’s a need to implement special measures. “Bengaluru will become an epicentre. It was an epicentre in the first wave and second wave. It will be the epicentre during the third wave as well,” Sudhakar told reporters. “If you look at the national figure, maximum cases are coming in the metropolitan cities. Almost 90% are in those cities. Hence, we are concentrating on Bengaluru with a focus on the formation of micro-containment zones and screening at the airport,” the minister added. He further added, there are 43 lakh children in the state within the age group of 15 to 18 and the state government wants to vaccinate them all in 10 to 15 days. “Yesterday (Monday), we vaccinated 4,22,252 children, though our target was 6.38 lakh. We could achieve 66% on the first day. We were in fourth place in the country in vaccinating teenagers. We want to increase the number of vaccinations,” he said.

The 10-day padayatra, scheduled to start from Mekedatu on January 9 morning, will culminate with a public meeting at Basavanagudi grounds. “We have information that BJP is attempting to stall the march citing Covid. The government may forcefully impose a lockdown too to stop us. But we would rather go to jail than drop the march,” Shivakumar told media. “I have been charged with violations of Covid-19 guidelines and have been served summons. Chief minister (CM) Basavaraj Bommai who violating restrictions and attended a wedding ceremony. What action has been initiated against him?” he asked. He said the party will adhere to Covid appropriate behaviour during the rally. “The party has ordered one lakh masks. We have also been procuring sanitisers and a process is in place to sanitise all choultries and mutts along the route where we will be staying. Also, 100 doctors from the KPCC doctors’ cell and 10 mobile health check-up units will be deployed as well,” he said. Despite the promises, Shivakumar’s Twitter handle on Tuesday released photos, where he could be seen standing with a large group of followers, without masks or mandatory social distancing. On Monday, the Congress party took out a mammoth rally in Mysuru as a prelude to the padayatra from Mekedatu to Bengaluru to build pressure on the BJP government in the State to start work on the project. Covid norms were followed during the rally as photographs of the gathering around Shivakumar and Siddarmaiah were released by the party after the event. Speaking to reporters, Karnataka health minister Sudhakar said the Congress will have to take responsibility if the infections in the state increase because of the padayatra. “It is good that they are doing it for implementation of the Mekedatu project which would provide drinking water to the city. The project was conveniently forgotten when they were in power for six years. They will have to take responsibility if the march causes the spread of infection,” he warned. Responding to the health minister, Opposition leader Siddarmaiah said it was the government’s responsibility to contain the pandemic spread and they have failed at it. “Why would the cases in state increase if the government had taken strict measures? Since they have failed to do so, the cases are increasing. We will follow all precautions during the march. We are not doing this for politics but for people,” he said. Siddaramaiah said the BJP questioning the Congress is just showing double standards. “When Prime Minister Narendra Modi was holding rallies in Uttar Pradesh, they didn’t have any concerns? Does Modi have a law of his own? Does Amit Shah have a different set of laws? Go tell them first,” said Siddaramaiah. Meanwhile, Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra in Chikkamagaluru said Congress should postpone the march considering the prevailing situation. “The opposition party has the freedom to organise such events but not when people’s lives are at stake,” he said. Karnataka cooperation minister ST Somashekar said, “In the interest of the people, the march should be deferred.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-continue-padyatra-even-if-lockdown-is-imposed-karnataka-congress-101641324726655.html

A weekend curfew has been announced in the city for two weeks starting from January 6 and the night curfew which is already in effect has also been extended by two weeks. “In Bengaluru urban district, all schools and colleges except, medical and para medical will remain closed with effect from Thursday except Class 10, 11 and 12,” read an order issued by the Karnataka government. These decisions were announced by the Karnataka revenue minister R Ashok, following a meeting called by chief minister (CM) Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday evening. The meeting called by the chief minister was attended by senior cabinet ministers, members of the technical advisory committee and other senior officials. Addressing the media, Ashok said that the daily increase in the cases crossing the 10,000-mark in the state is inevitable and since most of the cases are reported in Bengaluru, special guidelines have been planned for the city. “Pubs, clubs, restaurants, bars, hotels and other eating places will function with 50% of the seating capacity while strictly adhering to Covid protocols. Also, entry to such places will be restricted to fully vaccinated persons,” read the guideline issued by the government. “Cinema halls, multiplexes, theatres, rangamandiras, auditorium and similar places to also operate with 50% of the seating capacity in keeping with the Covid appropriate behaviour. Admission to these places will also be restricted to fully vaccinated persons,” the guideline added. Ashok further added that the RT-PCR test will be mandatory for all the passengers coming from Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra. “For international passengers, the guidelines issued by the central government will be applicable,” he said. The minister added that the number of people at a wedding will be restricted to 100 for indoor functions and 200 for outdoor functions. He also said that all forms of political functions, marches and protests will not be allowed. When asked if these restrictions will be applicable to the Congress, which is planning a padayatra, the minister said that restrictions will be applicable to everyone. “We are not making these restrictions keeping any particular party in mind, these restrictions are in place to keep people of Karnataka safe,” he said. These restrictions will be in effect from Wednesday morning, said the minister. Check points to be set upEarlier in the day, CM Bommai said checkpoints will be set up in places where there are village-to-village contacts between Karnataka and neighbouring states. He also said the police station under the jurisdiction will be responsible for such checkpoints. “Our experiences since the first and second wave have been that the infections in Karnataka rise whenever Covid-19 cases spiral in our neighbouring states, with whom we have daily business activities. We have to focus on that area,” Bommai told the reporters. When asked about the laxity in the border regions, the CM said the border is vast and inspection is happening at the main checkpoints only. However, there are contacts with neighbouring states at the village-level. “I’m going to issue a direction to hold the police stations responsible for places where there is village-to-village contact. We will also set up check posts in such villages and deploy people,” the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schools-shut-karnataka-govt-imposes-weekend-curfew-from-january-6-as-covid-cases-surge-101641324433728.html
05-01-2022||India||Kerala says no to night curfew, curbs to stay||Kerala on Tuesday decided not to re-impose night curfew but announced some restrictions in keeping with the Covid protocol. The state is at the third spot with 181 Omicron cases after Maharashtra and Delhi. The decision was taken at the core committee meeting on pandemic, chaired by chief minister (CM) Pinarayi Vijayan. During the meeting, some experts contended that there was no point in continuing with the night curfew as movement of people during night hours is limited in the state. Night curfew was in force for four days from December 30 to January 2 to avoid big gathering during New Year celebrations. As per the latest restrictions, the maximum number of people attending closed-door functions will be 75 and outdoor 150. Earlier, it was 150 and 200 respectively, said a statement from chief minister office (CMO). The government will also screen the visitors from abroad and quarantine them for two weeks. The CMO said around 15 lakh students have enrolled for the vaccine and their schedule will be completed at the earliest. The state detected the first case of the new variant on December 7. Experts said Omicron cases are likely to peak in the state in two months. The government said it has taken enough precautions to meet the exigency. At least 98.6% of eligible population in the state has received the first dose of vaccine and 80% both. Experts said good vaccination rate will help contain the Omicron threat but they warned it is too early to lower guard. Meanwhile, the state reported 3,640 Covid-19 cases after 71,120 samples were tested. It also reported 30 deaths taking the toll to 48,637.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-says-no-to-night-curfew-curbs-to-stay-101641323526384.html
05-01-2022||India||Holkars’ property case: SC fines petitioner for allegations against high court||“Enough is enough,” the Supreme Court remarked on Tuesday, as it fined a petitioner ₹25 lakh for raising “contemptuous allegations” against the Uttarakhand high court in a case pertaining to the sale and transfer of properties by a trust of the erstwhile royal family of Holkars.“You cannot slap and then say sorry...this practice must stop now,” observed a bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar, as it came down heavily on Vijay Singh Pal, who claimed to be a whistleblower of the alleged scam in sale and transfer of properties by the Indore-based trust that managed properties in several states.Pal had moved an application before the Supreme Court, levelling a spate of allegations against the judges of the high court, besides accusing officials of the Uttarakhand government as well as solicitor general Tushar Mehta of not acting fairly in a matter relating to the case. Mehta appeared for the Madhya Pradesh government in the case.“Averments made in the application are unacceptable. The applicant has the audacity to make allegations against the entire Uttarakhand high court and officials of the state government. In our view, an applicant who wants itself impleaded in a case that involves complex issues must show some restraint and must eschew on making unfounded allegations, as has been made in this application,” stated the court order.“We deprecate the casual manner in which this application has been drafted,” the order said. “We outrightly reject this application while imposing an exemplary cost of ₹25 lakh.”Pal must deposit the penalty with the court’s registry within four weeks, failing which the amount shall be recovered from his assets as arrears of land revenue, the court clarified. The district collector of Haridwar has been directed by the court to comply with the order of recovery from Pal after four weeks.In October 2020, the Madhya Pradesh high court had ordered an investigation by the economic offence wing (EOW) into sale and transfer of properties by Khasgi (Devi Ahilyabai Holkar Charities) Trust while holding all transfers as null and void. It also ruled that the properties managed by the trust will lie with the state government.The trustees include Usha Devi (daughter of late king Yashwant Rao Holkar), her spouse Satish Malhotra, justice PD Mule (retired), two representatives of the state government as ex-officio members, revenue commissioner of Indore and superintending engineer of the public works department, Indore, and a representative of the central government.The Khasgi Trust manages 246 properties spread over 12,000 acres of land in various states, including Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The properties include 138 temples, 18 dharmshalas and 34 ghats, among others.The trust challenged the high court order in the Supreme Court, which stayed the investigation by an order on October 16 and ordered a status quo with respect to possession and management of properties.On Tuesday, Mehta and advocate Prashant Bhushan, who appeared for an applicant in the case, urged the bench to vacate the stay, and let the investigation continue, but the court declined this plea.It noted that the interim order on October 16, 2020, was passed after hearing all the parties, and there was no new ground to modify it until the case is finally heard. Senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Abhishek Manu Singhvi appeared for the trust and some of the trustees.

In a video Stalin shared on Twitter, he is seen helping a man wear a surgical mask and distributing masks to people and children. He said he saw some people without masks on the streets and did this as a precautionary measure and to create awareness amidst the rapid transmission of the Omicron variant of concern. “Do not come out without wearing a mask,” he is seen telling people on the road.Tamil Nadu reported 2,731 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday with Chennai registering the highest-- 1,489, according to the health department. The number of new cases reported on Monday was 1,728, showing that cases have doubled in a day when tests on both days were almost similar in the 100,000 range. The state currently has 118 cases of Omicron variant. Stalin distributed face masks to people on the arterial Anna Salai near Omandurar government hospital on his way from the secretariat at Fort St. George, the seat of power of the Tamil Nadu government, to his residence. In a longer video shared by the government, Stalin is seen making several stops and distributing masks and advising people to wear one. “He did this through an 8-km commute,” said a government official not wishing to be named.The chief minister’s action comes a day after authorities of the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) collected a fine amount of over ₹2.18 lakh from more than a 1,000 people who were not wearing masks in the city. Stalin has been emphasising mask compliance and vaccination. He stressed on the two aspects while launching the vaccination drive for children in the 15-18 age group on Monday. On December 3, a total of 430,000 people were vaccinated across the state, which include 330,000 children. Stalin chaired a high-level meeting on the Covid-19 situation in Tamil Nadu with senior officials on Tuesday. More restrictions are expected to come into effect. 
05-01-2022||India||Farmers’ stir over new Amaravati municipality||A gazette notification issued by the Andhra Pradesh government regarding a decision to convert a part of the capital region Amaravati into a municipal corporation has triggered a fresh protest from the local farmers who had given away their lands for the formation of the capital city in 2015..According to the notification, which was issued on Monday, the state government has proposed to the Amaravati Capital City Municipal Corporation (ACCMC) to develop the area into a full-fledged urban agglomeration.While the planned capital city comprised 29 villages, the proposed ACCMC compromises only 16 of them, which fall under the Thullur block. They would be merged with three other villages falling under the Mangalagiri block of Guntur district to form ACCMC, according to the notification.The notification issued in the name of Guntur collector Vivek Yadav called for the conduct of “grama sabhas” (village meetings) in these 19 villages, starting from January 6, seeking the people’s opinions on the formation of the new corporation.“The grama sabhas would be conducted with the help of revenue and police officials strictly following the existing Covid-19 protocols and ensuring that there are no law and order issues. The opinions of the villagers would be consolidated and sent to the government for further action,” Thullur mandal parishad (block parishad) development officer A Srinivas Rao said.The development comes at a time when the farmers of Amaravati are fighting a legal battle in the state high court challenging the Jagan Mohan Reddy government’s decision to form three capital cities for the state and asking for retention of Amaravati as only capital.In November, the Jagan government repealed the laws seeking to create three capitals in the state legislature on technical grounds and declared that it would reintroduce fool-proof bills on the three capitals later, without giving scope for any legal hassles. The high court deferred the hearing to January 28.Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi (Amaravati protection committee) joint action committee (JAC) convenor A Shiva Reddy said there is something fishy in the government’s proposed plan to create a separate municipal corporation for Amaravati capital city only with 16 villages.According to him, nearly 24,000 farmers belonging to 29 villages in Tadepalli, Mangalagiri and Thullur mandals (blocks) gave away 33,000 acres of lands for the capital city of Amaravati in 2015.“These lands are under the control of AP Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA), with whom the farmers agreed in the development of capital. When there is already such authority, where is the need for a separate municipal corporation for the capital city?” Reddy asked.The APCRDA, which was constituted by the previous Telugu Desam Party government for the development of the capital city, was abolished by the Jagan Mohan Reddy government through legislation in June 2020 and its place, it created Amaravati Metropolitan Region Development Authority (AMRDA).However, with the repeal of the three capitals bill last month, the AMRDA ceased to exist,, and the APCRDA was restored.Reddy pointed out that in March 2021, the state government had separated seven villages – Nidamarru, Navuluru, Atmakuru, Yerrabalem, Bethapudi, Vundavalli and Penumaka villages – from the Amaravati capital region and included them under Tadepalli-Mangalagiri Municipal Corporation.“We have challenged the move in the high court, and the case is still pending. The government now seeks to separate another 16 villages from Amaravati to form a separate corporation. The remaining six villages are likely to merge with Tatikonda municipality. So, the government wants to divide the original capital region of Amaravati into three parts,” Reddy alleged.One of the farmers of Amaravati, K Anil Kumar of Venkatayapalem village, said the villages would oppose this divide-and-rule policy of the government in grama sabhas.“We shall demand that if at all the government wants to create a separate municipal corporation for Amaravati, it should comprise all the 29 villages falling under the capital region. I don’t think the government will proceed without the approval of the grama sabhas,” he said.The JAC convenor said nobody knew the state government’s plan. “But it appears there is a conspiracy to modify the master plan of the Amaravati capital city by dividing the 29 villages among the three civic bodies. When the government forms three capital cities finally, there would be no capital region development authority at all,” Reddy added.Do we have an Oppn reaction?
05-01-2022||India||Jagan seeks Centre’s nod for new national highway||Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday requested the Centre to approve a national highway from Visakhapatnam port to Bhogapuram in Vizianagaram district, where a new greenfield international airport is coming up.An official release from the chief minister’s office (CMO) stated that he had made a representation to this effect to union minister for transport and highways Nitin Gadkari during an hour-long meeting in New Delhi on Tuesday morning. He explained the steps being taken for the preparation of a detailed project report for the national highway.He said the Visakhapatnam-Bhogapuram national highway that would pass through Rushikonda and Bhimili beach corridor projects along the coast, would contribute to the development of tourism in the region, besides easing the traffic for the passengers to reach the international airport.Jagan said the highway would also reduce the distance from Visakhapatnam to Odisha and Chhattisgarh.The chief minister also requested the Union minister to consider the state government’s earlier appeal to grant a bypass road on the eastern side of Vijayawada and said land acquisition would be completed as soon as possible. “The state government would also give exemption from State GST and royalty to reduce the cost of the project,” he said.He also requested extension of the four lane road in Bapatla as a part of construction of NH-216 of Kathipudi – Ongole Corridor as there is a possibility of traffic jams again due to educational institutions, tourists and the air base.On Monday night, the chief minister met union minister for civil aviation Jyotiraditya Scindia and requested him to extend support to the development of the Bhogapuram airport.He reminded that at the time of the bifurcation of the combined Andhra Pradesh, the Centre had promised to provide financial assistance for the development of the residuary AP in all sectors, including aviation, for a period of 10 years.He said the new airport was being built at Bhogapuram, as there is no possibility for expanding the current airport in Visakhapatnam, which is adjacent to Eastern Naval Base. He urged the Union minister to extend support for completing the airport in the next three years.The chief minister also met union minister for education Dharmendra Pradhan and sports minister Anurag Thakur before returning to Vijayawada.
05-01-2022||India||Centre aims for digital push in revamp plan for cooperatives||India will soon have a digital database of cooperatives being worked on by the new ministry of cooperation, which will help overhaul a sector the government hopes will propel the economy’s size to $5 trillion, a senior official aware of developments said.The move is aimed to help reposition cooperatives as business entities with an online presence. A national database is also necessary to formulate an upcoming new policy for cooperatives, the official added, requesting anonymity.Prime Minister Narendra Modi shuffled his cabinet in July, carving out a new ministry of cooperation, which was earlier a department under the agriculture ministry. Home minister Amit Shah heads the new ministry.The ministry will focus on building cooperative societies as the pivot of a whole gamut of economic activities, from financial services to production of finished goods.Cooperatives are essentially collectives of small producers who pool their resources to achieve scale and collective bargaining power in markets. While there are some iconic cooperative businesses in the country, such as dairy giant Amul, seasoned flatbread-maker Lijjat Papad and fertiliser major IFFCO (Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative), the sector in many areas is hobbled by inefficiencies and opaque patronage systems.Financial cooperatives, a key segment within cooperatives, play a key role in lending and saving operations. State cooperative banks, according to Nabard’s annual report of 2019-20, had a total paid-up capital of ₹6,104 crore and deposits of ₹1,35,393 crore.Primary agricultural credit societies (PACS) will be a key thrust area of the digitisation push, officials said. PACS are village or district-level last-mile institutions that deliver agricultural credit to millions of farmers.A national software platform, which will be available in local languages, will link PACS, district cooperative banks, and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), potentially creating an integrated financial grid. The digital database is aimed at boosting their reach and transparency.India’s cooperative sector is the world’s largest, and covers almost 98% of the countryside, with over 900,000 societies with a membership of about 290 million people, according to data from the National Cooperative Union of India.Along with the technical framework, the government is also likely to bring statutory changes in the cooperatives sector. Addressing a cooperatives’ meet in January last year, Shah said that the government will bring changes to laws governing the sector to “smoothen processes in areas such as multisector cooperatives”. The minister added that this would a “big step in our march towards development”.The cooperatives sector policy was last revised by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 2002. “Now, the current government is looking to update the policy in step with newer economic realities,” the official cited in the first instance saidCooperatives are governed by two main pieces of legislation, the Cooperative Societies Act, 2012, and the Multi-state Cooperatives Act, 2002.Cooperative banks, both urban and rural, are lending institutions registered under the Cooperative Societies Act,1912. They are usually run by an elected committee.In March 2021, Parliament passed a law to bring them under the oversight of the Reserve Bank of India.“We welcome the government’s move to re-energise cooperatives. Cooperatives are the only way to ensure inclusive growth,” said Rattanlal Malik, the president of Saharanpur Gramin Sehekarita Bank.“I think the government will need to hold consultations with states before it can finalise a new cooperative policy for the country because the majority of cooperatives fall in the domain of the states,” said Amrit Pritam, director of the Navinttam, a development NGO that works with rural collectives.

The existence of such reputation in the present days is a million dollar question. It is apposite to mention here that appropriate disciplinary proceedings for capital punishment shall be initiated against the officials concerned for not maintaining absolute integrity and devotion to duty, which is unbecoming of a member of the service and such irresponsible officials should be dismissed from service and their dereliction should be entered into their Service Register, so that their promotions and other benefits should be deprived.” “The umbrella of moral turpitude should be widened to deprive gratuity to the officials and before depriving the gratuity, an opportunity shall be given to the person concerned, as on technical ground, on the failure to give an opportunity, the persons, who are involved in the act of moral turpitude, etc., should not be allowed to succeed to get their benefits,” a division bench of Justices S Vaidyanathan and A A Nakkiran said.The bench was passing final orders on a writ appeal from the University challenging the orders dated October 23, 2017 of a single judge, recently.The bench set aside both the orders of the University giving promotions to the two persons -- Veerapandi and Selvi, as well as that of the single judge who had held that the original petitioner Dr S Bhaskaran, should also be given the promotion to the post.Though they could smell a rat in the action of the University, they have no other option but to interfere with the order of the single judge, as they do not want to continue the illegality for ever and two wrongs cannot make a right, the judges said.The judges also observed that they find the order of the single judge has no legs to stand and is liable to be set aside. To be more precise, none of the persons, including the two -- Veerapandi and Selvi, are eligible to be promoted to the post of Assistant Librarian, without adhering to the proper selection process, on account of the fraud committed by the University. Since the University had extracted work from them in the post of Assistant Librarian, the salary, if any paid to them shall not be recovered, however, they are not entitled to any benefits for the past services rendered in that post, for, as stated supra, their promotion to the said post itself perpetuated illegality, the judges added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punish-erring-university-of-madras-officials-high-court-101641322868443.html
05-01-2022||India||Charge sheet filed in Lakhimpur Kheri case: SIT used 208 testimonials of witnesses, 24 photos and videos to build case||Lucknow:Investigators have used testimonials of 208 witnesses, 17 items of scientific and electronic evidence, and 24 photographs and videos to build their case in a 5,000 page charge sheet filed in the Lakhimpur Kheri case, officials said on Tuesday.The special investigation team probing the October 3 violence filed charges against 14 people on Monday, naming the son of junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni as the main accused, and citing witness statements to confirm his presence at the spot during the incident.The team used 24 photographs, CCTV footage and videos shot by independent witnesses to establish the sequence of events when four farmers and a journalist were allegedly mowed down by the minister’s son, Ashish Mishra, and others during a farm protest, a SIT official said.Three more people were killed in subsequent clashes. The SIT called it a “well-planned conspiracy”.The violence sparked nationwide condemnation and energised opposition parties to demand the minister’s resignation months before high-stakes polls in the crucial state. Several opposition parties disrupted proceedings in the winter session of Parliament to demand Ajay Mishra’s removal.There were 17 pieces of evidence, including ballistic reports of three firearms and forensic reports of the bullet shells and charred vehicles recovered from the site, the official said. Reports on the phone call details and cellphone locations of Ashish Mishra have been included as evidence. “In addition, the SIT included the statements of 208 eyewitnesses and witnesses to prove the presence of Ashish Mishra and others at the spot. The statements of over 90 witnesses were recorded before the judicial magistrate so that they could not retract from their version later,” the official said, requesting anonymity. The initial complaint into the case only named Ashish Mishra and unknown people. Subsequent investigation by the SIT identified 12 other accused. In the charge sheet, the SIT added a 14th accused – Virendra Shukla, a relative of the minister who is yet to be named in the charge sheet.The 13 accused were charged under sections 147(rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapons), 149 (unlawful assembly ), 307(attempt to murder), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 302 (murder) and 120B (criminal conspiracy), 427(mischief causing damage), 34 (acts done with common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and Section 177 (wilfully disobeying directions) and B177 of the Motor Vehicle Act, said prosecution officer SP Yadav.The victims’ kin and some opposition parties have alleged that the government was protecting Ajay Mishra by not naming him in the charge sheet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/charge-sheet-filed-in-lakhimpur-kheri-case-sit-used-208-testimonials-of-witnesses-24-photos-and-videos-to-build-case-101641322864730.html

Chief minister MK Stalin on Tuesday launched this welfare move at the state secretariat by handing over the gifts to ten families. The Pongal gifts to the beneficiaries have a total of 21 grocery items, including 100 gram of ghee produced by the state-owned Aavin, different varieties of dhal and also a full sugarcane which is an integral part of the festival. The government announced that the sugarcane provided with the gift hampers be procured directly from farmers who have cultivated sugarcane. Tokens for distribution of the hampers have been issued and the 2.15 card holders can collect it from the ration shops run by the state public distribution system.The erstwhile AIADMK government in 2019 and 2021 added a cash gift along with the hampers distributed for Pongal in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the DMK government has not included a cash dole. The grocery items are packed inside a cloth bag which says “Tamizhar Thirunaal Vaazthukkal” (Tamil festival greetings). After the launch, Stalin said in a tweet, “We are one race – Tamils. Pongal is the festival of Tamils during which we thank the sun and cattle.” Pongal is an important festival in the state. In January 2020, Pongal was when most parties informally kick-started their campaign ahead of the assembly election held in April with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, BJP leader JP Nadda and RSS chief Mohan Bhawat taking part in Pongal festivities. This year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to fly down to the state for the festival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-govt-begins-distribution-of-pongal-gifts-to-2-15-cr-ration-card-holders-101641322744688.html

But later, the police relented and gave the permission on the condition that there should not be a large number of participants in the rally.Nadda, however, confined himself to garlanding the Mahatama Gandhi statue at MG Road, Secunderabad, while the party leaders and activists took out a rally by wearing black badges and tying their mouths with black ribbons.Speaking to reporters at the state party office, the BJP national president said as a disciplined citizen, he had strictly followed the Covid-19 protocol and not participated in the rally.He alleged that the arrest of Bandi Sanjay was undemocratic and nothing but murder of democracy. While the TRS leaders gave a go-by to Covid-19 norms in taking out rallies, holding meetings and staging dharnas, Sanjay confined himself to his MP office with a few people, strictly following the Covid-19 norms, he pointed out.“Yet, the police broke open his office with gas-cutters to arrest him. They used teargas shells and water cannons and beat up the BJP workers indiscriminately. This clearly shows KCR has lost his mental balance, ever since his party lost the Huzurabad by-election. Vinash kale viparitha buddhi (When one nears the doomsday, one would get such destructive thoughts),” Nadda said.Describing the BJP’s fight as “Dharma Yudh” (righteous war), the BJP chief said the fight would continue in a democratic way on all fronts, including political and legal. “We are not going to stop with this rally. We shall intensify our fight and take it to a decisive end. The fight will continue till the TRS is pulled down from power,” he said.The BJP leaders decided to continue their struggle for the next 14 days in protest against the 14-day judicial remand of Sanjay.Earlier in the day, the state high court refused to entertain the petition of the state BJP chief seeking quashing of the FIR filed against him by the Karimnagar police. The high court asked the BJP leader to move the local court which is hearing the cases filed against the MLAs and MPs.

The bench also said that an order passed by another judge of the Madras high court in 2020 was in violation of the Supreme Court order defining right to privacy as a fundamental right. “The installation of CCTV equipment inside premises such as a spa would unquestionably infract upon a person’s bodily autonomy. These are inviolable spaces where the prying eye of the state simply cannot be allowed to enter,” Justice Swaminathan said in his orders on Tuesday. He said the Supreme Court had held that privacy as guaranteed in Article 21 takes different forms -- it includes a right to bodily autonomy, a right to informational privacy and a right to a privacy of choice.The case in the Madurai bench relates to that of a petitioner, Payel Biswas who is running a spa, named “Queen Ayurvedic Cross Spa Centre”, in Tamil Nadu’s Trichy district. After a gazette notification in 2018, obtaining of licence has been made mandatory for spa businesses and the petitioner applied for such licence. Since no action was taken on his request, he filed a writ petition for directing the respondents, the Trichy police, to issue a “no objection certificate”. He also wanted the court to restrain the police from interfering with the running of the spa relying on other orders made by other judges of the court.During the hearing, the government counsel informed the court about an order on December 12, 2020 passed by Justice S M Subramaniam on a similar petition. He had directed the installation of CCTV cameras in all spas, massage and therapy centres, across Tamil Nadu to prevent illegal activities and allowed police to take action if there is a complaint.Justice Swaminathan said that Justice S M Subramaniam order was contrary to a Supreme Court order on privacy.Justice Swaminathan concluded that in his “humblest opinion” and “the greatest of respect” to his “revered brother Judge”, his the judgment appears to run counter to the law laid down by the Supreme Court’s 9-judge bench judgment in the K S Puttaswamy versus Union of India case of 2017. He quoted justice Chandrachud’s order from the concluding part of the Puttaswamy case that states, “While the legitimate expectation of privacy may vary from intimate zone to the private zone and from the private to the public arena, it is important to underscore that privacy is not lost or surrendered merely because the individual is in a public place.”Suspicion that immoral activities are taking place in massage centres cannot be reason enough to intrude into an individual’s right to relax, for it intrinsically is part and parcel of his fundamental right to privacy, said Justice Swaminathan in his orders. The court then directed the police to consider the petitioner’s representation for availing of licence on merits within four weeks.

The ED had on December 29, 2021 filed a 7,000-page supplementary charge sheet against Deshmukh and his sons. The agency had earlier filed a charge sheet against 14 people, including Deshmukh’s private secretary (an additional collector-rank officer) Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde.The Enforcement Directorate had launched a probe against Deshmukh and others after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed an FIR against the senior NCP leader in April 2021 on charges of corruption and misuse of official position.The ED’s case is that while serving as state home minister, Deshmukh allegedly misused his official position and through dismissed cop Sachin Waze, who is behind bars in the ‘Antilia’ bomb scare and Mansukh Hiran killing cases, collected ₹4.70 crore from various bars in Mumbai.As per the prosecution, Deshmukh and his family members owned several companies which were used to launder the money. Deshmukh, who resigned from the post of state home minister in April 2021, has repeatedly denied the charges against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/money-laundering-case-anil-deshmukh-moves-special-court-to-seek-default-bail-101641322144585.html

This was easily the biggest gap to separate the two sides in the current series. Australia, who are now 2-1 up, won the first Test at Brisbane by a mere 16 runs and the second at Perth, by just two wickets. The fourth Test starts in Sydney on Saturday and the fifth at Adelaide, on Jan. 28. Overall, this was India’s fourth Victory over Australia, the first having been notched up at Kanpur in Dec. 1959. India have won at Bombay in 1964 and at Delhi in 1969. Skipper Bishen Bedi, who took both of Australia’s two remaining wickets, said afterwards that he was pretty confident that India would level the score in Sydney where the wicket, he said, gave bowlers a lot of hope, even though it produced a lot of runs. Australian captain Bobby Simpson said that his side had lost the match by batting badly in the first innings He said: “We got rolled over for 213 when we were looking for something like 400.” He added that the second innings collapse of his side was understandable, because the pitch had deteriorated. Simpson said he thought that if India were going to win anywhere, it was going to be in Melbourne, where the pitch would suit their bowlers and deaden the edge of Australia’s pace-oriented attack. He said that in spite of this heavy reverse, he considered Australia favourites for Sydney. In analysing the Indian win, Bedi said that it was an absolute team effort. “There was not one man who did not make a contribution”. But he was high in praise of his bowling companion, Chandrasekhar, who took 12 wickets in the match. Said Bedi: “When Chandra bowls as he did here, he is as exciting and aggressive as any fast bowler. It was the same when we won our first Test in England .. Chandra is a match, winner.” Australia’s tail-enders did not go down meekly There were some violent blows by Wayne Clark and he and Thomson added 28 runs in as many minutes before Thomson drove back a return catch to Bedi.Chandrasekhar could have increased his tally of wickets for the match to 13, but Mankad, at mid-wicket, put down a hard catch from Clark in the over before Bedi had him caught in the same position, by Ghavri Score board India - 1st Innings : 256 Australia - 1st Innings : 213 India - 2nd innings : 343 Australia - 2nd innings: 164 (Cosier b Chandrasekhar 34, Dyson lbw Bedi 12, Ogilvie c Chauhan b Bedi 0, Serjeant b Chandrasekhar 17, Simpson lbw Chandrasekhar 4, Toohey c Chauhan b Chandrasekhar 14, Maan c Gavaskar b Chandrasekhar 18, Rixon C and b Chandrasekhar 12, Clarke c Ghavri b Bedi 33, Thompson c and b Bedi 7, S.

The injured were sent to a nearby hospital. They have been discharged after treatment, district officials said.The event was organised by the district unit of the Congress under its Ladki Hoon, Lad Sakti Hoon (I am a girl and I can fight) poll campaign in Uttar Pradesh.The injured were sent to a nearby hospital. They have been discharged after treatment, district officials said.The event was organised by the district unit of the Congress under its Ladki Hoon, Lad Sakti Hoon (I am a girl and I can fight) poll campaign in Uttar Pradesh, where assembly elections are due in a few months.Soon after the incident, videos of the event were circulated on social media. In one of the videos, some girls running in front can be seen tripping and falling to the ground, forcing those behind to stop suddenly. This almost resulted in a stampede and some of the participants were injured. Most participants were neither wearing masks nor following Covid protocols.HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the videos.The incident occurred at the beginning of the race. No complaint has been lodged in the matter, police said.Congress leader and former Bareilly mayor Supriya Aron dismissed the incident. “When a stampede can happen in Vaishno Devi, these are just girls. It is human nature. But I want to apologise.” Her reference is to a recent stampede at Katra, on the route to Vaishno devi, which resulted in the death of 12 people.She further claimed that the whole incident might even be a conspiracy.Terming the incident unfortunate, Geeta Shakya, the Uttar Pradesh Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) women’s wing chief, slammed the Congress for its “irresponsible” statements.“First the Congress leaders lured these girls, using them for political gains, and then after the incident, the way they reacted on the incident was shameful. They did not provide first aid to the injured girls and later on, held them responsible for the incident,” Shakya said.Close to 10,000 girls registered for the run, local Congress leaders said. The prizes included a scooter, smartphones, smart watches and medals.“The Congress shamelessly compared the incident with the stampede at the Vaishno Devi temple. BJP cadres and local administration helped the students but the Congress leaders were only seen trying to cover up their mistake,” Shakya added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-girls-injured-after-stampede-like-situation-in-congress-s-bareilly-event-101641321666345.html
05-01-2022||India||EWS quota in medical seats: Supreme Court to hear NEET-PG case today||Petitions challenging reservations in the national quota of seats in postgraduate medical courses will be heard in the Supreme Court on Wednesday after the central government persuaded it to urgently list the matter.A two-judge bench of justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna will hear the petitions challenging reservation for other backward classes (OBCs) and economically weaker sections (EWS) in the all-India quota NEET-PG seats on Wednesday.Resident doctors who have qualified for postgraduate courses have been protesting the delay in counselling because the matter of reservations is pending in court.Appearing for the Centre, solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta on Tuesday told a bench headed by chief justice of India NV Ramana that the protesting resident doctors had genuine concerns, which can only be addressed only if the matter is listed urgently.“These matters relate to persons belonging to EWS. A statement was made by us that prevent further counselling for PG admissions. The resident doctors are protesting for this reason. Their concerns are genuine,” Mehta said.He requested that, for a limited purpose, even a bench of two judges headed by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud could be constituted to hear the pending petitions. On Monday, Mehta made a similar request before justice Chandrachud, seeking an early listing for Tuesday instead of the prefixed date of January 6. Justice Chandrachud assured him at the time that he would take this up with the chief justice.Counselling is the process by which the successful candidate can exercise choice of institute based on his/her eligibility decided by the marks/rank secured. The decision of the government to introduce OBC and EWS reservation in medical and dental courses was made applicable to 50% PG and 15% UG AIQ seats. The Government announcement on July 29 had said, “This decision would benefit every year nearly 1500 OBC students in MBBS and 2500 OBC students in PG and also around 550 EWS students in MBBS and around 1000 EWS students in PG.”A total of over 89,000 doctors had qualified in the NEET-PG examination conducted in September out of over 160,000 who appeared.The matter pending before the court has been filed by resident doctors who have challenged a July 29, 2021 notification by the Centre introducing 27% OBC quota and 10% EWS quota in the NEET all-India quota seats. The petitions questioned the basis for applying the EWS quota, and said that such reservation would exceed the 50% benchmark set by the top court in its earlier decisions since there is also 22.5% reservation for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes.In October, the top court raised doubts on whether EWS beneficiaries can be uniformly clubbed together as persons belonging to households with annual earnings below ₹8 lakh without considering the rural-urban divide, purchasing power in different regions, and other factors that vary across states. To quell these doubts, the Centre formed a three-member committee to revisit the criteria for identifying EWS in November, and put the counselling process of Neet-PG seats on hold.The committee, which revisited the January 17, 2019 order passed by the Centre prescribing criteria to identify EWS, concluded that the ₹8 lakh limit is not “over-inclusive”. It, however, omitted the residential asset criterion prescribed under the government notification. The Centre presented the report to the Supreme Court along with its affidavit filed on January 1, supporting the recommendations of the committee.The committee proposed that its recommendations can be implemented from the next admission or advertisement cycle, and that the existing criteria applicable for EWS be followed till then.The resident doctors had gone on strike protesting the delay in NEET-PG counseling. Their 14-day strike ended last Friday after an assurance was given by the Union health ministry to come out with the NEET-PG counselling schedule soon after the hearing in the court on January 6. The federation of resident doctors’ association had even demanded cancellation of the FIRs registered against doctors after they were manhandled by Delhi police while marching to the Supreme Court as part of their protest. This demand was also accepted by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ews-quota-in-medical-seats-supreme-court-to-hear-neet-pg-case-today-101641321367284.html
05-01-2022||India||GitHub row: 18-year-old U'khand woman, Bengaluru engineering student arrested||An 18-year-old woman and a 21-year-old engineering student, who allegedly met on social media due to their common interest in Hindutva ideology and later allegedly collaborated to put up webpages where hundreds of Muslim women were “auctioned”, were arrested on Tuesday.The arrests were made by Mumbai Police, which is probing two such controversial webpages hosted on the code sharing platform, GitHub. The first web page was floated in July 2021 and the second, Bulli Bai, surfaced on January 1. The webpages, which were named after derogatory references to the Muslim community, sparked outrage because hundreds of Muslim women -- most of whom were vocal activists or top professionals -- were listed for “auction” along with their photographs, which were sourced without permission and doctored.Activists pointed out that despite complaints, no action was taken in the July case, and that the pages were meant to demean Muslim women.The man, Vishal Kumar Jha, was allegedly running one of Twitter handles that was used to upload links to the websites, said an officer from the Mumbai cybercrime cell. Singh’s alleged role was not clear.The woman, Shweta Singh, lived in Uttarakhand’s Udham Singh Nagar district with her three siblings and had lost her father to Covid-19 in May last year and her mother to cancer in 2011. She was deeply involved in Hindutva ideology and often posted such content on social media, said a senior Uttarakhand police officer with knowledge of developments.“They both came in contact on the microblogging platform while commenting on a right wing post. Following that, they became friends and shared their contact numbers. They then started speaking to each other and chatting on WhatsApp sharing their common ideology,” said the senior Uttarakhand police officer quoted above, requesting anonymity.“She had no regrets for what she did,” he added.Jha was held in Bengaluru for questioning on Monday and brought to Mumbai in the evening, said joint commissioner of police (crime), Milind Bharambe.”He was questioned and several facts were verified. and after his role was found involved in the crime, he was arrested,” he added.Kumar was remanded to cyber police custody till January 10, the officer said.“There seems to be a much bigger network behind such coordinate crimes and I am confident that Mumbai Police will soon unearth the entire nexus that is enabling such hate crimes against women in our country,” said Maharashtra minister Satej Patil.A Mumbai Police team arrested Singh from Rudrapur city in Uttarakhand’s Udham Singh Nagar district.A second Uttarakhand police officer said the woman hailed from an economically weak background, had lost both her parents and was living with three siblings. “She had passed class 12 examinations but was yet to take admission in the college for higher studies,” said the officer, requesting anonymity.During her questioning, she told the police that she took the help of an acquaintance in Nepal and added that this man -- who she allegedly identified as Giyou -- had uploaded the women’s photos, said the second police officer.The woman was produced before a local court for transit remand, the officer added. The court granted the transit remand of the woman to Mumbai police.Uttarakhand director general of police Ashok Kumar confirmed the development.“Uttarakhand police only provided them (Mumbai police team) assistance in their action by sending a woman constable to arrest the accused. Uttarakhand police didn’t question the accused as the probe is conducted by the Mumbai police,” he said.Jha’s advocate Dinesh Prajapati said, “My client is falsely implicated in the case. During an argument i requested before the court for short police custody which was granted.”On January 2, Mumbai cyber police registered a First Information Report under sections 153A (to punish persons who indulge in wanton vilification or attacks upon the religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc of any particular group or class or upon the founders and prophets of a religion), 153 B (Imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration) 295A, (Deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 354D, (Stalking is unwanted or repeated surveillance by an individual or group towards another person), 509 (Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), 500 (Punishment for defamation) Indian Penal Code along with section 67 Information technology act against unknown people.. The case was based on statements of some women whose pictures were used on the webpage.The same day, Union minister for electronics and information technology Ashwini Vaishnaw said the account of the user who made the webpages had been blocked by GitHub after a government missive.

Five days after it set off, the dream has turned to nightmare, the voyage has been truncated, and the ship has been sent back to Mumbai from Goa, after 66 people, including six crew members tested positive for Covid-19.It was almost as if Murphy (of the famous law) was scripting the story of a cruise liner whose name first made the headlines in October last year following a drug bust during a rave party held aboard the then two-month-old ship. Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan was arrested during the bust, although no drugs were found in his possession and he was subsequently released on bail.The positive testsThe alarm was first sounded when a crew member on board the ship took ill on January 1 and a rapid antigen Covid test was conducted . A positive test prompted more, finding a total of six crew members positive. The ship’s doctor then informed port authorities and the crew members were allowed to disembark and made to isolate at a local hospital at Goa’s port town of Vasco Da Gama.The ship waited at anchorage as authorities scrambled to decide the best way forward before it was decided that the ship be allowed to berth and all 2017 passengers and crew be tested. By Monday afternoon, another 60 people, all passengers, tested positive.The narrative splits at this point.The ship’s handlers, the JM Baxi Group said that the decision to return to Mumbai was taken after some passengers refused to be admitted to a Covid facility in Goa. Meanwhile, other passengers asked why those who tested negative weren’t allowed to disembark and were made to travel back to Mumbai, alongside those who tested positive. “Due to a change in safety protocols with prevailing Covid-19 restrictions and in compliance with government authorities, we will be suspending our sailing...,” the company said in a statement via Twitter.The director general of shipping has now called for an inquiry and port officials have been asked to review Covid-19 protocols.Controversy on boardOver the weekend, videos of angry passengers on board the cruise ship emerged, with apprehensive guests heckling crew members on the confusion in protocols, the need for repeated tests, as well as the confusion over the next steps.The CEO of Waterways Leisure Tourism Pvt Ltd, which runs Cordelia Cruises, Jurgen Bailom, reiterated that all protocols were followed and said that the company went “above and beyond” in its attempt to secure passenger safety. “Ever since our cruise set sail in September 2021 with 1,400 guests on board, all crew members as well as guests have had to undertake a RT-PCR test which is no more than 48 hours prior to boarding. The RT-PCR is mandatory as is being doubly vaccinated for, both, the crew as well as all guests on board. In simple terms, even if one is double vaccinated, one has to undergo the RT-PCR test. Such conditions are more onerous than operation of domestic flights in India yet we adhere to the same by going above and beyond,” Bailom said in a statement.Rejecting allegations of laxity, Bailom said that the crew member who showed mild symptoms had done so very close to departure and was “immediately and safely isolated”.“It was Cordelia Cruises’ exemplary proactiveness in not only conducting the rapid antigen test but also, very responsibly informing the concerned authorities of the incident,” Bailom said, adding that there was a “lack of empathy” from authorities in Goa and that the company received “haphazard instructions” from the state administration.South Goa collector Ruchika Katyal denied this, and said authorities didn’t refuse anyone permission to disembark, and claimed that 13 passengers who tested negative did indeed disembark in Goa.“When the ship informed us about a positive case on board, our only instructions were that those who wish to disembark will have to be tested first. It was the ship’s own decision to have all their passengers tested,” she said.“We had asked the ship to give us a list of passengers who wished to disembark and they gave us a list of 13 passengers who disembarked and went their way after testing negative. There were no instructions that even the negative passengers be disallowed,” Katyal added.She further said that a total of 30 positive passengers were taken off the ship and kept in isolation at a local hospital. “However, of the 30, 24 expressed their desire to be taken back to the ship because they didn’t want to be separated from their families and so they were ferried by ambulances back to the ship,” she said.The cruise linerWaterways Leisure Tourism Pvt Ltd, according to its website, “aspires to promote and drive the cruise culture in India through experiences that are stylish, luxurious and most importantly, inherently Indian”. The company is part of the Dream Hotel Group promoted by NRI hotelier Sant Chatwal.The cruise offers on board a casino, children’s activities, pool, dining and entertainment shows. The activities include movie screenings on deck, magic shows, live musical performances, DJ nights, and stand-up comedy acts. Guests can either book the two-night cruise from Mumbai to Goa or choose from a list of options running up to the entire five nights.The cruise liner, however, is no stranger to controversy. It was from the MV Empress that Aryan Khan, the son of Shah Rukh Khan, was arrested on October 2 by the Narcotics Control Bureau under sections that relate to the use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. In a raid on board the ship as it was moored off the Mumbai shore, NCB seized 13 grams of cocaine, 5 grams of MDMA, 21 grams of marijuana and 22 pills of ecstasy. In a case that grew more and more controversial by the day, Khan, who did not have any drugs on is person, spent 22 days in prison, with opposition parties saying that this was part of a vendetta against the Bollywood superstar and his son.What happens in Mumbai stays in MumbaiOn Tuesday evening, the Empress returned to Mumbai’s Ballard Pier at around 6pm after leaving the Mormugao Port Trust at 11.30pm on Monday. Everyone on board was undergoing tests at the time of going to print. Officials said those testing positive will be shifted to hospitals or Covid care centres, those testing negative will undergo a mandatory one-week home quarantine with a stamp on their hand; however, nobody will be allowed to leave the ship till test results come out on Wednesday.“There are around 2,000 people on-board including the passengers and crew members. We started to collect the samples from 6.30 pm and the entire process of sample collection is likely to take six hours,” said Dr Prajakta Amberkar, Medical Officer of Health (MOH) in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Also on board when the ship docked were 60 positive patients currently; the six others are Goa residents who disembarked before the Empress left MPT for Mumbai.(With inputs from Manish Pathak)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-cruise-liner-s-new-year-dream-turned-into-a-covid-nightmare-101641320883744.html
05-01-2022||India||Omicron variant watch: Fast, even if not as furious, needs disciplined response||How fast does the Omicron variant intrinsically spread, and does it have a significantly altered transmission dynamics?The answers to these questions, still being worked out by scientists, will help determine the steps and degree of compliance required to bend the Omicron wave.We know that the variant spreads rapidly and there are at least three factors that are at play: infections now have a shorter incubation period, infected people have high viral load in upper air passages early on, and even brief exposure may trigger infection.These insights have been gleaned from epidemiological tracking and scientific studies. For instance, the UK’s travel advisory issued in early December cited assessments saying the incubation period – the time between infection and symptoms, which is correlated with contagiousness – has likely dropped from a week to three days or fewer.Lab studies in the recent month have shown the virus multiplies more intensely in the bronchus – the passage leading to the lungs – but less efficiently in the lungs. A University of Hong Kong research found the replication in the bronchus may be 70 times more than the Delta variant.The third factor is perhaps best illustrated in a contact-tracing investigation in Hong Kong. Authorities there found that an Omicron-infected person passed on the disease to a person in the opposite room in a quarantine hotel despite them having never interacted -- corroborated by CCTV evidence.Together, they suggest Omicron’s inherent transmissibility is high. Inherent transmissibility is denoted as the basic reproduction number, or R-nought, or R0 — an estimate of the number of secondary infections each infected person will cause on average.Delta’s R0 is estimated to be 5, and that of the ancestral variant from Wuhan was estimated to be between 2 and 3.Omicron’s R0, according to estimates by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine experts, could be as high as 10.To bring an epidemic under control, the effective R number must be brought down to under 1, which means on average, infected people do not pass it onwards.What will it take to get Omicron’s R to under 1?A team of researchers led by scientists from Germany’s Max Planck Institute in a recently released study have estimated how different measures – vaccination, face covering, social distancing and ventilation – can bring down the effective R number of a Sars-CoV-2 variant, and how many people need to follow it.For Delta, they found that if a region has 70% vaccination coverage, and if three out of 10 people are disciplined on social distancing, using masks and ventilation, it will be enough to contain an outbreak by bringing the R number 1. In the case of schools where children are mostly without doses, the effect of lower vaccination rate can be overcome by carrying out 2-3 tests per week, they said.“If the Omicron variant were to reach R0 = 8, it could still be contained with the synergetic measures outlined above,” they said in their report.But there’s a problem if Omicron has an inherent transmissibility like measles, with an R0 of 12 to 18. “In these cases, higher compliances and testing rates or additional measures like general contact reductions would be required,” they added.In other words, more people -- with almost near-complete compliance -- will need to mask up, maintain distancing, be in well-ventilated spaces and, most of all, take doses of vaccines with high efficacy against disease and transmission.Two years after the pandemic, this might seem like a natural conclusion. But Omicron has eroded vaccine efficacy to staggering levels, making protection from symptomatic infection – and thus transmission – below the standard bar of 50% in the case of all vaccines, without boosting.In India, 65% of the adult population has been fully vaccinated and none of them are yet to receive booster doses.And then there is compliance in masking and social distancing, or a stark lack thereof in the country..The variant is up to 70% less likely to lead to hospitalisation. The number is not 100%, which means even a minute risk of hospitalisation is a significant threat for a populous country like India. As the researchers in Germany show, it is now more crucial than ever for the country to adhere to protective measures and boost its vaccination coverage.
05-01-2022||India||Expert panel recommends phase 3 trial for Bharat Biotech’s intranasal vaccine||An expert panel of the central drugs standard control organisation (CDSCO) on Tuesday recommended the start of phase 3 clinical trials of Bharat Biotech’s intranasal Covid-19 vaccine, officials aware of developments told HT. The CDSCO’s subject expert committee (SEC) made the recommendation to start phase 3 clinical trials for the vaccine as a booster shot. “It also recommended that Covaxin Intranasal be permitted to go in for phase 3 clinical trial,” said a senior central government official aware of the matter, on condition of anonymity. The intranasal vaccine, BBV154, is a novel adenovirus vectored vaccine for the viral infection, and the company applied to the national drugs regulator to also use it as a booster shot for those who have been vaccinated with either Covaxin or Covishield as the primary dose. Salient features of the intranasal vaccine include stimulating a broad immune response – neutralizing IgG, mucosal IgA, and T cell responses; and immune responses at the site of infection (in the nasal mucosa) – essential for blocking both infection and transmission of Covid-19, according to Bharat Biotech, that is developing the vaccine. The company also says that the nasal route has excellent potential for vaccination due to the organised immune systems of the nasal mucosa. The vaccine is easy to administer as it is non-invasive, needle-free, and does not require trained health care workers. According to an earlier company statement, this intranasal vaccine candidate showed unprecedented levels of protection in mice studies. “Our experience in viral vaccines, manufacturing capabilities, and distribution continues to be our strong suit in ensuring safe, efficacious, and affordable vaccines. It is prudent for Bharat Biotech to be involved in diverse but tenable projects to provide a much-needed vaccine against Covid-19 that reaches all citizens of the world,” said Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director, Bharat Biotech, earlier.

According to the Union government’s Co-WIN dashboard, Uttar Pradesh administered 1,309,645 doses (for all categories), the most across the country, followed by West Bengal, which administered 852,938 vaccine doses, and Maharashtra, which gave out 755,620 shots. In UP, out of the total doses administered, 275,097 were given to teenagers. In West Bengal, between 8am and 10pm, 174,013 doses were administered to the 15-18 years category, while in Maharashtra, 247,467 children were given their first doses. “The vaccination exercise as a tool to protect the most vulnerable population groups in the country from Covid-19 continues to be regularly reviewed and monitored at the highest level... The daily vaccination tally is expected to increase with the compilation of the final reports for the day by late tonight,” the statement by the Union health ministry said. In the national capital, on the second day of the vaccination drive, 33,179 children were vaccinated, which was more than Monday’s 20,998. Data shared by Delhi government showed that most teenagers were inoculated in northeast Delhi, with 6,237 first doses being given on Tuesday alone. Southwest district administered 4,402 doses, central Delhi administered 2,028 doses, east Delhi 2,907, New Delhi 2,653 and north Delhi inoculated 1,886 children. A senior official of Delhi government’s health department said that Delhi has made arrangements to vaccinate 300,000 children every day. “We are hoping that the daily vaccination count among children will increase further in the coming days. Most of our centres have been exclusively reserved for children in the 15-18 years age category. In centres where vaccination for general public is on, we have made provisions for a separate entry and exit for this age group, so that it is convenient for them,” the official said.

The TRF claimed responsibility for multiple killings of civilians in Jammu & Kashmir last year. The police did not say whether the two terrorists killed on Tuesday were involved in any of these killings.Following a tip-off, a joint team of the police, the Indian Army and the Central Reserve Police Force launched a search operation at Okay village in Kulgam district on Tuesday. The operation turned into a gun battle in which the two local terrorists associated with TRF were killed, the police said.“The two terrorists, who were killed in the encounter, were linked to Lashkar/TRF and were involved in multiple terror crime related activities,” said Vijay Kumar, inspector general of police in Kashmir.The terrorists were identified as Amir Ahmad Wani of Alamgunj in Shopian, and Sameer Ahmad Khan of Tiken in Pulwama. “As per records, Amir Ahmad was a categorised terrorist and had links with terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba. Sameer Ahmad joined the terror fold recently,” a police spokesperson said. Arms and ammunition, including an AK-47 assault rifle and a pistol, were recovered from their possession.On Monday, two terrorists, including LeT commander Saleem Parray from Hajin in Bandipore district, were shot dead in separate gunfights. The other terrorist killed was identified as Hafiz, alias Hamza.The developments come after six terrorists affiliated with Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), including two Pakistani nationals, were killed in two separate encounters in Jammu and Kashmir’s Anantnag and Kulgam districts last week.The Centre told Parliament in November last year that 40 civilians were killed and 72 injured in Jammu and Kashmir in terror-related incidents. Minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai also said that 35 personnel of security forces, including Jammu and Kashmir Police, were killed in such incidents till November 15.He said the steps taken by the government to protect civilians included proactive operations against terrorists, identification and arrest of “over ground workers”, action against members of banned organisations and coordination meetings among security agencies.BLURBThe news comes a day after top Lashkar commander Saleem Parray was gunned down during an encounter in Srinagar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-terrorists-killed-in-kashmir-s-kulgam-district-101641320586432.html
05-01-2022||India||Indian troops celebrate new year at Galwan Valley||Images of Indian soldiers celebrating new year with the national flag at Galwan Valley in Ladakh were released by the security establishment on Tuesday, a riposte to China playing up the hoisting of its flag by troops in the same region amid a dragging standoff. The images of the Indian soldiers were released three days after China’s state-run media extensively reported on new year celebrations by Chinese troops in Galwan Valley, the scene of a brutal clash between troops of the two nations in June 2020 that left 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops dead. Law minister Kiren Rijiju, who belongs to the border state of Arunachal Pradesh claimed by China, tweeted three photos of “brave Indian Army soldiers” in Galwan Valley on new year. He also posted a brief video of himself spending time with troops of the Assam Regiment and Arunachal Scouts near Bomdila in Arunachal Pradesh, where he said the temperature was minus 8°C. The latest images from the Indian side were apparently meant to reflect the army’s continued presence in Galwan Valley following questions raised by opposition parties about propaganda by China’s state-run media. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had asked the Prime Minister to “break the silence” over Chinese “incursions” at Galwan Valley. One of the images showed some 30 Indian soldiers standing near the tricolour. Another showed the group with the flag and another tricolour flying atop what appeared to be an observation post. A flag of the Indian Army’s Dogra Regiment could also be seen above the post. The Indian side had earlier released photos of troops of the two countries exchanging sweets and greetings on new year at 10 points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), including in Ladakh and Sikkim. The videos shared by China’s state media had not been filmed at either the site of the 2020 skirmish or the two-kilometre buffer zone created at Galwan Valley after the clash, which saw troops from both sides fighting each other with rocks, batons and clubs wrapped in barbed wire, people familiar with developments earlier said. China’s state media had played up a video of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers sending new year greetings from Galwan Valley while standing next to a sign painted on a rock that read “Never yield an inch of land”. India-China relations are at an all-time low due to the standoff in Ladakh along the LAC, which began in May 2020. The deaths at Galwan Valley were the first fatalities on the LAC since 1975. India has accused China of amassing tens of thousands of troops on the LAC without any valid reason, attempting to unilaterally alter the status quo and violating several border management agreements. The renaming of 15 locations in Arunachal Pradesh by China last week and new satellite images showing a bridge being built by the Chinese side to connect both banks of the strategic Pangong Lake in Ladakh to facilitate faster troop movements reflect the continuing tensions between the two countries. Such “invented names” would not alter the state’s status as an integral part of India, the external affairs ministry said, responding to the renaming of places in Arunachal Pradesh. Though India and China pulled back frontline troops at Pangong Lake and Gogra last year, they have not been able to move forward with disengagement at several other friction points such as Depsang. The last round of military talks in October ended with the Indian Army saying its “constructive suggestions” were not agreed to by the Chinese side, which is yet to respond on the holding of the next round of talks between army commanders.
