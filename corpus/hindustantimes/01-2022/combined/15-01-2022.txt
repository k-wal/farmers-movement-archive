15-01-2022||Lucknow||Azam Khan’s son released from Sitapur jail after 23 months||Lucknow : Abdullah Azam, son of senior Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Azam Khan, was released on bail from Sitapur jail on Saturday evening, after almost 23 months of imprisonment. “I will only say one thing that oppression will end after March 10 and the oppressor will also be removed from the throne,” Abdullah told reporters outside the jail, signalling towards the defeat of the BJP in upcoming assembly elections. Abdullah waved to his supporters waiting outside the gates of Sitapur jail before entering his vehicle. Azam’s younger son Abdullah was booked in 43 cases, ranging from theft to extortion and forgery, along with his father. Abdullah has been granted bail in all of these cases by lower courts in Rampur. The release orders following bail were sent to Sitapur jail by late Saturday afternoon that cleared the way for Abdullah’s release. Azam’s wife Tazeen Fatima, who is also a co-accused in many of these cases, was released from Sitapur jail in December 2020. Meanwhile, Azam Khan, who has more than 70 cases lodged against him on similar charges, is yet to get bail in all of them. Abdullah won from Swar constituency on SP ticket in 2017 assembly election. However, hearing a case against him, the Allahabad high court in 2019 annulled his election as an Uttar Pradesh MLA on the ground that he was underage and not qualified to fight the poll in 2017. The troubles for Azam Khan and his family started in 2017 when the BJP came to power in UP. Just a few months after the election, 10 cases were lodged against Azam Khan in revenue board by the then district magistrate of Rampur for procuring 104 acres of land belonging to people of Schedule Caste “against rules”. In 2019, over 70 cases were lodged against Azam Khan and his family members for forgery, theft, extortion and other crimes within a few months. Majority of the cases pertained to encroachment of land that was usurped in the construction of the Jauhar University, of which Azam Khan is chairman. Azam Khan was also accused of stealing old books from a government school and keeping them in his library. Acting on the compliant, police raided Mumtaz library located inside Jauhar Ali University and recovered over 2000 old books from there. Considering the number of cases against him, the district administration also named him as land mafia in Rampur. Khan criticised these cases at first but later succumbed to the mounting pressure and repeated court notices. He also tried to get anticipatory bail in many cases but in vain. Eventually in February 2020, Azam, his wife and son Abdullah Azam surrendered before an MP-MLA court in Rampur. On the court’s order the trio was later shifted to Sitapur jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/azam-khan-s-son-released-from-sitapur-jail-after-23-months-101642270934805.html

15-01-2022||Lucknow||Election Commission notice to SP over poll code violation||Lucknow: The Election Commission of India issued notice to the Samajwadi Party on Saturday over violation of model code of conduct (MCC) and Covid-19 guidelines in an event organized by the party on Friday. The poll panel has directed the Samajwadi Party to explain its stand regarding the violation of MCC and Covid- 19 guidelines within 24 hours of the receipt of the notice, failing which the Commission will take appropriate decision in the matter without further reference to the SP. In a letter to the general secretary of the SP, ECI secretary Ajoy Kumar said the Commission had announced the schedule for UP assembly election on January 8. The Commission had also issued a broad guideline with regard to conduct of the election during Covid-19 pandemic, imposing ban on physical rallies, road shows, pad yatras, cycle/bike/ vehicle rallies and processions till January 15, he said. Taking cognizance of the media reports of violation of the Commission’s Covid guidelines in a public gathering in the office compound of Samajwadi Party on Vikramaditya Marg, Lucknow the Commission sought report from UP Chief Electoral Officer (CEO). The UP CEO in his report sent on January 14 informed that the existing Covid protocol had been violated by organizing public gathering in the SP office premises in the name of virtual rally. An FIR under sections 188,269,270 and 341 IPC, 1860, section 54 of Disaster management Act, 2005 and section 3 of Pandemic Act, 1897 had been lodged against 2000-2500 political functionaries of the SP on Friday, he said.

15-01-2022||Other||Gurugram: Drive-through sessions, special camps planned to increase vax pace||In a bid to increase the pace of Covid-19 vaccination for the 15-18 age group and administering booster dose to senior citizens, the district health department has planned initiatives such as drive-through vaccination sessions and special camps at various societies. On Sunday, two drive-through vaccination sessions will be conducted in the district from 10am onwards at Cyber Hub and Ambience Mall, officials from the district health department said. Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “In the drive-through vaccination session at Cyber Hub, booster dose of Covishield will be given to health care workers, frontline workers and senior citizens. Covaxin doses will be administered to the children in the 15-18 age group. For both categories, 300 doses each will be available and registration on the CoWIN portal is mandatory.” The officials said that a drive-through vaccination will also be conducted at Ambience Mall where both Covishield and Covaxin would be available for booster dose, while only Covaxin for vaccination of teenagers.The vaccination pace for the 15-18 age group, which started on January 3, has reduced since the first week due to a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases in the district. The administering of booster dose to senior citizens has also been slow since it started on January 10. In the 15-18 age group, in the first week daily average vaccination was close to 10,000 doses which has now reduced to 2,000 doses, according to an official data. For booster dose, the daily vaccination has not gone beyond 2,000 despite double the slots being available, the data shows. The officials said that they have asked health care workers to visit various societies to find out the teenagers in the 15-18 age bracket and senior citizens who are eligible for booster dose, and motivate them to come to the nearest vaccination centres. “We are also planning to set up special camps at some societies to increase the vaccination pace for these two categories. We are hoping that with these measures, the pace may increase in the coming days,” said Singh.“For vaccination of children, we have found that as all schools are not open, it is impacting the vaccination pace. We have asked our teams to conduct mop up rounds to cover maximum possible children. We are also trying to reach out to children who come under the category of persons without identity,” said Singh. On Saturday, a total of 16,620 doses of Covid-19 vaccine were administered, including 6,978 first doses, 7,935 second doses and 1,707 precautionary (booster) doses. With this, over 4.63 million doses have been administered in the Gurugram district till now.

15-01-2022||Delhi||North MCD likely to de-seal over 2,000 factories shut before Covid||NEW DELHI: The Standing Committee of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation has asked the factory licensing department to submit its updated report on over 2,000 factories, which were sealed before the Covid-19 outbreak due to technical and revenue issues, with officials saying that it will consider de-sealing them.North MCD officials said the issue was discussed during a meeting of the standing committee -- chaired by its chairman Jogi Ram Jain -- on Thursday, where councillors noted that sealing has added to the woes, especially since many businesses have suffered losses due to the pandemic.A senior North MCD official said that the 2,000 factories were listed as “illegal factory clusters”, mainly involved in garment manufacturing, jeans dyeing, plywood work, furniture making, cardboard work and engineering/welding work, in December 2019. “These units were running from residential areas despite the fact that the Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIIDC) had allotted only three hubs in the city as ‘notified industrial areas’, i.e. Narela, Bawana and Wazirpur,” he said, on condition of anonymity. Standing committee member and BJP councillor from Pitampura, Anju Jain, was among those who pushed for de-sealing the factories. “Even those factories, which have been shifted by their owners to the alternative plots allotted to them by the Civic body in the notified industrial areas, should also be de-sealed. Granting them permission to run the factories will help bring the economy back on track,” she said. Echoing similar views, AAP councillor Vicky Gupta also said that the factories must be de-sealed if they have adhered to the norms. “Many such units have applied under the household industries category to get relief. The power of granting household industry licence has been devolved from the high-powered committee chaired by Delhi government officials to respective municipal bodies after necessary changes in the Master Plan 2021. The civic body must initiate the disposal of their applications,” he said. Meanwhile, an officer from the licensing department of the North MCD said that since these units have been sealed by monitoring committee, the same panel has to take a call on the issue. “Orders from any other department will be null and void. The chairman of our standing committee has asked us to submit a report about sealed and opened industrial units within 15 days, we are already on it,” said the offical, asking not to be named. When contacted, Jogi Ram Jain said that a decision on de-sealing the factories can only be taken after getting the detailed report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/north-mcd-likely-to-de-seal-over-2-000-factories-shut-before-covid-101642269256016.html

Of the addition in green belt, 5.57 sq km is open forest cover in the district since the last survey carried out in 2019, the report said. “A major reason for increase in open forest is the ‘environmentally-sensitive’ citizens of Pune who are taking initiative to plant on their own,” said Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forest. “Pune district also follows ‘Tri+Party’ agreement, where the forest department along with a non-profit organisation and a private organisation undergoes an agreement to plant trees under their annual CSR programme. Recently, we have planted 100,000 trees in Pune,” he said. Union environment minister Bhupendra Yadav released the report, which is the 17th edition of ISFR.

While Mumbai and other MMR cities such as Thane, Navi Mumbai, Mira-Bhayander, Kalyan-Dombivali have reported a substantial drop in the cases over the last seven days, other states cities including Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad and rural areas reported markable surges. Cases in districts like Pune (4,437 to 10,047), Nagpur (697 to 1,698), Nashik (810 to 1,939), Aurangabad (158 to 657) rose significantly in the last one week between January 7 and 14. On Saturday, Pune district logged 10,197, the second-highest in the state after Mumbai. Nagpur and Nashik districts reported 2,134 and 1,915 cases respectively.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, a member of the union government-appointed task force said that the cases in the rural parts of the state will keep rising over the next few weeks. “As seen in the first two waves, the surge will shift from the metropolis to other parts in phases. It started from Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru and spread to other smaller cities. I do not think Mumbai has attained its peak and it could be in the next 8-10 days.”Dr Salunkhe said that there could be more migration to cities during this wave because the cases and hospitalisation in rural parts will be more than in urban parts. “The vaccination rate in cities like Mumbai and Pune is fabulous, so is the ramping up of the health infrastructure. On the contrary, many rural areas lag on both fronts. This will result in more hospitalisation in rural areas, though severity will remain low compared to the earlier wave. As such there will be migration of the patients for the hospitalisation from rural areas where the health infrastructure has been augmented significantly,” he added.According to an official from the health department, even the rural areas have been prepared to tackle the third wave surge. He said that all the district collectors have been directed to increase the vaccination rate and simultaneously get the health machinery prepared. The officer said that the staggered surge in the cases will help them in handling the pressure on health infrastructure by concentrating on areas with high cases.The daily positivity rate in the state stood at 21.21% while the daily case fatality rate reported was 0.054%. State’s overall CFR stands at 1.97%, while recovery rate stands at 94.28%.

15-01-2022||Pune||Airport in Pune district will be reality, don’t want to speak about site: Ajit Pawar||PUNE Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday expressed confidence of Pune district getting an international airport despite the ministry of defence (MoD) cancelling the no objection certificate (NOC) for the proposed new airport site of Purandar that was finalised by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. “Airport will be constructed in Pune district. I do not want to speak anything regarding the site because it will be assumed in a different way. The state government is focussed on constructing an international airport in the district. I can tell you with total belief that we will build an international airport for Pune residents,” said Pawar, who was in the city for Covid review meeting on Saturday. “The airport plan will also be useful for the residents of Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and Ahmednagar. It will have two runways – one for landing and one for take off, and the central government will also play its role in setting up the airport,” Pawar said. Civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia in a written response to MP Girish Bapat on December 31, 2021, said, “The MoD had given the NOC (no objection certificate) on August 12, 2021, with certain conditions for the new proposed site, later it cancelled the NOC vide their communication dated September 29, 2021.” However, leaders from opposition party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – MP Girish Bapat, Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil — have also given thumbs up for the airport at Purandar. “The airport is still possible in Purandar if the MVA government decides to opt for the original site. The proposal of the old site had lapsed after the current government wanted a new site,” Patil had told reporters on January 8. Bapat had said “The letter only states about withdrawing clearance to the resubmitted proposal with changes. The old proposal still stands and all the clearances obtained so far are also valid. If everyone pushes for the original proposal then, it will happen.” The ministry of defence is yet to make any comment about the site. Meeting between the state government officials, the Pune Airport Advisory Committee and the ministry of defence is expected to take place soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/airport-in-pune-district-will-be-reality-don-t-want-to-speak-about-site-ajit-pawar-101642267814483.html

Dams have enough water so we decided to keep water supply as it is for rural areas, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune city.”“Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner Vikram Kumar have promised to take various steps to save water and we will support their efforts,” he said.Mohol said, “Guardian minister has accepted our demand and did not cut water supply for the city. PMC has conveyed that additional villages got merged in the city. Even PMC is taking enough steps to stop leakages. The 24x7 water scheme is in progress and once it is complete, PMC will require less water.”The irrigation department was aggressive and had put its views before the canal committee. The irrigation department blamed that PMC is using additional water than its limit.Even by considering the existing population of additional villages, PMC consumes more water, said officials of the irrigation department.“We have denied all the allegations,” said Mohol.Pawar, meanwhile, said, “We want to add Mulshi dam’s water for drinking purposes for both Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. Earlier electricity was generated through hydro energy, but now there are various options to generate electricity than water. Urban areas are increasing and so is the water demand.

15-01-2022||Pune||Two arrested in ₹15 crore Barshi stock scam; lookout notice issued against main accused||Pune: The Solapur police are investigating a stock market fraud which they believe could go up to more than ₹15 crore, involving Fate family in Barshi. The police have arrested the main accused Vishal Fate’s father Ambadas and brother Vaibhav in connection with the fraud. The other family members identified as Vishal, his mother Alka and wife Radhika are absconding even as teams of Economic Offences Wing (EOW) have been sent to nab them from their hideout. Vishal’s close friend Deepak Babasaheb Ambare (37), a resident of Barshi, lodged an FIR against him at the Barshi police station. Taking into consideration the large number of investors being duped, the Solapur police have decided to form a special investigation team (SIT) to arrest the culprits and eight squads have been formed to investigate the case. According to the police, a number of prominent personalities, including mediapersons, doctors and professionals have been duped with promise of attractive returns on investments reportedly thrice the amount invested. Vishal’s father, a retired professor from Barshi college, along with Vaibhav was produced before the local court which remanded them into four days of police custody. Ambare in his FIR stated that he had met Vishal in 2019 after which both became friends. Vishal used to do stock trading and showed him the attractive returns he earned while investing in the stock market. He later established three companies in the name of his father, mother and brother for stock trading and accepted huge amounts from different investors in Barshi promising them exorbitant returns. He accepted the money in the form of RTGS, cash and cheque basis. Addl SP Himmat Sonawane said, “We received a complaint on January 13 regarding Vishal Fate, the main accused who promised thrice the amount as returns to customers. Based on the complaint, we have booked him and four of his family members under IPC 409, 417 and 420 and 34 and MPID Act 1999 section 3. Currently, the scam involving over ₹5.65 crore has been detected and we believe it could run into crores of rupees more. There is a possibility of a large number of persons being duped by the accused. Vishal Fate disappeared with the money on January 9 and all his accounts have zero balance. A lookout notice has been issued against him and his wife,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/two-arrested-in-rs-15-crore-barshi-stock-scam-lookout-notice-issued-against-main-accused-101642266858203.html

The CS had a long interaction with the staff and doctors in the integrated Covid command centre trying to understand its functioning. He made random calls to two Covid patients from there through Dr Seema Singh and knew about their well-being. He asked officials to ensure that not only medicine kits were delivered to Covid patients at their home but they should also be briefed properly as to how to take medicines. During inspection of the smart city office in Lalbagh, the CS obtained information about the integrated traffic management system (ITMS) running the city’s traffic system. He asked officials to organise events aimed at making children aware of the hi-tech traffic management system. “Organise study tours of school students,” he told officials. Visiting the Sugarcane Research Institute, Telibagh, Mishra inspected the hybrid agriculture model that seeks to increase farmers’ income. The scientists there told the CS that the hybrid model had immense potential to bring qualitative change in the income of farmers.

15-01-2022||Other||{Kerala nun rape case} Outrage mounts over acquittal; activists launch online campaign||Thiruvananthapuram A day after a Kottayam court acquitted former Bishop of Jalandhar, Franco Mullakal, 57, the lone accused in the Kerala nun rape case, women activists, activists and legal experts have criticised the verdict, claiming that it casts aspersions on the victim. Former Kerala high court judge, justice Kamal Pasha, said the verdict was a clear case of “miscarriage of justice”; he has also questioned some of the verdict’s findings. He added that the Supreme Court has clearly stated that an accused can be convicted on the testimony of the victim, if she is found to be credible and trustworthy.The case surfaced in June 2018 after a 43-year-old nun, also a mother superior belonging to the Missionaries of Jesus congregation based in Punjab, filed a police complaint in Kottayam saying Mullakal had raped her several times between 2014 and 2016. The complaint was filed in June 2018, but it took the police three months to arrest Mullakal in September.PROSECUTION TO MOVE HCThe prosecution team is mulling its options, including filing an appeal against the verdict in the high court. A part of this team, former superintendent of police S Harishankar, who supervised the investigation for three years, said, “We will approach the high court in a couple of days.” In an outburst against the verdict on Friday, he had said that “it was unprecedented in legal history”. A defence lawyer said this statement would be brought to the notice of the HC registrar. Some activists have started an online campaign “Avalkoppam” (with her) to vent their anger and outrage. While asking the government to move the HC, activists say the Covid situation is preventing them from carrying out candle-light protest marches. Mullakal visited his relatives and Kerala Congress leader PC George on Saturday. George, who has been backing Mullakal, said, “A move to dent the powerful church was foiled by believers.”WHAT THE COURT HAS SAID“There are exaggerations and embellishments in the victim’s statement. Police failed to seize the mobile phone of the victim, as it would have given some input into alleged messages sent by the accused. The in-fighting... of the nuns and desire for power and position to control congregation is evident,” additional district and sessions judge G Gopakumar says in his 289-page order; the victim’s statements were contradictory and corroborative evidences were missing, the judge added.“This is a case in which grain and chaff are inextricably mixed up... she made every attempt to hide certain facts. It is evident that the victim was swayed under the influence of others, who had vested interests in the matter,” the order says, adding, “This court is unable to place reliance on the solitary testimony of the victim and hold the accused guilty of offences charged against him.”“The court has agreed to all contentions put forward by the defence; the prosecution was also overconfident. It is a disappointing verdict for all suffering women,” said Joemon Puthanpurakkal, who had fought Sister Abhaya case for 28 years, where Abhaya’s body was found in a convent well; finally, a nun and a priest were convicted. “Soon after she filed a police complaint, there was a concerted social media attack on her by people close to the church. Many theories and stories were floated, once she filed a complaint. Sad, the court also fell into the defence trap,” said Sister Jesme, who came out of the congregation questioning the alleged ill-treatment by church authorities. She claimed that according to the court’s interpretation the relationship between the victim and accused was consensual, which was shocking.

However, out of these only 37 showed mild symptoms and the rest did not show any symptoms at all.Expressing concern over the rise in Covid-19 cases in Pune and the rest of Maharashtra, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday said that as of now no new restrictions will be brought in but a decision will be taken next week depending upon the scenario. Pawar was chairing the weekly Covid review meeting.Pawar also said that more police personnel from both Pune and Mumbai are also reporting to be Covid-19 positive as recent events like at Bhima Koregaon saw many police personnel on duty for safety and vigilance. As of Saturday, Pune saw a total of 465 Covid-19 positive cases among police staff who have all been vaccinated. Out of the 465, 47 were senior level officers, and also a few have been hospitalised. Pawar also said that the policemen are now preparing to take the third dose also known as the precautionary dose which has already started in the city.Pawar reiterated that although the number of new cases is rising the rate of hospitalisation remains low. However, as per the data from the district health office, in the past week between December 30 and January 5, out of the over 11.000 active cases, 905 were hospitalised between January 6 and 12, out of the 38,000 active cases the number of hospitalisations has also gone up with 1,752 admitted due to Covid-19 .

However, 95% of the active Covid-19 cases currently in the district are under home isolation.BOXNew restrictions if state oxygen consumptions go beyond 700 mt dailyPawar said, “The only reason why cases are surging is because people are not following the Covid-19 protocols. We have also released funds from the state disaster response force for the pending payments if any towards the staff of the jumbo hospital in the city. If required, we will reopen the jumbo facilities. However as of now, despite the surge in cases, the rate of hospitalisation remains low. However, if the cases continue to surge and the oxygen consumption in the state goes beyond 700 metric tons daily, there will be new restrictions.”As of now, in the past week, the district’s oxygen consumption is close to 80 metric ton daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/omicron-cases-51-fully-vaccinated-only-37-reported-symptoms-101642265656462.html

More than 40 people had died allegedly after consuming spurious liquor in a month since Diwali last year in four districts of north Bihar — East Champaran, West Champaran, Muzaffarpur and Samastipur. Allies trade fireMeanwhile, state BJP chief and West Champaran MP Sanjay Jaiswal on Friday once called for a review of prohibition law, saying the legislation may be “well intentioned but its implementation had brought shame to the state”. He was reacting to a social media post of by JD(U) spokesman Abhishek Jha, who had questioned Jaiswal’s visit to the houses of victims hooch tragedy in the latter’s home constituency. BJP and JD(U) are constituents of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar. JD(U) spokesman Rajiv Ranjan sought to blame those opposing the liquor ban. “Such incidents are abetted by elements who are utterly disappointed by the liquor law. So far as the state BJP chief’s assertion is concerned, I hope leaders of alliance abide by the coalition dharma and help the government enforce the law with full firmness. After all, they too have taken a pledge to make Bihar liquor free,” he said. Congress leader and former MLC Ajay Kumar Singh it was high time the liquor law is reviewed to save the poor who generally fall prey to spurious liquor. “Leaders of the ruling parties have openly said good brands of liquor are easily available in black market to those who can afford it.

15-01-2022||Mumbai||CM faces heat over absence from office, BJP says he should handover charge||Mumbai Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who is recuperating after spine surgery, is again facing the heat of his long absence from office from the opposition BJP. After Thackeray skipped an online meeting convened by Prime minister Narendra Modi on Covid on January 13 citing health reasons, the BJP has remarked that the state does not have a full-time chief minister for the past 70 days and he must hand over charge to someone else till he recovers. Thackeray’s absence from the recently concluded winter session of the state legislature has also been cited by the BJP.Thackeray, who had spine surgery in the second week of November 2021, has been recuperating since. Though he started virtual meetings (besides charing cabinet meetings in December) from January 1, his daily meetings or reviews of various departments have not restarted so far. “The state does not have a full-time chief minister for the last 70 days. The chief minister could not attend the meeting convened by prime minister Narendra Modi through video conferencing on the Covid-19 situation in the country. The health minister Rajesh Tope said that he (Thackeray) cannot sit for two or two-and-a-half hours at a stretch in a place. Therefore, till he recovers, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray must hand over the responsibility of the post,” Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said in Kolhapur.Thackeray, according to party insiders, has been advised by his doctors to not sit at a stretch which could strain his neck and back again. Patil said that when the third wave of Covid infections is in Maharashtra, missing such “crucial” meetings is not appropriate. Reacting to the criticism, Shiv Sena leader and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said that Thackeray’s health is much better now. “Yes, he did not participate in the meeting. Someday even the prime minister will not attend meetings. There may have been some other work. Health minister, who heads the department, was present in the meeting,” said Raut.Last month during the winter session, the state BJP chief had said that he won’t be surprised if Thackeray’s wife Rashmi’s name crops up for the chief minister post. The statement invited ire from the Shiv Sena leaders. Subsequently, a BJP functionary Jiten Gajaria posted a photo of Rashmi Thackeray, who is inactive in politics, with a caption that said ‘Marathi Rabri Devi’. The Mumbai Police called Gajaria over the objectionable social media post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cm-faces-heat-over-absence-from-office-bjp-says-he-should-handover-charge-101642261814490.html
15-01-2022||Mumbai||Air at 6 junctions in Thane city polluted with AQI 201-240||The air you breathe in at six of the major junctions in Thane city is polluted, revealed the annual pollution report for the year 2020-21 published by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC).The air quality was measured at 21 junctions in the city. While six were in the polluted category with Air Quality Index ranging from 201-240, 14 others had moderate air quality ranging from 101-200. The data was measured in 2021 and states the closing down of local trains leading to increase in road travel as one of the major reasons for the air pollution. Apart from this, the ongoing construction works of bridges, road widening and Metro line 4 are also some of the reasons cited in the study.The annual pollution data revealed that while the air quality was better during the lockdown, the quality deteriorated after the unlock. Teen Hath Naka, Shilphata, Retibunder, Castle Mill, Balkum and Mumbra Fire Centre are some of the most polluted junctions in the city. The Air Quality Index of these junctions is between 200 and 240. An officer from TMC said, “With the train services hit in the lockdown, most people chose to travel by roads. Even after the train services resumed, many still preferred private vehicles or road travel to the crowded locals. This has led to traffic jams at some of the major junctions like Teen Hath Naka, Shilphata and Castle Mill, increasing the air pollution levels.”As per the RTO records, the vehicular population in Thane city has increased by around one lakh vehicles, from 22,17,699 in 2019-20 to 23,13,941. Out of these 13,41,544 are two wheelers while 4,77,797 are private cars and 45,512 are jeeps.The officer added that apart from an increase in vehicles on the roads, the ongoing bridges, road widening and metro projects too are adding to the city’s pollution. The dust on the roads, vehicular emissions, industrial emissions, diesel generator burning of farm stubbles, construction waste and domestic fuel are some of the other causes of pollution, as per the study of the pollution department.The corporation claimed that it has made a plan to reduce particulate matter by 20% to 30% till 2024.Nagesh Tekale, a city-based environmentalist, said, “Most of these junctions also have high rises adjoining the highways, so the air has no place for movement. Thus, the particulate matter and the pollution remain at the junction for long. There is also a need to change the signal system as people should get some warning when the signal turns green so they can switch off the vehicles instead of keeping them on. Regular misting or spraying of water on the roads also should be undertaken as it reduces the particulate pollutant in the air.”He added that the potholes and bad conditions of the roads also add to air pollution.57% increase in particulate pollutants during DiwaliThe level of Repairable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) has increased by 57% during Diwali, as per the report. While the RSMP level was 133ug/m3 in Diwali 2020, the levels were as high as 233ug/m3 in Diwali 2021. The reason, claimed the pollution department, must be the increase in use of noise-free crackers as the noise emitting crackers are banned by the government.Most polluted junctions in Thane city Junctions: Air Quality Index Teen Hath Naka 236 (Polluted) Shilphata 230 (Polluted) Retibunder 227 (Polluted) Castle Mill 220 (Polluted) Mumbra Fire Centre 218 (Polluted) Balkum Naka 201 (Polluted) Shastri Nagar Naka 199 (Moderate) Waghbil Naka 197 (Moderate) TMCs plan to reduce pollution by 2024 •More e-buses and e-charging stations•Wider roads which will reduce traffic and emissions•Green buffer zone and cycle tracks along the traffic corridors •Water fountains at 20 junctions to generate mist in the air •Seven new dust sweeping machines added to the fleet

15-01-2022||Mumbai||Kharegaon ROB in Kalwa inaugurated; motorists heave sigh of relief||Thousands of commuters and pedestrians who have been forced to cross the Kharegaon level-crossing can now heave a sigh of relief. The Kharegaon Rail Over Bridge was finally inaugurated on Saturday after missing several deadlines.The inauguration, however, was surrounded by a lot of political drama with both NCP and Shiv Sena leaders taking credit for the work.The issue of the bridge was stuck for over two decades owing to several permissions from various authorities. The bridge was first proposed in 2000, approved in 2008 and the work began in 2014.The ₹38Cr ROB was proposed to close the railway gate at Kharegaon, which the residents of Kalwa had to cross to reach Kalwa Railway Station, leading to accidents. The motorists, too, had to wait for a long while to cross this railway line. The ROB is constructed by Thane Municipal Corporation and the Railway authorities together.The bridge was inaugurated by Thane Guardian Minister, Eknath Shinde, and State Housing Minister, Jitendra Awhad. Awhad said, “The real development in Kalwa began in 2009 when I was elected as an MLA here. Till then, there was not even a proper road in Kharegaon. Now there are no potholes on the roads in Kalwa. We have set an example through the development in Kalwa.”Shinde added, “Taking the credit of the bridge should be avoided as every party and every agency has worked towards completion of the bridge. The important thing is people now have the bridge which will save hundreds of lives every year. We have never stopped funds for the development of Kalwa and Mumbra. Funds were provided without thinking about who is in power in these suburbs.”
15-01-2022||Pune||Delta still dominant strain, Omicron slowly gaining pace: health dept||PUNE Based on the genome sequencing of over 4,200 RT-PCR positive samples, the state health department officials and experts believe that Delta still continues to dominate the infection while Omicron is slowly gaining pace.Despite the surge in cases, rate of hospitalisation has been low which could possibly be because the vaccines could be preventing severity of symptoms, experts have said. However, with Delta still in dominance, better planning with regards to availability of beds, oxygen and further vaccination strategy is crucial.The state in its letter dated January 14, to all district collectors and administrators noted that in the last three weeks the surge in the new Covid-19 cases was reported mainly in Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Palghar, Pune and Nagpur. The state has also observed of the 2,40,133 active Covid-19 cases reported as of January 12 this year, only 9.1% or 21,783 had to be hospitalised while the rest are in home isolation. Among the hospitalised patients, 74.2% have mild symptoms and only 2.3% needed ICU/ Oxygen support and 700 patients or 0.29% are on ventilators.The state has also stated that since November 1, 2021, out of the 4,265 RTPCR positive samples that have been sent for whole genomic sequencing, results are available in 4,201 cases. Out of available results Omicron has been detected in 1,367 cases which is only in 32% of the cases while in 68% cases reported Delta variant of Covid is still prevalent. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary wrote that low rate of admissions show that better vaccination is preventing serious illness in Covid infection, and so above observations should be taken into consideration with proper perspective of circulating Delta variant and vaccination cover.Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, head, Microbiology Department at BJ Medical College said, “As per the latest data slowly and steadily Omicron is replacing Delta and its variants. However, this is not the case for all of Maharashtra. Most of the samples that are being sequenced at BJ Medical College, which are mostly samples that are from Pune and Mumbai. Soon enough we will also be sequencing samples from across all the districts, at least 100 samples, the results of which will be published by the end of January as it takes time to run the samples for genome sequencing.”The state wrote that “…But still above observations can help us in our planning and strategy to fight Covid. The availability of good quality data to know actual bed occupancy and utilisation of oxygen beds, ICU and ventilators becomes very important. We need to have a clear plan with a clearly scalable strategy, if the need arises. Till that time, we can probably use our energy and resources to better monitor the cases under home isolation and create awareness about signs & symptoms, when the home isolated patient should seek the care in hospital and rapidly increase coverage of Covid vaccination.Earlier this week, Commissioner Pune division, Saurabh Rao during an interview with Hindustan Times said the fatality rate of Covid-19 is very low right now as most positive thing of the current wave is that the infection is not affecting lungs. One reason, according Rao, has been that in the present scenario, both Omicron and Delta are affecting people. “As per the virus behaviour, it is predicted that in the later part of the wave, Omicron will replace Delta completely and the fatality rate may again go down,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/delta-still-dominant-strain-omicron-slowly-gaining-pace-health-dept-101642257680118.html

In his PIL, Kadam has stated that in the year 1999, the city had more than 250 licensed stamp vendors, but the number drastically went down after many of them surrendered their licenses and stopped vending stamp papers, as they were either prosecuted or apprehended prosecution for selling counterfeit stamps in the fake stamp paper scam involving Abdul Karim Laadsab Telgi.In the backdrop of the scam, in March 2004, the government took a policy decision to grant stamp vending licenses only to institutions like banks, post offices. The PIL, however, points out that while hardly any license was issued to any such institution in Mumbai, the Additional Controller of Stamps in Mumbai closed down 8 government-run stamp selling counters, resultantly today the city has only 13 licensed vendors - 12 individuals and a bank run by Mantralaya employees.Kadam has alleged that the union of the 12 licensed vendors have “influenced” the office of the Collector of Stamps and brought about the situation in order to keep the income from 3℅ commission on sale of stamped papers and adhesive stamps, especially the stamps of denomination of ₹100 and ₹500, which are frequently required and used by the general public.According to the PIL, the sale of these two stamped papers have gone to the extent of ₹100 crore annually, but in 2020 - being a Covid pandemic year, the sale was limited to ₹65.68 crore. Alleging that the sale of stamp papers in Mumbai has been deliberately kept in limited hands, the petitioner lawyer has also stressed upon the need for an independent inquiry in the entire episode.The PIL also highlighted that under the high court’s directives of December 2014, 13 stamp papers vends were started by advocates associations at various courts in Mumbai, but those counters have also been indirectly compelled to close down since 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-to-state-respond-to-pil-over-shortage-of-stamp-papers-in-mumbai-101642255573960.html
15-01-2022||Delhi||From Tambola to Ludo: #WeekendCurfew scene just got exciting!||As you wonder how to keep yourself upbeat while you stay indoors during the weekend curfew and wait for the number of Covid-19 cases to come down again, here’s some inspo from your neighbouring societies. Utilising the time to interact with each other on a playful note, many society groups and Residents’ Welfare Associations are reviving their game sessions that had become a hit during the last two Covid-19 waves too. From Tambola to Ludo, there are quite a few options that are adding thrill to the otherwise boring evenings. “In our Attraction Family Group, we’ve started virtual Tambola and Ludo sessions. We have reserved the slot from 5pm to 6pm, but if the curfew continues for longer, we might start a late night slot too,” says Shikha Ahuja, a resident of Shalimar Bagh.Explaining how they play virtually, among the society members, Ahuja adds: “For Ludo, we make different chat rooms on an online app, which is accessible for four players to play at a time. For Tambola, we have a WhatsApp group where I take pictures of the tickets and send them for a nominal price to those who want to play. Once the players have saved their tickets, we start the game. To draw the numbers randomly, I use an app, and as soon as the number appears on my screen, I write it on the group. Anyone who manages to scratch the numbers in one row or crack a full house first, is asked to upload the picture. The prize money is transferred to the winner then. ” Pitampura-based Kriti Singhal, who runs a youth community, is also organising a number of exciting activities for residents of her society. “Besides games, we have also planned some other activities such as virtual satsangs. And weekend curfew is the best time to play treasure hunt virtually! This is arranged in a way that it becomes possible to play within the house, by hunting for items based on the clues we give online. Recently, we also played a Lohri-themed game where the families competed to show who possessed the maximum number of Lohri essentials such as rewari, peanut, dhol, etc,” says Singhal.Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/from-tambola-to-ludo-weekendcurfew-scene-just-got-exciting-101642254915402.html

HT has seen a copy of the inspection report.According to the 2012 census, Sarvodaya Enclave had 787 trees, with the figure dropping to 731 trees in 2019, despite 21 new trees being planted. The field sheets had information on each street of the neighbourhood, along with characteristics of the trees, including the species, girth, location, height, health, as well as ground and soil conditions.“The field staff of the south forest division verified the field sheets of the 2012 census report by conducting a physical re-census on the ground and also using satellite imagery to aid in the process. The field sheets of both censuses [2012 and 2019] were acquired from the aforesaid trust. The ground verification revealed that instead of the earlier number of 77 trees allegedly missing/alleged felled as per a complaint dated December 8, 2020, 143 trees were found to be missing on site,” said the inspection report, which found 94 missing trees on land under the South Delhi civic body, and 32 trees under PWD’s jurisdiction. The remaining were part of private properties.The species of missing trees include Gular, Amaltas, Shahtoot, Ashok, Gulmohar, Peepal, Harsingar, Belpatra, Champa and Kadi patta species.The HC last year ordered the South Delhi municipal body to free trees in Vasant Vihar of concrete. HT in December 2020 reported that of the 4,993 trees on the streets of Vasant Vihar, 3,859 were heavily concretised. A tree census conducted by local residents showed over 450 trees had nails, tree guards, barbed wires in or around them, 764 trees were lopped off and at least 793 trees were infested with termites.The report also said that during the first hearing in the high court on December 9 last year, SDMC and PWD failed to submit affidavits regarding the trees going missing, after which each agency was given an additional seven days to submit the details.Separate notices were again issued to the horticulture directors of SDMC and PWD on December 24, with the list of missing trees. However, in his report, Anand said neither of the agencies was able to justify the trees going missing.The report said that on a hearing on December 30, the PWD officer appearing for the department was ‘completely unaware’ of the missing trees and was given 15 days to submit a list of all civil work carried out in the areas the trees went missing. Failing to do this, the Delhi high court said, will result in a fine of ₹1 lakh per tree, along with directions to plant 10 trees for each one missing.The Delhi high court will hold a final hearing in the matter on January 19.Similarly for the SDMC, a submission made before the forest and wildlife department said that between 2011 and 2019, the civic agency received 28 calls regarding trees that were impacted by or had fallen due to the rain. Of these, three were marked as ‘dangerous’ trees. The forest department in its report said no permission was sought to fell the three dangerous trees, which is another violation under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994.The inspection report states the civic body also does not know the present status of these trees.During this period, the SDMC also received 13 letters, seeking permission to cut or prune trees, but the report says the south corporation is yet to furnish details about the status of the trees. A similar fine of ₹1 lakh per tree has been recommended.“It is needless to remind the concerned officials of the SDMC that in case no specific information is submitted on duly sworn affidavit containing their submission with regard to the list of missing/illegally felled trees, it will be presumed that the SDMC that the SDMC has no submission to make and the matter would proceed in accordance with the law. Further, a fine of ₹1 lakh per tree shall be imposed, along with a direction to plant 10 trees for each missing/illegally felled tree,” the order states.Bhavreen Kandhari, an environmental activist, who filed the initial complaint with the forest and wildlife department in December, 2020 and a subsequent complaint in the Delhi high court, says the 143 trees going missing is a figure linked to just one Delhi neighbourhood, with similar problems occurring across the entire city. “Trees are going missing and only when public citizens and acting and carrying out a census on their own, are we finding about the problem. This also shows how satellite imagery can be used to find out about missing trees,” says Kandhari.Padmavati Dwivedi, an activist who carried out the original 2012 and the subsequent 2019 tree censuses in the neighbourhood, said even more trees may have been lost in the years after the second census.“The second census began in 2016 and we were able to finish it by the end of 2017. By the time this census report came out in 2018 and 2019, we still had relatively older data. If we factor in the years following the second census and carry out a third census now, we will find even more trees would have vanished.” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sarvodaya-enclave-lost-143-trees-in-7-years-delhi-forest-dept-finds-101642253653316.html

Many residents in the area spotted these winged wonders on Friday evening and passed on the message so that more people could spot them.“As we were strolling in the joggers’ area off Vastu Vihar society, we noticed these avian guests,” said an elated Naresh Chandra Singh.Other nature lovers, Seema Tonk and Jyoti Nadkarni, also spent over a couple of hours till beyond the sunset on Friday enjoying the scenery and taking pictures.Bird watchers and activists celebrated the development as a ‘Sankranti Day’ gift from Nature and exchanged notes on social media, Singh said. “Instead of flying kites, we had these lovely birds flying in,” he said.“This reinforces the point that the mudflats, mangroves and wetlands of the area need to be protected for maintaining nature’s balance,” said NatConnect Foundation director BN Kumar, who has earlier complained to the government and the High Court-appointed mangrove committee about the destruction of mangroves and mudflats in Kharghar.Kharghar has witnessed golden jackals earlier and researchers like Tarang Sarin have been spotting a host of butterflies and birds in the area. “It is this natural heritage and biodiversity that we have to protect and conserve,” Sarin said.Kumar tweeted to Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray that being a lover of biodiversity, “he must make sure that the flora and fauna of Navi Mumbai and the entire Mumbai Metropolitan Region is protected”. The government must look beyond South Mumbai, he said.“Mangrove ecosystem not only hosts the sea forests but also other elements such as sparse mangroves, intertidal grasslands, mudflats, water bodies that are all of a great significance to the entire ecosystem,” said Nandakumar Pawar of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan.NatConnect, which is working with BNHS on Project MMR Biodiversity, said the latest developments will be highlighted in the documents to be submitted to the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/flamingoes-spotted-in-kharghar-wetlands-after-2-years-and-7-months-101642253474001.html

We have to ensure that we pick the medicines, disposable items, PPE kits, and masks from Covid-infected families or individuals. Jaise cases badhte hain, we divide our work. We park our vehicle near the house and use a stick to ring the door bell. We ask the residents to come and throw the waste in the vehicle,” adds Vishwakarma. Bhagwati Prasad Sharma, a Gurugram-based retired Border Security Force personnel, who had recently called for waste collection from his house, recalls, “We were very grateful for the collectors. Woh apni life ko risk kar rahe hain is kaam mein. And, we, as responsible residents, need to ensure a smooth disposal of biomedical waste by segregating the waste. Ghar ka garbage nahin dalna chhaiye iske saath.”Harsh Bhagat, another Covid waste collector from Gurugram, shares how despite taking all precautions and maintaining transparency, people are still afraid. “People message us when they test Covid positive, and then we inform them specifically that we’ll pick only the Covid waste and not the regular garbage. We follow protocol and take all precautions. Lekin log ghabrate hain. Aaj kisi ka phone aya aur woh ghabrahat mein humse kehne lage ‘Kal mere pitaji theek ho jaayenge toh aaj mat aana, kal aana waste lene’.”Sharing what a normal day during the influx of cases looks like, Ajay Kumar, a Covid waste collector with New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) says, “Main dhai saal se Covid waste collect kar raha hoon. Hum subah 4 baje assemble hote hai. Main PPE Kit pehen ke, aur sir ka face shield pehen ke nikalta hoon. Din ke 500-700 ghar cover karte hain hum. Kabhi toh 1,000 ghar bhi ho jaate hai. Ghar jaake nahata hoon ache se. Har roz ek nayi PPE kit pehente hai. Alag toilet bhi milta hai. Mujhe abhi tak Corona nahin hua hai .”Explaining the rigours of the process, Dr Rahul Singh, Nodal officer for Covid-19, Medical Services Department, NDMC informs, “The list of people who have turned positive is divided according to their locality and given to the collectors and drivers. They are sent fully sanitised in PPE kits. I also give them extra gloves. My prime responsibility is their safety as they go to collect the trash, which is brought to a nodal point and segregated further.” The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Friday began special arrangements to lift bio-medical waste from homes of Covid-19 positive patients in its jurisdiction and has lifted nearly 750 kilograms of bio-medical waste from all four zones from January 1 to 13. The helpline numbers for the same are 011-40988800 (South Zone), 011-49506548 (West Zone), 7290041009 (Central Zone) and 8010863863 (Nazafgarh Zone).Author Tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter

Of the 142 employees, three are hospitalised while the remaining 139 are home quarantined. Among the 142, 139 have taken both the vaccination doses while three others have taken only one dose.The institutional quarantine centres, Savali in Nerul and Nivara in Kalamboli, are empty as the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Headquarters), Abhijeet Shivthare, informed that all the infected are in good health and none are facing any severe infections.During the first wave, 824 police personnel were infected, of which 11 died. In the second wave, 181 were found positive of which one died.“About 98% of the police personnel in Navi Mumbai Police have been fully vaccinated and preparations have begun to give booster doses to the police personnel who have taken both the doses and completed 39 weeks.

Navi Mumbai police have a tie up with 16 hospitals in Navi Mumbai, so we used to help the patients and their families in getting admission in one of those hospitals. The biggest worry then was lack of oxygen. Fortunately, this time, there is no requirement for admission,” police inspector Jagdish Kulkarni, one of the members of the wellness team, said.The police have also started sanitising all the police stations and police headquarters within the limits of the Navi Mumbai police commissionerate.“We are making sure that 55 years and above staff are given office duty and all the staff work in rotation in shifts,” Deputy Commissioner Of Police (Special Branch), Rupali Ambure, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/178-navi-mumbai-police-personnel-test-positive-for-covid-all-barring-3-home-quarantined-101642249877332.html

India has detected 6,041 Omicron cases so far.Notably, the earlier issued restrictions in Bengal were supposed to end on Saturday (January 15).The latest announcement comes as West Bengal on Friday witnessed a marginal decline in its single-day Covid-19 tally after 22,645 individuals tested positive for the disease, down from Thursday's 23,467, according to the state health bulletin data. The dip came after the state has been recording a massive spike in its daily Covid-19 caseload over the last few days.Here's a better insight into what will be allowed and what won't be following the latest order by the West Bengal government.Will outdoor activities be allowed?It is permitted but with restrictions. The government imposed a night curfew in Bengal from January 3 in which all forms of outdoor activities along with movement of people and vehicles will be prohibited between 10pm and 5am. However, essential and emergency services are exempted.Will marriage functions be allowed?Marriage events can be held with a maximum of 200 attendees or 50 per cent of the venue's capacity, whichever is lesser. In the earlier issued circular on January 2, the state government capped attendees for marriage related ceremonies at 50.Are offices going to be operational?All government offices in the state will continue to function at 50 per cent capacity, and so will the private ones. The state government has asked to encourage work from home “as far as possible.”Are schools, colleges and universities going to open?All educational institutions, including schools, colleges and universities will continue to stay shut. However, administrative activities are allowed only with 50 per cent capacity at a time.Will restaurants and cinemas be open?Restaurants and bars, and cinema halls and theatres can function with 50 per cent capacity at a time. However, all these establishments need to close for the day by 10pm before the night curfew kicks in every day.Will entertainment places, markets and shopping malls stay open?In the previous order dated January 2, the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC government in Bengal ordered closure of all swimming pools, spas, beauty parlours, saloons, wellness centres, zoos, tourist locations, among others.However, market places and shopping malls can run with entry capped at 50 per cent capacity at a time up to 10pm in adherence to the night curfew timings.Will metro and local trains be available?Metro services will be available with 50 per cent seating capacity according to the usual operational time. Local trains will also follow the similar protocol and can run up to 10pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-extends-covid-curbs-till-jan-31-allows-marriage-events-with-200-people-101642242984109.html

15-01-2022||Pune||Startup Mantra: Getting a life to function with your diet||Mugdha Pradhan, 43, is not a doctor and has no medical training of any sort.Pradhan identifies herself as a nutritionist and is the founder of a health and wellness startup iThrive – Healing and Beyond (previously known as ThriveFNC). Pradhan’s resume hinges on the words “functional medicine” and she was her own index case study that allowed investors to buy into her vision.The vision? A one-stop shop’ for anything to do with health and in Pradhan’s own words, “My life is now dedicated to making diseases disappear from this planet”. It would perhaps be wise to reference Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos here. An aggressive startup founder with a sales pitch that sold Silicon Valley a similar “vision” – a medical revolution based on a single drop of blood.Holmes will be sentenced shortly after she was convicted for fraud, with her claims to investors being proven fake.It certainly muddies the water for Pradhan and her belief in “functional medicine”. And the claims she is making.Taking on the issue head on, Pradhan says, “If it was truly an unethical business practice, then I strongly condemn it,” with reference to Theranos. “However, there’s no regulation around these devices and shortcut testing mechanisms. I know of companies in India too that claim to perform such tests and detailed reports based on five minute scans. How do they work is anyone’s guess. I am not for such shortcut methods.”Pradhan remains quietly confident and the fact that she has raised $100k in a seed round in March 2019 and $350k in a pre-series A in August 2020, suggest her investors are buying the “functional medicine” cure.As are customer, with turnover for iThrive at Rs31 lakh in 2020-21 and Rs70 lakh (till date) in 2021-22. Because this deals with lifestyle and medicine, two highly flammable substances in terms of cause and effect versus claim, Pradhan start at the end. The bottom line. If she is not a doctor how can she prescribe anything to anyone?Pradhan starts with supplements and all other solutions offered by iThrive. “They do not create side-effects. Supplements are just nutrients that one is not getting from food. They do not adversely affect anyone. If a customer suffers an injury or faces any other problem or acute condition while undergoing the course, we ask them to consult their physician. We only work on chronic diseases. In some cases, we may partner with the customer’s doctor for a particular time period.”“When a customer joins iThrive, they sign up on the clauses which clearly state that iThrive is going to partner with them only for nutrition, food and lifestyle changes. Customers are made aware and made to agree that if they have any acute condition, then they need to consult their physician. We also have a disclaimer saying that customers will see results only if they adhere to our recommendations,” says Pradhan.Recalling an incident, Pradhan said, “There was one person who came onboard and then after one week he didn’t want to make any changes. He wanted us to give him the diet that he wants to do. But we don’t do that. So we gave him a refund, but he still left us a nasty Google review.”The Institute for Functional Medicine defines functional medicine as “a systems biology–based approach that focuses on identifying and addressing the root cause of disease.” Explaining this Pradhan says, “Usually a blood test report mentions the reference ranges of various parameters. These reference ranges are average of lab data of sick patients from previous decades. So, it may not truly represent the range of healthy people which is why some of us feel sick even if the reports are normal. In functional medicine, we consider ‘optimal ranges’ which are based on latest research and updated every few years. These ranges are derived from the Functional Medicine University and the Institute of Functional Medicine.”“iThrive is affiliated to US-based Institute of Functional Medicine (IFM). As per Indian laws, which govern iThrive, nutritionists cannot prescribe medicine or change medications. That is why iThrive partners with the customer’s family doctors in some cases where required. IFM certified doctors, however, can use IFM guidelines for diagnosis, as the lab reports are just act as guideline. Which is why diagnosis of doctors vary even if it is based on same lab report,” stated Pradhan.“Reference ranges in lab reports are regularly updated based on global studies. For example, American Heart Association has revised or updated the guidelines for normal cholesterol levels from above 220 to 150. These ranges are not an average of lab data, but based on disease-specific research findings. In India, it is expected that medical practitioners should follow guidelines of medical council which is the regulatory authority,” says Dr Avinash Bhondwe, a top medical analyst.Pradhan, four years ago she struggled with her own personal health issues, but learning the nuances of “functional medicine” transformed her health. Her startup focuses on reversing chronic health conditions and lifestyle diseases through functional nutrition using root-cause analysis. It is backed by a team of highly qualified functional nutritionists that aim to help people reverse a multitude of health dysfunctions through “science-backed functional nutrition coaching and real-time response”.Pradhan spent her early days in Bengaluru. In 2001, after her graduation, she worked as a visiting faculty for two years at a college in Mumbai. She married, and moved to Bengaluru again in 2004. She pursued a career in corporate HR and joined Flipkart’s team. Then, due to personal problems, she went through a bout of clinical depression. Says Pradhan, “By 2016, I weighed 97kg and always looked sick. I had no energy and was not happy with my life. I realised something was very wrong and I should go back to nutrition. In early 2017, I did not have any entrepreneurial background or experience. Finances were becoming an issue and the only answer I knew was to fix my health first.”“While researching, I discovered ‘Functional Medicine’. I borrowed money from my friends to survive. I did my blood tests and learnt to interpret the report. I realised that I had many underlying issues like a lot of deficiencies. Whatever symptoms your body shows, like excess weight, there is an internal reason. So, I started fixing things for myself and by July 2017 I had lost 37kg. It was such a visible difference, that everyone said whatever you did for yourself do for us too. That’s where I got my first client who was one of my friends, whom I charged ₹2,000 for a month.”As a solopreneur, Pradhan started thinking about helping more people. She says, “In August 2018, I helped a woman in a wheelchair. Her uncle, Rajesh Ranavat contacted me in December 2018. I was not aware that he was the executive director at Fung Strategic Investments. I was leading a ‘nomad life’ and he asked me what I wanted to do and I told him that I have a vision of healing a million people. That’s when he introduced himself as an investor.”iThrive was formally registered on June 25, 2019. Pradhan recalls, “We started hiring people and Avinash Deshmukh, who looks after operations, was one of the key persons to join us. Initially we got weight loss, diabetes cases but later, we started getting more complicated cases. People trusted us as we had a science-based approach to looking at any disease and we use a specific strategy to deal with it. By February 2020, we grew to about a six-member team. In March 2020, the Covid-19 outbreak started and since lockdown was we took a pause.”“Since people were not spending in the first few months, it became difficult for us to survive the lockdown. We had made some early entrepreneurial mistakes like spending on advertisements, outsourcing digital marketing. In July we had no money left. Funding was coming in two tranches and we had not met our revenue goals. I was worried whether I would be able to pay the salaries of our employees. I had given two options to my team. Close the company or stay and share whatever profit we make. Since the team was aligned with my vision of creating a healthier, happier and lifestyle-disease free community, they stayed back. August 2020 onward our trajectory turned positive in terms of signups and referrals.”Pradhan believes that once someone’s physical health is taken care of, their mind opens up to do good things. She launched a three-month programme ‘iThrive Alive’ as a premium payment model. It is a preventive healthcare programme. While scaling, Pradhan faced the problem of recruiting and training nutritionists herself. To solve this problem, she started the ‘iThrive Academy’ in January 2021. She says, “We are actually teaching functional medicine to doctors, nutritionists, homeopaths, physiotherapists, nurses and others. Then, there are the supplements. ‘iThrive Essential Supplements’ launched in November 2021. “Due to supply chain disruptions during lockdowns and unforeseen circumstances otherwise, clients were facing problems while purchasing supplements. If somebody is with us for three months, we want to make sure that their nutrition is fixed, else they are not going to see results,” said Pradhan.Rajesh Ranavat commented that iThrive has gained significant traction in the last 12 months and is now well positioned for its next phase of growth with the launch of the online iThrive Academy and the supplements’ verticalNeelesh Bhatnagar added, “In the last two years iThrive has uniquely become a category creator in the functional nutrition space in India, and is rapidly growing into becoming India’s leading Functional Medicine ecosystem with consulting services, online academy and supplements vertical. The brand is full of life and opportunities.”iThrive received its second funding of $350K in August 2020. “It was like a bridge round – pre-series A. Our first investor Ranawat brought in the second round of HNI investors too. We will be looking at an institutional Series A round late this year or early first Q of 2023. Now we are working on a tech app for Alive and we will soon be launching a sports nutrition programme, iThrive Juniors for children. We want to be the said Pradhan.“We have partnered with some labs globally. With a special research and development setup, we are doing a lot of intensive testing. We have also got ethical approval to run clinical trials, because we have a lot of patients’ clinical information,” she claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-getting-a-life-to-function-with-your-diet-101642243575265.html
15-01-2022||Kolkata||West Bengal civic polls deferred by 3 weeks to February 12. Thank you, says BJP||KOLKATA: Amid rising cases of Covid-19 cases in the state, the West Bengal state election commission on Saturday postponed elections to the four civic bodies by three weeks, even as the Mamata Banerjee administration relaxed some of the restrictions imposed by the government earlier.According to a notification by the poll panel, voting for the four bodies will take place on February 12 instead of January 22. The commission, however, is yet to announce when the votes will be counted. A senior poll panel official said counting may be done on February 15. The Calcutta high court on Friday told the state election commission (SEC) to consider postponing civic elections by four to six weeks. A division bench headed by chief justice Prakash Shrivastava also told the commission to take a decision within a period of 48 hours. “We welcome the (state) election commission’s decision. The Calcutta high court directed the panel to consider postponing the polls. The state government informed the commission that it has no objection if polls were deferred keeping in mind public safety. The poll panel postponed it. We will abide by the decision,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP. Elections to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation were held on December 19. The state election commission earlier scheduled polls to four civic bodies, Asansol, Bidhannagar, Siliguri and Chandannagar for January 22, Counting was scheduled to be held on January 25. But with Covid-19 cases rising alarmingly, a petition was filed in the high court to seek directions to the state election commission to put off the polls.“We had appealed to the commission to defer the polls as Covid-19 cases have risen alarmingly in the state. In this situation, free and fair elections can’t be held as people would be scared to go to the polling station. Later many other (political parties) echoed us. The Calcutta high court directed the poll panel to postpone the elections by four to six weeks. It has been postponed by three weeks. We thank the commission,” said Sukanta Majumdar, president of the BJP’s state unit.According to union health ministry data on Saturday, Bengal has 1,45,483 active Covid cases.On Thursday the state government told the court that once the election dates were announced, the state government has no role and only the poll panel could defer it. The poll panel, on the other hand, informed the court that the commission does not have the power to defer the election dates once the dates have been notified unless the state government declares such a disaster or an emergency which will make it impossible to hold such election. “This could have been announced earlier. But instead, the state government and the poll panel pushed the ball to each other’s court. Now that the high court has ordered they were left with no option,” said Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of the Congress party in the Lok Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/west-bengal-civic-polls-deferred-by-3-weeks-to-february-12-thank-you-says-bjp-101642243333544.html
15-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: Congress relies on old hands, 58 MLAs in first list of 86 candidates||The Congress on Saturday released its first list of 86 candidates, including 58 sitting legislators, for the February 14 assembly elections in Punjab. Also read: ‘Suggest CM face’ initiative logs 8-lakh responses: AAPChief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, deputy chief ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and OP Soni, cabinet ministers Manpreet Singh Badal, Vijay Inder Singla, Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Pargat Singh and Amrinder Singh Raja Warring and Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa are among the prominent party leaders on the list and have been repeated from their present seats. Cabinet minister Brahm Mohindra’s son Mohit Mohindra has been fielded from Patiala Rural, which the veteran leader represents in the present assembly. Four sitting MLAs denied ticket The party has denied the ticket to four of its sitting MLAs – Harjot Kamal Singh from Moga, Balwinder Singh Laddi from Hargobindpur, deputy speaker Ajaib Singh Bhatti from Malout and Nathu Ram from Balluana. Sonu Sood’s sister Malvika from Moga, Moosewala from Mansa Sonu Sood’s sister Malvika Sood Sachar has been fielded from Moga. Singer Sidhu Moosewala is also on the list of candidates from Mansa. Both are new entrants to the party. Punjab has 117 assembly constituencies. Screening committee differed on Sujanpur, Moga, Garhshankar The Congress central election committee headed by interim president Sonia Gandhi finalised the names of candidates on the basis of recommendations made by the screening committee set up under party national general secretary Ajay Maken. The candidate selection was not without its usual set of hiccups with Sidhu, Channi, Jakhar and Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary pushing their own favourites. The screening committee had made its recommendations to the CEC after half a dozen meetings but these members voiced their differences when these names came up for discussion on Thursday for final decision. The CEC confirmed the names of most of those recommended and asked the screening committee to hold discussion on five seats, including Sujanpur, Moga and Garhshankar, on which there was no consensus among the state leaders. The screening committee held fresh discussions and recommended a single name for these seats, paving the way for the party to release the list after approval after the Congress president’s nod. Sidhu, Channi push for CM face beforehand Since the party has not named any chief ministerial face and is going into the elections under the “collective leadership” of Channi, Sidhu and Jakhar, all three have been jockeying for the lion’s share of party tickets, which might come into play in deciding the new CM if the party is able to get the numbers required to retain power in the state. Both Sidhu and Channi are pushing for declaring the chief ministerial face beforehand, pitching themselves for the position.

Hitting out at the Samajwadi Party and BJP defectors who joined the SP on Friday, Mayawati said the Samajwadi Party (SP) is not a well-wisher of the Dalit, backward and Muslim community. Rather under the SP government, only the Yadav community was promoted and enjoyed access to resources. Under the BSP government, she said, members of all community got share in the power, government schemes and resources. Mayawati called upon her party workers to celebrate her birthday at home in view of the implementation of the model code of conduct (MCC) after the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the schedule for assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, on January 8 and surge in the Covid-19 cases across the state. The BSP will celebrate her birthday as “Jankalyankari Diwas” (public welfare day). Party workers have been directed to assist the poor people and family members of the Covid pandemic victims. The BSP chief released the 17th edition of her book “A Travelogue of My Struggle Ridden Life and BSP Movement” at the party’s state unit office on the occasion. “The travelogue will generate self-respect among the party supporters and guide them to take the movement launched by the BSP forward,” she said.

Based on the Delhi Police case, ED launched a money laundering probe against him in February 2021 and arrested him under PMLA in July 2021.“Investigation under PMLA revealed that Rajeev Sharma had supplied confidential and sensitive information to Chinese Intelligence officers, in exchange for remuneration thereby compromising the security and national interests of the country. It was revealed that such remuneration to Rajeev Sharma was being provided by a Mahipalpur-based shell company that was run by Chinese nationals - Zhang Cheng alias Suraj, Zhang Lixia alias Usha and Qing Shi along with a Nepali national Sher Singh alias Raj Bohara,” ED said in its statement on Saturday.The company involved in the case has been identified as M Z Pharmacy. ED further said “the Chinese company was acting as a conduit for the Chinese Intelligence agencies to provide remuneration for persons like Rajeev Sharma indulged in criminal activities. The remuneration was being paid in cash through carriers as well as through cash deposits. Sharma also received money using the bank account of his friend in order to conceal his involvement in criminal activities.

It could be that (accident),” Dr Arvind was further quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Earlier, the Rajasthan police said no evidence had so far been found in the incident and the possibility of a sexual assault is less.The minor girl was found bleeding in an abandoned condition on the Tijara flyover in Alwar, following which she was admitted to a hospital.

Shekhawat wrote."Any senior officer will try to suppress such a sensitive matter only when the order is received from the government.

15-01-2022||Delhi||DU college societies reset their calendars virtually||The joy of students upon the phased reopening of Delhi University (DU) and the resumption of offline activities for various college societies seem to have been short-lived. With Omicron and the surging Covid-19 cases in the city, activities of college societies have been forced back to the virtual world. Until some time back, members of Verbum – the English Dramatics Society of Sri Venkateswara College — were holding regular physical meet-ups. Now, they have transitioned to a virtual calendar for the next few months. “We have shifted to conducting virtual workshops and training,” says Arya Ray, the president of the society, adding, “Besides the improvisational games for acting, we have scriptwriting workshops as well as sessions on technical (lights and sound) and production (set design, costumes, props) aspect of plays. As of now, we are not working on any virtual plays.” The Finance and Investment Cell of Shri Ram College of Commerce has also resorted to digital support sessions. Sanya Madan, president of the society, shares, “After an online induction, we have the mentor group’s meeting, where juniors will find their mentors. Instead of physical interactions, they will connect over video calls. We have already started the sessions on Shri Ram Financial Forum, where speakers from the field will conduct virtual sessions with our members.”Not to be held back by the virus, students engaging in social work have also taken a digital detour. Mansi Rathore, a final-year student from Miranda House, says, “Students in Connecting Dreams Foundation — an NGO affiliated with Miranda House — were earlier going out for field work, such as distribution of sanitary pads and teaching the underprivileged. But their outings have had to be halted due to the pandemic situation. Currently, they are planning a virtual fundraiser. So what if we can’t go outside? We can still do our bit for the society.” Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-college-societies-reset-their-calendars-virtually-101642231573427.html

To begin with, the plantation would be done on 10 hectares in all the districts after formal training to the farmers,” said Kishore. One Ranjit Kumar Singh of Vaishali planted a few saplings of HRMN-99 apple, which he brought from Himachal Pradesh three years ago, along with his other friends of Begusarai, Bhagalpur and Aurangabad districts.“The saplings planted by Ranjit Kumar in Vaishali have borne fruits, which would be ready for plucking by May-June,” said deputy director, horticulture, Rakesh Kumar, adding that plants in other districts too are in different stages of fruiting.A plant scientist of Rajendra Prasad Agriculture University (RAU) in Samastipur said that a molecular study had been performed for the characterization of HRMN-99 apple in comparison with check varieties by Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission, Gandhinagar.“The study confirms its diversity and superiority over other low chilling varieties Anna and Dorsett golden,” the scientist said, adding that this variety of apple could be grown even at 40deg C. The state government has also decided to offer a subsidy of up to ₹1.23 lakh per hectare for the apple plantation to the farmers, nearly half the estimated cost of ₹2.46 lakh. The pilot project envisages imparting training to at least five farmers in each district before offering them the saplings to grow. The directorate will also cultivate apples on 0.2 hectare of land at Vaishali’s centre of excellence for training and demonstration purposes. The HRMN-99 variety of apple was developed by farmer Hariman Sharma from Bilaspur district in Himachal Pradesh. Sharma.

Delhi’s humidity stood at about 93% at 7am, making pollutants heavier and subsequently dispersion difficult.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said Friday was the "longest foggy day of the season" and predicted similar conditions for Saturday."Today, was the longest foggy day over Delhi for this season. It also caused a cold day due to the absence of sunlight in the day and also a little windy from northwest of 8-12kmph towards noon," IMD said.A Met department official said that a layer of dense fog on Friday morning and moderate fog during the day over Delhi-NCR, Punjab, Haryana, west Uttar Pradesh and north Rajasthan prevented the sunlight from reaching the surface. Foggy conditions along with light north westerlies blowing over the region led to a cold day, the official added.Meanwhile, cold wave conditions continue to grip Delhi as the temperature dipped to 8 degrees Celsius at around 7am, with a wind speed of 5 kilometres per hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-air-quality-deteriorates-to-very-poor-fog-predicted-for-next-4-days-101642213643109.html
15-01-2022||Bhopal||Actor Raza Murad dropped as cleanliness ambassador on minister's order||Noted film actor Raza Murad was removed as brand ambassador of the Bhopal Municipal Corporation's 'swachhata abhiyan' on Friday on the order of Madhya Pradesh Urban Development Minister Bhupendra Singh, a day after the announcement of his appointment was made. In a letter to the Bhopal civic chief, Singh said Murad should be dropped as brand ambassador as his contribution in the field of cleanliness was not known. "A brand ambassador should be such a person who has contributed in a major way in the field of cleanliness or who is well-versed with Bhopal's culture. Therefore, the order in this regard should be cancelled with immediate effect. Instead, nominate a prestigious person/institution who has made noted contributions in the field of cleanliness," the minister's letter said. However, Murad told PTI he was well-versed with the city as he had kin hailing from here and had also completed his schooling in the state capital. "No one can be a bigger Bhopali than me as my mother, wife and many other members of the family belong to Bhopal. I did my schooling from the Cambridge School here. I am well versed with the city, its roads, its typical language, its tea, paan and gutkha, so the charge that I don't know the culture of the city holds no ground," Murad said. "Secondly, the minister also said the brand ambassador should be such a person who has done commendable job in 'swachhata'. But, when you do not give me an opportunity to prove (my credentials in the field), then how can you decide I have not done anything," he asked. Murad also said he had already started work on the subject on Thursday in the city's Chowk area by telling people to segregate solid and liquid waste, adding that "if the minister doesn't want my services, so be it, as they (powers that be) are maalik (all powerful)". BMC public relations officer said the 100-150 people chosen as cleanliness ambassadors on Thursday were those had made a name in their respective fields. Meanwhile, the Congress hit out at the BJP government in the state and said Murad being dropped from the brand ambassador list was "Sanghi thinking". In a tweet in Hindi, Congress spokesperson KK Mishra said Murad was removed as he was Muslim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/actor-raza-murad-dropped-as-cleanliness-ambassador-on-minister-s-order-101642205064623.html

15-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab assembly elections: BJP to bank on senior leaders to bring home its traditional seats||Not willing to take any risks in the high-stakes Punjab assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party is planning to field its top senior leaders on the seats traditionally contested by the party.The party’s 25-member state election committee is set to meet on Saturday to chalk out names of probable candidates.The names doing the rounds include BJP’s party affairs in-charge for Himachal Pradesh and former MP, Avinash Rai Khanna, party’s national general secretary Tarun Chugh, Union minister Som Parkash and chairman of the National commission for scheduled castes, Vijay Sampla. Khanna, is currently the senior-most leader of the party, has represented Garshankar assembly constituency of Hoshiarpur district once. A former national vice-president of the party, he has also served as the Lok Sabha member from Hoshiarpur seat and is widely respected among the BJP rank and file, especially in Doaba area. Chugh had unsuccessfully contested from Amritsar Central twice. Though Chugh is busy with national assignments in Delhi, the party is not able to find a suitable replacement for him in the Amritsar Central segment, currently represented by Congress’s senior leader and prominent Hindu face, OP Soni. Som Parkash has twice represented Phagwara assembly constituency of Kapurthala district before being elected as Member of Parliament from Hoshiarpur assembly segment. The general feeling in the party is that Parkash or his wife, are the best bets from the seat, which has a high number of scheduled caste and Hindu votes. Here, BSP’s state president Jasvir Singh Garhi is the candidate of SAD-BSP. Sampla, also a former state BJP chief and a former member of parliament from Hoshiarpur reserved constituency, is the seniormost scheduled caste leader of the party in Punjab at present. His son, Sahil Sampla, a lawyer, is actively nurturing Sham Churasi constituency of Hoshiarpur district for the family. Sampla, who had remained a Union minister of state during the previous tenure of Modi government, was elevated as chairman of National Commission for Scheduled Caste with Union cabinet minister rank in February last year. Since then, he has been actively taking up issues related to scheduled castes in Punjab and was actively criss-crossing the state during farm protests as well. “With Congress planning to field chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi from Adampur seat of Jalandhar apart from his own Chamkaur Sahib seat with any eye on scheduled caste votes, fielding senior leaders like Som Parkash and Sampla can make a difference for the party,” said a senior party functionary. Som Parkash said he has always abided by the party’s directions and will follow whatever is being told to him. Sampla, however, denied contesting polls, claiming that his son was already contesting from Sham Churasi. “Why would the party give tickets to two people in a family,” said Sampla. Khanna, meanwhile, said he will do what the party high command tells him to.

He also directed them to prepare a detailed plan to clear the rest of the legacy waste with additional processing, and deploy more manpower and machinery, if required.The administrator directed UT adviser Dharam Pal to take up the matter of clearing the accumulated RDF in the mining area with power plants of Haryana and Punjab.MC commissioner Anindita Mishra told the administrator and adviser that bio-mining in one part of the garbage dump is currently ongoing and will be completed soon.

15-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab assembly elections: Gurnam Charuni, Balbir Rajewal fail to break deadlock over seat-sharing||With Gurnam Singh Charuni-led Sanyukt Sangharsh Party (SSP) demanding 25 seats in the seat-sharing agreement with Balbir Singh Rajewal’s Sanyukt Samaj Morcha(SSM), and the latter unwilling to part with more than seven seats, the stalemate between the two parties continues ahead of Punjab assembly elections slated for February 14.Both parties held a series of meetings in Ludhiana on Friday. As per information, Charuni’s party demanded 25 seats, but Rajewal’s side agreed for 13, then went down to nine and finally gave them seven seats, and that too, those which were not the ones SSP was hoping for. Giving the example of Sardoolgarh, a close aide of Charuni said, “SSM withdrew the seat that was earlier promised to SSP.”The aide further said, “We formed our party six months ago and since then, have been working hard. Our workers have also spent a lot, so going back is difficult.”Rajewal has formed a three-member committee to deal with seat-sharing matters. He had formed the SSM last month, taking along 19 of the 32 farm bodies from Punjab who were part of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella organisation that led the agitation against the now repealed agriculture reform laws. Rajewal had announced candidates for 10 seats two days ago and is expected to make the announcement for 25-30 more seats on Saturday. A meeting between Charuni’s group and Rajewal’s committee is fixed for Saturday. In a video message released earlier, Charuni had threatened to go solo in case a respectable seat-sharing formula is not arrived at for the 117 seats in state. “We will be left with no option but to contest the polls alone in case a formula suited to both sides is not reached,” said Charuni’s aide. Differences narrowed, don’t want to split farmers’ votes: SSMAddressing a press conference in Ludhiana, SSM parliamentary committee member Prem Singh Bhangu said differences between both sides have been narrowed. Responding to a question regarding Charuni’s displeasure, Bhangu said, “We were together during the farm agitation and don’t want farmers’ votes to be split. Everything is fine and the differences have been narrowed. Soon, both outfits will make a combined announcement.” The SSM had organised the press conference to announce candidates for six seats of Ludhiana city and others. But the announcement was put off till Sunday, stating that more applications have been received and the SSM wants to go through those. Bhangu said candidates for six seats of Ludhiana city will be chosen from the group of industrialists, who are part of SSM.1,273 ticket aspirants have applied: SSM Bhangu said SSM had set January 14 as the deadline for accepting applications from aspiring candidates and as many as 1,273 applications have been received from the state. He said some Arjuna awardees and Olympians also figure in the list of applicants. The party leaders said all the applications will be thoroughly scrutinised and candidates will be finalised on merit basis. “SSM will not entertain any application sent after 5pm on January 14. We will also not give tickets to those who leave their party at the eleventh hour, aspiring for a ticket,” said Bhangu. The SSM leaders further said they will release the manifesto for the upcoming election in 2-3 days. They refuted the allegations leveled by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) that BJP is helping SSM in getting registered with election commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-assembly-elections-gurnam-charuni-balbir-rajewal-fail-to-break-deadlock-over-seatsharing-101642191851991.html

Kindly ensure that all faculty members and students actively participate in the programmes,” reads the government order.“Why should Muslim students be forced to do anything, including yoga, to celebrate Makar Sankranti? It is a festival and to celebrate it or not must be a personal choice. Would the BJP be happy if a similar order was issued to order non-Muslim students to celebrate Eid,” asked NC vice-president and former chief minister Omar Abdullah in a tweet.Another former chief minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti also criticised the decision. “GOIs PR misadventures aim to demean and collectively humiliate Kashmiris. Forcing students and staff to perform Surya Namaskars by issuing orders despite their obvious discomfort with the imposition of something laden with religious connotations gives an insight into their communal mind-set,” Mufti tweeted.Srinagar city mayor and Apni party leader Junaid Azim Mattu termed the order as “undemocratic”.“No activity with origins in religion, mythology or faith should be forced upon anyone. Such broad-brushed, undemocratic directives are violative of the very basic principles of our constitution,” tweeted Mattu.Muttahida Majlis-e-Ulema (MMU), the amalgam of several religious organisations of J&K, in a statement took strong exception to the government order.The MMU said, “To deliberately force them to do so by issuing directives is mischievous. The rulers should be clear that this is completely unacceptable to the Muslims of the state who will never yield to such highhandedness.”The statement further said that Muslims of J&K are respectful of all religions and believe in harmonious coexistence but will never yield to any pressure, if and when there is any interference in matters related to their faith.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jammu-and-kashmir-admn-directive-for-surya-namaskar-on-makar-sankranti-sparks-row-101642191553179.html

15-01-2022||Chandigarh||2019 Tarn Taran blast: High court grants bail to one accused, says allegations prima facie not true||The Punjab and Haryana high court has granted bail to Amarjeet Singh, an accused linked with the 2019 Tarn Taran blast and alleged pro-Khalistani group member, observing that the accusation is not prima facie “true”. Two of the accused — Vikram Singh, alias Vicky, and Harpreet Singh, alias Happy — were killed on the spot when an explosion took place at Pandori Gola village of the district in September 2019. The third accomplice, Gurjant Singh suffered injuries. Initial probe suggested that the trio was trying to retrieve ammunition concealed underground to unleash terror activities in the state. Later, the case was taken over by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Amarjeet in his appeal had said that he was in custody since September 2019 and nothing has come on record that he was a member of any terrorist organisation and involved in any unlawful activity. Hence, bail be granted. The NIA had argued that the mastermind in the case Bikramjit Singh is absconding and Amarjeet was in touch with him and had participated in the training organised by him to make and test bombs. The court observed that the NIA has not been able to collect incriminating material against the petitioner. However, data recovered from his social media accounts show the appellant’s inclination towards Khalistan. “Mainly because there are some Khalistani mentions in his social media account which are of offending nature ……would not as such be conclusive proof that the appellant is a member of a terrorist group,” it said, allowing his bail further observing that trial is not likely to be concluded in the near future. “.. (from the evidence on record) it can be safely recorded that the accusation is not prima facie true and he is entitled to the benefit of regular bail during the pendency of the trial,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2019-tarn-taran-blast-high-court-grants-bail-to-one-accused-says-allegations-prima-facie-not-true-101642190950327.html
15-01-2022||Chandigarh||National Commission for Women chief Rekha Sharma terms Bishop Franco Mulakkal’s acquittal shocking||National Commission for Women chairperson Rekha Sharma on Friday said she was shocked to hear the acquittal of Kerala nun rape case accused Franco Mulakkal and promised to support the victim and fellow nuns. “Shocked at the judgment of the district sessions court. The victim must go to the high court. NCW is with her in her fight for justice,” she tweeted after the verdict. Kerala women’s commission chairperson P Sathi Devi also expressed concern over the verdict. “We are with the suffering nuns. We will help them,” she said. While political parties are guarded in their reaction, for shocked activists and others it took time to sink in. “The verdict is really painful. But it is not over. In Sister Abhaya murder case, it took 28 years for long arms of the law to punish the offenders,” said Sister Lucy Kalapura who was expelled from the Franciscan Clarist Congregation for openly supporting nuns who staged a sit-in protest in 2018 in Kochi, seeking the arrest of Franco Mulakkal. She said the verdict will give a wrong message to those who want to come out against such atrocities. Former SP of Kottayam S Hari Shankar, who supervised the investigation, said the verdict will be unprecedented in Indian judiciary. “We can look at the verdict only with shock. There have been a lot of corroborative evidence and enough witnesses. There were medical evidence as well. We have to check what kind of message this verdict is giving to the society as a whole,” he said. Activist Joemon Puhtanpurakkal, an activist who fought more than 25 years to ensure justice for Sister Abhaya, who was found murdered in a well of the convent, said it was only a temporary setback and nuns should continue their fight for justice. State fisheries minister Saji Cherian, also hailing from Kottayam, said the government will take a decision after taking legal opinion. But a senior lawyer with the defence team CS Ajayan said the verdict was a natural outcome. “You can raise charges easily but you will have to corroborate these with evidence. The prosecution failed to come up with proofs to substantiate its charges,” he said. Catholic Youth Forum leader Kennedy K said truth prevailed with the verdict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/national-commission-for-women-chief-rekha-sharma-terms-bishop-franco-mulakkal-s-acquittal-shocking-101642190650255.html

They were warned of action under the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897, in case any violation of order.However, though vaccination teams remained present at both schools through Thursday, no student turned up for the jab. “This not only resulted in wastage of precious human resources, but also prevented the health officials from discharging their duty during the ongoing crisis,” Garg said in the notices sent to the schools.The schools have been asked to explain whether all students enrolled in the school and eligible for the vaccine were informed about the camp set up on the school premises. They have also been asked to explain why the authorities were not informed that none of the students had consented to get vaccinated on Thursday. The schools need to send an explanation to the school education director within three days and no more vaccination camps will be organised there, the notice stated.Schools refute allegationsBoth schools claimed there was no violation of the health secretary’s order. Sacred Heart Senior Secondary School has already sent its reply with a list of all modes of communication used to inform the students. The school shared that even the neighbouring schools in Sector 26 were asked to bring their students for vaccination and staff was also sent to Bapu Dham Colony to invite children. Principal Sister Arti said, “The school falls in an institutional area, so many of our students have already gotten vaccinated at centres closer to their homes. A Google form was sent out on Wednesday regarding the vaccination camp on Thursday and many parents responded that their wards will be getting vaccinated on Thursday.”She added that out of 650 eligible students in the school, around 60% had already received the first dose of vaccine. School authorities added that on Thursday, some students showed up, but were not vaccinated as a vial was to be opened for a minimum of 10 people. At GMSSS, Sector 23, principal Seema Grover said, “Students did not arrive early in the morning due to Lohri and chilly weather. Around 20 students turned up later, but the vaccination team had already left by 11.30 am.”She added that the school had sent numerous text messages, voice notes and utilised other means to inform students about the camp. “These will be shared with the authorities now. Around 67% of our eligible students are already vaccinated, as we took them to the camp at GMSSS, Sector 16, while some others went to GMSSS, Sector 19, as it’s closer to their houses,” Grover said.According to the eligible population projected by the central government, about 72,000 children, aged 15 to 18, are eligible for vaccination in Chandigarh.Since January 3, the UT health department has vaccinated 41,032 (57%) children with the first dose.

15-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram: Man arrested for driving SUV with number plate of another car||A 32-year-old owner of an automobile workshop was arrested on Friday for allegedly replacing the registration number plate of his SUV with that of another vehicle, which he had sold to a resident of Palwal last year. Police said last December, Rajesh Sarot, the Palwal resident, received three challans for jumping signal and not wearing seat belt while driving. Sarot, who registered a complaint, said he was shocked as he had not visited Gurugram during this period. “I went to the traffic police and brought the matter to the attention of the officer concerned. By then, I had already paid two challans without realising that someone else was using my SUV’s registration number,” he said. Assistant commissioner of police Sanjeev Balhara said, “We showed him the CCTV footage of his car. He was shocked as someone else was driving the SUV, whose shape and colour was the same as his vehicle. We checked the records and found that the suspect had paid one challan. We took the picture of the suspect and showed it to the complainant, who identified him as Naresh Singh of Hisar.” Balhara said they have a record of all the challans in their integrated command and control centre (ICCC) in Sector 44, where cameras linked to traffic signals detect violations. “We sent a team to the workshop in Wazirabad village and arrested the suspect from the spot. During questioning, he revealed that he had bought two Scorpio SUVs from Bangalore. While he sold one of the SUVs to the complainant, he kept the other one for himself. As there was tax pending and e-challans issued for his Scorpio, he replaced the number plate with the one he sold, after which he drove his SUV to the national capital and to different districts of Haryana,” he said. Police said to evade e-challans for traffic violations, Singh allegedly used the registration number of Sarot’s vehicleto trick traffic cameras and authorities in Gurugram. Police said more than 10 challans were issued against the registration number on Singh’s vehicle. He had been using the fake registration plate for almost a year to avoid paying e-challans for traffic violations.Balhara said they are investigating if Singh has violated serious traffic norms or has been involved in road accidents during this time. If found guilty, more sections will be added. A case under sections 417 (punishment for cheating), 465 (punishment for forgery), 468 (forging document) and 471 (using forged document) of the IPC was registered against Singh at Sector 53 police station on Thursday. Police said they have received 38 similar complaints from Panipat, Gurugram, Farrukhnagar, Nuh and Pataudi since January, 2021. The maximum cases are from Panipat. Balhara said there are gangs using the same modus operandi, where in they attach the original number plates of vehicles obtained in other districts and states to stolen vehicles. “We have identified some suspects belonging to different gangs. The fake registration number plates were used for kidnapping, murder, attempt to murder, robbery and snatching cases. We are yet to arrest the suspects involved in such casesand have written to other districts and states regarding the same,” he said. In April last year, Gurugram traffic police received similar complaints from Panipat and Faridabad. A 38-year-old resident of Panipat received a challan for jumping red signal from Gurugram police in January andreceived another challan from the Delhi police in the last week of March. The victim who had never visited any of the cities met police alleging that they have wrongly sent challans to him. An investigation was carried out, during which it was found someone was using his Enfield Bullet’s registration number plate and had violated traffic rules and regulations 13 times in a span of three months. “The victim was adamant and asked for proof. Police took CCTV footage from a few locations and showed him the clippings, after which it was clear that some unidentified person was using his registration number on a stolen motorbike since January 2021,” said Balhara. After the incident came to the fore, police started receiving similar complaints and the registration number of 13 vehicles, such as Innova, Ciaz, Honda City, Corolla, and Eco Sport, were found in use by criminals to escape police action. Commissioner of police K K Rao said their I-CCC is not only helping in recovering stolen vehicles but also tracking other vehicle-related crimes. “We have written to other districts to share if they have registered similar complaints. We have formed teams to arrest people involved in such cases,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-man-arrested-for-driving-suv-with-number-plate-of-another-car-101642189751594.html

15-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram: Senior sanitary inspector fined for failing to clear waste||A senior sanitary inspector (SSI) of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has been fined by the Haryana Right to Service Commission for failing to clear waste in Sector 12-A area despite being served a suo moto notice by the commission last month and for giving unsatisfactory response in the matter, said a release that the district administration came out with on Friday. It is for the first time that the commission has taken any action against an MCG official. Last week, the SSI, Rishi Malik, was appointed as MCG’s nodal officer for biomedical waste collection.The matter pertains to a complaint raised by a resident of Sector 12-A area, regarding the failure of the MCG in collecting waste from streets and roads in his area.The SSI and a sub-divisional officer (SDO) of the MCG both appeared before the commission via video conference on Tuesday. Both the officials were served a suo moto notice by the commission on December 13 last year. The SDO was issued a notice for a matter pertaining to the flow of drain water in Sector 12-A area and his statement was accepted during the hearing.According to the order shared by T C Gupta, the chief commissioner of Haryana Right to Service Commission, the SSI said that Gurugram district is divided into six sanitation zones and that Sector 12-A falls under zone two, which was under his supervision at the time of the complaint and that he has 1,600-1,700 sweepers at his disposal. Municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja also submitted a reply in the matter before the commission for perusal.“The reply given by the SSI is unsatisfactory in view of the fact that there is clear cut demarcation of district Gurugram into zones for sanitation purpose and a fleet of 1,600-1,700 sweepers and also many supervisors...to manage the sweepers have been placed at this disposal. The MCG commissioner has indirectly admitted in his reply that the area was dirty and there was a lot of garbage that had not been lifted or cleaned, and the same was done only after the intervention of the Haryana Right to Service Commission,” said the order. The order further states that the photographs sent by the MCG commissioner clearly proved that the area was not cleaned before the intervention of the commission. “It is evident that he (the SSI) has failed to deliver this notified service within the stipulated timeline by not cleaning the area, including green belts for many days. He had adequate resources at his command and it is painful that he has not utilized these sweepers, supervisory officers, ASIs (assistant sanitary inspectors) and SIs (sanitary inspectors) allotted to him prudently and efficiently,” said Gupta’s order. The commission ordered the senior sanitary inspector to deposit a fine of ₹20,000 in the state treasury within 30 days of issuance of these orders. If the amount is not deposited within the given time, further action will be taken by the commission as per law.Malik declined to comment on the matter.“The area in Sector 12-A has been cleaned and the latest photographs of the area has been submitted before the commission for perusal. The SSI is in the process of submitting the fine amount,” said a senior MCG official in the sanitation wing of the civic body. The commission further found the SSI and the SDO to be “ignorant and lacking sensitization” for being unaware of the services pertaining to MCG notified under Haryana Right to Service Commission and timelines thereof. They directed the MCG commissioner to organize training, either online or through video conference, keeping in mind Covid-19 restrictions, regarding the commission’s services for all MCG employees within 30 days of issuance of these orders and report compliance on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-senior-sanitary-inspector-fined-for-failing-to-clear-waste-101642189510125.html

Currently, the district has 34,855 units registered with the MSME portal, which, according to officials, are operating normally even as some curbs have been imposed due to the rising Covid 19 cases. The department has also set up a help desk at the district MSME centre at IDC in Sector 16, to facilitate the registration of new and existing firms, said officials. Singh also said of the 34,855 units, 33,000 units are registered on the Udhyam registration portal of the central government and the remaining are there on the Haryana Udhyam portal of the state government. According to the department, all the medium.and small units would get the benefit of subsidy and other amenities from the government only if they are registered on these portals. The two portals where the firms have to get registered are udyamregistration.gov.in and harudhyam.edisha.gov.in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-firms-asked-to-register-on-msme-portal-101642189150223.html

15-01-2022||Noida||All eyes on BJP’s list for Ghaziabad, party may go with sitting MLAs on all five seats||After several major political parties released their lists of candidates for the five assembly seats of Ghaziabad, all eyes are now on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is yet to announce any of its candidates. Speculation is rife that the party may again field its sitting MLAs on all five seats of Loni, Muradnagar, Sahibabad, Ghaziabad and Modinagar.The Uttar Pradesh assembly elections is scheduled to take place from February 10 to March 7 in seven phases with Ghaziabad going to polls under the first phase on February 10. Under phase 1, candidates began filing their nominations on January 14 and the last date to file nominations is January 21; nominations will be scrutinised on January 24, and the last date for withdrawal of nominations is January 27, as per the schedule announced by the Election Commission of India.While the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress formed an alliance during the 2017 assembly elections, this time the SP and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) are in alliance in western Uttar Pradesh and have fielded three candidates from Loni, Sahibabad and Modingar on Thursday. The Congress, which is contesting by itself, and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have also declared three candidates each in Ghaziabad, while the Bahujan Samaj Party has declared four candidates so far.Following speculations about BJP candidates, some of the party’s former office-bearers took to social media to voice their opinions about candidate selection.“I made a point which should be noted by the leaders about one assembly segment in Ghaziabad where a candidate has been given tickets three times in a row and if another ticket is given this time, how will other party workers take it? Tickets should go to deserving candidates and also to those who work hard for years,” said Ajay Sharma, former BJP president, Ghaziabad.In December 2017, Sharma was removed as district party chief after he allegedly staged a protest against the police in Raj Nagar and publicly opposed the wedding of a Hindu woman with a Muslim man.BJP office-bearers, however, said people raising questions on social media have not said anything against the party as yet.“Speculation is rife as our party has not released its list yet. If the names of any candidate is repeated this time, it will be the party’s decision. The list is likely to be released by Saturday,” said Sanjeev Sharma, Ghaziabad BJP president.Ever since the announcement of elections earlier this week, several BJP MLAs, including three ministers, have resigned from the party. These include ministers Swami Prasad Maurya and Dharam Singh Saini, who have now joined the Samajwadi Party in the presence of party chief Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow on Friday.“In UP, the chariot of the country’s biggest party is slowing down and people in the BJP are fleeing the party… People should think whether these people or party can provide better facilities for you and your children. The AAP government and Arvind Kejriwal delivered what they promised in Delhi,” said AAP leader Manish Sisodia, who is also the deputy chief minister of Delhi, in a virtual rally on Friday.He reiterated his party’s poll promises for Uttar Pradesh. “You have seen every party in UP but only the AAP can provide all these facilities to people in UP. We are the alternative,” Sisodia said.The BJP officer bearers, however, dismissed AAP as being a major challenge.“They have fielded candidates in the past, too, from Ghaziabad but all of them lost. This party has no presence in Ghaziabad or Uttar Pradesh and they are just contesting the election to make their presence felt. Our main fight is with the Samajwadi Party,” BJP’s city chief Sharma said.Meanwhile, party leaders, requesting anonymity, said anti-incumbency will come into play if candidates in Ghaziabad are repeated. However, the BJP spokesperson disagreed.“On Friday, we held a meeting with our partners in the National Democratic Alliance. Those who have left the party recently have gone on their own as their aspirations (of getting tickets or posts) could not be fulfilled. They joined our party for this reason. However, it will not impact our prospects during this election,” said Chandra Mohan, party spokesperson and secretary of the BJP state unit.“We expect no anti-incumbency in case candidates are repeated. In the 2019 general elections, we all saw that there was no anti-incumbency,” he said.
15-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram: Cops probe demat accounts of BSF officer involved in ₹150 crore fraud||Police on Friday said that they were scanning demat accounts of the Border Security Force (BSF) deputy commandant who was arrested with three others this week for allegedly duping owners of four construction firms by awarding them fake contracts to carry out work on the National Security Guard (NSG) campus in Manesar. Police said four other people allegedly involved in the ₹150-crore fraud were on the run and teams had been formed to arrest them from Punjab and Haryana. Police said the deputy commandant, Praveen Yadav, masterminded the fraud, posed as an IPS officer posted to National Security Guard (NSG), Manesar, and claimed to provide construction contracts for various work on the campus. Police confirmed that Praveen was actually on deputation at NSG, Manesar, for three years till May 2021, and misused his ID card to gain access to the campus after his tenure was over. He was in charge of fencing, solar plants and other construction-related work while he was posted to NSG.The NSG is part of the Indian special forces under the ministry of home affairs. According to police, Praveen allegedly duped four owners of city-based construction firms by providing them with letters of intent and copies of fake tender contracts and also made them deposit money in an account with a private bank, in the name of “Office of GC (Garrison), Station HQ, NSG, Manesar”, on the pretext that it was earnest money for tender allocation. Police identified the other suspects as Praveen’s wife Mamta Yadav, sister Ritu Raj Yadav and his friend Dinesh Kumar. Police said Yadav would show his identity card, photograph, designation and visit the campus on multiple occasions with the contractors to win their trust. “He would present his NSG identity card with his photograph and designation as group commander. The contractors believed him as it is not possible to enter the NSG campus without being posted there, and all the security officials knew him,” said Sangwan, adding that he forged NSG seals to issue the allotment letters. Police said the contractors have complained against eight people in total, including Praveen’s father and brother-in-law, who are on the run. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said Praveen had opened demat accounts. “We are scanning his accounts to get exact details of transactions he made. Also, we are scanning other accounts he opened in his relatives’ names to trace the money,” he said. Sangwan said Praveen rented a house in Zirakpur, Punjab, withdrew some cash and kept it at the house. He hired a housekeeper but he was not aware of the cash in the house. “Praveen was planning to flee the country but had applied for premature retirement from the BSF and was waiting for his relieving letter as he wanted his pension. The process took time, due to which his plan got delayed and he was arrested,” he said. Sangwan said Praveen’s sister Ritu’s husband, an assistant commandant posted to NSG, Manesar, is also under the scanner, and is on the run. “We expect to recover more cash from their possession,” he said. NSG and BSF could not be reached for comment despite multiple attempts.

15-01-2022||Bangalore||Explain why you missed deadline, SC asks Karnataka on admissions for 633 MDS seats||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday called for an explanation from the Karnataka government for holding counselling for the Master of Dental Surgery (MDS) course long after the cutoff date for counselling prescribed by the Centre and Dental Council of India expired.While the deadline for MDS counselling ended on November 20, 2021, the Karnataka government conducted counselling from December 4 to 18 and filled up 633 MDS seats across institutions in the state. But the future of the 633 post-graduate dental students in Karnataka hangs in balance after the Centre and the Dental Council of India (DCI) refused to recognize the admissions, pointing that the state government did not hold counselling within the stipulated period. They told the court that an exception cannot be made for Karnataka as the academic session for MDS has already begun.The matter reached the top court as one of the dental colleges in Karnataka filed a petition to request that the admissions be regularised.On Wednesday, when the matter was heard by a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna, the Karnataka government washed its hands off by saying that at the time of granting admissions, students were intimated of the consequences of the delayed counselling. 29 affected students also approached the court through advocate Charu Mathur seeking the court’s “compassion” and a direction to the government to retrospectively extend the MDS admission cutoff.The students further told the court that a delay in commencement of the 2021-22 session will automatically delay the next batch, and disturb in the academic cycle. The bench agreed to consider the issue after getting the state’s response.In its order of January 12, the bench said, “We direct the Secretary, Medical Education of the state government to file an affidavit explaining the circumstances in which the state of Karnataka breached the deadline of 20 November 2021. The affidavit shall be filed within a period of one week.” The matter has been posted for January 21. In the meantime, the court has allowed the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) and the Dental Council of India to file their respective responses.Additional solicitor general (ASG) KM Nataraj appearing for the Centre opposed the petition filed by the Maratha Mandals Nathajirao G Halgekar Institute of Dental Sciences and Research Centre. He said that MDS counselling across the country was conducted between November 10 and November 20 and all colleges stuck to the deadline. “The state of Karnataka was aware of the fact that the cut-off date was extended only till 20 November. Now classes have also begun. No occasion arises to extend the deadline.” DCI counsel Gaurav Sharma supported this stand, underlining that an exception cannot be made for one state.The petitioner college represented by senior advocate Shyam Divan told the court that the delay was not caused by the college as the responsibility for conducting counselling exclusively rested on the shoulders of the state government. “The state itself has delayed the process and carried out admissions beyond the deadline fixed by the Union Government. In all, 633 students have been admitted and if these admissions are not regularized, the colleges in the state will have no students for three years.”The court noted that Karnataka did not move any application in the Supreme Court for extension of the counselliing deadline. Additional advocate general (AAG) Nikhil Goel appearing for Karnataka stated that the state did ask the Centre to extend the time but the request was rejected. In these circumstances, the court said, “we find it necessary that the Karnataka government must explain the circumstances in which it carried out admissions beyond the deadline of 20 November.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/explain-why-you-missed-deadline-sc-asks-karnataka-on-admissions-for-633-mds-seats-101642187534406.html
15-01-2022||Chandigarh||Haryana private sector job quota: HC dismisses plea seeking early hearing||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday dismissed a plea filed seeking early hearing on the petitions challenging the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, which provides 75% reservation to local youth in private sector. The law, which comes into force on Saturday, was notified in November.The hearing was deferred as Haryana’s additional advocate general Jagbir Malik told the high court bench of justice Ajay Tewari and justice Pankaj Jain that there is no urgency involved and for next three months, the firms merely have to upload the data with regard to employees on the government mandated website. The hearing will now take place on February 2.The court was hearing a fresh plea by the Faridabad Industries Association, which demanded early hearing. The association had challenged the law in December demanding the Act be declared unconstitutional.In its detailed response to the issues raised by the association and other similar industry bodies, the government has argued that the law merely makes ‘geographical classification’ which is well permitted under the Constitution of India.“It is to protect right to life/livelihood of people domiciled in the state and to protect their health, living condition and their right to employment,” it said, arguing that the plea was not maintainable as the petitioner is “an artificial juristic person”, who cannot challenge a legislation.It further argues that no material facts placed by the association proves that it is prejudiced. Legislation enacted by the state is on a subject that squarely falls within its legislative domain, it has argued adding that it was enacted in compelling situation of increasing unemployment.“Industrialisation and urbanisation in the state has led to huge land acquisition which resultantly has reduced growth and employment opportunities in the agriculture sector,” it said, adding that the law nowhere discriminates any person on the ground of place of birth or residence but it provides employment to the local candidates on the basis of domicile.“…there is a distinction between the expression ‘place of birth’ and the expression ‘domicile’. Both reflect two different concepts. Reservation on the basis of ‘place of birth’ will definitely be hit by the provisions of the Constitution of India but employment on the basis of ‘domicile’ does not,” it claimed.It said the law is for 10 years and it will cease to have affect after 10 years. The 75% employment to the local candidate is restricted to only low paid jobs, the employers are not restricted to employ other higher skilled jobs getting more than ₹30,000 gross salary, it submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-private-sector-job-quota-hc-dismisses-plea-seeking-early-hearing-101642187533238.html
15-01-2022||Noida||2022 UP elections: First-time voters to play key role in Gautam Budh Nagar seats||Nearly 334,000 first-time voters are likely to play a key role in deciding the fate of candidates contesting from the three assembly seats -- Noida, Dadri and Jewar -- in Gautam Budh Nagar in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh elections, said officials on Friday.As Gautam Budh Nagar comes into the Phase I schedule, out of total seven phases planned in Uttar Pradesh by the Election Commission of India (ECI), the polling will take place on February 10 this year.The nomination filing in the district started on Friday, with the administration putting adequate force and arrangement in place for a peaceful process at the Surajpur district magistrate office, where the nomination papers will be submitted and reviewed. However, none of the candidates filed nomination papers on Day One. There are a total of 2,525,000 voters in the list this time, against the 1,624,000 voters in the 2019 general elections, according to officials.“According to the revised electoral roll, the total number of voters has gone up as compared to the previous electoral roll,” said Suhas LY, district election officer of Gautam Budh Nagar.Since Noida and Greater Noida (Dadri seat) are home to the migrant population who come in these cities for employment, much more compared to Jewar, which is a rural belt so far, as the urbanisation there will take some time, said administration officials. As a result, people keep moving to and from these two cities in large numbers, thereby impacting the electoral roll in every election. “The number of voters has gone up in Noida and Dadri seats because a large number of voters have shifted here into their homes or rented accommodations. However, since Jewar is a rural area, only 7% first-time voters have been added to the list,” said an administration official, requesting anonymity. There are 690,000 voters in Noida -- a 32% increase from 524,000 voters in the previous list of 2019 general elections, and there are 587,000 voters in Dadri -- nearly 33% from 441,000 voters in the previous list.“The first-time voters will play a key role in deciding the fate of the candidates, because they will vote for a party or candidate who will reach out to them strongly with a plan,” said Bhanu Pratap Jha, political science assistant professor at Delhi University.
15-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | BJP sees four-cornered fight for party ticket in central constituency||The saffron party, which is hoping to dislodge three-time Congress MLA Surinder Dawar from the Ludhiana central constituency in the upcoming assembly elections, is looking at a four-cornered contest for the party ticket with three state body leaders, and the daughter of a former cabinet minister in the fray. BJP state vice-president Parveen Bansal, treasurer Gurdev Sharma Debi, trade cell convener Dinesh Sarpal and former health minister Satpal Gosain’s daughter, district vice-president Rajeshwari Gosain, are likely to slug it out for the BJP ticket. The final decision will be taken by the party high command. The leaders have already started rounding up their troops, and have been mustering residents’ support in the central constituency. Bansal and Debi have gone so far as to opening offices to contest from the central constituency.Debi, who had contested the last election from the central constituency under the SAD-BJP alliance, had lost to Dawar by a whopping 20,000 votes, while Bansal has been losing the last two assembly elections from the north constituency to Congress’ Rakesh Pandey.Posturing himself as a possible candidate, Bansal said, “Since 1997, I have thrice been elected councillor from the central constituency, and have also served as senior deputy mayor from 2007 to 2012. My home has always been in this constituency and even when I contested from the north, I regularly tackled the issues being faced by people here.” Meanwhile, Debi said he had been continuously working for the constituency for the last five years, even when Bansal was busy in the north. “I believe the party will choose the candidate who has been working for the betterment of residents in the constituency.”Putting his best foot forward, Sarpal, who has been affiliated with the party for 15 years, said his involvement with the BJP’s trade cell could give him an edge. “The constituency is the hosiery hub, and I am also the president of the Ludhiana Hosiery Manufacturers’ Association. My forefathers have been living in the central constituency and I have also been active on social platforms.”The lone woman in the fray, Rajeshwari Gosain, says, “I have an edge over others as my father has won the assembly elections thrice from this constituency. I have worked with my father, and have been doing my best to ensure the betterment of people in the constituency ever since. People know us and admire our work.”Whoever gets the saffron party’s ticket will contest against Pritpal Singh Pali of the SAD-BSP alliance, and former Congress leader Ashok Prashar Pappi, who has joined the AAP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-bjp-sees-four-cornered-fight-for-party-ticket-in-central-constituency-101642187350034.html
15-01-2022||Chandigarh||Student exodus starts amid rise in Covid cases in Haryana||Amid the rise in Covid-19 cases and strict curbs imposed by the Haryana government, students, who had been staying as paying guests and in hostels, have started moving back to their villages.The reasons behind the student exodus is the government’s decision to shut down all colleges, public and private libraries and coaching institutes, besides cancelling all advertised jobs which will be now filled through the common entrance eligibility test being conducted by the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC).Ashish Lather, of Jind, said he had been preparing for the Haryana-based competitive exams for the last three years.“The government is playing with our dreams. First they imposed curbs by closing all educational institutes, and then they cancelled all proposed Class 3 and 4 exams. Now, the HSSC has decided to fill these vaccines through CET and we don’t know when it will be conducted,” he said.“My parents have asked me to come back home as they cannot afford to spend ₹8,000 per month on rent. After coaching institutes are reopened, I will come back to Rohtak,” he added.Pooja Kadyan, of Jhajjar, said she had been preparing for the Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU)’s PhD entrance examination but the authorities have increased the last date to fill the form for three more weeks.“The university has closed its hostel and library. I do not have any other option but to go back home. In villages, we suffer from internet connectivity issues and the atmosphere is also not good for studies,” she added.Rachna Malik, a former teacher, who runs a paying guest accommodation at Rohtak’s Dev Colony, said 60 of 85 youths have moved back to their villages after the government closed all coaching institutes.“The students left for their villages as the state government cancelled all proposed Class 3 and 4 jobs and another reason is the rise in Covid cases. They said they will return after coaching institutes are reopened. I don’t know why the government shut down educational institutes first. Our livelihood is dependent on students and the pandemic has hit us hard,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/student-exodus-starts-amid-rise-in-covid-cases-in-haryana-101642187291327.html
15-01-2022||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Here, there and everywhere||And, for a Saturday, in tribute to the late great Busybee, presenting a few stray thoughts, and a few general observations (all my own work) on how the coronavirus pandemic has upended our lives beyond recognition.Like, it’s been two years since the coronavirus reared its ugly head in our midst and you still feel not a single person has been able to accurately describe the full extent of the ghastliness and horror that it has wrought on our lives.Like, however ghastly and challenging your experience of it has been so far, you know you’re still better off than if you’d been a parent to a house bound toddler or teenager on interminable vacation from their school or college. Like, at a time when everyone appears to have learnt a new skill or language, written a bestselling book or a TV script, or mastered an instrument, you alone appear to have achieved nothing but a new international benchmark for sloth and procrastination.Like, your most enduring relationships these past two years appear to be with your Amazon and Swiggy delivery boys.Like, things are beginning to look promising in this regard, with the lab technician at your local testing agency too.Like, for an outstanding back bencher in chemistry – not to mention biology - during your school days, you never imagined you’d know so much about both subjects in your adult life, all thanks to WhatsApp.Like, now that masks have become such an intrinsic part of our daily lives, you wonder if anyone has noticed that they are one of the only items associated with both Superheroes as well as their counterpart Super Villains - and if there’s any deep meaning in this.Like, you often find yourself marvelling at how little has got done since the pandemic began and conversely, how much too.Like, apocalyptic, doomsday films such as ‘Don’t Look Up’ suddenly don’t seem like satire any more.Like, you’ve lost count of the people you’ve lost in these past two years or the many occasions when you’ve had to type out condolences messages on social media to their loved ones. Like you wonder if you’re the only one who’s reserved emojis to convey them now, because you’re fast running out of words.Like, how the words ‘Hope all is well and safe’ have become auto generated on your phone.Like, the entire pandemic appears to be an endless rerun of March 2020 when the first wave appeared. And March 2021, when the second wave washed over us. And looking at the coming months it appears Shakespeare was right about the Ides of March being ominous from the get go.Like, at this stage, among the blessings you find yourself counting is the fact that you don’t have to hoard toilet rolls any more, or sanitize your vegetables before you bring them into your home.Like, you often find yourself looking at your shoe and handbag collections, wondering who the person was who’d bought them and what she had been thinking. Ditto for lipsticks and earrings. And almost 90% of the rest of the contents of your cupboards.Like, now that the wearing of masks has made sunglasses redundant - who needs that much anonymity and all that fogging up ? - you have nightmares of ginormous landfills piling up with mountains of discarded pairs creating further ecological disasters for the planet .Like, how you finally understand the meaning of First World and Third World when you realize that in some countries political leaders get away with holding election rallies for thousands during the pandemic while in others, a prime minister can lose his job for attending an office Christmas party attended by 30 colleagues and staff members.Like, whatever others say about the advantages of technology bringing the world closer during the pandemic, you cannot help noting that you’ve felt an impending sense of Zoom most of this time.Like, you often find yourself wondering what will be the pandemic’s long term impact on human relations in light of the recent experiment to study the impact of face masks on the readability of emotions, which concluded that people’s emotional reading was strongly hampered by the presence of a mask.Like, whereas you’ve gotten used to the fact that no one recognizes you when you are wearing a mask, leave alone the expressions on your face, the fact that even your cell phone doesn’t recognize you feels like a low blow.Like, you find yourself thinking the trade-off between not having to wear a bra most of the time and having to wear a mask in public is a pretty decent one, all things considered.Like, you watched the recent viral film of ostriches escaping from a Chinese zoo and felt a sudden and unmistakable desire to join them.Like, whereas 76% of Mumbai’s populace is said to follow correct mask protocol, it appears as if you only keep meeting the remaining 24%.Like, there are some people who seem to have found a hundred different highly creative ways to wear their masks – and none of them have to do with covering their noses and mouths.Like, you never imagined that the sight of someone’s exposed proboscis in a public space would drive you to such extremes of irritation and unease.Like, there ought to be a special kind of hell for people who go out in public forgetting to wear their masks, but not their mascara or their eye shadow.Like, there are teenagers all over the world who’ve been in more lockdowns and quarantines today than relationships.Like, you can’t help thinking that there is something sad about the forced buoyancy in most post pandemic shows of revelry.Like, as you keep adjusting to the new normal, you often find yourself remembering that allegory of frogs in a pan being lulled into a false complacency by being cooked over a slow flame.Like, the pandemic has made you realize that ASAP can also mean ‘as slowly as possible’.Like, one of the sadnesses of the pandemic- albeit a very minor one - is that you cannot smile at passing strangers and random kids any more while being stuck at a traffic light on account of your mask. What’s worse is of course that you can’t see anyone else smile back at you either. Like you wish you could be more upbeat about things 24X7 but it’s hard to be positive when everyone around you, including yourself, is testing positive. And this final observation: like, if you think you’ve got it bad, imagine the plight of poor Karan Johar and his extreme levels of FOMO on account of all those cancelled parties on his social calendar, as he is now reduced to tagging along with his twins to theirs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-here-there-and-everywhere-101642187289433.html
15-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi records 24,000 Covid cases, positivity rate at 30%||The Capital’s daily Covid-19 case count dropped by nearly 4,500 on Friday amid a dip in testing the previous day, even as the positivity rate shot past the 30% mark for the first time in over eight-and-a-half months. Delhi added 24,383 cases of Covid-19, down from 28,867 on Thursday, the largest single-day spike in the city ever. However, the city also collected nearly 20,000 samples on Friday, compared to the previous day, a testing dip that authorities attributed to Lohri on Thursday. The city also added 34 deaths of the infection. So far in January this year, 198 in Delhi have lost their lives to Covid-19, and 25,305 have died over the course of the pandemic. “Despite new cases arriving every day for the past few days, the number of patients admitted to the hospital is currently stable. But people should still be cautious and follow all Covid appropriate behaviour,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Friday.The test positivity rate, however, continued its upward surge, the sampling dip notwithstanding, breaching the 30% for the first time since May 1 last year (soon after the height of the fourth wave of infections). Of the 79,578 samples collected, according to Friday’s health bulletin, 30.64% returned positive results, up from 29.21% a day ago. Just over 92,000 people in Delhi are currently battling Covid-19. This number, known as the active case count, dipped (from 94,160 on Thursday) for the first time in over three weeks, as 26,326 people recovered from the virus, according to Friday’s bulletin, the most in a day since May 1 last year, To be sure, hospitalisation numbers in the city are comparatively low, with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus (which is behind the ongoing infection surge) causing far fewer admissions than earlier configurations of the virus. State government data showed that 2,529 patients in Delhi are hospitalised, up marginally from 2,424 a day ago. Nearly 13,000 of the city’s 15,478 hospital beds are still vacant, with the state in a position to ramp up to 37,000 oxygen beds overnight, if required. Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant (internal medicine), Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, said, “It seems like we are still at the peak of infections but maybe in the coming week we can see cases lowering. But we cannot say for sure. Compared to the last week, I am definitely receiving fewer calls for consultations. This could perhaps be seen as a positive sign.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-records-24-000-covid-cases-positivity-rate-at-30-101642187229983.html
15-01-2022||Noida||GB Nagar reports 1813 new Covid-19 cases, district registers spike in recoveries||Noida: Gautam Budh Nagar on Friday reported 1,813 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), taking the district’s tally of active cases to 11,942, the highest in Uttar Pradesh. The district also reported a sharp spike in recoveries-- 624--in the last 24 hours, said officials.On Thursday, the number of recoveries was 207. According to officials, the sudden rise in the number of recoveries on Friday is due to the completion of mandatory isolation requirements for Covid patients according to the Central government’s guidelines.WHAT ARE THE GUIDELINES“The patients who tested positive in the district at the beginning of this month are now recovering and hence the total number of cured patients per day has increased. We are expecting more recoveries and the tally of patients who recover every day may cross 1,000 in the coming days,” said a senior health department official, requesting anonymity.The district health department’s Integrated Command Control Centre (ICCC) has been calling patients in home isolation to enquire about the status of their health.“The ICCC call centre as well as Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) have been making at least 4,000 calls per day to patients in home isolation to enquire about their health. As we receive information about them testing negative, we update the same in our database,” said Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.Residents of Gautam Budh Nagar can call the ICCC helpline number --1800-419-2211--to ask for details about testing, hospitals and other information.While the number of recoveries may be increasing, the positivity rate—ratio of samples that test positive from the total number of samples tested-- is still high. On Friday, the district’s positivity rate was recorded at 30% -- a sharp spike from Thursday’s 27.8% .However, district health officials said that the number of hospitalisations and critical cases remains low.“The district has notified 11 Covid-19 facilities, in which there are around 1,800 Covid beds. However, there are only 95 patients hospitalised right now, with one patient on oxygen support, that too as a precautionary measure due to comorbidities. Hence, the high positivity rate indicates that the district is testing and tracking efficiently, but there is no reason to panic,” said a senior health official, requesting anonymity.Medical experts said that positivity rate is expected to increase as the current wave of the pandemic is yet to pea.“The number of Covid-19 cases in Gautam Budh Nagar is yet to peak, hence positivity rate has increased. We are expecting the cases will peak in the next five to seven days after which there will be a sharp decline. Meanwhile, the high rate of recovery is also a healthy trend, as patients are not presenting severe symptoms and only 2% of all cases are requiring hospitalisation,” said Dr Sunil Awana, president, Indian Medical Association (Noida chapter).
15-01-2022||Gurugram||Damdama Lake restoration work to start by end of January||The district administration is planning to start the ground study for restoration of Damdama lake by the end of this month after it signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the team of Namami Gange, which will provide the technical support for the project, said officials on Friday. The Namami Gange is a flagship programme of the Union government launched to accomplish the twin objectives of effective abatement of pollution, conservation and rejuvenation of GangaOfficials said the project will be undertaken in two phases. First, a pre-study will be conducted to understand the history of the lake where in the hydrological aspects, such as contour level, quality and level of ground water, catchment area, among other aspects will be taken into consideration. The second phase will be implementation of the results of the pre-study with the technical support from the Namami Gange team. Osho Kalia, a senior member from GuruJal (the district administration’s water management team) who is working on the project, said, “Our main aim is to ensure that the waterbody becomes a perennial lake. Currently, water is available in the lake only for a few months after monsoon. We are likely to sign an MoU with different agencies by the end of this month and start the pre-study, which we are aiming to complete by the end of this year.” Spread across 75 acres, Damdama lake acts as a natural water reservoir in Sohna and is one of the biggest lakes in Haryana. It is the last surviving natural lake of Delhi-NCR. Vaishali Rana, a city based environmentalist, said, “Damdama lake is one of the most crucial lakes for ground water recharge in Gurugram and a source of water for wildlife in the Aravallis. With encroachment and deforestation in the catchment area of the lake, it has been reduced to one third of what it used to be earlier. The restoration of the lake is every important from both a wildlife perspective and for the increasing population of Gurugram.”In the third week of December last year, the district administration conducted a meeting with all stakeholders of the project and set a target of the coming monsoon for the restoration of the lake. Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of Gurugram, had said before starting the restoration work, it was important to study other important aspects, such as geographical location.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/damdama-lake-restoration-work-to-start-by-end-of-january-101642187112881.html

15-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ambala-Saharanpur railway line blocked for hours in Yamunanagar||Some residents of the Mustafabad (now Saraswati Nagar) area of Yamunanagar blocked the Ambala-Saharanpur railway track near Uncha Chandana village on Friday, demanding stoppage of passenger trains at the Mustafabad railway station.The track remained blocked for at least three hours till an assurance from railway officials, leading to cancellation of the Ambala-Saharanpur passenger train (04532) and delayed many other goods and passenger trains, the spokesperson of the Ambala railway division said.In the morning, the villagers held a panchayat in the area with support of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni), pressing for the demand.Sanju Gudiana, unit president of the union, said during the panchayat, the villagers asked the railway employees at the station to call senior divisional officials within two hours but when no official reached, they decided to block the railway track.“From past several years, passenger trains used to halt at this station but the service was discontinued due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But when trains resumed operations, villagers asked for a stoppage due to daily travel issues they faced, but no one paid any heed to their demands,” he added.However, soon after the protesters laid siege to the tracks, additional divisional railway manager (operations) Karn Singh and senior divisional commercial manager Hari Mohan reached the site.Singh said the issue is expected to get clear within a week as it has already been placed before the railway board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambalasaharanpur-railway-line-blocked-for-hours-in-yamunanagar-101642187050151.html
15-01-2022||Delhi||6 of 7 kids who died of Covid in Delhi from Jan 9-12 had comorbidities||Of seven children who died of Covid-19 between January 9 and January 12, six had severe co-morbidities, according to a report by the Delhi government. In those four days, 97 Covid-positive patients died in Delhi’s hospitals, of whom only eight were fully vaccinated and 19 others had got one jab of the vaccine, highlighting the vulnerability of the unvaccinated during the ongoing Covid-19 surge, which has been fuelled by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.Of the seven children, five were younger than 15. Vaccines in India are only available to those aged 15 and above.The government report showed that of the seven children who died, three were infants (younger than a year-old). The first infant was previously with disseminated intravascular coagulation, a condition affecting the blood’s ability to clot. The child was admitted to Delhi government’s Lok Nayak Hospital on January 8, after testing Covid-19 positive on January 9. Doctors treating the infant said that the deterioration in her condition was primarily because of the pre-existing medical condition. The second infant was also admitted to Lok Nayak Hospital on January 7 and was tested positive the next day. She died on January 10. The Delhi government report said that the child had a “heart condition”, without revealing any more details of the ailment. The third infant was admitted to Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya on January 6 and tested positive the next day during the mandatory Covid test. The child, however, also had a pre-existing condition— thalassemia major, an inherited blood disorder characterised by less oxygen-carrying protein (haemoglobin) and fewer red blood cells in the body than normal. Of the three others, a six-year-old girl who died on January 12 had a liver disease; a five-year-old patient, who also died on January 12 had a liver disease; and another 16-year-old child who died on January 12 was suffering from extra pulmonary tuberculosis. The teenager was on anti-tuberculosis treatment and had severe anaemia and reportedly died of hypovolemic shock (a severe loss of fluid in the body). “Technically, it would be misleading to term these as Covid-19 deaths because a majority of them [children] had pre-existing medical conditions. It would also create unnecessary panic among people,” said a senior health department official. Health experts said comorbid conditions increase the risk of mortality during an infection. “It is not just Omicron. Any infection among people with pre-existing conditions becomes more risky as compared to a healthy person. Plus, it is also important to note that children below the age of 15 are also the unvaccinated lot,” said Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant (internal medicine), Indraprastha Apollo Hospital.
15-01-2022||Chandigarh||Save girl child fight of Haryana suffers eight points dip in sex ratio at birth||The Haryana government’s flagship programme to stop female foeticide has registered an eight-point dip in sex ration at birth (SRB) in 2021, according to official data.It is for the first time that the SRB, a critical indicator of gender equality, has dropped by eight points after the ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ programme was launched in January 2015 from Panipat by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The health department data showed that the SRB stood at 914 female births per 1,000 males in 2021 even as it was 922 in 2020. In 2019, Haryana’s SRB at 923 was the highest the state had achieved in a decade.The SRB of Haryana was recorded 833 in 2011, 876 in 2015 and 900 in 2016. In 2017 and 2018, it remained 914 and registered nine-point growth by jumping to 923 in 2019.The first signs of slip in the SRB had emerged when the cumulative SRB till June 2021 had dipped to 911, from 920 in the corresponding period till June 2020.Later, Haryana had registered another dip in the SRB between January and September 2021 as 906 girls were born per 1,000 boys till September in comparison to 915 during the corresponding period in 2020.According to Dr Amit Kumar Agrawal, additional principal secretary (to CM) and nodal officer ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’, one of the key reasons behind this dip are issues related to birth data registration which are causing this variation.“The decline (in SRB) is evident, but it is a minor dip,” said Dr Agrawal, blaming the glitches in the birth registration system for the SRB dip.Health officials attribute the inability to meet the SRB targets to multiple factors, including the touts involved in gender determination tests taking advantage of the challenges the Covid-19 pandemic has been posing to the field staff, besides the steps taken to eliminate possibilities of manipulation in birth registration data.Total 5,27,967 births were registered in 2021 which included 2,75,911 male births and 2,52,056 female births. In 2020, total 5,37,996 births were registered including 2,79,869 male births and 2,58,127 female births.Hence, the number of total births registered in 2021 were 10,029 (6,071 females and 3,958 males) less than the total births recorded in 2020.Officials said steps have been taken to deal with the malpractice of sex determination and female foeticide in the last five years during which about 1,000 raids were conducted. Of these, over 275 were inter-state and about 970 FIRs were registered with regard to sex determination and the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act.Dr Agrawal said the true picture will emerge after the census data is released this year.“We should wait for another three-four months... There is a delay in registration of births as well. Nevertheless, we are doing our best to catch people involved in gender determination tests. We are on our toes and maintaining pressure on the touts,” Dr Agrawal, added.Rohtak leads, Sonepat laggingThe SRB of 10 districts last year ranged between 914 and 945, while the SRB of nine districts was between 903 and 913. The SRB of three districts slipped below 900.Rohtak led the state with an SRB of 945, followed by Panchkula 930, Sirsa 929, Nuh 926, Hisar 925, Jind 923, Kurukshetra 921, Charkhi Dadri 919, Panipat 918, Yamunanagar 914, Kaithal 913, Karnal 912, Gurugram and Ambala 908 each, Palwal 907, Mahendergarh and Bhiwani 904 each, Faridabad and Rewari 903 each, Fatehabad 899, Jhajjar 895, and Sonepat 888.In 2020, Sirsa was leading with 949 SRB, while Charkhi Dadri was at the bottom with 891 SRB.Kaithal, Ambala, Fatehabad and Sonepat districts were among the top 10 best performing districts in 2020, but in 2021 Sonepat and Fatehabad were at the first and third slot from the bottom, while Kaithal and Ambala slipped to the 12th and 14th positions, respectively.Rohtak improved its SRB from 912 in 2020 to 945 in 2021, while Gurugram’s SRB was 921 in 2020 and dipped further to 908 in 2021.In Muslim-dominated Nuh district, the highest 55,293 number of births were registered followed by Faridabad (45,696) and Gurugram (38,241).Haryana’s spirited fight to save the girl child suffered setbacks which became evident when in a recent interaction with journalists in Delhi, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had admitted that the state government could not maintain its focus on improving the sex ratio in last two years due to the Covid-19 outbreak, despite registering around 300 cases against those conducting sex determination tests.

Thereafter, plinth will be laid and it is expected to be completed by the end of March.Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust has set a deadline to complete all work related with the temple’s base by March.The Trust has decided to start construction of the main structure of Ram temple from the festive occasion of Chaitra Navratri. The nine-day Hindu festival is starting from April 2, which also marks Hindu New Year.“The main structure of Ram temple will start coming up from April this year. Engineers are working round the clock to complete the work on time,” Champat Rai, general secretary, Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust, told media persons on Friday evening.More than 250 labourers and 35-40 engineers are working round the clock at Ram Janmabhoomi to finish the temple’s raft and plinth work by the end of March.Vinod Mehta, project manager, Larsen and Toubro (the company carrying out construction work of Ram temple), assured that laying of stones for the temple’s main structure would start in April.At present, casting of the raft above the temple’s foundation is going on. A raft foundation is used when the soil is weak. It helps distribute the weight of the building over the entire area of the building, reducing the stress on the soil.Plinth is the lowest part of a building and it works as a base for any structure. It is in the form of a rectangular block or slab.The Trust has already set a deadline to enthrone Ram Lalla (infant Lord Ram) in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple in Ayodhya by December 2023 to allow devotees to worship the deity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ram-temple-s-main-structure-to-start-coming-up-in-april-trust-101642186869958.html

Deputy commissioner Yash Garg issued directions that all such commercial establishments, where people come to stay and visit their guests, must maintain a record of the visitors, along with an identity proof, in view of the heightened security arrangements. The directions were issued under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and will remain in force from January 20 to 26.

15-01-2022||Noida||With 1,963 fresh Covid cases, Ghaziabad records highest single-day spike ever||The district on Friday recorded 1,963 fresh Covid cases -- the highest single-day spike since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 -- pushing the tally of active cases across the 10,000-mark to 10,604.According to official records of the district health department, the previous largest single-day spike was 1,788 cases on April 30, 2021, during the second wave.Since January 10, the district has been recording over 1,000 cases daily, and the total number of cases since the start of the pandemic has gone up to 67,366, including the 11,452 cases recorded in January.About 11,047 of 11,452 cases in January were recorded in the last 10 days (since January 5), when the district ramped up daily testing and conducted more than the daily target of 7,400 assigned to it by the government.According to district health officials, 395 patients were discharged between Thursday and Friday, taking the tally of discharged patients to 56,301. The number of patients who died due to Covid so far in the district is 461.“There is an increase in daily cases because we received about 3,000 pending test reports in the past 24 hours from a lab in Lucknow where we had to send the samples, as the labs in the region were overburdened. The present trend of cases indicates that the cases will be on the higher side in the coming days. We expect cases to decline only by the end of the month,” said Dr Sunil Tyagi, additional chief medical officer.“About 395 patients recovered in home isolation and were marked as discharged on Friday. This is due to the effect of changes made to the portal after the government revised the home isolation period from 10 days to seven days. The revision will also increase our recovery rate,” Dr Tyagi added.Officials said that the reduction of the home isolation period from 10 days to seven days will significantly reduce the number of active cases because patients who stay in home isolation are marked as active. However, once they are discharged in a lesser number of days, it will lessen the number of such cases.On Friday, the district health department reported 1,963 Covid cases after testing 9,690 samples, leading to a positivity rate of 20.26% -- the highest single-day positivity rate during the present wave.Positivity rate refers to the percentage of people who test positive for the virus compared to those who have been tested for it.The district last recorded its highest positivity rate during the present wave on January 11 -- 18.72%.“The present wave is less severe and no deaths have taken place so far. Patients are getting better in 3-5 days. However, if the symptoms persist for a longer duration, it is a cause of concern. So, the present infection could be due to Omicron variant, and if these symptoms persist for a longer duration, it could mean other variants such as Delta, which is more severe and requires extensive clinical intervention,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter).“At present, there are 84,440 active cases in Uttar Pradesh, 82,412 of whom are in home isolation. This indicates that the severity of infection is low and only a few people require hospitalisation. Still, everyone should observe all Covid-related precautions,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health).

Officials said three colonies were being developed in the area without any permission or licence. R S Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said 20 under-construction structures, 59 plinths and 10 boundary walls were demolished. “We had issued notices to the encroachers and property owners but they did not give any satisfactory answer. These colonies are illegal and demolition had to be carried out,” he said. According to the department, Sector 93 is a residential sector while Sector 94 has been designated as an open space. “Any construction or development of a colony in this area requires permission from the state government and license from the department of town and country planning,” said officials. Bhath also said after taking action against the illegal colonies on the eastern and southern side of the city, they have now decided to focus on areas along the Dwarka expressway as they have been getting complaints of encroachments. “We have asked our teams to conduct a survey along the Dwarka expressway and identify illegal colonies. We also appeal to buyers not to invest in such colonies as their all their savings would get stuck,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-town-planning-department-demolishes-illegal-colonies-in-sectors-93-94-101642186511247.html
15-01-2022||Chandigarh||With 1,808 Covid cases, Ludhiana records highest single-day spike so far||With 1,808 more people testing positive for the coronavirus on Friday, the district registered a triple-fold increase in cases — the highest single-day spike so far. The fresh infections have broken the previous single-day record of 1,729 cases, which had been detected on May 9, 2021. Seven more people lost their battle with the virus – the highest in seven months. Those who succumbed include an 89-year-old resident of Omaxe Residency, a 53-year-old woman of Haibowal Kalan, a 71-year-old man of Basti Jodhewal, a 72-year-old man of GTB Nagar, a 73-year-old man of Narinder Nagar, a 92-year-old woman of Khud Mohalla and a 45-yea--old man from Dhandari Kalan.Now, the district’s Covid count has climbed to 94,619, of which 2,134 patients have succumbed to the virus, and 86,729 patients have recovered. Active cases in Ludhiana stand at 5,756, of which 5,660 people are under home isolation. There are 15 active micro containment zones in the district. Civil Surgeon SP Singh said, “It is concerning that the number of cases have increased from 18 (December 31) to 1,808 (January 14) in two weeks. Residents should take precautions and get themselves fully vaccinated. Carelessness, especially during New Year, contributed to the spike in cases. Most patients who succumbed had comorbidities.” Virus’ trajectoryThe number of cases have increased from 18 (December 31) to 1,808 (January 14) in two weeksJanuary 8: 561 January 9: 509January 10: 806January 11: 678January 12: 724January 13: 670January 14: 1,808||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/with-1-808-covid-cases-ludhiana-records-highest-single-day-spike-so-far-101642186391818.html
15-01-2022||Mumbai||BMC makes it mandatory for buyers of Covid-19 self-testing kits to share reports with BMC & ICMR||MUMBAI To ensure that citizens using Covid-19 self-testing kits maintain transparency about their test results, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday made it compulsory for every resident to share their test results with the civic body and upload the same on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) website, irrespective of whether the result is positive or negative.At present, seven self-test kits have been approved by the ICMR, including Coviself by Mylab, Covifind by Meril Diagnostics, and Panbio by Abott amongst others. The BMC said that regularly, 300,000 to 350,000 tests are being taken by citizens in Mumbai and a majority of these tests are going unreported.On Friday, the BMC said that the local BMC ward war room will verify the test results of each and every buyer of self-testing kits by contacting them. The BMC also said that if necessary, staff from the health department will visit the residence of the buyer and scrutinise the situation physically.“At the back of every self-testing kit, there is a QR code which directs the user to the ICMR website where they need to upload the test results along with their credentials. Most of the users were not doing it up until now which is why we have brought these new guidelines to check that these cases don’t stay unreported anymore,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner and in-charge of public health in the BMC.Earlier on Thursday night, the BMC issued detailed guidelines for manufacturers, distributors and sellers of self-testing kits. The BMC set up two new email identities, mcgm.hometests@gmail.com and whogmp.mhafda@gmail.com, with each identity to be monitored by the BMC Epidemic Cell and the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) in Mumbai. The BMC instructed buyers, sellers and distributors of these kits to maintain a record of buyers of these kits and share it regularly with the authorities through specified emails. The BMC also said that each seller should issue bills to the customer and in return, take down details such as telephone numbers and addresses from them which will be shared with the authorities mandatorily by 6 pm regularly. Following which, these details will be passed on to the local ward war room which will then verify the details. Kakani said that the BMC has also asked chemists to share their email identities with buyers so that they too can share the test results with authorities. “After the war room receives the details, they will check and verify if the reports have been uploaded on the ICMR website or if they have received any email from them. If not, they will contact buyers of these kits and seek their reports. If they are found to have tested positive, the war room will monitor their condition,” said Kakani. “In case we sense that any person is hiding reports, officials from the local ward office may visit their place to verify the status of their health physically,” Kakani added. He said that in the last 24 hours, 107,000 test reports from Maharashtra have been uploaded on the ICMR website out of which around 3,500 samples have tested positive. He said that the BMC predicts that at least 10% of the daily testing figures include figures of self-testing kits.“The guidelines will come into effect from today (January 14) and in the next one week, we are hopeful that these figures may also be recorded in the daily Covid-19 tally. These numbers will give us more clarity in understanding the present ongoing trend,” Kakani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-makes-it-mandatory-for-buyers-of-covid-19-self-testing-kits-to-share-reports-with-bmc-icmr-101642186274804.html
15-01-2022||Delhi||Manish Sisodia: BJP nervous, trying to shut down ‘Desh Ke Mentor’ plan||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was plotting to derail the Delhi government’s ‘Desh Ke Mentor’ programme by asking the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) to act against the scheme on a complaint by a party worker from Chhattisgarh. Sisodia’s comments came in response to the January 11 letter by the child rights body to the state government, in which the commission alleged that the programme, under which school students are provided career guidance by eminent citizens, “exposes them to certain dangers”, and asked the Delhi government to suspend it till the loopholes are “overhauled”.“BJP doesn’t want poor children to have a chance to attend world-class universities so it can spread hate and filth through its ‘WhatsApp University’. BJP is terrified of the success of poor children through ‘Desh Ke Mentor’ and is trying to stop the programme using a complaint by a BJP worker,” Sisodia said at a press briefing, asserting that the programme has checks and balances to leave no scope for abuse. Sisodia said that the BJP must keep their political agenda away from education, and let the Kejriwal government work. “Delhi government started a mentor programme. BJP got nervous about this programme and tried to stop it. They have given absolutely ridiculous reasons to stop this programme. We have a well designed process to assess and select mentors for our children of Delhi government schools. All those who apply for being mentors go through a psychometric test and then they are trained on all aspects of mentoring children. On the call of the Kejriwal government, 44,000 youngsters have joined this programme. All the statements and directions from NCPCR are politically motivated and are illogical,” Sisodia stated. Sisodia said that the Delhi government has responded to the NCPCR letter. “We replied to the commission that we are taking all precautions for children’s safety and use specially designed psychometric tests to assess mentors. But they have sent another notice highlighting that mentees (who are students of Delhi government schools) are not undergoing police verification and mentors (who are from reputed colleges and universities) might be involved in crimes related to children,” Sisodia said. The ‘Desh Ke Mentors’ programme was launched in October 2021, and is meant to connect 900,000 students of classes 9 to 12 in Delhi government schools with noteworthy citizens who will offer them career and general guidance. The mentors will engage with students over the phone for 10-15 minutes daily to guide them on various aspects of life, the government said while launching the programme.The programme has emerged as yet another sticking point between the AAP government in Delhi and the BJP-led central government. The two governments are already engaged in a legal tussle over the former’s doorstep delivery of ration scheme. In its letter, NCPCR said the fact that the interactions are done over the phone does not guarantee any protection from crime. “It may be noted that child related crime can be initiated through phone calls as well. For instance, children are susceptible to probable child trafficking through phone calls. Is there any mechanism to prevent origin of cybercrimes and child trafficking?,” the commission said.Sisodia said all students who have got mentors have submitted consent letters from their parents. “Also we have made sure that all female students are guided by female mentors and male students by male mentors. We have even rejected more than 750 people who applied for this programme but failed the psychometric test. Currently, 1.76 lakh children are being mentored under the programme,” Sisodia said. Responding to Sisodia’s comments, NCPCR chairperson Priyank Kanongoo alleged that the Delhi government is politicising the issue.“I want to ask them: Is this psychometric test a fool proof assessment of a person in terms of potential threat to any child? Is this psychometric test analysed, checked or scrutinised by professional practising experts? Can this psychometric test identify paedophiles or potential paedophiles,” he said in comments to PTI.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said AAP government’s response to the NCPCR’s letter reflects its “anarchic behaviour”. “NCPCR has not banned the mentorship programme, it has just sought suspension of the programme subject to legal clarifications. Why is the AAP government objecting to police verification of mentors. A mentor is like a guide or a teacher, and as per law credentials of every individual employed as teacher are verified by police,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/manish-sisodia-bjp-nervous-trying-to-shut-down-desh-ke-mentor-plan-101642186211179.html

15-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi CM Kejriwal inducts 100 low-floor AC buses to take fleet size to 6,900||In a big push to Delhi’s transport infrastructure and to further enhance public mobility, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday flagged off 100 low-floor AC CNG buses, taking the public transport bus fleet size to 6,900. Prior to this, Delhi saw 6,000 buses in the fleet of Delhi transport department during the 2010 Commonwealth Games. The new AC CNG buses will run from Ghumanhera depot in outer Delhi to cater to Delhi’s rural areas, on nine cluster bus routes in Delhi. Along with this, the Delhi Government is likely to bring in more CNG and electric buses in the coming days to further strengthen thee public transport system. Flagging off the buses from Rajghat cluster bus depot, Kejriwal said the buses were put to use from Friday. “A new bus depot has been developed in Ghumanhera. The buses will be stationed there and serve rural routes majorly. Overall, there are about 6,900 buses running on the roads of Delhi today. This is the highest number ever achieved by the state transport department. Prior to this, there used to be around 6,000 buses during the 2010 Commonwealth Games,” Kejriwal said. The new buses are Bharat Stage VI emission standard compliant, have foldable ramp for the differently abled, provide step-less boarding and alighting for passengers, CCTV cameras and panic buttons with hooters for women safety, live video streaming in case of an emergency, two way communication with the control room, GPS units for live tracking of buses, fully automatic transmission with rear engine, fire detection and suppression system and other features. The chief minister announced that Delhi will witness the infusion of buses at a larger scale very soon. “Electric buses are about to arrive, CNG buses are in the process, and DTC is getting its own fleet too. The whole process of procuring buses takes two to three years due to the several legalities involved. There was a dearth of buses when we came to power and we initiated the process of procuring buses right back then itself. Ever since then we’ve been seeing buses being rolled out from time to time to strengthen the public transport system. The Delhi government is committed towards taking the bus transport system of Delhi to the highest standards and will provide the best frequency on every single route,” Kejriwal said. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said Delhi’s buses now stand out as an example of safe, accessible and convenient transport system in the country. “A robust, efficient and well connected public transport system is our lifeline and we have huge plans to augment Delhi’s transport this year, be it bus, metro or depot infrastructure. We are also making a huge transition to electric -- the first electric bus is already in Delhi and ready to start operations. We are in the process of expanding our para-transit systems to ensure safe last-mile connectivity to every Delhi resident at any time of the day,” Gahlot said. Transport experts underlined the need to add more buses to strengthen the public transport infrastructure. “Public transport is critical for the sustainable development of the city. This is even more important with the ongoing Covid-19 crisis because cities operate public transport at low occupancy levels. Therefore, cities need to add more buses to maintain the level of service. This is where Delhi has shown leadership by adding more buses-- it has reinforced the importance of public transport in our cities,” said Amit Bhat, executive director (transport), WRI India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cm-kejriwal-inducts-100-low-floor-ac-buses-to-take-fleet-size-to-6900-101642185432432.html
15-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Digital soldiers driving Congress agenda, countering propaganda||On January 5, as all hell broke loose with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) launching a full-on attack on the Congress government in Punjab, demanding action for the “serious security lapse” during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s maiden visit to the poll-bound state in two years, the virtual world was flooded by a counteroffensive targeting the saffron party on the poor turnout at the Ferozepur rally that the PM was forced to skip. Short video clips, photos and posts with stinging captions using hashtags such as #70000Kursi700Bande, #Modi_Ka_Jhoot_Sabse_Mazboot and Punjab_Virodhi_Modi started circulating in the social media, and soon #Punjab_Maaf_Nahin_Karega campaign to “bring out the truth” about the incident became trending. The counteroffensive was piloted by a 35-strong team of the Congress, working out of a nondescript office spread over two floors in Sector 70, Mohali. The social media war room has been buzzing with digital soldiers — a mix of young techies, graphic designers, audio and video experts, volunteers and election strategists, who are closely tracking social media, creating crisp posts, putting out video clips and creating graphics to give the party a leg up in the high-stakes battle to retain power in Punjab. They have been putting out positive posts on WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter day after day for the past three-and-a-half months through campaigns such as #LokaanDiSarkar and #PunjabDiChangiSarkar to highlight power rate cut, loan waiver, farmer benefits, pro-women steps, employment generation initiatives, Scheduled Caste benefits and other achievements of the state government. In addition, they keep scrolling social media posts of rival parties to counter their online propaganda, particularly targeting the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on its Delhi model and chief ministerial face, and the BJP on farmers’ issues, inflation, communal disharmony and fuel prices. Talking numbersThe digital media team has created “pipelines” for digital outreach on messaging and social media platforms. Gaurav Pandhi, the Congress’ national coordinator, digital communications and social media, said that there are 13,000-odd WhatsApp groups having more than 9.1 lakh members to reach out to party supporters and voters through three messages a day, besides a WhatsApp channel with another 10,000 subscribers who are sent messages daily. The plan is to double the number of WhatsApp groups in the next 10 days. “We have a huge network of party leaders, workers and volunteers on the ground. Once we decide an issue, create digital content and share it with everyone, they all talk about it and take the party’s message to the grassroots,” Pandhi said, juggling the 10-odd mobile phones — his weapons in this digital battle — lying in front of him. On Facebook, the response has grown significantly with the Punjab Congress’ official page having an outreach of 1.9 crore in the past one week and post-engagement of 77 lakh in the form of likes and shares for posts put out in Punjabi, Hindi and English. Punjab Congress’ state social media coordinator Samraat Dhingra said the digital agenda and messaging is decided in the meeting of the strategy group with inputs from senior state leaders, including Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and campaign committee chairman Sunil Jakhar. “Weekly agendas are set up and content is generated accordingly,” he said. Both Sidhu and Channi also have their own separate teams for their own promotion on social media. The numbers have given a big fillip to the ruling Congress in Punjab in view of the “campaign curfew” imposed by the Election Commission to check Omricon-driven Covid-19 surge. The poll panel has banned super-spreader events, such as rallies, road shows and street corners, making social media the key driver for parties to maximise their voter outreach. Punjab has the highest mobile teledensity of 122.19 mobile phone connections per 100 persons, according to the Niti Aayog Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) India Index 2020-21. The Internet penetration is also the best among the major states with 84.32 subscribers per 100 persons. The Punjab Congress’ social media team was operating from the chief minister’s residence till September 2021 with a staff of five, and being overseen by Nirvan Singh, the grandson of then chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. In October, it moved to Mohali, and has grown in leaps and bounds in both its size and outreach, but its impact will be known on March 10, the day the poll results are slated to be announced. What role do you see for social media in this election? It’s very important. Campaigning is shifting to digital medium. Right now, it’s being pushed by the Election Commission, but this has to happen eventually. Everything, including governance, is going digital, so why not the path to elect the government? We were already preparing, but it is going to be challenging as the entire focus has suddenly shifted to social media. How do you engage with party leaders and voters? We are totally in sync with the thinking of the party leadership. We are fortunate to have leaders who understand social media. As for voters, we reach out to them over WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram. We also do campaigns on Twitter. We are making the best use of social media. Earlier, the AAP was leading, but we are ahead for the past couple of weeks. Are you using influencers? Fortunately, we have not so far, because we already have a huge network and influence on social media. We would need them if our presence is not there and we are just trying to pretend. Can you name your three most successful campaigns? #LokanDiSarkar, campaigns against the BJP’s propaganda on PM’s security, and #Pegwant that was done by our volunteers. Also, #111CongressDubara and #Congress_Hi_Aaugi are doing well. How do you maintain balance between leaders like Sidhu, Channi and Jakhar?

In the evening, the Punjab police chief tweeted about recovery of another 5-kg IED being found in Amritsar.Though scanning of the footage from the CCTV cameras installed at the market gate did not give any specific clue, investigators said that some people who were present inside the market has told them that they saw four-five people leaving hurriedly in a three-wheeler goods carrier “around the time when the IED was found. The police are trying to identify and locate the three-wheeler, the investigator said.After the market was evacuated soon after the arrival of the police, fire and disaster management personnel at the spot, the Delhi Police enhanced deployment at border points in Ghazipur, near Anand Vihar and Maharajpur. All cars crossing the border were thoroughly checked by personnel of the police forces of the two states. The checking of vehicles and placement of barricades led to long queues of vehicles at the three border points on Friday evening.Barricades for vehicle checking were also placed at Singhu, Tikri, and other borders connecting Delhi with Haryana. The police personnel were seen checking boots of the cars and two wheeler riders were asked to show their bags.A senior Ghaziabad police officer, who asked not to be named, confirmed enhanced patrolling and vehicle checks along the Delhi border. He said besides the recovery of explosives, the state was already on an alert due to the model code of conduct in place for the upcoming assembly elections.A senior Delhi Police officer, who asked not to be named, said there were no “serious inputs” from the central intelligence agencies regarding any possible terror strike in the national capital around the Republic Day. He added that Delhi Police have already sounded a heightened alert, and the personnel have been asked to stay at maximum vigil.“Security at popular markets and vital installations is being enhanced in view of the Republic Day,” the officer added..
15-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi’s south civic body orders merger, closure of 29 primary schools||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has issued orders for the merger and closure of 29 primary schools run by the civic body -- mostly double-shift schools -- with officials claiming that the idea is to reduce wasteful use of resources since many of these institutes do not have enough students. The order has elicited sharp reactions from teachers’ unions and several education activists who feel the move raises questions on SDMC’s claims of a rise in student enrolments due to the pandemic.In an order issued by the SDMC education department on Thursday, the additional director (education) stated that the municipal commissioner has accorded administrative approval for merging five schools in central zone, one in South zone, 15 in West zone and eight in Najafgarh zone. The schools are located in places like Ambedkar Nagar, Nangal Raya, Uttam Nagar, Dabri, Madipur, Okhla, Noor Nagar among other sites. A senior education department official said that most of the schools being merged are operating in double shifts. “There is a morning shift school and an evening shift school in most of the 29 cases. The overall number of enrolled students has indeed gone up but in these schools, there are enough rooms to accommodate students in both shifts together. Right now, we are forced to use double the number of workforce -- teachers, principals, etc -- for imparting education to the students. The merger will make the system more efficient and lead to savings,” said the senior official, requesting anonymity.The merger will be operationalised from April 1, 2022, on commencement of the new academic session, and the zonal directors have been asked to submit proposals for transfer of principals, special educators, teachers, school attendants and other staff members who will be rendered surplus after the merger. The number of municipal primary schools across has been on a decline with several mergers occurring over the last five years. Over 300,000 students are currently enrolled in the 568 primary schools run by SDMC, and the corporation has claimed that it has added more than 93,000 new students in the current academic session. Data from SDMC shows that the corporation was operating 605 primary school with 283,737 students in 2016-17. In 2018, North MCD has also decided to merge and close 20 primary schools citing low enrolment numbers.Studies have shown there is an increase in enrolment in government schools across the country due to financial constrains created by the pandemic. Kuldeep Khatri, who heads the Nagar Nigam Shikshak Nyay Manch -- a municipal teachers association, said that the merger of such a large number of schools raises questions on claims of rising enrolment. “The merger clearly shows that the data pertaining to a nearly 100,000 increase in number of students is questionable. The schools are merged only when the number students goes down in double shift system schools. In the past, schools have been merged when the number went down below 150 students in a shift,” Khatri said.Khagesh Jha, an education activist who heads the Forum for Indian Parents, said that while a general shift system is better, the merger clearly shows that the rise in number of students should be audited. “If the number of students is indeed rising, the number of shifts in schools should be increased. The same steps of merger of schools and using the buildings for non-education purposes has been repeated in the past by municipal corporations,” he said. Jha said that thousands of students are out of the school system and many are studying in unrecognised schools. “If corporations have extra infrastructure, they should focus on ensuring the return of these children to the school system under Right to Education,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-south-civic-body-orders-merger-closure-of-29-primary-schools-101642185189870.html

15-01-2022||Delhi||Work on new Ring Road to unclog Delhi kicks off||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has started the construction work on the much-delayed Urban Extension Road-II (UER-II) project, also referred to as the third Ring Road of Delhi, and is expected to be ready by October 2023, senior NHAI officials said. The highways authority has asked the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to provide land for transplantation of around 4,000 trees which need to be cut of the project.A senior NHAI official said, “Tree transplantation is the foremost activity that needs to be carried out to prepare the site for construction. We have written to the DDA to provide us approximately 6.4 hectares of land, preferably closer to the site, for transplantation of around 4,000 trees.”Conceived in the early 2000, UER-II could prove to be crucial for decongesting the national capital. The 75.71km-long corridor will connect four national highways (NH-1, 10, 8 and 2) and provide seamless connectivity between north, northwest Delhi and IGI airport and Gurugram. The ₹7,715.6-crore-project will also pass through around 25 villages in Delhi, starting from GT Karnal Road.The project, which was to be initially executed by the DDA, was approved by Delhi’s apex traffic and transport planning body, Unified Traffic and Transportation and Infrastructure Planning and Engineering Centre (UTTIPEC), in 2016. But due to delay in land acquisition related issues, the project was transferred to the NHAI in April 2018.The highways authority has got permission to cut and transplant 6,600 trees from the Delhi government, of which 80% will be transplanted along the proposed corridor, according to the state government’s tree transplantation policy. “The work to transplant close to 4,000 trees along the corridor has started. We have transplanted around 700-odd trees so far. The work is going on unhindered,” said a second senior NHAI official who asked not to be named.In addition to this, the NHAI has to carry out compensatory afforestation, since 54.87 hectares of deemed forest land was diverted for the project. The NHAI has got 55 hectares of land from the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for afforestation.While approving the diversion of deemed forest land under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 last year, the Regional Empowered Committee, under the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change, had asked NHAI to transplant trees as far as possible.“Usually, transplantation is not done under compensatory afforestation. But the committee has asked us to transplant as many trees as possible while giving the permission, so we are planning to transplant around 4,000 trees. For this, we need around 6.4 hectares of land. We have written to the DDA in this regard,” the official said.When contacted, a senior DDA official said, “As a policy, it has been decided not to give land for tree transplantation. Land for transplantation has to be managed by the infrastructure agencies. We are anyway struggling to provide land for compensatory afforestation; it is not possible to provide land for transplantation.”Sabyasachi Das, former planning commissioner in-charge at DDA, agrees with DDA officials and said, “Providing land for compensatory afforestation and plantation is a big challenge. The land available right now is for future development of the city and those land parcels can’t be given for plantation purposes.”Environment expert Diwan Singh says that land must be provided for compensatory afforestation when deemed forest land is being diverted for development, and questioned the need for carrying out such projects. “There is no end to development. We have to decide how much development is required which the city can actually accommodate. This highway project will only result in urban sprawl, as land of villages falling on the corridor will be used for urban development such as commercial, residential and industrial spaces. We are already facing a major air pollution problem. Can the city really afford such development?” said Singh.The projectOf the 75.71 kms, 38.1kms will be constructed in Delhi covering a majority of rural villages, especially on the periphery, in north and south west Delhi and connecting them to the IGI Airport and rest of Delhi. The access-controlled highway will pass through villages such as Narela, Bawana, Alipur, Holami Kalan, Mundka, Chhawla, Najafgarh etc.Though the NHAI invited bids for the project in 2019, it couldn’t start work as it had asked the DDA, which was to execute the project initially, to pay a viability gap funding of ₹4,000 crore. The matter was resolved last year and work for the project was awarded in October last year.“The pre-construction work started in November. The work will be carried out at a fast pace as we have all necessary permissions. We have to complete the project by October 2023,” said a senior NHAI official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/work-on-new-ring-road-to-unclog-delhi-kicks-off-101642184889741.html
15-01-2022||Delhi||Ahead of Republic Day, cops probe ‘attempted terror strike’ in Delhi||The improvised explosive device (IED) containing suspected RDX and ammonium nitrate found at the gate of the Ghazipur flower market on Friday was placed there to “cause maximum damage and casualties” since nearly 4,000 people were present inside the market when the bomb was spotted, senior police officer associated with the investigation said. The officers said that a case under the explosive substances Act has been registered, and they were probing an “attempted terror strike by a terrorist outfit from any neighbouring country”. They said if the explosives would have gone off, it could destroyed everything in the radius of 60 to 70 metres.The IED found near Gate number 1 of the wholesale market had a timer device attached to it. It was destroyed by the bomb disposal squad of the National Security Guard (NSG) through a controlled explosion that was done inside an eight-feet-deep pit dug in the market premises.“The controlled explosion left a two-feet hole which indicates that on the ground it could have damaged nearly half of the market’s buildings. A major tragedy has been averted otherwise hundreds of lives could have been lost,” said a police officer associated with the case.According to the police officials, the IED was assembled in a metal box and kept in a black and grey laptop bag. Some wires and white powder were found inside when the bag was opened, suggesting that ammonium nitrate was also one of the ingredients of the bomb. NSG director general M A Ganapathy told HT that prima facie analysis of samples taken from the bomb site suggests “RDX and ammonium nitrate was used”. The recovery and destruction of a strong IED at the gate of the Ghazipur flower market triggered panic among the shopkeepers and nearly 4,000 people who were present in the market when the explosives bag was spotted by a real estate company’s employee. He found the bag near his scooter that was parked just outside gate number 1 of the market, said Mohammad Salim, who runs a wholesale flower shop there.“The flower market has an average daily footfall of 15,000 to 20,000 between 4am and 7am -- the peak business hours. By 10am, half of the shops are closed and the crowd also recedes. By around noon, the entire market is empty. Our business is usually held between 2am and 10am. Hundreds of people would have died had the bomb exploded between that period,” said Salim, adding that no checking of vehicles or individuals is done at the market despite it being an important wholesale area. Vijay Sisodia, former chairman of Ghazipur flower market, also said that a major tragedy could have taken place had the IED exploded during the peak business hours. Sisodia said the entire market is covered by CCTVs but did not give the exact number of cameras installed there. “There are cameras at the entry and exit gate as well. I am sure the suspect who placed the bag outside the gate was captured in one of the cameras. There are 411 licenced shops in the market. Many unauthorised shopkeepers also run their businesses from the market. Despite the Covid-19 situation, the market has a daily average footfall of nearly 10,000,” said Sisodia.Investigators said the presence of RDX among the explosives indicate the role of a terror outfit from across the border. Some Delhi Police officers, who have probed terror related cases in the past, were of the opinion that RDX was mostly sourced from another country, and smuggled into the national capital through Jammu and Kashmir or Punjab.Besides the explosives found at the flower market, an IED weighing around 5kg was also recovered in Amritsar on Friday. “IED consignment weighing 5kg approximately which includes 2.7kg RDX recovered by STF from Gharinda area in Amritsar just 2.5km from the international border,” Punjab Police chief Viresh Kumar Bhawra tweeted on Friday evening.A special cell officer, who asked not to be named, said the last time RDX was used in any bomb blast in Delhi was during the 2005 Delhi serial blasts in which 62 people had lost their lives and over 200 were injured.“After 2005, RDX was not used in the other blasts that were carried out by terror outfits in Delhi between 2008 and 2011. In all the following blasts, ammonium nitrate was the common explosive because it is easily available. RDX can be sourced only from our neighbouring countries,” the officer added.Officials said that the investigating agencies are also probing a suspected link between the recent Ludhiana blast and the recovery of the IED in Delhi and Punjab on Friday.
15-01-2022||Delhi||Covid: Deaths, admissions low, no need to panic, says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||Highlighting Delhi’s low Covid-19 hospitalisation rates and fewer deaths compared to previous surges of the infection, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday urged residents not to panic, even as he acknowledged the rapid spread of the virus through the city, as it headed into its second weekend curfew of the fifth wave of cases.Speaking at the Rajghat bus depot, where he flagged off 100 new buses, the chief minister also said the state will tighten curbs only if necessary and relax restrictions if cases begin to trend downwards.“The number of Covid-19 cases is rapidly increasing. The infection rate in Delhi has now [as on Thursday] reached nearly 29%, but there is no cause for concern. The number of patients admitted to hospitals is very low, as is the number of deaths. As a result, there is no need for people to be concerned or panicked,” Kejriwal said.“There is no shortage of hospital beds. There are also plenty of intensive care beds available. We do not need to panic, but we must act responsibly. We are keeping an eye on the Covid-19 situation. We will tighten the restrictions only if necessary, but if cases begin to decline, we will relax the curbs,” he added. State government data showed that 2,529 patients in Delhi are hospitalised, up marginally from 2,424 a day ago. Nearly 13,000 of the city’s 15,478 hospital beds are still vacant, with the state in a position to ramp up to 37,000 oxygen beds overnight, if required. Like last week, the weekend curfew kicked in from 10pm on Friday and will be in place till 5am on Monday, as part of the restrictions to check the spread of Covid-19. E-passes issued on or after January 4 for essential movement and those in exempted groups will continue to be valid throughout the ongoing period of night and weekend curfews. “The weekend curfew and the daily night curfew from 10pm to 5am are in place and will continue to be implemented strictly till further orders,” a DDMA official said. All existing restrictions under the ‘yellow alert’ will continue to be in place, under which educational institutions, gyms, and cinemas are shut. The Metro and public buses are allowed to occupy 100% of their seating capacity, but cannot carry standing passengers. Shops in malls and markets will continue to operate on an odd-even basis between 10am and 8pm. Only 20 people are allowed to attend weddings and funerals. “In case any person is found violating the instructions, they will be proceeded against as per the provisions of section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Section 188 of IPC and other applicable laws, besides imposition of fines,” the DDMA official stated. All district administration and police authorities have been asked to enforce all existing restrictions. The weekend curfew prohibits all non-essential activity, and exempts businesses and individuals engaged in essential services. Shops dealing with food, groceries, fruits, vegetables, meat and fish, animal fodder, pharmaceuticals, medicines and medical equipment; dairy and milk booths; banks, insurance offices and ATMs; print and electronic media; telecommunications, internet services, broadcasting and cable services; IT and IT-enabled services will be open. Delivery of all essential goods including food, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment through e-commerce is allowed. Those providing essential services will need to produce e-passes or valid identity cards upon request. People coming from or going to airports, railway stations or bus terminals will be allowed travel with valid tickets, as will those who work for services such as grocery shops, internet service providers, banks and petrol pumps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-deaths-admissions-low-no-need-to-panic-says-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-101642184350254.html

As of Friday, while 110% of the eligible population had received the first dose, 100% had been vaccinated twice. Earlier in September 2021, Panchkula had become the third district in Haryana to achieve 100% first dose vaccination, nine months after the nationwide vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16.According to district immunisation officer Dr Meenu Sasan, initially when the Covid cases were low, they faced a lot of reluctance and misbehaviour from people when they were contacted to get fully vaccinated. The door-to-door campaign also failed to elicit much response.“It was only after December 22, when the Haryana government made it compulsory for people to be fully vaccinated to access public places that people started lining up at vaccination centres. Within 23 days since, Panchkula achieved 100% double-dose target,” she said.She added that apart from first two doses, they had also provided the precautionary third dose to 3,567 citizens since January 10. Besides, as many as 18,241 (45%) children in the 15 to 18 age group had received the first dose in the district.

15-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: Former Congress minister Joginder Singh Mann joins AAP||Former Congress minister and Punjab Agro Industries Corporation chairman Joginder Singh Mann joined the Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday. Also read: India records over 2.60 lakh new Covid cases, positivity rate past 16%Mann was inducted into the party by AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in the presence of the party’s Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha. On Friday, Mann resigned from the Congress, snapping his 50-year-old ties with the party. “I lost eight family members to militancy yet I remained a loyal soldier of the Congress for five decades. Apparently, now the party doesn’t need us that is why our loyalty is considered as our weakness. But it is not so as we are strong enough to safeguard the interests of residents of Phagwara in general and that of underprivileged sections in particular even without the Congress,” he said. In a letter to Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, the three-time former Phagwara MLA said, “I had a dream that when I die, the Congress tri-colour will be wrapped around my body but my conscience does not allow me to stay here after seeing the Congress patronising those guilty of the post-matric scholarship scheme for Scheduled Caste students.” Mann had spoken up against Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu recently after he was ignored during a rally organised by local MLA Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal in Phagwara. “Maharajas, landlords, moneybags and opportunist leaders like Captain Amarinder Singh and Sidhu came to the party for their vested interests due to which the party drifted from its core values and the focus shifted merely to contest elections and grab power. For the past few months, I’ve been having sleepless nights because hundreds of SC students’ career has been ruined due to the usurping of money. Instead of punishing the guilty, the Congress sheltered them and the recent Cabinet decision was the final blow,” he said. Citing another reason for quitting, he said residents of Phagwara have to travel 40km to Kapurthala for getting their administrative works done at the district headquarters. He said had been repeatedly flagging the issue of according district status to Phagwara with the then CM Captain Amarinder Singh and later Charanjit Singh Channi. “Instead of paying heed, they ignored this long-pending demand of Phagwara residents,” he said. Mann also claimed that over the past few years, the Congress has been meting out a step-motherly treatment to the Valmiki or Mazhabi Sikhs, while using the community as a vote bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-elections-former-congress-minister-joginder-singh-mann-joins-aap-101642225452516.html

15-01-2022||Mumbai||Maha still has 11.19 million unvaccinated residents||Mumbai: Maharashtra still has 11.19 million unvaccinated residents, a majority of whom are in the age group of 18 to 45 years according to data compiled by the state health department. The state has more 95.15 million beneficiaries — including the most recently added set, the 15-18 year-olds — and 11.75% are yet to receive the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, which is proven to stave off the worst of the disease in the ongoing pandemic. Of them, 9.34 million unvaccinated persons are in the age group of 18 to 45 years. Nationally, 96.1% of the adults [18 years and above] have received at least one dose of the vaccine, while in Maharashtra, at least 89.44% of all adult beneficiaries have received the first dose.At least half of the unvaccinated populace belong to the 10 worst-performing districts — 1.02 million are in Thane, 850,000 in Nashik, 720,000 in Jalgaon, 670,000 in Ahmednagar and 650,000 in Nanded. As of January 14, nearly 82 million Maharashtra residents above 18 years have received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.State inoculation officer Dr Sachin Desai attributed the low vaccination rate among the 18-45 age group — only 83.64% of this age group (57.1 million beneficiaries in all) has received their first dose in the state — to a few possible reasons. For one, the Centre only permitted vaccinating this age group starting May 1, after the national vaccination programme had already been rolled out to health care workers, frontline workers, senior citizens, and persons above 45 years with co-morbidities. What’s more, there was also a severe shortage in procuring vaccines from the Centre for the first few months after this age group was included in the national drive.“It may be because the inoculation for this category was added late. There is no specific reason known for the hesitancy in this age group. We have been reaching out to all the beneficiaries under Har Ghar Dastak drive with request to come forward for the inoculation,” Dr Desai said.The number gains significance in the wake of Omicron, the new variant of concern that is driving the third wave in the country. Citing data till January 6, Brihanmumbai Corporation (BMC) municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal said last week that 96% of the people occupying oxygenated beds (1,900 at the time) were unvaccinated.Dr Gautam Bhansali of the Bombay Hospital, who is also coordinator of all private hospitals in the city, said that the majority of patients occupying oxygen beds were unvaccinated and were in the age group of 40 to 50 years. This drives home the point that full vaccination is singularly important to prevent death and severe disease.Thane district health officer Dr Manish Renge said that the corporation was trying to improve the percentage of first dose inoculation. “We find resistance in parts of rural Thane and Bhiwandi. We have roped in more personnel to reach out to the remaining beneficiaries. Awareness programmes are also being undertaken to convince people,” he said.In Aurangabad, which has 560,625 adults who are yet to take even their first dose of the vaccine, district officials said that they were facing vaccine hesitancy. “Around 150,000 names in the list [of unvaccinated adults] are of the people migrated, dead or with duplicate entries. We have been involving religious scholars and preachers to convince their community members, but the response is low. Even the third wave has not helped,” Dr SS Shelke, district health officer said.According to state health department officials, the emergence of the Omicron variant in November and the resultant surge in Covid-19 cases starting the third week of December ensured that more people went for their jab. The daily average of inoculation in July 2021 was 391,714; in November, it was 538,652 and in December it was 624,642.“Despite efforts, a section of the society has been opposing vaccination. It is going to be quite difficult to convince the remaining percentage of beneficiaries who have not taken even their first dose,” an official of the state health department said, wishing to remain anonymous.However, districts where social schemes required vaccination helped drive up the number of people getting jabs. In Mumbai, for instance, only those with double vaccination certificates are allowed to travel on the local trains, or enter malls, shopping centres and auditoriums. In Aurangabad, the public distribution system and other benefits have been linked to a person’s vaccination status. The Thane Municipal Corporation restricts people who are not fully vaccinated from travelling in state buses. In Nagpur, the municipal corporation does not allow anyone who is not doubly vaccinated to enter government offices.However, vaccination is not mandatory. On Thursday, in a meeting between the prime minister and chief ministers of five states, state health minister Rajesh Tope requested the Central government to make the vaccination mandatory for all. “Some of our districts such as Aurangabad are lagging behind the state average. This has resulted in the state lagging behind the national average,” Tope said. CM Uddhav Thackeray was unable to attend the meeting and was substituted by the health minister.Not all districts of Maharashtra are performing badly. Mumbai and Pune have 107% and 109% single dose vaccination of eligible citizens, according to the figures released by the state health department on Wednesday. At least 460,000 more people have taken their first dose in last three days. More than 35% or over 2.1 million of the 5.5 million beneficiaries in the age group of 15-18 years — whose inoculation was started on January 3 — have taken the jab in the last 10 days.Dr Desai said that the state has a stock of over 10 million doses of Covishield and over 1.6 million doses of Covaxin. “We have been using Covaxin for the youngsters in the age group 15-18 years and in the wake of the response from this age group, we fear that there will be shortage of the jabs,” he said.On Friday the ministry of health and family welfare clarified that there was no shortage of supply in Maharashtra. On Thursday, Tope had raised the demand of 5 million Covishield and 4 million of Covaxin doses citing the potential shortage with the addition of new age group to vaccination drive.Ends 
15-01-2022||Lucknow||Denied ticket, Gulabi gang founder quits Congress||A day after the Congress released its first list of 150 candidates, including 50 women for the UP Assembly elections symbolizing efforts for women empowerment, a section of party leaders questioned the party’s ticket distribution process.Those who raised their voice included Sampat Pal Devi, founder of Gulabi Gang, which derived its name from its pink (gulabi) saree clad members. The gang is known for vigilante justice against those accused of “committing atrocities on women.”“I am resigning from the Congress as my candidature for Manikpur seat in Banda has not been considered. Women who secured lesser votes than me have been fielded from the same seat though I have worked harder over the years to strengthen the Congress. My Gulabi Gang members have supported the Congress not only in Uttar Pradesh but also in other states,” said Sampat Pal Devi while speaking to Hindustan Times on phone.Sampat Pal Devi’s resignation came when the Congress has fulfilled its promise of 40% tickets to women, taking the issue of women empowerment to the centrestage of politics. Those known for raising their voice against any injustice to women have been given party tickets.Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar ‘Lallu’ was not reachable for comments on the first list of Congress tickets that party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra released on Thursday.Meanwhile, a party leader Sheela Mishra staged a dharna at UPCC headquarters for some time on Friday to lodge her protest against the Congress’ decision to deny her a ticket from an assembly seat of Lucknow. “Sheela Mishra sat on dharna for some time at UPCC headquarters,” said a party functionary.Another party leader Priyanka Maurya, whose picture has been used on the Congress’ ‘Ladki Hoon, Lad Sakti Hoon’ (I am a girl, I can fight) campaign posters accused the party of “irregularities in the ticket distribution.”According to party leaders, she was a contender for a Congress ticket from Sarojini Nagar assembly seat of Lucknow. Priyanka Maurya accused a party functionary of asking her to pay money for a ticket and even called the Congress “anti-women and anti-OBC.”“The Congress list is a good gesture for women and every political party should follow the same instead of waiting for enactment of a law. Any resentment against ticket distribution on some seats is routine and an internal matter of the political party,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of department, political science, Lucknow University.

Sharing five lessons from his fight against Omicron, Dr Younus informed that he had developed symptoms two weeks ago.Recounting how he got exposed to the virus, the health expert said he has been around Covid patients over 1,000 times in the last two years but did not get infected due to masks and PPE. He said he got exposed for two days at a maskless family gathering. Personal News: Omicron got me:)Two weeks ago I developed symptoms and tested +veSharing five lessons I learned from that experience and hoping you’ll find them helpfulThanking vaccines, Dr Younus said it is because of the vaccines that he is back to tell his story on Twitter within five days. He said he is also back to work, with a mask."I didn’t need monoclonal antibodies, steroids, antibiotics or paxlovid etc. Symptomatic therapy (that I’ve shared many times before) was enough. Definitely didn’t use ivermectin, HCQ, zinc," he added.Herd immunity is good, but herd mentality is bad, Dr Younus tweeted. "Covid or no Covid, think of your own mortality, often. It puts everything in perspective and allows us to make brave, meaningful decisions," he added.If despite wearing an N95 mask, Covid infects a person, he or she is likely to recover fully if vaccinated. "That family gathering was important for me. But your risk tolerance could be different," he said.Dr Faheem has been sharing Covid-related tips since the beginning of the pandemic. In the latest updates, the doctor said that Omicron cases are doubling in every two days compared to every two weeks for Delta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-health-expert-gets-infected-by-omicron-shares-5-lessons-from-experience-101642266649700.html
15-01-2022||World||What's next after Omicron? Maybe more worrisome Frankenvariants, say experts||Omicron which was earlier thought to be less severe and the probable end of the two-year-old pandemic may actually be a precursor to more worrisome variants, scientists now think. Leonardo Martinez, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Boston University, said, the faster the Omicron spreads, which is happening across the world, the more opportunities it gets for further mutations, leading to more variants. There is no way to confirm or predict the arrival of the next variant, but there is no guarantee either that the future variants will cause milder illness."The faster omicron spreads, the more opportunities there are for mutation, potentially leading to more variants,” Leonardo told AP.“People have wondered whether the virus will evolve to mildness. But there's no particular reason for it to do so. I don't think we can be confident that the virus will become less lethal over time," said Dr Stuart Campbell Ray, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University.UK's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies has predicted there will be a fresh wave of Omicron cases in the early summer as people resume social activities and the immunity achieved in the ongoing surge reduces, The Guardian reported.Here is what may happen after Omicron, according to experts1. Omicron is likely to lead to reinfections, experts think. People infected with Delta or other previous variants or even Omicron may get reinfected.2. It's a possibility that the virus becomes milder like a common cold but viruses don't always get less deadly over time. Omicron's initial behaviour has kindled the hope.3. Replicating is the main goal of a variant which is easily possible when the infected people develop mild symptoms and spread the virus to others without understanding.4. There are many possible avenues for evolution, the AP report said. Animals could potentially incubate and unleash new variants.5. Another possible avenue for Omicron is to create Frankenvariants with Delta, hybrids with characteristics of both Omicron and Delta.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whats-next-after-omicron-maybe-more-worrisome-frankenvariants-say-experts-101642258811307.html

However, the total number Omicron cases remains unclear.He Qinghua, an official at the National Health Commission (NHC), said in a briefing earlier on Saturday that the Omicron variant was also detected in Shanghai, without specifying the case count. He did not say whether the variant had been found locally or among travellers from overseas.He said 14 provincial areas in China had found the Omicron variant in infected individuals arriving from overseas, without naming the regions.In a statement on Saturday, the NHC reported 165 new confirmed coronavirus cases for Jan. 14, down from 201 a day earlier.Of the new infections, 104 were locally transmitted, according to a statement by the National Health Commission, compared with 143 a day earlier.The new locally transmitted cases were in Henan, Tianjin, Guangdong, Shaanxi and Zhejiang.China also reported 25 new asymptomatic cases for Jan. 14, down from 42 infections a day earlier. China classifies asymptomatic cases separately from confirmed cases.There were no new deaths, leaving the death toll at 4,636.As of Jan. 14, mainland China had 104,745 confirmed cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-reports-first-locally-transmitted-omicron-case-ahead-of-winter-olympics-101642255944759.html
15-01-2022||World||Study finds one in 10 people might still be infectious for Covid after 10 days||A new study has found that one in 10 people might have clinically relevant levels of potentially infectious SARS-CoV-2 past the 10 day quarantine period.The study has been published in the 'International Journal of Infectious Diseases.The study, led by the University of Exeter and funded by Animal Free Research UK, used a newly adapted test that can detect whether the virus was potentially still active. It was applied to samples from 176 people in Exeter who had tested positive on standard PCR tests.The study found that 13 per cent of people still exhibited clinically-relevant levels of virus after 10 days, meaning they could potentially still be infectious. Some people retained these levels for up to 68 days. The authors believe this new test should be applied in settings where people are vulnerable, to stop the spread of Covid-19.Professor Lorna Harries, of the University of Exeter Medical School, oversaw the study. She said, "While this is a relatively small study, our results suggest that potentially active virus may sometimes persist beyond a 10 day period, and could pose a potential risk of onward transmission. Furthermore, there was nothing clinically remarkable about these people, which means we wouldn't be able to predict who they are".Conventional PCR tests work by testing for the presence of viral fragments. While they can tell if someone has recently had the virus, they cannot detect whether it is still active, and the person is infectious. The test used in the latest study however gives a positive result only when the virus is active and potentially capable of onward transmission.Lead author Merlin Davies, of the University of Exeter Medical School, said, "In some settings, such as people returning to care homes after illness, people continuing to be infectious after ten days could pose a serious public health risk. We may need to ensure people in those setting have a negative active virus test to ensure people are no longer infectious. We now want to conduct larger trials to investigate this further."Animal Free Research UK CEO, Carla Owen, said, "The University of Exeter team's discovery is exciting and potentially very important. Once more, it shows how focusing exclusively on human biology during medical research can produce results that are more reliable and more likely to benefit humans and animals.""Pioneering Animal Free work is providing the best chance of not only defeating Covid 19 but also finding better treatments for all human diseases. The results also send a loud and clear message to the Government to better fund modern medical research and make the UK a world leader in cutting edge, kinder science," Owen added.The research is a collaboration between the University of Exeter Medical School, the Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, and the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-finds-one-in-10-people-might-still-be-infectious-for-covid-after-10-days-101642249951897.html

Dharmalingam's appeal against his execution will be heard by a five-judge panel of the Singapore's Supreme Court on January 24, according to a media report.Nagaenthran, 33, of Indian-origin and Malaysian citizenship, is appealing against a High Court decision denying him permission to start judicial review proceedings to challenge the death sentence.The appeal is set to be heard by a panel comprising Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Justices Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash, Belinda Ang and Chao Hick Tin, The Straits Times reported on Friday.Represented by lawyer M. Ravi, Nagaenthran has pleaded to not have the mental fitness to be considered as a regular drug trafficker. He has even asked the court to have him assessed by a panel of psychiatrists.Nagaenthran was arrested in 2009 with a stash of heroin strapped to his thigh. He was convicted of trafficking 42.72g of heroin in 2010 and sentenced to the death penalty, which was then mandatory.His appeals against his conviction and sentence were dismissed in 2011, the newspaper said.In 2015, he applied to be re-sentenced to life imprisonment after the law was changed to allow the alternative sentence. However, the high court upheld his death sentence in 2017 after considering the opinions of four psychological experts.Last year, Nagaenthran made an 11th-hour attempt to challenge his impending execution on November 10 - again pleading mental disabilities. However, on the day of his appeal on November 9, Nagaenthran tested positive for Covid-19. The three-judge panel then granted a stay on his execution.In this interim period, the hearing got further delayed after his lawyer, Ravi - also of Indian origin - was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The Law Society of Singapore (LawSoc) forced Ravi to go on leave from December 2 to January 13. Ravi has returned to practise now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-man-s-death-sentence-appeal-to-be-heard-on-jan-24-in-singapore-101642245622549.html
15-01-2022||World||Can you get Omicron twice? Possible, say epidemiologists||Omicron, the latest and the fastest-spreading variant of SARS-CoV-2, can infect the same person twice and it may not be very rare, experts said as the world is grappling with a fresh wave of the two-year-old pandemic, presently being driven by the Omicron. US epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding said Omicron reinfection is certainly possible if the first Omicron infection was of a 'low-dose' that did not stimulate the immune system enough. Another condition for Omicron reinfection could be heavily compromised immunity."There are lots of recent anecdotes about new Omicron reinfections after a recent Omicron infection. It’s certainly possible if your first Omicron infection was a low-dose one that didn’t stimulate your immune system enough or if you’re immunocompromised. Be careful folks," the epidemiologist tweeted.In new Covid guidelines, CDC says N95s offer ‘highest protection’, cloth masks ‘least’There are lots of recent anecdotes about new #Omicron reinfections after a recent Omicron infection. It’s certainly possible if your first Omicron infection was a low-dose one that didn’t stimulate your immune system enough or if you’re immunocompromised. Be careful folks. 🙏 https://t.co/k0lcBibyl7The world is familiar with Covid reinfection as in the subsequent waves of the pandemic it was found that people who have got infected once also stand at the risk of reinfection. It is also not new that people vaccinated against Covid are also contracting the infection again as the vaccines are not disease-preventing, but offer protection from severity and mortality. Reinfection by Omicron is a relatively new idea as Omicron is the variant active in the present wave. If people are getting reinfected by Omicron, it means they are getting the infection in a very short span of time. Natural immunity that the body develops after one infection should last at least seven to nine months. But Omicron reinfection indicates getting infected twice in a quick interval.People who have been earlier infected with earlier variants of Covid can certainly get Omicron. People can even get infected by Omicron twice. “Omicron is highly contagious and it would appear to not induce fantastic protective immunity,” Stanley Weiss, M.D., professor at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and the Department of Epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-you-get-omicron-twice-possible-say-epidemiologists-101642243745529.html

In his message, read out by Liberal Party MP Chandra Arya, Trudeau said, “The Hindu community has made important contributions to the Canadian business landscape and I’m sure the Chamber of Commerce will become an indispensable forum for representation, development and improvement.”The directors of the new Chamber belong to various parts of Canada and have roots in several states of India, as well as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka. It will also represent businesses of community members who have immigrated from the Caribbean, Nepal, Pakistan, SouthEast Asia and elsewhere.The organisers’ objective behind formation of the Chamber is to provide “unified and effective representation” to Hindu businesspersons.Also extending their congratulations via video messages on the creation of CHCC were Leader of the Opposition and Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole and the Premier of the province of Ontario Doug Ford.Trudeau also congratulated the organisers for the commitment in putting together CHCC despite the last two years being “exceptionally challenging” due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The Board of Directors of CHCC is led by its president Toronto-based Naresh Chavda.The inaugural event was virtual due to the constraints imposed by the latest wave of the coronavirus crisis. Those in attendance included representatives from three levels of government in the country, including MPs Arya and Melissa Lantsman, Ontario’s Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction Nina Tangri, and Mississauga councillor and former provincial Cabinet Minister Dipika Damerla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/entrepreneurs-set-up-canadian-hindu-chamber-of-commerce-101642236673053.html
15-01-2022||World||Covid-19: Omicron driving high case load in Canada||While the fifth wave of Covid-19 pandemic in Canada, driven by the Omicron variant, is leading to historic high numbers of daily infections as well as positivity rate, health authorities are hopeful the peak could arrive soon leading to a rapid decline in infections.In a statement released on Friday, Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam put the positivity rate at 28% of samples tested by laboratories, far exceeding previous counts.New modelling released by the Public Health Agency of Canada forecast daily case load reaching 150,000 but Tam said that the peak could be reached within days.However, while risk of hospitalisation from Omicron infections remains lower when compared to Delta, the sheer volume of cases being reported could result in new daily hospital admissions that “could still exceed previous historical peaks”.During the latest 7-day period, January 6 to 12, an average of 37,530 new cases were reported daily across Canada. Tam said that while this was a 10% decrease compared to the week prior, “this could in part be attributed to changes in testing policies across Canada that can underestimate the true number of infections”.An average of 6,779 people with Covid-19 were being treated in Canadian hospitals each day during that period, 84% higher than last week and higher than all previous peaks, she added. This included, on average, 884 people who were being treated in intensive care units (ICUs), which was 50% higher than the previous week. “Omicron disease activity has now eclipsed all previous waves of the pandemic and is trending far above daily counts for severe outcomes, nationally,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-omicron-driving-high-case-load-in-canada-101642229832877.html

Until now, the CDC had not explicitly addressed any difference between a regular cloth mask and protective N95 respirators.However, with more contagious strains like Omicron continuing to soar, experts have now urged the CDC to recommend N95 masks for all citizens.What is the new recommendation by the CDC?According to a report by The New York Times, in its previous version of the recommendations, the CDC had said individuals may choose to use a disposable N95 respirator instead of a mask “when supplies are available”.The agency has now recommended all Americans to “wear the most protective mask you can that fits well and that you will wear consistently”.Covid-19 has been spreading like a wildfire across the US and world, especially with the surge of Omicron, which targets the upper airways and has spread at least twice as quickly as Delta.“Our main message continues to be that any mask is better than no mask,” said Kristen Nordlund, a CDC spokeswoman, in a statement.However, the CDC has relaxed Covid-19 guidelines and reduced the isolation period for those infected to five days, provided their symptoms stop and if they wear masks in public for another five days.Masks are still recommended by the agency for people aged two years and older, regardless of vaccination status and indoor public spaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-new-covid-guidelines-cdc-says-n95s-offer-highest-protection-cloth-masks-least-101642209672842.html

But organized cybercriminals, many of them living in Russia, have gone after institutions aggressively in the past two years with ransomware, freezing data and computerized equipment needed to care for hospital patients.In some cases, those extortion attacks have led to patient deaths, according to litigation, media reports and medical professionals.Friday's attack on Ukrainian websites included a warning to "be afraid and expect the worst", at a time when Russia has amassed about 100,000 troops near Ukraine, raising fears in the West that it is considering an invasion. Moscow denies it wants to invade.Russia has repeatedly rejected hacking allegations leveled by Ukraine and other countries over the years. While a suspect in the new web defacements, Russia has not been directly accused by Ukraine.In 2014 Russian troops went into the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and annexed it from Ukraine. If Russia invades again, more cyberattacks would occur too, predicted former CrowdStrike cybersecurity executive Dmitri Alperovitch.They would most likely be disruptive, not fatal, Alperovitch said. "It will be a sideshow. The main show will be on the ground."US concerned Russia prepping for invasionUkraine has already borne the brunt of some of the largest hacks on infrastructure to date.In December 2015, a first-of-its-kind cyber attack cut the lights to 225,000 people in western Ukraine, with hackers also sabotaging power distribution equipment, complicating attempts to restore power.The average temperature during the winter in Ukraine is bellow freezing and losing heat is potentially lethal. Outages in the 2015 attack reportedly lasted six hours in some towns.In the last two months of 2016, hackers targeted Ukrainian state institutions about 6,500 times, officials said. The cyberattacks showed Russian security services were waging a cyberwar against Ukraine, the government said.An attack on the State Treasury halted its systems for several days, meaning state workers and pensioners had been unable to receive their salaries or payments on time.The attacks against Ukraine’s power grid are considered by experts as the first examples of hackers shutting off critical energy systems supplying heat and light to millions of homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-lights-no-heat-no-money-that-s-life-in-ukraine-during-cyber-warfare-101642204100619.html

But they were in short supply previously, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials had said they should be prioritized for health care workers.In updated guidance posted late Friday afternoon, CDC officials removed concerns related to supply shortages and more clearly said that properly fitted N95 and KN95 masks offer the most protection.However, agency officials noted some masks are harder to tolerate than others, and urged people to choose good-fitting masks that they will wear consistently.“Our main message continues to be that any mask is better than no mask,” Kristen Nordlund, a CDC spokeswoman, said in a statement.The CDC has evolved its mask guidance throughout the pandemic.In its last update, in September, CDC officials became more encouraging of disposable N95 masks, saying they could be used in certain situations if supplies were available. Examples included being near a lot of people for extended periods of time on a train, bus or airplane; taking care of someone in poor health; or being more susceptible to severe illness.On Thursday, President Joe Biden announced that his administration was planning to make “high-quality masks,” including N95s, available for free. He said more details were coming next week. The federal government has a stockpile of more than 750 million N95 masks, the White House said.The latest CDC guidance notes that there is a special category of “surgical N95" masks, that are specially designed for protection against blood splashes and other operating room hazards. Those are not generally available for sale to the public, and should continue to be reserved for health care workers, the agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-encourages-more-americans-to-consider-n95-masks-101642201387028.html

Many students returned to classrooms later, while others went home after taking part in peaceful demonstrations.An online petition started by a Boston high school senior saying schools are a "Covid-19 breeding ground" and calling for a remote option had gathered more than 8,000 signatures as of Friday morning.The Boston Student Advisory Council, which called for the walkout, posted a series of demands on Twitter, including two weeks of remote learning and improved Covid-19 testing for teachers and students.The latest wave of infections has renewed the debate over whether to keep schools open, as officials seek to balance fears about the highly contagious Omicron variant with concerns that kids could fall even further behind after two years of stop-and-start instruction. The result has been a patchwork of Covid-19 policies around the country that has left parents feeling exhausted and bewildered.Ash O'Brien, a 10th-grade student at Boston Latin School who left the building with about a dozen others on Friday, said he didn't feel safe staying in school."I live with two grandparents who are immune-compromised," he said. "So I don't want to go to school, risk getting sick and come home to them."In a statement, Boston Public Schools said it supports students advocating for their beliefs and vowed to listen to their concerns.In Chicago, a student group, Chicago Public School's radical Youth Alliance, organized a walkout at various city schools on Friday afternoon, followed by a rally outside the district's headquarters.Students had just returned to Chicago schools on Wednesday after a week of canceled classes due to a standoff between teachers and the school district over Covid protocols. The teachers union agreed to return to in-person instruction after striking a deal to strengthen safeguards.Earlier this week, students at several New York City schools staged a walkout to protest what they say are inadequate safety measures. Mayor Eric Adams said on Thursday his administration was considering a temporary remote learning option for the significant number of students who are staying home.Nearly 5,000 public schools across the country have closed for at least one day this week due to the pandemic, according to Burbio, a website that tracks school disruptions.The Omicron surge appears to be slowing in areas of the country that were hit first In the last week, new cases have risen only 5% in Northeastern and Southern states compared with the prior seven-day period, according to a Reuters analysis. In Western states, by contrast, the number of new cases has climbed 89% in the past week compared with the previous week.Overall, the United States is still tallying nearly 800,000 new infections a day and record levels of hospitalized patients with Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-omicron-fuels-surge-us-students-stage-walkouts-to-protest-in-person-classes-101642200953372.html
15-01-2022||World||'Deeply regrettable': Johnson's office apologises to Queen for party on eve of Philip's funeral||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office apologised to Queen Elizabeth on Friday after it emerged that staff partied late into the night in Downing Street on the eve of Prince Philip's funeral, when mixing indoors was banned.Johnson is facing the gravest crisis of his premiership after almost daily revelations of social gatherings during Covid-19 lockdowns, some held when ordinary people could not bid farewell in person to dying relatives.As an opinion poll showed the opposition Labour Party pulling into a 10-point lead over Johnson's Conservatives, a report said he had encouraged staff to "let off steam" during regular "wine-time Friday" gatherings.After building a political career out of flouting accepted norms, Johnson is now under growing pressure from some of his own lawmakers to quit. Opponents say he is unfit to rule and has misled parliament by denying Covid-19 guidance was breached.In an extraordinary twist to a saga that has been widely lampooned by comedians and cartoonists, the Daily Telegraph said drinks parties were held inside Downing Street on April 16, 2021, the day before Prince Philip's funeral."It is deeply regrettable this took place at a time of national mourning and No. 10 (Downing Street) has apologised to the Palace," Johnson's spokesman told reporters.Johnson was at his Chequers country residence that day and was not invited to any gathering, his spokesman said.Such was the revelry in Downing Street, the Telegraph said, that staff went to a nearby supermarket to buy a suitcase of alcohol, spilled wine on carpets, and broke a swing used by the prime minister's son.The next day, Queen Elizabeth bade farewell to Philip, her husband of 73 years, following his death aged 99.Dressed in black and in a white trimmed black face mask, the 95-year-old Elizabeth cut a poignant figure as she sat alone, in strict compliance with coronavirus rules, during his funeral service at Windsor Castle.'LEAVE THE STAGE'Opponents have called for Johnson, 57, to resign, casting him as a charlatan who demanded the British people follow some of the most onerous rules in peacetime history while his staff partied at the heart of government.A small but growing number in Johnson's Conservative Party have echoed those calls, fearing it will do lasting damage to its electoral prospects."Sadly, the Prime Minister's position has become untenable," said Conservative lawmaker Andrew Bridgen, a former Johnson supporter. "The time is right to leave the stage."In the latest report of rule-breaking, the Mirror newspaper said staff had bought a large wine fridge for Friday gatherings, events that were regularly observed by Johnson as he walked to his apartment in the building."If the PM tells you to 'let off steam', he's basically saying this is fine," it quoted one source as saying.Separately, the former head of the government unit behind COVID restrictions, Kate Josephs, apologised for holding her own drinks gathering when she left the job in December 2020.Johnson has given a variety of explanations of the parties, ranging from denials that any rules were broken to expressing understanding for the public anger at apparent hypocrisy at the heart of the British state.The Independent newspaper said Johnson had dubbed a plan to salvage his premiership as "Operation Save Big Dog".Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, seen as a possible successor, said "real mistakes" had been made."We need to look at the overall position we're in as a country, the fact that he (Johnson) has delivered Brexit, that we are recovering from COVID... He has apologised.""I think we now need to move on."To trigger a leadership challenge, 54 of the 360 Conservative members of parliament must write letters of no confidence to the chairman of the party's 1922 Committee.The Telegraph said as many as 30 such letters had been submitted.Johnson faces a tough year ahead: beyond Covid-19, inflation is soaring, energy bills are spiking, taxation will rise in April and his party faces local elections in May.British police said on Thursday they would not investigate gatherings held in Johnson's residence during a coronavirus lockdown unless an internal government inquiry finds evidence of potential criminal offences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deeply-regrettable-johnson-s-office-apologises-to-queen-for-party-on-eve-of-philip-s-funeral-101642200526475.html

15-01-2022||World||Omicron cases receding in New York, major cities: Data||The US’ Omicron wave is beginning to recede in New York and other major cities, official data showed this week, even as Covid-19 hospitalisations, a lagging indicator, reached new highs. The trend of explosive rises in Omicron cases followed by equally fast declines follows similar patterns seen in Britain and in South Africa, where the variant was first reported in late November.In New York city, the seven-day average of new daily cases has been falling since around January 2, when they peaked at 40,000 a day - an all-time record.The figure stood at around 28,500 on January 10, still higher than anything seen in previous waves caused by other strains, an official tracker showed on Friday. Similar drops were visible in New York state, New Jersey and Chicago, the country’s third-largest city, as well as in the capital Washington.But the nationwide average is still rising, with more than 750,000 cases per day, as infections continue to shoot up in most states.Even as US President Joe Biden termed the current surge as a “pandemic of the unvaccinated”, drawing a distinction between how it has affected those who have taken the jab and those who haven’t, the Supreme Court blocked the administration from enforcing a vaccine-or-testing mandate for large employers in the country.The court’s six conservative judges outnumbered the three liberal justices — and ruled against federal vaccine mandates, on the grounds that the federal executive branch did not have the authority to impose such a sweeping requirement.India flight ban extendedHong Kong extended social distancing measures and the city’s flight ban on eight countries to stem an outbreak of the infectious Omicron variant.The Asian financial hub will extend its passenger flight ban on Australia, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, the UK and the US, until February 4, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam said on Friday .China further tightened its anti-pandemic measures in Beijing and across the country on Friday as scattered outbreaks continue. The city of Tianjin, about an hour from the capital, has ordered a third round of mass testing starting Saturday morning.With inputs from Prashant Jha||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-cases-receding-in-new-york-major-cities-data-101642193418695.html
15-01-2022||World||North Korea fires ballistic missiles in 3rd test of the year||North Korea fired two ballistic missiles Friday, the South and Japan said, in what would be its third weapons test this month, despite a fresh volley of US sanctions.The latest launches came just hours after Pyongyang warned of a “stronger and certain” reaction to the sanctions on five North Koreans linked to the country’s ballistic missile programme. Seoul’s joint chiefs of staff said it had detected two short-range ballistic missiles fired from North Pyongan province, adding they were “analysing the specifications”.The weapons likely “fell outside” Japan’s territorial waters, Tokyo’s defence minister Nobuo Kishi told reporters, adding that the repeated tests indicated Pyongyang was “aiming to improve its launch technology”.The Friday missiles came hours after Pyongyang accused the US of “provocation” over fresh sanctions imposed this week in response to a recent string of weapons tests.The launches were at 2.41pm and 2.52pm, with the weapons flying a distance of 430km at an altitude of 36km, according to Seoul’s joint chiefs of staff.Seoul’s National Security Council expressed “strong regret” over the recent missile launches, saying they “do not contribute to stability on the Korean Peninsula at this important juncture.”Pyongyang debuted a hypersonic missile in September last year, and carried out what it called two successful tests this month, as it looks to add the weapon to its arsenal.In response, the US imposed new sanctions on Pyongyang this week. On Friday, the US condemned North Korea’s latest ballistic missile launch.“We remain committed to a diplomatic approach to the DPRK and call on them to engage in dialogue. Our commitment to the defence of the Republic of Korea and Japan remains ironclad”, a state department spokesperson said in an emailed statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missiles-in-3rd-test-of-the-year-101642192849270.html
15-01-2022||World||China dismisses spy claims||China on Friday dismissed a rare public warning by British security services that a suspected Chinese agent was trying to influence lawmakers, saying it was the result of watching “too many 007 movies”.British authorities said on Thursday that a London-based solicitor “knowingly engaged in political interference activities” inside parliament, citing Britain’s counter-intelligence and domestic spy agency MI5.Christine Lee had reportedly worked on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party to gain influence through donations, the office of House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said.China’s foreign ministry denied engaging in “interference activities”, blasting the accusations as “alarmist remarks based on some individuals’ subjective assumptions”.“Perhaps some individuals have watched too many 007 movies, leading to unnecessary mental associations,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular press conference, referring to the James Bond book and movie franchise.MI5’s security notice said Lee was acting “on behalf of the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party” and answered to figures in China and Hong Kong.‘Patriotism’: HK police switch to goose-steppingHong Kong’s police force will switch from colonial-era British marching drills to the goose-stepping style seen on the Chinese mainland, the city’s force said on Friday, citing the need to show officers’ “patriotism”.The stiff-legged marching technique was first publicly demonstrated by Hong Kong officers on April 15 during National Security Education Day - designated to mark a Beijing-imposed law that has empowered a crackdown on dissent.The force has “actively planned for the full roll-out of Chinese-style foot drills in order to show patriotism and foster love for our motherland and Hong Kong”, police said.Staff from China’s People’s Liberation Army barracks in Hong Kong have been teaching the city’s police officers the technique since February 2021.Taiwan adds mine-laying to defences against ChinaTaiwan on Friday commissioned new navy minelayers to add to its defences against China.President Tsai Ing-wen presided over a commissioning ceremony for the navy’s First and Second Mining Operations Squadrons, which will operate ships able to automatically sow large numbers of small but powerful mines at high speed without the need for divers.Such technologies are part of a strategy to deter any possible invasion from China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-dismisses-spy-claims-101642192968545.html
15-01-2022||World||US concerned Russia prepping for invasion||The Biden administration believes Russian actors are preparing potential sabotage operations against Russian forces and fabricating Ukrainian provocations in social media to justify an intervention and sow divisions in Ukraine, according to a US official who asked not to be identified.President Vladimir Putin’s government is laying the groundwork to justify an attack, including through sabotage activities and information operations, by accusing Ukraine of preparing offensive operations, according to the person.As part of the plan, Moscow has prepositioned operatives trained in urban warfare and in using explosives possibly to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia’s proxy forces in or near Ukraine, the person said, adding that the plan would likely be set in motion if diplomacy with the US, Nato and key European nations fail.The news follows a cyber attack that downed a wide range of Ukrainian government websites on Friday. In previous incursions in Ukraine’s Crimea region and in Georgia, Russia was accused of ramping up disinformation campaigns and staging “false flag” events to justify its interventions.President Joe Biden has been briefed on Friday’s attack but the US doesn’t yet have attribution for who was behind it, according to a spokesperson for the National Security Council. Russia has rejected those charges, and says it has no plans to attack Ukraine.With more than 100,000 Russian troops on Ukraine’s border, US officials have long warned that Moscow could try to create a “false flag” event to justify an incursion.Russia on Friday strongly reaffirmed its demand that Nato doesn’t expand eastward despite the rejection of that by the military alliance amid a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine.Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov warned that Moscow wouldn’t wait indefinitely for the Western response, saying he expects the US and Nato to provide a written answer next week.EU foreign ministers on Friday warned Russia of a “robust” response, fearing that a cyberattack against Ukraine could prepare the ground for military action by Moscow against its neighbour.Meanwhile, Ukraine has proposed three-way talks with Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. “We are still waiting for the reaction on this, I think, from the Russian side. But our American partners take our proposal with some interest,” said the head of the president’s office, Andriy Yermak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-concerned-russia-prepping-for-invasion-101642192397247.html
15-01-2022||India||Odisha government moves to raise wages of prisoners by four fold||BHUBANESWAR: Six months after the Odisha government marginally hiked the daily wages of the convicts and undertrial prisoners in 87 jails of the state, the prisons directorate has proposed to raise the daily wages by at least four times after deduction of maintenance cost of each convict. The directorate of prisons in a letter to the state home secretary proposed that the daily wages be hiked as per the orders of the Orissa high court passed in December last year which advised the state government to adopt the best practices of Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Telangana and Chhattisgarh in the matter of prisoners’ wages and issue a circular within a period of two months. In its letter, the prisons directorate also referred to the minimum wages for unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled labourers notified by the Odisha labour commissioner in November last year, fixing the daily wages of unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled labourers to Rs. 315, Rs. 355 and ₹405 respectively. The prisons directorate said the convicts and under-trial prisoners can be given ₹234, ₹274 and ₹324 for unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled convicts respectively after deductions of cost of upkeep/ maintenance of Rs. 81.49 per day. In its December judgement, the Orissa high court asked the state government to revise wages to all inmates referring to the best practices in Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Telangana and Chhatisgarh in regard to wages of prisoners. “The practice in jails in Odisha is that while convicts are engaged in activities of carpentry, farming, etc., it is voluntary when it comes to undertrials. The Court finds that the rate of wages offered to prisoners, when compared to the best practices elsewhere in the country, is abysmally low,” the HC said in its order while referring to a 1998 judgement which said “it is not only the legal right of a workman to have wages for the work, but also a social imperative and an ethical compulsion”. Quoting the SC judgement, the high court had said “extracting somebody’s work without giving him anything in return is only reminiscent of the period of slavery and the system of beggar”. In June last year, the Odisha government marginally hiked the daily wages of convicts from ₹40 to ₹50 for unskilled prisoners, ₹50 to ₹60 for semi-skilled ones and ₹60 to ₹70 for and skilled convicts. While welcoming the move of the prisons directorate to raise the daily wages, human rights activists said the state government should immediately implement it instead of subjecting it to routine examination. “The HC has clearly given a timeline and so the government should not delay its implementation as it would amount to contempt of court. But what is surprising is the government move to deduct ₹81.5 a day towards upkeep and maintenance cost from their due wage. It’s the duty of the state to maintain the convicts and they should not be charged anything. Besides, the jails also earn a handsome amount from what the convicts make while serving their sentence,” said Omkar Devdas, a human rights lawyer. The Orissa High Court judgement came in response to two writ petitions filed by one Krushna Prasad Sahoo, a convict in Balasore district jail in 2006 and 2014 highlighting various issues in Odisha jails such as violation of human rights in custody, treatment of prisoners and maintenance of good sanitation inside jails, payment of compensation to prisoners who die in custody due to medical negligence and whether first time offenders, under trials, life convicts, other convicts, women and children need to be completely segregated from each other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-government-moves-to-raise-wages-of-prisoners-by-four-fold-101642270214814.html

His remarks come at a time when the country is locked in a border row with China, and negotiations are ongoing to cool tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. In his address at the Army Day parade, the army chief referred to the developments along the northern border with China and described last year as “challenging.”India and China held the 14th round of military talks between corps commanders to keep the border situation under control, he said. The 14th round of India-China military dialogue on January 12 — like the previous round held on October 10 — failed to yield any positive outcomes, although both countries said they would work towards mutually acceptable solutions to resolve the 20-month standoff along the LAC. The next round is expected to be held soon. “Our patience is a symbol of our self-confidence,” Naravane said. “No one should make the mistake of testing our patience.” On Thursday, a joint statement was released from the two armies talking about a consensus on consolidating previous outcomes and taking steps for security and stability on the ground. At his customary annual press conference on January 12, Naravane had said India will deal with the People’s Liberation Army in a firm and peaceful way, but if it comes to war or conflict, India will emerge victorious. Despite three rounds of disengagement at friction points on the LAC, the two armies still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each and advanced weaponry deployed in the Ladakh theatre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-allow-any-change-in-status-quo-at-border-says-army-chief-101642269918648.html

15-01-2022||India||‘If he wants to...’: Kejriwal responds to reports Utpal Parrikar is joining AAP||PANAJI: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said he will be open to welcoming Utpal Parrikar, the son of former union defence minister Manohar Parrikar into the Aam Aadmi Party, should the latter express his desire to switch from the BJP. Speaking to reporters during a round of door-to-door visits that the Delhi Chief Minister has embarked upon in Goa, Kejriwal, however, sounded skeptical that the elder son of the former defence minister will switch from the BJP. “Does he want to come (with us)? First you ask him if he wants to come. If he wants to come then we will definitely take him,” Kejriwal said. Utpal Parrikar has lashed out at the ruling BJP leadership for indicating that the party ticket for the Panaji constituency will be given to Atanasio “Babush” Monserrate, who Utpal said was tainted by his criminal antecedents and that the “kind of politics” he is presently seeing in Goa is “not acceptable” to him. While indicating that he was inclined to contest, Utpal said he will announce his decision at the right time. The Delhi chief minister began his door-to-door campaigning by visiting homes in the Pale village falling in the San André constituency seeking votes in the name of his party that is making a second attempt at contesting Goa elections. “There is a lot of support. People are excited to try a new party. They want change. For many years Congress and BJP have been alternating in power in Goa, but they failed to deliver. Give us one chance and if we fail, we won’t ask for your votes again,” Kejriwal said. Kejriwal also rubbished the prospects of other parties in the fray saying that a party like the TMC has failed to win the ‘faith’ of the people. “I am happy to see the expectation of the people for an honest alternative.

The committee was set up after sending wrong messages to the party’s national leaders. I can see an ominous sign. We want to fight this together,” Thakur told media persons. Thakur held a meeting in Kolkata on Saturday with a section of the party’s senior leaders including former state vice-president Jaiprakash Majumdar, former general secretary Sayantan Basu and party legislators Ashok Kirtania and Subrata Thakur. “A particular leader, in a bid to take control of the whole party (state unit), formed the committee by excluding veteran and experienced leaders of the party. I believe that leader and his associates have connection with some other political parties. We would foil all their plans and that’s why we met today,” he said without naming the leader. The West Bengal unit of the BJP announced its new state committee in December 2021 replacing several veterans and triggering rumblings in the organisation by retaining many who came from the Trinamool Congress (TMC). Earlier, Thakur and at least nine MLAs quit the party’s WhatsApp groups after the party overhauled its district committees. “Almost 90% of the leaders, who helped to increase the BJP’s vote share from around 2% to 40% in the state, were excluded from all committees at the state, district, block and booth levels. It could be a conspiracy of a rival party. We want removal of that leader. We have already informed our national level leaders and we would take this protest forward in the future,” he said. The BJP’s state leadership, however, tried to downplay the incident saying that it was not a party meeting and there were no rebel leaders. “There is no rebellion protest within the BJP. We don’t have any information about any such meetings as it was not a party meeting. There is a protocol when a party meeting is convened. Some party leaders may get together but that is not a party meeting. We can’t tag them as rebels. Thakur is a MP and a union minister. It won’t be right to tag him as a rebel. The MLAs who were with him are all party’s legislators. If there is any grievance there is a protocol in the party,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP’s state spokesperson. This comes two days after the party’s state president Sukanta Majumdar dissolved the new cells and departments which were announced on December 22. “This is their internal matter. I don’t want to comment on it. I really don’t know when a leader comes in and goes out of the party. They had roped in leaders to form an organisation which is now falling apart,” said Partha Chatterjee, TMC general secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ominous-signs-says-union-minister-as-rift-in-bengal-bjp-comes-out-in-open-101642261994278.html

15-01-2022||India||Blackbuck skin found in house of doctor accused of performing illegal abortion||The police have recovered the skin of a blackbuck from house of the doctor arrested in an illegal abortion case in Maharashtra's Wardha district, an official said on Saturday. Earlier this week, the police had found 11 skulls and 54 bones of foetuses in the premises of a private hospital where the accused doctor worked in Arvi taluka of the district. The police have arrested five persons, including Dr Rekha Kadam and two nurses, for performing an abortion on a 13-year-old girl. During a search, the police recovered the skin of a blackbuck from Dr Kadam's house and the same has been handed over to the forest department, the official said, adding that a separate offence has been registered in this regard. Earlier on Wednesday, 11 skulls and 54 bones of foetuses were found in a biogas plant located in the premises of Kadam Hospital. The police had arrested Dr Kadam, two nurses of the hospital for allegedly performing an illegal abortion on an underage girl and also nabbed the parents of a minor boy who allegedly impregnated the girl with whom he was in a relationship. According to the police, the doctor had failed to inform the authorities about performing an abortion on a girl under the age of 18. A probe is underway to ascertain if the bones and skulls recovered from the biogas plant were disposed of legally or illegally, it was stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blackbuck-skin-found-in-house-of-doctor-accused-of-performing-illegal-abortion-101642254453609.html
15-01-2022||India||Four die, two fall critically sick in a suspected hooch tragedy in Nalanda||PATNA: In yet another incident of suspected hooch tragedy, four persons died and two left critically ailing allegedly due to consumption of illicit liquor late on Friday evening in chief minister Nitish Kumar’s home district of Nalanda. The deceased are Bhago Mistri (55), Manna Mistri (55), Dharmendra alias Nageshwar Mistri (50) and Kalichanra Mistri (48), all of them of the twin tola of Chhoti Palari and Pahar Talli under Sohsarai police station area. Shivaji Chauhan and Ram Swarup, both of them in the same age group and of the same locality, are being treated at Bihar Sharif sadar hospital. The condition of both the persons is stated to be precarious. Family members alleged that the victims, who worked as construction labourers, consumed alcohol together and fell sick once they reached home. “While two of them died at home, one died at Sohsarai primary health centre during the treatment and another declared brought dead,” said a police officer. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Sadar, Sibli Nomani, under whose jurisdiction the incident occurred, said that the reasons for the death was not clear as yet. “Statement of the bereaved families are being recorded. Postmortem reports of the deceased are being awaited to know the exact cause of the deaths,” said Nomani. State DGP SK Singhal could not be contacted for his comments. The police personnel, who picked his official phone, said the DGP could be contacted on this number during the office time. “Other than the office hours, DGP saheb hands over his mobile to the control room,” said the staff. Additional chief secretary, home, Chaitanya Prasad said the DGP was the most suited person to comment on it. This is the seventh incident of hooch in Bihar in which more than 40 persons have died allegedly due to the intake of spurious liquor in the last six months, even as the state has been under total prohibition regime since April, 2016. Most of the hooch tragedies were reported from East Champaran, West Champaran, Muzaffarpur and Samastipur districts in the recent times. State BJP chief and West Champaran MP Sanjay Jaiswal on Friday once again batted for the review of prohibition law, saying that the legislation may be well intentioned but its implementation has brought shame to the state. His reaction was to a social media post of the JD(U) spokesman Abhishek Jha, who questioned Jaiswal’s visit to the houses of the victims of hooch tragedy in the latter’s home constituency. In a post, Jaiswal also claimed to have personal knowledge of many instances in which people from other states had to suffer for carrying liquor though they were merely passing through Bihar. JD(U) spokesman Rajiv Ranjan said that it was a shocking incident and those responsible for it would be penalized. “Such type of incidents is abated by those unsocial elements, who are utterly disappointed by the liquor law. So far as the state BJP chief’s assertion is concerned, I hope that leaders of the alliance partners must abide by the coalition dharma and help the government enforce the law with full firmness. After all, they too have taken pledge to make Bihar liquor free,” added Ranjan. Congress leader and former MLC Ajay Kumar Singh said that recurring hooch tragedies exposed the failure of the state government and it was high time the liquor law should be reviewed to save the poor and the downtrodden, who generally fall prey to spurious liquor. “Leaders of the ruling parties have openly said that alcohols of good brands are easily available to affordable lots. But the poor mostly resort to the illegally produced country liquor as they are available cheap. The government shall better focus on social awareness to dissuade people from alcohol consumption than using stringent legal route,” said Singh.

15-01-2022||India||India, Sri Lanka review progress in extending loans worth $1.5 bn||NEW DELHI: India and Sri Lanka on Saturday reviewed the progress in extending loans worth a total of $1.5 billion to the island nation for emergency purchases of food, medicines and fuel to tide over an economic crisis. The matter figured in a virtual meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Sri Lankan finance minister Basil Rajapaksa, who visited New Delhi last month to discuss a four-point financial assistance package. Sri Lanka has been grappling with a severe debt and foreign exchange crisis, which has been exacerbated by a downturn in tourist arrivals because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Analysts believe the rapidly depleting foreign exchange reserves could result in a default on external debt. Following a meeting between Indian envoy Gopal Baglay and Sri Lanka’s Central Bank governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal in Colombo on Thursday, India extended a Saarc currency swap facility of $400 million and deferred the payment of $515.2 million to the Asian Clearing Union (ACU) by two months to assist Sri Lanka. At their meeting, Jaishankar and Rajapaksa “reviewed the progress in extending Indian credit facility of $1 billion for importing food, essential items and medicine and $500 million for importing fuel from India”, the external affairs ministry said in a statement. Jaishankar tweeted the two sides discussed the “early realisation” of these loans. The ministers “positively noted” the extension of $400 million under the Saarc currency swap arrangement and deferral of the ACU settlement of $515.2 million, the statement said. Jaishankar also tweeted that India will be a “steadfast and reliable partner of Sri Lanka”. He said he assured Rajapaksa that India will take up initiatives to support Sri Lanka at this important juncture with other international partners. The statement said India “has always stood with Sri Lanka, and will continue to support Sri Lanka in all possible ways for overcoming the economic and other challenges posed by Covid-19 pandemic”. It added, “As close friends and maritime neighbours, both India and Sri Lanka stand to gain from closer economic inter-linkages.” Both ministers noted that recent steps taken by the Sri Lankan government for jointly modernising the Trincomalee oil tank farm will boost the confidence of investors and enhance Sri Lanka’s energy security. They agreed to remain in touch for guiding mutually beneficial economic cooperation. Rajapaksa recalled India’s longstanding cooperation with Sri Lanka and “deeply appreciated the gestures of support”, the statement said. He welcomed Indian investments in several important spheres, including ports, infrastructure, energy, renewable energy, power and manufacturing, and assured Jaishankar that an environment conducive to investments will be provided by Sri Lanka. Last week, Sri Lanka signed a deal with a subsidiary of Indian Oil Corporation for the long-gestating project to refurbish the British era Trincomalee oil farm, an 850-acre storage facility with a capacity of almost one million tonnes. State-owned Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Adani Group finalised a deal last year to develop the west container terminal at Colombo port. Jaishankar also took up the issue of Indian fishermen detained in Sri Lanka, and urged Colombo to ensure their early release as a humanitarian gesture. India’s moves to extend financial aid to Sri Lanka come close on the heels of a visit to Sri Lanka last week by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, who said in Colombo that no “third party” should interfere in the China-Sri Lanka relationship. A large part of Sri Lanka’s outstanding debt is held by China, which has extended soft loans worth billions of dollars that some experts say have put the island nation in a debt trap. During a meeting with Wang, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa called on China to restructure debt repayments as a solution to the economic crisis. He also sought a concessional trade credit scheme for imports from China.

15-01-2022||India||Community transmission of Omicron in Delhi: What this new study claims||A study into Delhi Covid samples between November 25 and December 23 last year has indicated that there was an eventual community spread of the Omicron in the Capital. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain already claimed that Omicron was spreading in the community as people without any travel history were getting positive for Omicron, the variant which has caused the surge in Covid-19 cases in India. However, the report by the department of clinical virology, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, is the first report confirming community transmission of Omicron in Delhi, news agency ANI said."The respiratory specimen of all RT-PCR confirmed positive cases between November 25 -December 23, 2021, collected from five districts of Delhi were subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Complete demographic and clinical details were also recorded. Hence, we analysed the formation of local and familial clusters and eventual community transmission," the study noted. It found that around 60.9% of the Covid-infected people whose samples were tested showed a community spread."Out of the 264 cases during this study period, 68.9 per cent (n=182) were identified as Delta variant and its sub-lineages while 31.06 per cent (n=82) were Omicron variant with BA.1 as the predominant sub-lineage (73.1 per cent)," the study said.What is community transmission?SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that spreads from one person to another. The source of the infection thus can be tracked by retracing the people an infected person met in the last few days. This is the standard way of contact tracing as being practised by the administrations. Community transmission is not a new concept. It implied a massive spread of the infection where the source can't be tracked as the virus is widespread in the community. It is a situation when it is not possible to track who gave the infection to whom as everybody, more or less, has the infection.During the peak of the second wave of the pandemic too, experts claimed that without community transmission the massive second wave was not possible.With Omicron, the issue of community transmission became evident as people without travel history tested positive of this variant. Omicron was first found in South Africa in November 2021. The first cases were reported in India in December. The first few cases were reported in people coming from abroad. The period in which the samples in Delhi have been studied was the time when Omicron's spread was accelerating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/community-transmission-of-omicron-in-delhi-what-this-new-study-claims-101642246662051.html

The decision was taken at an “All Konyak Summit” held in Mon town where leaders of Konyak organisations, Konyak legislators, officers, village chiefs etc. were present. The organisations on December 10 gave a month’s time to the government demanding that all officers and personnel involved in the killings of 14 civilians on December 4 and 5 be prosecuted in the appropriate civil court and the action taken report be brought in the public domain. However, the government’s probe team is yet to submit its final report. The Konyak organisations while extending the deadline warned that in the event of failure to fulfill their demands, the tribe will abstain from all national events within its customary jurisdiction as endorsed by the Eastern Nagaland People’s Organisation (ENPO), the apex body of six Naga tribes in five districts- Mon, Tuensang, Longleng, Kiphire, and Noklak. The ENPO in December declared non-cooperation with the armed forces until justice delivered to Oting victims and AFSPA repealed from Nagaland. The Konyak organisations said they have also resolved that all designated Army camps in Mon district, located within civilian areas, should be relocated. They further demanded that the state government’s Special Investigation Team (SIT) and the Army’s Court of Inquiry share their reports with the Konyak Union for perusal. The state’s SIT has announced that results from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory in Guwahati and Hyderabad were awaited to complete its final report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-civilian-killings-tribal-body-extends-ultimatum-to-govt-till-jan-25-101642243813700.html

Further, Gehlot promised that justice is served in the incident.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has held the Gehlot Government accountable for the incident and had strongly demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation's (CBI) probe into the case. BJP delegation had also gone to reach out to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Rajasthan where she was on a personal visit.While Responding to the BJP's attack and politicisation of the issue, Congress national spokesperson Supriya Shrinate wrote on Twitter, "BJP people had 'snatched' a daughter's body from her parents and burned it in Hathras. After the death of the rape victim, they point fingers at her character and defame her. Who are they to talk about serving justice to women?""Priyanka Ji is sensitive on this issue and has always stood by the voice of people. The people of BJP should look in their own pockets before spreading false news about them," she said.A specially-abled minor girl was found abandoned on the Tijara flyover in Alwar on January 12, Superintendent of Police Tejaswani Gautam told ANI."A specially-abled minor girl was found in an abandoned condition on the Tijara flyover in Alwar, Rajasthan. The girl was admitted to the hospital where it was found that there has been a lot of bleeding from her private part.

15-01-2022||India||Amid rising Covid-19 cases, polls to 4 municipal corporations in Bengal deferred to Feb 12||The Election Commission of India (ECI) has rescheduled the polls to four municipal corporations in West Bengal in view of the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation. As per the new schedule, the civic body polls in Bidhannagar, Asansol, Siliguri, and Chandannagar municipal corporations will now be held on February 12 instead of January 22.The decision to defer the civic body polls by three weeks was taken after the West Bengal government confirmed that it was okay with the elections getting postponed in view of the recent surge in Covid-19 cases across the state. The state election commission said in an official release today that the decision was taken with respect to the Calcutta high court's impetus asking the commission to reconsider the date of the polls.However, no new decisions have been taken regarding electioneering rules. Political parties in the fray are still allowed to conduct their campaignings, albeit under the ambit of the requisite Covid-19 norms and protocols. According to the election commission, campaigning will, however, have to end 72 hours before the civic body polls.Notably, the civic body polls in Bidhannagar, Asansol, Siliguri, and Chandannagar were originally scheduled to be held on January 22. However, in view of the worsening Covid-19 situation in the state, a number of petitions were submitted before the Calcutta high court, urging it to take necessary steps and reconsider the date of the elections. In turn, the high court notified the election commission on Friday and asked it to review the situation; however, it also directed the commission to take an “independent decision” in this regard.In view of this, the election commission, in a letter to the West Bengal government on Friday itself, wanted to know its stance regarding a potential reschedule of the civic body polls. This was especially important to know since the state government had several times in the past opposed a move to postpone dates of elections. However, this time, the state secretariat wrote back to the poll body with a green signal to defer the elections, adding that authorities have been ramping up measures to cut the spread of the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-rising-covid-19-cases-polls-to-4-municipal-corporations-in-bengal-deferred-to-feb-12-101642239239488.html

According to news agency PTI, Ketan Kakkad apparently owns a plot near Salman Khan's farmhouse in Panvel. The actor approached the court alleging that in an interview with a YouTube channel, Ketan has defamed Salman Khan. Judge Anil H Laddhad directed Kakkad to file his reply and posted the matter for further hearing on January 21, the news agency reported.Lawyers from DSK Legal which represents Khan sought an interim injunction (order) restraining Kakkad from making any further defamatory statements during the pendency of the suit. But Kakkad's lawyers Abha Singh and Aditya Pratap opposed the prayer, saying they received case papers only on Thursday evening and could not go through the entire suit.Kakkad's lawyers also said that if Salman Khan had waited for a month to file the suit, then their client Kakkad should also get some time to file the reply.According to Salman Khan's complaint, apart from Kakkad, two other people participated in the show. They have also been named as respondents. Social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and search engine Google have been made parties to the suit as Salman wants the defamatory content to be removed from the internet. The actor also wants a permanent order restraining Kakkad from positing or publishing any defamatory content about the actor or the farmhouse.According to a Bar and Bench report, Salman Khan's plea pointed out that Kakkad had attempted to purchase a plot of land beside Khan's Panvel farmhouse but the transaction was cancelled by the authorities as they deemed it illegal. Since then, Kakkad had been raising false and baseless accusations that the transaction got cancelled because of Salman Khan. The "false, disparaging and defamatory" allegations in videos, posts and tweets are causing harm and loss to the actor, his family members and also to his business ventures, Salman's lawyers said.“Comments made by Defendants travel well beyond the scope of fair comment” the suit stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/salman-khan-approaches-court-against-neighbour-on-charges-of-defamation-next-hearing-on-jan-21-101642239196565.html
15-01-2022||India||Catch your own waves at Mulki||As the swells come in from deeper waters, surfers keep a lookout to catch waves while laying on their belly on a surfboard, and as they spot one, they paddle to catch the centre of the rising wave and as it breaks towards the shore, the surfers jump from their bellies to their feet and right into the breaking wave. This is the perfect scenario for a surfing experience. And Indians are lapping up the idea of this water sport. Surfing is a lifetime experience and is all about a surfboard, the waves and your penchant for adventure. The long, gently sloped yet powerful waves of Mulki, a quaint town in Karnataka suits everyone from those relatively new to surfing, and experienced riders. Possessing blue skies and clear waters, the sport of surfing is fast catching up with adventure seekers ready to ride waves and learn surfing.Dikshit Suvarna, popularly known as Druva, started the Indica Surf School in 2014. Nestled amid lush green evergreen and deciduous forests of Karnataka, it is a traveller’s paradise. The ocean is a little over from the Mulki base allowing you to enjoy a calming stroll on the way to the surfing retreat. The Surf House is not far from the central town, thus, inviting you to experience plenty of activities, from shopping to visiting magnificent museums. “My love for surfing which I learnt as an adolescent has culminated into this surf school.”He adds, “We help people learn the basics of surfing, improve their ocean knowledge and experience a new perspective when it comes to aquatic sports.”Sukriti Chaturvedi, content creator and blogger, says, “To be honest, I’m a lil scared of adventure sports... but surfing seemed something extra fun and adventurous! So I thought to give it a try. The place is extraordinary and the instructors at Indica surf school make you feel very very comfortable. On the first day, I learnt the basics and balancing. With the waves crashing on the shore, it was a tad bit difficult to handle the surf board and myself. I fell in the water multiple times but it was all fun! Though I could only do a 2-day course, it was an experience of a lifetime! Wait... Am I a surfer now?”Standing up on a board, spotting the waves, understanding currents and being in the right spot when the wave approaches is learnt with experience and a lot of practice. The conditions are always changing and after getting caught in the wrong spot multiple times and experiencing a nosedive once in a while, you will be able to catch your own waves without a push. Staying at the schoolStaying at the school is an excellent opportunity to enjoy the real experience with a caring family to look after you. It is a special place, as Deepika Suvarna and Pushpalata Suvarna make a traveller feel at home. Home-cooked piping hot meals are served in the kitchen of their home. After a gruelling session, the meals transport you to a food heaven. It features farm views, air-conditioned or fan cooled rooms, fast internet, a wardrobe, and a bathroom with hot and cold shower facilities.“I had never even thought of going surfing when my friend called me up while she was waiting for her Mangalore flight at Mumbai and convinced me to go to Mulki to surf! The sudden plan was too much to decipher but everything was worth it because the moment I entered Indica Surfing school I knew I was in for a treat! The very next morning we went surfing and it turns out I wasn’t as good at it as my friends but I had so much fun! The place is beautiful. What I personally loved most was the family who runs this place! Deepika, Dhruva and their Mummy were so wonderful and OH MY GOD the food!! Delicious food every single time. Deepika also helped us navigate to the right sunsets and also the best saree shop where we picked a load of beautiful Sarees. Indica surf school is much more than just a surf school. They are an overall experience,” says Tia Rohin Sebastian, actor.“Indica Surf School was very peaceful, especially Deepika who was very sweet. Local authentic food was the icing on the cake. My husband and I ensured we ate every meal,” says Sanjana Palai.Indica Surf School is a complete package and an experience of a lifetime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/catch-your-own-waves-at-mulki-101642239253312.html

15-01-2022||India||Netaji birth anniversary on Jan 23 to be part of Republic Day celebrations: Official||NEW DELHI: The Republic Day celebrations from this year will start from January 23 instead of January 24 to include the birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in line with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government’s “focus to commemorate important aspects of our history and culture,” a government official said on Saturday.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, however, did not clarify what the decision will translate into. One possibility is that the government will count events to commemorate Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary held every year to be part of the R-Day celebrations.Last year, the Centre announced that January 23 will be celebrated as Parakram Diwas or the day of valour.Other such days, observance of which has become a yearly affair, are August 14 as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day, October 31 as National Unity Day (birth anniversary of Sardar Patel), November 15 as Janjatiya Gaurav Divas (Birsa Munda’s birth anniversary), November 26 as Constitution Day and December 26 as Veer Baal Divas (a tribute to the four sons of Guru Gobind Singh), the official cited above added.Reacting to the decision, Chandra Bose, kin of Subhas Chandra Bose, said even though it is a good decision but to really honour the freedom fighter, the government needs to understand and implement his ideology.“Subhas Chandra Bose is extremely relevant in 21st century India. We see all across the country, I don’t suggest any specific political party, all parties are engaged in divisive politics. This must stop, Netaji envisioned a united India. If Netaji had returned to India, there would not have been a Partition of India or Partition of Bengal. India will again get divided, unless you bring Netaji’s ideology into the national mainstream of politics,” he added.Ahead of the 125th birth anniversary this year, Chandra Bose, who is also a member of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him to have the freedom fighter’s image on currency notes. He also suggested declaring January 23 as a national holiday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/netaji-birth-anniversary-on-jan-23-to-be-part-of-republic-day-celebrationsofficial-101642235173262.html

The Indian Army won't let any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo along the country's borders to succeed.Speaking about the standoff with China on eastern Ladakh, he said, “Last year was extremely challenging for the Army. Joint efforts at various levels led to disengagement in many areas which is a constructive step. The 14th round of military-level talks was held between India and China recently to keep the situation under control.”Regarding the Line of Control on the western border, the Army chief said the situation is better than previous year, but Pakistan is still harbouring terrorists.On the role of women in the armed forces, General Naravane said, the Army has taken major steps to give equal opportunity to women. “Now they can be in a high position and take bigger responsibilities. This year in NDA (National Defence Academy), women cadets will be included and women will also join as Army pilots,” he said.Also read | Army Day 2022: World's largest Khadi flag to be displayed in Jaisalmer todayEarlier in the day, the three service chiefs – General Naravane, Air Force Chief Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari and Navy Chief Admiral R Hari Kumar – paid their obeisance at the National War Memorial in Delhi to mark the day.The armed forces chiefs also laid a wreath at the war memorial.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind also extended their greetings on Army day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/message-is-clear-army-chief-on-bid-to-change-status-quo-along-border-101642227752928.html

He recently said masks "should not be used for long"."Masks should not be worn for long. I am saying as an MBBS doctor that there should not be prolonged mask usage. One should wear a mask in crowds. There is no need to panic during this third wave of Covid-19. The symptoms will get cured in five-six days," he said when asked about his not wearing a mask in a programme.Drawing an analogy of roads with film actors’ skin and cheeks seems to be a favourite with politicians of all hues and times.Maharashtra minister and Shiv Sena leader Gulabrao Patil had recently sparked a row after comparing the smoothness of roads in his Assembly constituency Jalgaon district to actor-turned-politician Hema Malini's cheeks. The minister later apologised for the remark.Later, Sena MP said such comparisons were meant to accord respect to the veteran actor and had happened earlier too. He said former Bihar chief minister Lalu Yadav had come up with a similar example.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-congress-mla-vows-to-make-roads-smoother-than-kangana-ranaut-s-cheeks-101642226208789.html

Will be happy to partner Tesla in working through the challenges to set shop in India/Telangana. Our state is a champion in sustainability initiatives & a top notch business destination in India."Two days ago, Musk, while responding to a Twitter user asking when Tesla will launch in India, said, “Still working through a lot of challenges with the government.”The leading entrepreneur has been pushing to lower import duties on his Tesla cars in India to make the electric cars widely available.India is the world's second-most populous country and one of the fastest-growing economies.However, major Indian automotive producers Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors and Mahindra are opposed to the idea of slashing import duties on automobiles, a LiveMint report stated.Government sources said that Tesla was free to use the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) window to produce electric vehicles in India.The reason given by government sources, according to LiveMint, for the delay in Tesla's launch was that Musk wanted to slash import duties without offering any commitment to produce in India.Earlier on Friday, Musk had announced that Tesla Inc merchandise can be bought using digital currency Dogecoin. The meme coin surged by nearly 20 per cent immediately after the tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/happy-to-partner-with-tesla-tweets-kt-rama-tao-as-elon-musk-talks-of-challenges-with-govt-101642217601520.html

15-01-2022||India||‘Can’t make marital rape an offence until talks end’: Centre to Delhi HC||The Union government has informed the Delhi high court that marital rape cannot be made into a criminal offence until the Centre’s consultation with all stakeholders is complete, paving the way for comprehensive amendments in criminal law instead of “piecemeal” changes.Submitting a fresh affidavit in response to a clutch of petitions to criminalise marital rape, the Centre maintained that it is examining the issue of broad changes in criminal law of the country and that the petitioner could also give their suggestions to the competent authorities.The affidavit, filed on Thursday, stated that the exception to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which exempts forceful sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife from the offence of rape, cannot be struck down at the instance of the petitioner alone. “Principles of natural justice require larger hearing of all stakeholders,” emphasised the government.The government’s petition indicates no change in its position -- and comes amid a rising chorus seeking the criminalisation of marital rape.Underlining that amendment of criminal law is “a continuous process”, it added that suggestions have been invited from chief ministers of all the state governments and from Union territories, the Chief Justice of India, chief justices of all high courts, judicial academies, national law universities, Bar Council of India, Bar Council of all high courts and members of both Houses of Parliament. The affidavit, filed through the Union ministry of home affairs, however, does not mention the date when views were solicited.“The government has already undertaken a comprehensive exercise to make amendments in the criminal laws and thus, the government is already seized of the matter. The petitioners are also at liberty to give their submissions/suggestions to the Ministry,” stated the affidavit, which has been reviewed by HT.It relied upon parliamentary standing committee reports in 2008 and 2010 to argue that the need is to overhaul the criminal laws instead of making any piecemeal changes in any specific legislation.The government further cited the 172nd report of the Law Commission of India on “Review of Rape Laws” in March 2000 that said it would not recommend deletion of the exception clause in Section 375 “since that may amount to excessive interference with the marital relationship”.Further, a 2017 Supreme Court judgment, said the government, read down an exception to Section 375 only to the extent of criminalising rape with a minor wife but clarified at the same time that it has not expressed any view on the issue of marital rape.“We make it clear that we have refrained from making any observation with regard to the marital rape of a woman, who is 18 years of age and above, since that issue is not before us at all. Therefore, we should not be understood to advert to that issue even collaterally,” said the 2017 judgment, as quoted by the affidavit.Even as the Centre’s affidavit makes references to the reports of the Law Commission and parliamentary panels, it has refrained from mentioning the recommendation made by Justice JS Verma’s committee in 2013.The Justice Verma committee was set up to propose amendments in criminal laws in the wake of gang- rape of a paramedical student in December 2012. This committee received around 80,000 suggestions and finalised its 644-page report in 2013, proposing that “the exception for marital rape be removed” and the law must “specify that a marital or other relationship between the perpetrator or victim is not a valid defence against the crimes of rape or sexual violation”. The committee recommended the criminalization of marital rape, since the state of being married does not generate automatic consent to sexual acts.The fresh affidavit has been filed by the Union government in addition to the one filed in August 2017 which said that it has to be ensured that marital rape does not become a phenomenon that destabilises the institution of marriage and “an easy tool for harassing the husbands”. The petitions have been pending before the court since 2015.The 2017 affidavit added: “What may appear to be marital rape to an individual wife, it may not appear so to others...if all sexual acts by a man with his own wife will qualify to be marital rape, then the judgment as to whether it is a marital rape or not will singularly rest with the wife. The question is what evidences the Courts will rely upon in such circumstances as there can be no lasting evidence in case of sexual acts between a man and his own wife.”A bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar is currently hearing final arguments in the bunch of PILs filed by NGOs RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association, and two individuals, who have sought removal of the exception to Section 375, saying that it discriminated against married women who were sexually assaulted by their husbands.The Delhi government has submitted before the bench that a court does not have the power to create a new offence even as it argued that marital rape is treated as a “crime of cruelty” in India which can be prosecutable under charges of domestic violence, assault or cruelty under the IPC.On his part, senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao, who has been appointed as amicus curiae to assist the court, has argued in favour of doing away with the exception in Section 375 to make marital rape an offence.Referring to the fresh affidavit on behalf of the Union government, solicitor general Tushar Mehta made a brief statement on Thursday, saying the government is considering a “constructive approach” in the matter.

Bidhannagar falls in North 24 Parganas district.Bengal on Friday reported 22,645 new Covid-19 cases -- 822 less than the previous day -- which pushed the tally to 1,863,697, the health department said in its bulletin on Friday.On January 14, HT had reported that the state became the first region in the country where the Covid-19 wave, or average daily cases, has surpassed the peak of the brutal second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/consider-postponing-civic-elections-amid-covid-surge-calcutta-hc-to-sec-101642188490327.html
15-01-2022||India||Kerala govt, Mutt protest against rejection of tableau depicting social reformer on R-Day||The Kerala government on Friday protested against the Central government’s decision denying permission to the State’s Republic Day parade tableau depicting social reformer Sree Narayana Guru and asked the State unit of the BJP whether it would agree to the decision of the Centre.Following reports that the Defence Ministry, which manages the R-Day parade, has denied permission to Kerala’s proposal, the Sivagiri Mutt, founded by Guru, also expressed strong protest and concern.“The Central government’s decision to deny permission to the Kerala’s Republic Day tableau, which contained anti-caste crusader Narayana Guru’s figure, is extremely condemnable. @BJP4Keralam must state whether they agree with this insulting attitude towards Kerala’s Guru,” V Sivankutty, State Education Minister, said in a tweet.The Mutt said it respects Adi Shankara as a master of Advaita but Guru was revered worldwide and across all sections of society.The reactions came after news reports said the Defence Ministry had rejected Kerala’s proposal to depict Guru and Jadayu Rock, a monument in south Kerala, together in a float. The Central government had reportedly suggested the statue of Adi Shankara instead, which was not accepted by the southern State.“Sree Narayana Gurudevan is universally accepted and respected by all sections of society, including political parties like the Congress, the BJP and the Communist Party. Although Adi Shankara was a great man, he was accepted only by a section of people in Kerala. Gurudev, on the other hand, is revered by people all across the world, regardless of caste or religion,” Mutt said in a statement.CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan had also criticised the Centre’s move.Meanwhile, the BJP said for the past few years, the proposal of Kerala for the R-Day parade was getting rejected due to mediocre floats.“Opportunity was denied for Kerala due to its lack of homework. Kerala’s presentation was being rejected for the few years due to mediocre floats,” BJP state chief K Surendran said in a statement.The State’s proposal for 2020 parade, intending to showcase Kerala’s art and architecture, was rejected by the Centre. The BJP-led government had rejected Kerala’s float depicting Vaikom Satyagraha, a historic renaissance movement, for the Republic Day parade in 2019.However, in 2021, Kerala’s tableau showed the State’s relationship with coir in the Republic Day parade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-govt-mutt-protest-against-rejection-of-tableau-depicting-social-reformer-on-rday-101642188370283.html
15-01-2022||India||Chennai reports record high fresh Covid cases||Chennai: Driven by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, Chennai recorded an all-time high of 8,963 Covid-19 cases on Friday since the pandemic began, health department data shows. Chennai reported 7,564 cases on a single day during the second wave on May 12 last year, which the city surpassed on Thursday with 8,218 cases. Tamil Nadu reported 23,459 Covid cases on Friday against 20,911 on Thursday. Active Covid cases have also mounted. On January 1, the state had 8,340 active cases and the number of people carrying the virus spiked to 118,017 on Friday, according to the health department bulletin. Health secretary J Radhakrishnan, referring to estimates by epidemiologists, said the cases will begin to decline in the state in another two weeks. “We had 5,907 cases on December 27. Despite us taking several precautionary measures, the cases have spread rapidly. Tamil Nadu crossed 20,000 new cases yesterday,” said Radhakrishnan. “It is likely to increase especially after the Pongal festival and the opinion of experts is that it will come down in another two weeks.”However, out of over 100,000 active cases, only 7,629 patients are under hospital treatment, including 608 in the ICUs of government hospitals, according to the health department data. This is vastly different from the scenario compared to the second wave when hospitalisations were high and patients were being treated outside hospitals in parking lots due to shortage of beds. On May 12 last year, 12,624 people were in hospitals, including 1,935 in ICUs. As of Thursday, 64% of the eligible people in Tamil Nadu have been fully vaccinated lessening the complications brought by SARS-CoV-2 and reducing deaths, say experts. Dr K Kolandaswamy, retired director of Tamil Nadu’s public health who is in a committee formed during the second wave to advise the state government on preparing for the third wave, said that a majority of those infected currently can be managed at home. “So we will not see a problem in government hospitals this time,” he said. “Government facilities are especially better placed this time. Most of our recommendations following the second have to strengthen labs, increase oxygen beds and add ambulances have been accomplished.” Experts say that the Omicron variant of concern detected in November is the cause of the exponential rise in cases. Out of the 241 Omicron cases in Tamil Nadu, 144 are from Chennai – all of them have been discharged. Chennai with the most number of cases is showing double the positivity rate compared to that of overall Tami Nadu. The city’s test positivity rate has surged from 3.3% on January 1 to 21.9%, which is twice the state average of 11.5%. Closer to Chennai, infections are rising in its adjoining district Chengalpattu, which also has a high positivity rate of 21.1% with 2,504 new cases on Friday. The wide difference in the number of daily cases between Chennai and Chengalpattu shows that health authorities are carrying out targeted testing. On January 12, Chennai tested 33,673 samples out of which 7,372 returned positive while Chengalpattu tested 8,725 samples out of which 1,840 people were found to have been infected. “We know Omicron spreads faster than the previous variants so the pattern in Chennai is not surprising but expected. The rate of growth of cases is already slowing down in Chennai though that’s not the case with whole numbers,” said Dr Prabhdeep Kaur, deputy director, National Institute of Epidemiology. “But I do see cases declining in Chennai in another 7 to 10 days and after that our focus has to be on the districts. Especially when several people have gone back home to the districts for Pongal.”
15-01-2022||India||NCW chief Rekha Sharma shocked at Mullakal’s acquittal||National Commission for Women chairperson Rekha Sharma on Friday said she was shocked to hear acquittal of Kerala nun rape case accused Franco Mullakal and promised to support the victim and fellow nuns. “Shocked at the judgment of the district sessions court. The victim must go to the high court. The NCW is with her in her fight for justice,” she tweeted after the verdict. Kerala women commission chairperson P Sathi Devi also expressed concern over the verdict. “We are with suffering nuns. We will help them,” she said. While political parties are guarded in their reaction, activists and others expressed their shock. “The verdict is really painful. But it is not over. In Sister Abhaya murder case it took 28 years for long arms of the law to punish offenders,” said Sister Lucy Kalapura who was expelled from Franciscan Clarist Congregation for openly supporting nuns who staged a sit-in in 2018 in Kochi seeking the arrest of Mullakal. She said the verdict will give a wrong message to those who want to come out against such atrocities. Former SP of Kottayam S Hari Shankar, who supervised the investigation, said the verdict will be unprecedented in Indian judiciary. “We can look at the verdict only with shock. There have been a lot of corroborate evidences and enough witnesses. There were medical evidences as well. We have to check what kind of message this verdict is giving to the society as a whole,” he said. Activist Joemon Puhtanpurakkal, who fought more than 25 years to ensure justice for Sister Abhaya, who was found murdered in a well of the convent, said it was only a temporary setback and nuns should continue their fight for justice. State fisheries minister Saji Cherian, also hailing from Kottayam, said the government will take a decision after taking legal opinion. But a senior lawyer with defence team, CS Ajayan, said the verdict was a natural outcome. “You can raise charges easily but you will have to corroborate these with evidences. The prosecution failed to come up with proofs to substantiate its charges.” Catholic Youth Forum leader Kennedy K said truth prevailed with the verdict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncw-chief-rekha-sharma-shocked-at-mullakal-s-acquittal-101642188131348.html
15-01-2022||India||Assam commission seeks CBI inquiry into illegal coal mining worth ₹4872 cr||GUWAHATI: A commission of inquiry set up by Assam government has recommended an independent investigation by an agency like Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into illegal coal mining worth ₹4782 cr by Coal India Limited (CIL) and North Eastern Coalfields (a subsidiary of CIL) in the state. “Because of the involvement of several departments/agencies, the commission is of the view that unless an inquiry is conducted by an independent agency, like CBI, over which the government of Assam has no control, the truth may not come out and in the process the guilty officers, will go unpunished,” it said. The one-man commission of inquiry was set up by Assam government in September 2020 to inquire into allegations of illegal coal mining in Saleki proposed reserve forest (PRF) and in Tikok open cast project (OCP) as well as other reserve forests in Digboi forest division of Tinsukia district by individuals and organisations. The commission headed by retired Gauhati High Court judge BP Katakey submitted its report in the winter session of the Assam assembly last month. The commission found that Coal India Limited (of which North Eastern Coalfields (NEC) is a unit) was granted a 30-year lease in 1973 to carry out mining in nine mines in three coalfields in the Digboi forest division in Tinsukia district in a total area spread over 6174 hectares from May 1, 1973 to April 30, 2003. It was revealed that while leases of five of the coal mines were renewed after their expiry in 2003, “there was no renewal of the other leases, after expiry of the thirty years lease”. The commission however noted that while the leases of the five mines were extended, they were not registered as required by rules. It was also found that the leases of four mines were extended by mines and minerals department of Assam government in 2019 (16 years after expiry of lease) and the lease of the fifth mine extended in 2008 (5 years after expiry of the earlier lease). “Such retrospective renewal of lease is not permissible,” the commission noted while adding that since the extensions were not registered, NEC and CIL “didn’t have any lease in respect of the aforesaid mines with effect from the date of expiry of the thirty year lease, i.e. from 1973 till date”. It observed that in absence of lease from competent authority, NEC, CIL “could not have carried out any mining operation in the aforesaid mines”, which includes Tikok OCP and Saleki PRF—“such mining activities on the part of NEC, CIL are, therefore, illegal”. During inquiry, the commission also found the NEC, CIL had violated provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 by breaking portions of the Tikok OCP for coal mining activities and other non-forest purposes without prior permission from central government. Field visit by the commission at Tikok OCP revealed that dumping of overburdens (waste or spoil from mining) caused damage to vegetation and the surrounding environment. The commission noticed rat-hole mining in the area done by other individuals and organisations apart from NEC, CIL, but couldn’t identity those responsible for it. The commission held the mines and minerals department of Assam and its officers responsible for failing to protect reserve forest land from illegal mining activities by NEC, CIL and other individuals and organisations. A report based on satellite imagery of the area submitted by the Assam chief conservator of forest to the commission revealed that from 2003 to 2020 (after expiry of the existing lease) area under mining in Saleki PRF increased from 192 hectares to 1458.8 hectares. Of this 1043 hectare was within the PRF, the rest outside (479 hectare open cast mining and 979 hectare rat-hole mining). Another report prepared by a local official estimated that apart from NEC, CIL nearly 400-40,000 persons illegally extracted 30-40 kg of coal per day (approximately 12,000 to 1200,000 kg of coal daily) from the area causing huge loss of revenue to the state exchequer. Other recommendations of the commission included steps to end all illegal mining activities in the area and urged the Centre and state to see if all mining can be stopped. It suggested setting up of a committee headed by the state DGP to take action against those involved in illegal mining, storage and transportation of coal. 
15-01-2022||India||Philippines to acquire 3 batteries of BrahMos||The Philippines confirmed on Friday it will acquire three batteries of the BrahMos cruise missile jointly developed by India and Russia in a deal worth almost $375 million, a development expected to boost India’s efforts to become a major exporter of defence hardware. The defence deal is unlikely to go down well with China, whose aggressive behaviour in the disputed South China Sea has taken relations with the Philippines to a fresh low. The Philippine Marines intend to use the BrahMos as a shore-based anti-ship missile. Philippine defence secretary Delfin Lorenzana said he had recently signed the “notice of award” – or the acceptance of India’s proposal for supplying the missile – for the Philippine Navy’s shore-based anti-ship missile acquisition project. “Negotiated with the Government of India, it includes the delivery of three batteries, training for operators and maintainers as well as the necessary Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) package,” Lorenzana said in a brief post on his Facebook page. The deal for the BrahMos was conceptualised as early as 2017, and the office of the Philippines president “approved its inclusion in the Horizon 2 Priority Projects in 2020”, he added. Hindustan Times had first reported in December 2019 that the Philippines was set to become the first country to buy the BrahMos missile system. Both sides were keen on signing the deal during a proposed visit by President Rodrigo Duterte early in 2021, but the plan fell through because of widespread disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The notice of award signed by Lorenzana on December 31 last year put the value of the BrahMos deal at $374.962 million. Last month, the Philippines government allocated 2.8 billion pesos ($55.5 million) for initial funding for the weapon system. A team from the Philippine Navy visited the production unit of BrahMos Aerospace in Hyderabad in December as part of the acquisition process. “The Coastal Defense Regiment of the Philippine Marines will be the primary employer of this modern strategic defense capability of the Armed Forces of the Philippines,” Lorenzana said. There was no official word from the Indian side, though Sudhir Mishra, who was till recently the CEO of BrahMos Aerospace, said in a tweet: “As then CEO and MD, worked on the Philippines contract for the past five years very hard connecting people, dots, procedures & unseen forces. BrahMos has shown the way for high value defence exports.” According to the government, policy changes have resulted in defence exports increasing by more than 325% over the last five years. India has set an ambitious target of achieving defence exports of $5 billion by 2024. The country exported defence gear worth ₹8,434.84 crore during 2020-21. However, the BrahMos deal is being seen as a game changer as India’s defence exports so far have been items such as avionics, coastal surveillance systems, spares for radars, personal protective items, and offshore patrol vessels. The deal with the Philippines could open the door for further sales of the BrahMos – which has a range of 290 km and can carry a 200-kg warhead – to other Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia, which have been engaged in negotiations for the weapon system for several years. One of the potential areas for use of the BrahMos by the Philippines is the South China Sea. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled that a specific portion of the South China Sea claimed by both China and the Philippines belonged to the Philippines alone. China rejected the ruling and has continued to send its vessels into the disputed waters. The Philippines military is currently implementing a revised modernisation programme and signed a contract for two corvettes with South Korea’s Hyundai Heavy Industries on December 28 last year. The Philippines also plans to sign contracts for 36 Black Hawk helicopters and six offshore patrol vessels in 2022. Former Indian Navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash said about the BrahMos deal in a tweet: “This is a long-delayed decision, which could alter the India-China strategic equation. By arming its Indo-Pacific friends, India not only helps bolster their security, but also gives China a dose of its own medicine! Vietnam & Indonesia, too, are waiting.” 
15-01-2022||India||HC calls for ban on rallies, strict adherence to Covid guidelines||The Karnataka High Court on Friday directed the state government to ensure that the guidelines and standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the state on January 4 are strictly adhered to in all the districts and added that no rallies, dharnas or any other political gathering to be permitted in the entire state, till the SOP is in operation.The development came as the high court took cognizance of the public interest litigations (PILs) seeking directions for the state government to restrain Mekedatu padayatra organised by Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) and not allow rallies and dharnas. A division bench of chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and justice Suraj Govindaraj gave the order while hearing the PIL filed by activist Nagendra Prasad AV. The Karnataka high court on Wednesday had pulled up the state government for allowing the Mekedatu padayatra by the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee and questioned whether it was “helpless” to stop the party from doing so amid a surge in Covid-19 cases. While the court sought an explanation from the state government on how it allowed such activity during the pandemic, it also asked the party to submit an explanation by January 14 whether they had taken any permission to hold the rally. Appearing for the Congress, senior advocate Uday Holla said that the party has suspended the padayatra taking into consideration the high court’s observations made during the last hearing. However, Holla claimed that the state government banned only KPCC’s padayatra in its latest order but other political parties were being allowed to hold the rallies. The additional advocate general (AAG) appearing for the state said that the general notification issued on January 4 had prohibited all the rallies, dharna and protests. The bench took note of the AAG’s submission that it had passed an order following the court’s orders on January 12. “All inter-district movement of vehicles to attend the padayatra are prohibited and all superintendent of police and divisional commissioners are directed to enforce the order strictly. The transport commissioner is directed to take adequate measures regarding the same. It is submitted that adequate measures have been taken by the state government to implement the government order,” said the bench. “In view of the government order prohibiting the padayatra, and the suspension of the said padayatra by respondent themselves we feel that the purpose for which the writ petition was filed no more exists. As such we do not find it necessary to keep the petition pending,” the bench stated while disposing of the petition. The court also told the government that it should strictly implement the Covid guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-calls-for-ban-on-rallies-strict-adherence-to-covid-guidelines-101642188010060.html
15-01-2022||India||UP elections: Denied ticket, Gulabi Gang founder quits Congress||Sampat Pal Devi, founder of Uttar Pradesh-based women’s organisation Gulabi Gang, on Friday quit the Congress after she was denied a ticket for the upcoming assembly elections. On Thursday, the party released its first list of candidates comprising 125 names, including 50 women, for the assembly polls. The party had promised to give 40% of its tickets to women. The mother of the Unnao rape victim and a block official who was assaulted during panchayat elections in Lakhimpur Kheri were among the many names on the list.Upset over not being given a ticket, Devi told HT over phone: “I am resigning from all posts of Congress as my candidature for Manikpur seat in Banda has not been considered. Women who secured lesser votes than me have been fielded from the same seat though I have worked harder over the years to strengthen the Congress. My Gulabi Gang members have supported the Congress not only in Uttar Pradesh but also in other states.” The gang is known for seeking justice against those accused of “committing atrocities against women”.Besides Devi, several other leaders also questioned the ticket distribution to women.Party leader Priyanka Maurya, whose picture has been used on the Congress’ ‘Ladki Hoon, Lad Sakti Hoon’ (I am a girl, I can fight) campaign posters, accused a party functionary of asking her to pay money for a ticket and even called the Congress “anti-women and anti-OBC.” Another party leader, Sheela Mishra, staged a dharna at the party headquarters after she was denied a ticket from an assembly seat in Lucknow.State party chief Ajay Kumar ‘Lallu’ was not reachable for comments.
15-01-2022||India||Increasing cases of home-grown drugs keeps state police on toes||On September 17, 2021, the central crime branch of the Bengaluru police had raided a drug manufacturing unit in Bengaluru and seized 4kg MDMA, a psychoactive drug. The gang used to hide ‘home manufactured drugs’ by storing them in a hidden compartment in custom-made shoes. They accused to sell these drugs across the city and in New Zealand as well.Days later, on September 26, 20211, in another major drug haul, police arrested two Iranian drug peddlers, who used to grow hydro cannabis inside a rented house, and seized drugs worth ₹1 crore from them. During the interrogation, the accused confessed that they brought the cannabis seeds via a darknet and were growing it in a villa near Bidadi on the outskirts of the Bengaluru city. The latest case in the series of home-grown drugs was reported on January 10, when a Nigerian national was arrested by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) for manufacturing and peddling synthetic drug MDMA from his rented accommodation at Tarabanahalli village on Hesaraghatta Road, North Bengaluru. The accused had learnt to make the synthetic drugs using the information available on the internet. “They had modified a pressure cooker using an iron pipe to manufacture the drugs. They used to buy raw materials like sodium hydroxide and acid from Mumbai,” said the officer. For Bengaluru police, who have been launching a crackdown on the drug trade in the city, these homemade drugs are posing a new challenge. Police officials, who had until recently changed their focus on catching the kingpins of the trade and targeting the source of the supply from outside the state, now have to keep a tab on drugs being manufactured within the city. A senior CCB official said that the recent arrests are only the tip of the icebergs. “Now, drug manufacturing has become an accessible trade. We have been witnessing this trend of accused taking rented houses on the city outskirts and cooking drugs. We have to focus on these activities more,” the officer added. He, however, added that Bengaluru police’s track record in the past two years in nabbing drugs peddlers has given the department enough confidence to deal with the new challenge as well. In 2021, the Bengaluru police arrested 5,644 drug peddlers in 4,275 cases and seized drugs worth around ₹59 crores. In comparison, 2,766 cases were registered with 3,673 arrests in 2020. The figure was at 768 cases and 1,260 arrests in 2019. According to official data, of the 4,475 cases registered in 2021, 4,275 cases were related to the seizure of marijuana, followed by 103 cases of MDMA, 39 cases of synthetic drugs and other narcotic substances ecstasy, hashish and LSD. Total 3,641.756kg drugs worth ₹592,775,690 were seized in 2021 against 3,912.826kg drugs worth ₹213,856,550 in 2020, and 1053.188kg drugs worth ₹34,686,700 in 2019. In 2021, 173 foreign nationals were arrested and 137 cases were registered, of which 105 accused were Nigerian nationals. In 2019, 38 foreign nationals were arrested and 33 cases were registered; and in 2020, 84 foreigners were arrested with 66 cases being registered against them. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), in 2020, Bengaluru had reported the highest number of cases related to narcotics in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/increasing-cases-of-home-grown-drugs-keeps-state-police-on-toes-101642187410074.html
15-01-2022||India||Mount Victoria Babax bird species spotted in India after 25 years||In a very rare find, two birders have come across and photographed a Mount Victoria Babax, a bird species not seen in India since 1997, in Mizoram on Wednesday. The bird was sighted at Phawngpui (Blue Mountain) National Park, one of the two national parks in Mizoram, close to Myanmar. Located in Lawngtlai district, the park is named after Phawngpui, the highest peak in Mizoram with an altitude of 2157 metres above sea level. Though the bird has been sighted in Myanmar, usually at or around Nat Ma Taung, (also known as Mount Victoria-after which the bird is named) the highest peak in Chin state of the country, it’s the first time it has been seen in India in 25 years. “It was known from only one specimen collected by Walter Norman Koelz, an American zoologist, in March 1953 at Phawngpui,” said Delhi-based birder Puja Sharma who along with Andrew Spencer, a digital media manager at Cornell Lab of Ornithology of Cornell University in US, saw and photographed it. In 1997, Dipankar Ghose (now with WWF India) saw and photographed the bird at Phawngpui, although his sighting went almost unnoticed. Back then, it was the Chinese Babax. The species was split in 2005. Both Sharma and Spencer are bird-sound recordists and had been hiking and birding in the area for the past four days, when they first heard the bird’s song at 6:30 am on Wednesday before seeing it. “We heard the bird singing first as we were getting ready to descend and trek back to the nearest village, Thaltlang at the periphery of the park and the road head for the trek to Phawngpui peak ,” said Sharma. “We managed to get closer to the source of the sound and were able to track the source of the sound to this gorgeous bird, singing from within an oak tree after which we got a visual confirmation and managed to photograph and videograph it for further documentation,” she addedMount Victoria Babax (Pterorhinus woodi) belongs to the laughingthrush family Leiothrichidae and is found in a limited geographical range in Mizoram and the Chin state of Myanmar. In an article published in November last year, Bird Count India, an informal partnership of organizations and individuals interested in bird distribution and populations, listed Mount Victoria Babax in 8th rank among 20 rare bird species seen in India. “This is quite significant . Though it is slightly widespread in Myanmar, in India it is limited to a very small area in Mizoram. This is the first photographic record of species in India and shows its continuous occurrence in the area,” said Anwaruddin Choudhury, retired bureaucrat, conservationist and an expert on birds of northeast India. The species was first described by Frank Finn, an English ornithologist, in 1902 from a specimen collected in Kanpetlet near Nat Ma Taung. It was considered a sub-species of the Chinese Babax till 2005 when two American ornithologists, Pamela Rasmussen and John Anderton, argued that it should be considered a separate species based on its plumage and song. A streaky brown babbler with a slightly down-curved dark bill and thick black moustache stripe, the Mount Victoria Babax is found in open forest, forest edges and tangles at elevations of 1200-2800 m. It can be recognized from persistent inflected bubbling whistles that goes-‘puh-pooo-yih’. “Confirmation on the presence of the bird species in the area shows the need to protect the area around Phawngpui National Park from development and other activities. It is only when the area is preserved well that the bird species can thrive,” said Sharma.

Natural forests show a decline of evergreen forests from 7.5% (1985) to 5.7% (by 2019), moist deciduous forests from 5.7% (1985) to 4.1% (by 2019), and dry deciduous forests from 4.0% (1985) to 2.2% (2019),” he said.A report released on Thursday by India State of Forests Report (ISFR) 2021 shows that Karnataka has lost 64sq km of moderately dense forest compared to its 2019 findings. Karnataka’s forest cover is 20.2% of the total geographical area which is lower than the national average of 21.7% and terribly short of the globally prescribed 33%, the report adds.As per the report on Mekedatu, there will be a submergence of 4,996 hectares of wildlife, forest and revenue land and its total requirement is 5,252.40 ha. This includes 3,181.90 ha of Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary and 1869.5 ha of reserve forest land which is home to elephant migratory routes, honey badgers, grizzled giant squirrels, Deccan Mahseer fish and the smooth-coated otters among hundreds of other exotic — and potentially endangered — species of animals.While the tourism department milks its rich biodiversity to attract more tourists, over- exploitation of these resources have added to the growing environmental challenges for the southern state.Meanwhile, experts believe that the actual situation is far more dire.“At a time when we should be augmenting our forest ecosystem, we are depleting and plundering it. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to protect and preserve biodiversity, but on the contrary, we are destroying it. Ideally, 33% of the Indian landscape should be reserved for forest. But we barely have 20%,” wildlife activist Joseph Hoover said.Karnataka has also refused to declare the Western Ghats as an eco-sensitive zone, prioritising economic interests over environmental concerns.The Mekedatu reservoir project, proposed to be constructed at a height of nearly 100ft, can store up to 65 tmcft of water but lead to loss of green cover and livelihood of thousands living in the region.Questioning the equitability of the project, noted rights activist Medha Patkar said, “The project’s equitability and sustainability needs to be proved before it gets a go ahead of any kind. That is not yet happening in case of Mekedatu,” Patkar said on Thursday in Bengaluru.Bengaluru receives around 1400 million litres per day (mld) of Cauvery water and of this nearly 40% is lost in leakages due to old and dilapidated pipelines, wastage by consumers among other reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-gains-overshadowing-mekedatu-s-ecological-impact-101642186932899.html
15-01-2022||India||‘Seek better relations with India, Kashmir at core of ties’: New Pak security policy||NEW DELHI: Pakistan desires to improve its relationship with India, though a “just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir” issue will remain the core of bilateral relations, according to Islamabad’s new National Security Policy released on Friday. Past governments had focused solely on military security and never planned beyond this, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said while addressing a ceremony at which he released the public version of the policy. “We’ve never had the concept of a coordinated national security policy,” he said. National security adviser Moeed Yusuf said the NSP was centred round economic security, and geo-strategic imperatives were included to bolster Pakistan’s security. He said the document was finalised with “full civil-military consensus”. The 62-page public version of the National Security Policy has separate sections on India and Jammu and Kashmir in the part dealing with Pakistan’s foreign relations. It also contains several other references to India in sections dealing with defence policy and the neighbourhood. “Pakistan, under its policy of peace at home and abroad, wishes to improve its relationship with India. A just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute remains at the core of our bilateral relationship,” the section on India said. “Growing Indian arms build-up, facilitated by access to advanced technologies and exceptions in the non-proliferation rules, is a matter of concern for Pakistan. Besides impacting regional stability, such policies of exceptionalism also undermine the global non-proliferation regime,” it added. The section on India expressed concern at what it said was the “rise of Hindutva-driven politics in India” and said this “impacts Pakistan’s immediate security”. The “political exploitation of a policy of belligerence towards Pakistan by India’s leadership has led to the threat of military adventurism”, it said. The section also accused India of pursuing “unilateral policy actions on outstanding issues...to impose one-sided solutions”. It added, “Pakistan continues to believe in resolving all outstanding issues through dialogue; however, recent Indian actions remain significant hurdles in this direction.” The section on Jammu and Kashmir said a “just and peaceful resolution” of this issue remains a vital national security interest for Pakistan. It reiterated Pakistan’s position that India’s decision to scrap the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019 was “illegal and unilateral”, and alleged that Indian security forces were behind human rights abuses and oppression in Kashmir. “Pakistan remains steadfast in its moral, diplomatic, political, and legal support to the people of Kashmir until they achieve their right to self-determination guaranteed by the international community as per United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions,” the section on Kashmir said. The document stated Pakistan will seek to deter war “through full-spectrum deterrence within the precincts of credible minimum nuclear deterrence in concert with our conventional military capabilities and all elements of national power”. “The expansion of India’s nuclear triad, open-ended statements on nuclear policy, and investments in and introduction of destabilising technologies disturb the strategic balance in the region,” it added. The document contended that special attention is required to manage “lingering border disputes which continue to pose security threats, particularly along the Line of Control and Working Boundary where ceasefire violations by India threaten civilian lives and property while endangering regional stability”. Referring to the Indian Ocean region and India’s role as a net security provider, the policy claimed this will “affect the region’s security and economic interests negatively”. India and Pakistan have not held any substantial and structured talks since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, carried out by the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), disrupted bilateral ties. Several attempts in the following years to revive talks ran aground after a series of terror attacks, mainly targeting Indian security forces, that were mostly blamed on the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). After a series of back-channel contacts between security officials of the two countries, the Indian and Pakistani armies agreed in February 2021 to restore the 2003 ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC). However, the ending of exchanges of fire on the LoC did not lead to further breakthroughs between the two sides. 
15-01-2022||India||Chikkaballapura recoded five mild earthquakes in less than a month||In a span of over one month Chikkaballapura – located around 65 km from state capital Bengaluru – has reported five mild earthquakes. The mines and geology department officials Thursday visited the Kamabalahalli and Bullsandra villages, a day after tremors were reported from the said areas. Government officials had to camp on site to assure the villagers of safety as five such incidents have been reported in the district so far. The tremors on Wednesday were the latest in a series of mild earthquakes. Chikkaballapura was hit by two 3.0 magnitude earthquakes on December 22. The first earthquake had a magnitude of 3.1 and occurred at 7.09 am. The second earthquake, at a magnitude of 3.4, hit the area five minutes later at 7.14 am. Another earthquake was reported at 2.16 pm on December 23 with a magnitude of 3.6 on the Richter scale. On January 5 an earthquake, measuring 2.7 on the Richter Scale, hit the district again. While no casualties or major damages have been reported, cracks were found on the walls of some houses. Following the frequency of the quakes, the state government directed the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) and the mines and geology department to look into the matter. KSNDMC director Manoj Rajan said, “All the incidents reported in the district were of mild scale and tremors were felt up to a radius of 20-30km from the epicentre. No one was injured during these incidents, however, slight shaking of the buildings have been reported.” “This falls under hard rock granitoid and gneissic terrain of seismic zone II. Scientists are studying Chikkaballapur and they have also recommended the National Geophysical Research Institute to carry out studies in the region,” he said. A senior officer of the KSNDMC, on the condition of anonymity said that the recent earthquakes were caused due to the heavy floods that the district experienced. “The district is drought prone and the rain in this region has been limited. But, last year the district witnessed heavy floods. When such unexpected amount of water comes to traditionally drought-prone areas, water enters fractured zones, which could be as deep as 10km, resulting in the movement of loose rock and eventually in these tremors,” the official explained. Voicing the same opinion, an official from the mines and geology department, who was overseeing the survey in the district, said due to heavy rains reported last year, defunct borewells and other water bodies were filled quickly. “The water entering crust of the earth, which is called hydro-seismicity, causes these incidents in the district,” said the official. Refuting the government claims, the local residents however alleged that rampant illegal mining in the district is the reason behind the numerous tremors in the district. Meanwhile, satellite images sourced from the National Remote Sensing Centre, the department of mines and geology (DMG) and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) had identified 532 illegal quarries in the Chikkaballapur district in 2019. The findings were mentioned in the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) report as well, in which DMG was asked to take action against these illegal quarries. According to the report, at least 11.12 crore metric tonnes of specified and unspecified minerals were illegally extracted, causing a loss of ₹223.25 crore to the state. A DMG official meanwhile said, “Around 450 licences have been issued for decorative stone quarries and 300 for stone quarries. But there are way more quarries. As per our estimate, there could be more than 2,000 illegal quarries across Karnataka.” Minister-in-charge of the district, Dr K Sudhakar, said even though the tremors are caused by the underground water, strict action will be taken against the miscreants involved in illegal mining and those violating rules . “We have had few incidents in the past where the tremors have been felt in some villages in the district. As per the experts, the sudden rain in recent times has resulted in these incidents… now those who are involved in mining should employ controlled blasting. I have told the police to take action against the people who are violating these norms and using such explosives which go against than the regulations,” said Sudhakar.

Fresh findings have also revealed that the 14-year-old girl had travelled from her village to the city on her own, they said. She was found bleeding and lying on a bridge near Tijara Fatak on Tuesday night. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had directed the police department to conduct a thorough investigation, following which a Special Investigation Team was constituted by the Alwar Superintendent of Police (SP). According to doctors, the girl’s rectum was displaced and she underwent a two-and-a-half-hour surgery.“Today (Friday), a team of experts have submitted a report to the police, in which they have said that injuries are not suggestive of any penetrative assault to the girl. So far, facts and technical information of medical experts suggest that there is no possibility of rape in the case,” Alwar SP Tejaswani Gautam told reporters.The SP said the police are yet to ascertain how the girl sustained such grievous injuries.Gautam told reporters that the girl travelled around 25 km from her village and reached Alwar city in an auto-rickshaw. She then walked towards the Tijara Fatak bridge “on her own”.“We have been able to track the girl’s movements and traced the auto-rickshaw in which she travelled with 8-10 other passengers. A team of forensic experts have not found anything suspicious in the auto-rickshaw. The driver was interrogated and her co-passengers will be questioned,” the SP said.CCTV footage collected from various locations showed her walking in many areas of the city and on the bridge, but no camera found her in a distressed condition on the bridge, police said. Official sources said that the chief minister was constantly monitoring the case. “Jaipur Inspector General of Police visited Alwar on Wednesday and issued necessary directions to the district police. Required forensic and technical assistance was provided,” a source said.Meanwhile, a child psychologist and experts also interacted with the girl. Police said they were preparing a questionnaire for the experts so they could seek answers from the girl.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/medical-report-suggests-girl-with-mental-illness-was-not-raped-rajasthan-police-101642186509980.html
15-01-2022||India||India’s desire for peace is born out of strength, should not mistaken otherwise: Army chief||New Delhi: The Indian Army stands firm to counter any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo along the country’s borders and India’s desire for peace is born out of strength and should not be mistaken otherwise, Army Chief General MM Naravane said on Friday.The army chief also said that differences in perceptions and disputes are best resolved through established norms based on the principle of equal and mutual security.The armies of India and China are locked in a military standoff in eastern Ladakh since May 5, 2020, after a violent clash erupted in the Pangong lake area.Both the countries have conducted 14 rounds of military-level talks to resolve the standoff.“We stand firm to counter any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo along our borders. Our response to such attempts has been swift, calibrated and decisive as was seen when the situation so demanded,” Naravane said in his speech on the eve of Army Day.Naravane said the Army has instituted additional safeguards to prevent any further attempts at military brinkmanship.”We believe that the differences in perceptions and disputes are best resolved through established norms based on the principle of equal and mutual security,” he mentioned.“Our desire for peace and tranquillity is born out of our inherent strength. It should not be mistaken otherwise,” he added.Institutional mechanisms and safeguards to counter state-sponsored terrorism have been strengthened both along the borders and the hinterland, Naravane mentioned.These mechanisms and safeguards have proven effective in lowering the levels of violence, he said.”Our actions have demonstrated our capability and willingness to strike at the source of terrorism,” the Army chief mentioned.In the year gone by, the Indian Army has resolutely executed its responsibilities and was steadfast in safeguarding the security and territorial integrity of the nation, he said.India’s active borders were guarded with resolve and resilience, he mentioned.“Our brave officers, JCOs (junior commissioned officers), and soldiers, have faced adversaries and adversity with courage and fortitude even to the extent to laying down their lives in the highest traditions of the Indian Army,” Naravane said.The Indian Army remains at a high state of operational readiness to face ongoing and future challenges, he said.After the violent clash on May 5, 2020, both -- Indian and Chinese militaries -- gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process last year in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake and in the Gogra area.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.

15-01-2022||India||Indian railways decides to redesignate post of ‘guard’ as ‘train manager’||The Indian Railways on Friday announced to re-designate the post of ‘guard’ as ‘train manager’. Senior officials in the railway ministry said the issue was being demanded for quite some time.“Indian Railways has decided to redesignate the post of “Guard” as “Train Manager” with immediate effect. The revised designation is more in consonance with their existing duties & responsibilities and will improve the motivation level of Guards now Train Manager,” the railways ministry tweeted on Friday.“The demand was that the existing designation train guard has become outdated. It was also said that in today’s society, common man thought that he/she may be a guard in some private firm,” said one of the officials cited above.“In this connection, it would not be out of context to mention that, in the general and subsidiary rules (GSR), a train guard is virtually a train in-charge of the respective train,” the official added.“It would be quite appropriate that the existing designation of train guard be changed to train manager, which would be a dignified designation for them without any financial implication, so that they can also lead a respectful life in the society,” said another senior railway official.Some experts, however, said this was one of the ways towards corporatisation. “A passenger is not going to be affected by this designation change in anyway. It is not difficult to understand that the railways is inching towards corporatisation,” said an industry expert, who did not wish to be named.According to the revised designation document, dated January 13, assistant guard will now be ‘assistant passenger train manager’, goods guard will be ‘goods train manager’, a senior passengers’ guard will be ‘senior passenger train manager’ and mail or express train guard will be mail/express train manager.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-railways-decides-to-redesignate-post-of-guard-as-train-manager-101642186091235.html

A bench of chief justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and justice Surjeet Narayan Prasad was holding a virtual hearing on the weekly investigation progress report when it expressed dissatisfaction over the central agency’s claim that the two accused reportedly admitted that they were trying to snatch the judge’s mobile phone when the incident took place.Judge Uttam Anand was on a morning jog when he was mowed down by the autorickshaw on July 28 last year, an incident which sparked off security concerns in the entire judiciary. The vehicle, which was stolen from Dhanbad, was recovered from neighbouring Giridih district that night. Auto driver Lakhan Verma, 22, and his accomplice Rahul Verma, 21, were arrested two days later. In October, the central probe agency filed its chargesheet against the duo under sections 302 (murder), 201 (destruction of evidence) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code.“Citing what was captured on the CCTV, the court observed that in no way it was established that there was any attempt to snatch the phone by the occupants of the auto rickshaw at the time of the incident. The court said it could be possible that the accused were trying to derail the murder investigation by making such claims,” a lawyer who attended the virtual hearing said, wishing not to be named.The court also sought to know from the probe agency the need to conduct the narco test and brain mapping of the accused twice. To this, the CBI said the two procedures were carried out twice to establish different sets of information that emerged during the course of the probe, they lawyer cited above said. Fixing January 21 as the next date of hearing, the court directed the probe agency to submit all test reports by then. The Supreme Court and the Jharkhand high court took suo motu cognisance of the hit-and-run incident after CCTV footage showed the three-wheeler swerving on an empty road to knock him down.The CBI took over the probe on July 31 after the top court said the incident had larger ramifications for the independence of the judiciary. The state government had also recommended an investigation by the central agency into the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-rejects-cbi-s-snatching-bid-theory-in-dhanbad-judge-s-death-case-101642186089825.html
15-01-2022||India||Centre brings all higher education institutions on ABC platform||The Centre has brought all recognised higher education institutions, irrespective of their accreditation or rankings, under the ambit of the Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) , enabling students to switch between institutions and multiple entries and exits to and from the programme.The ABC framework is part of National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and will allow higher education institutions to maintain a digital repository of credits earned by students; under ABC, students can choose to study one course in a year in one institution and switch to another one the next year. The framework also allows students to pursue courses online and earn credits. While mandatory under NEP 2020, institutions have the flexibility of adopting it at a time of their choice.The University Grants Commission (UGC) on July 28, 2021, notified ABC and issued the UGC (Establishment and Operation of Academic Bank of Credits in Higher Education) Regulations, 2021.On Wednesday, the commission wrote to all universities and colleges informing them about the amendment made in the regulations. “It was felt that the universities and autonomous colleges satisfying sub-regulation 2 of regulation 1 and the institutions of national importance as declared by the government of India and specifically empowered by an Act of Parliament to confer or grant degrees, irrespective of their NAAC or NIRF ranking should be able to participate and register in the academic bank of credits. In this regard, the amendments have been notified in the Gazette of India on 28 December, 2021.”The July 28, 2021, regulations, made it compulsory for higher education institutions that received ‘A’ grade from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) or fall in the top 100 National Institutions Ranking Framework (NIRF) rankings, to register for ABC.However, under the UGC (Establishment and Operation of Academic Bank of Credits in Higher Education) (First Amendment) Regulations, 2021, now any university or college, irrespective of ranking, can participate and register to come under the ABC framework. This will include both central and state universities, deemed-to-be universities and autonomous institutions.“All higher education institutions are once again requested to take appropriate steps for joining ABC Platform at the earliest. Further, you are requested to kindly make the students of your University/institution aware of the ABC facility and encourage theln for opening Academic Bank Account,” the UGC letter added.Officials at the UGC said that as many as 40 central universities have already decided to adopt ABC. “ ABC gives liberty to students to choose the pace of their studies, tailor their degrees, and enable multiple entry-multiple exit for students to complete their degrees as per their time preferences. It was important that all higher education institutions be allowed to opt for it,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.Abha Dev Habib, member of the Delhi University Teachers Association, said that ABC will reduce the role of universities and teachers. “It will damage students’ education and growth. Universities are known for their course curriculum and syllabi. No good university should allow deviation from their prescribed structure and syllabi. ABC Regulations are aimed at reducing grants to public universities by cutting costs on teacher hiring and pushing students to online education in the name of “choice”.”

Reacting to the statements made by Congress senior election observer for Goa P Chidambaram, who in an interview with a local TV channel said that the Congress was yet to receive a formal offer of an alliance, Moitra suggested that Chidambaram should get in touch with the Congress leadership. The AITC (All India Trinamool Congress) already made [a] formal & definitive offer to INC (Indian National Congress) on Goa to defeat [the] BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party ]. [The] INC leadership asked for time to revert. This was almost two weeks ago,” Moitra tweeted. In the interview, Chidambaram said that the Congress was open to receiving support from other parties wishing to defeat the BJP provided they recognise the Congress is best placed to lead any such anti-BJP alliance in Goa. The former union minister of finance and home however said that time was running out and admitted that there was “bitterness” between the Congress and the TMC over the latter poaching its leaders and now seeking an alliance. State Congress leaders have repeatedly denied that there are ongoing talks between the leaderships of the Congress and the TMC ahead of the upcoming elections. Goa goes to the polls on February 14 along with Punjab and Uttarakhand in a single phase while the election results will be declared on March 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sent-proposal-two-weeks-ago-mahua-moitra-on-possible-cong-tmc-alliance-for-goa-101642185672950.html
15-01-2022||India||2021 was fifth warmest year in India, impact of global warming: IMD||The year 2021 was the fifth warmest reported in India over the past 121 years, according to the annual climate statement 2021, released by India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday. The four warmest years are 2016, 2009, 2017 and 2010, the report said.According to the report, the annual mean air temperature was 0.44°C above normal in 2021 while in 2016 it was 0.71°C above normal; 0.55°C in 2009; 0.54°C in 2017, and 0.53°C in 2010.“This is certainly an impact of global warming. The fact that the most recent years after 2000 are recorded to be the warmest years is not just true for India, but globally also. That is why we are preparing better forecast strategies in view of global warming,” said M Mohapatra, director general of IMD.The global mean temperature in 2021 (January to September) was around 1.08°C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average and the year is likely to be between the fifth and seventh warmest year on record, according to the World Meteorological Organisation. 2021 is cooler than recent years owing to La Niña conditions.IMD scientists said a very warm winter and post-monsoon season in 2021 led to an increase in mean temperature last year. In winter (Jan and Feb) last year, the seasonal mean temperature was 0.78°C above normal and during the post monsoon season (October to December) mean temperature was 0.42°C above normal.During the 1901 to 2021 period, there was a 0.63°C rise in mean temperature for 100 years.Annual rainfall over the country last year was 105% of its long period average (LPA); rainfall during southwest monsoon season (June to September) was normal at 99% of LPA; but the northeast monsoon rainfall was 171% of LPA—record highest since 1901, the report stated.Heavy rainfall and flood-related incidents claimed over 750 lives last year while thunderstorms and lightning claimed more than 780 lives in different parts of the country, the report stated. Of the 750 deaths due to heavy rainfall events, 215 deaths were reported in Maharashtra, 143 in Uttarakhand, 55 in Himachal Pradesh, 53 in Kerala and 46 in Andhra Pradesh.Among 780 deaths due to thunderstorms, 213 were in Odisha, 156 in Madhya Pradesh, 89 in Bihar, 76 in Maharashtra, 58 in West Bengal, 54 in Jharkhand, 49 in Uttar Pradesh and 48 in Rajasthan.According to the report, Maharashtra was the most adversely affected state during 2021 -- the state reported more than 340 deaths, mainly due to extremely heavy rainfall, floods, landslide, lightning, cyclonic storms and cold-wave events.There were 5 cyclonic storms in 2021—Tauktae over Arabian Sea (May 14 to 19); Yaas over Bay of Bengal (May 23 to 28); Shaheen over Arabian Sea (September 29 to October 4); Gulab over Bay of Bengal (September 24 to 28) and Jawad over Bay of Bengal (December 2 to 6).The most devastating was Tauktae which crossed Saurashtra coast on May 17 claimed 144 lives due to its impact on the west coast.Many states reported extremely wet to severely wet conditions due to excess rainfall last year.The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is an index used for monitoring drought conditions based on precipitation. Negative values indicate dry conditions while positive values indicate wet conditions.SPI values of the past twelve months indicate extremely wet-severely wet conditions over parts of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Gangetic West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, East Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, Punjab, East Rajasthan, West Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat Region, Konkan & Goa, Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, North Interior Karnataka, south Karnataka and Kerala. Extremely dry-severely dry conditions were observed over parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & Tripura, Sub Himalayan West Bengal & Sikkim, East Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.Climate Vulnerability AtlasOn the occasion of IMD’s 147th foundation day, IMD launched four doppler weather radars — in Leh (highest altitude in India); Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi. The radar for Ayanagar in Delhi will cover an 100 km area and will provide information for the entire National Capital Region. It will provide improved rainfall monitoring; information for nowcasting and disaster mitigation, officials said.IMD also launched a Climate Hazards and Vulnerability Index Atlas of India on the occasion. The Atlas has mapped district wise climate hazards and climate vulnerability. The climate hazards are mapped for wind hazard, extreme rainfall, lightning, dust storm, hail storm, fog, drought, cyclone and thunderstorm.The data for heavy, very heavy and extremely heavy rain (over 64.5 mm/ day) during 2011 to 2020 was concentrated along the west coast districts the atlas showed including Satara, Ratnagiri, Uttara Kannada, Shimoga, Kozhikode etc. Lightning incidents (201 to 508 lightning days) were largely concentrated in Odisha, West Bengal and Maharashtra between 1969 to 2019. Highest number of heat wave days ( 400 to 1113) were concentrated in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan.“The atlas will have two uses. One, it will be a reference for impact-based warning that we issue for various regions. People can also see the atlas to understand what is the impact of certain extreme weather events in their region. Secondly, it can be used to plan climate-resilient infrastructure. For example, if construction is coming up in a coastal area, the atlas can give crucial information on what kind of disasters are probable,” added Mohapatra.M Ravichandran Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences said IMD plans to install at least 90 weather radars to be able to effectively forecast severe weather events. “Our aim is to populate the radars in the country so that no area are without the eye of radar. There are about 33 radars in IMD network and our objective is to at least have 90 radars to map the entire country. Though we are successful in providing accurate forecasts at various timescales, people always talk about where we have failed. It’s natural. We need to accept the criticism and try to rise to the occasion. We have improved our cyclone forecast significantly both intensity and track and last week’s winter rain was forecasted accurately but no one noticed it. At the same time, we failed some localised forecasts in Chennai, especially heavy rain but everyone noticed it. Our model resolution is about 12 km. Its difficult to forecast rainfall and weather with that resolution. We need to improve the model resolution with better input,” he said adding that “in the global warming scenario heavy and extremely heavy rainfall is going to increase and we need to augment resources to predict accurately. Awareness among people is very important, especially the complexity involved in forecasting weather.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2021-was-fifth-warmest-year-in-india-impact-of-global-warming-imd-101642185609896.html
15-01-2022||India||Govt seeks more data for full market clearance to Covishield, Covaxin||Approval for full market authorisation for both Covid-19 vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, could take longer, with the subject expert committee of the national drugs regulator seeking more data from the manufacturers in its meeting on Friday.Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech International Ltd, manufacturers of Covishield and Covaxin respectively, separately applied to the central drugs standard control organisation (CDSCO) to seek full market authorisation stating that more than a billion vaccine doses have been administered to beneficiaries under the national Covid-19 immunisation programme.“The volume of doses administered is large enough, no doubt, but there were some specific queries that the panel had, and has sought additional data in a particular format for that purpose. Like in case of emergency use authorisation, for complete market authorisation also, the review needs to be thorough,” said an official familiar with the development, on condition of anonymity.Full market authorisation is granted when there is enough data to demonstrate that the vaccine is safe and effective for most people who receive it.SII locally manufactures the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine under the brand name Covishield.On December 31, last year, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla announced through a tweet that it applied to India’s drugs regulator for full market authorisation to Covishield, citing adequate availability of the required data.“Supplies of the COVISHIELD vaccine in India, have exceeded 1.25 billion doses. The government of India now has enough data for full market authorisation, and therefore @SerumInstIndia has applied to the @CDSCO_INDIA_INF (DCGI) and @MoHFW_INDIA for this permission,” tweeted Poonawalla.According to people familiar with the development, Bharat Biotech also moved its application for complete market authorisation for Covaxin last week.Both the vaccines were granted approval for restricted use in emergency situation by the drugs controller general of India, VG Somani, on January 3, last year, and both the vaccines have been the mainstay of India’s covid immunisation programme.
15-01-2022||India||Budget session to start Jan 31 in backdrop of third Covid wave||Parliament will meet from January 31 to April 8 for its crucial and the longest annual session — the budget session — in the backdrop of the third surge of the Covid-19 infections.There will, however, be a long recess in between, from February 11 to March 14, according to a note from the Union parliamentary affairs ministry circulated on Friday. This recess period roughly coincides with elections in five states that will run in seven phases starting on February 10, with the results to be announced on March 10.The general budget will be presented on February 1 after the President’s address to the joint sitting of both Houses on the inaugural day. The Economic Survey will also be presented on January 31.Top officials of the two Houses have started exploring options, including a staggered timetable for the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha, and a highly dispersed seating arrangement for the MPs for the upcoming budget session. A final decision on the arrangements will be taken around January 25 or 26, when Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla meet over the issue, the officials said.But the length of the session, like the previous five since March 2020, will depend entirely on the Covid situation.India reported 270,460 cases and 399 deaths on Friday.“The priority will be to first clear the budget, the finance bill and the appropriation bills — the mandatory requirements under the Constitution. We can think about the other legislation if the time permits,” a senior government functionary said.The treasury benches will be looking to clear important legislation and the Opposition to discussing crucial issues after the 2021 winter session was heavily disrupted. Twelve Opposition members were suspended from the Rajya Sabha right at the start of the session over indiscipline in the monsoon session, leading to opposition parties stalling proceedings in protest. Disruptions were also triggered by the Opposition’s demands for a law on minimum support prices (MSPs) for certain crops in the backdrop of the repeal of three controversial farm bills.Lok Sabha, which had utilized 100% time in nearly all sessions, saw 82% productivity while the Rajya Sabha had 47% productivity in the winter session. “We definitely want this session to run. We have key issues to discuss,” said a senior Opposition leader who is a member of the Rajya Sabha.The Covid situation, however, may delay the review of some crucial bills as several parliamentary panels have been unable to meet for the last several weeks due to a surge in infections triggered by the Omicron variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus.“The panel on environment cancelled its meeting on January 10. It was scheduled to discuss the amendments to the wildlife act. “Some other committee meetings too were cancelled. But the joint committee on Biological diversity bill met once on January 4, the next meeting is scheduled on January 21,” said an official, citing instances of how the pandemic’s latest wave has slowed down the functioning of these panels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-session-to-start-jan-31-in-backdrop-of-third-covid-wave-101642183810023.html
15-01-2022||India||Around 1% active Covid cases in ICUs: India data||Just around 1% of those who have tested positive for Covid-19 across India are in intensive care units (ICUs) of government hospitals, with only around a tenth of them (those in ICUs) being on ventilators, people familiar with the matter in the health ministry said -- proportions that are in keeping with trends seen around the world in regions where infections are being driven by the Omicron variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus.“Around 1% are in intensive care units (ICUs), 0.12% on ventilators, and 1.55% , being treated on oxygen beds in several government health facilities,” said a senior health ministry official on condition of anonymity, quoting the current public hospitalisation data. The numbers do not include those being treated in private hospitals although most experts believe the proportions are likely to be roughly the same.The hospitalisation rate seen so far in the current Covid-19 wave has been between 5% and 10% of the active cases, according to the Union health ministry.“The hospitalisations have increased over the past few days even though the situation isn’t as bad as we saw last year driven by the Delta variant. However, even a small percentage for a country like India could result in significant overall increase because in absolute numbers it will be higher,” said Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant, department of internal medicine, Apollo Hospitals.Disaggregated data is hard to come by, but In Delhi, for instance, according to the daily update provided by the state government, on January 14, only 2.7% of the 92,223 active cases are currently in hospital, with a mere 0.73% in ICUs. Active cases were last at this level on May 2 last year, and at that time, nearly 22% of them were in hospital.According to the government data shared by Union health ministry on Friday morning, India’s active caseload currently stands at over a million (1,272,073). The last time the number was at this level was on June 9, 2021, when India’s active case load was 1,231,415.But hospitalisations have not risen. According to an HT tracker of 15 regions, almost 85.3% of hospital beds are currently vacant.The trends in India are consistent with what has been seen globally: the Omicron variant is significantly less likely to lead to severe disease due to a combination of intrinsic characteristics -- the virus is less able to replicate in the lungs -- and baseline immunity conferred by vaccination or a past infection.Public health experts are also of the view that Omicron may not be responsible for at least some of the hospitalisations. The Delta variant, they add, is still in circulation, even though Omicron is increasingly becoming the dominant variant.“Omicron numbers may be rising, but we must not forget that Delta is still present and hospitalisations could partly be a result of the Delta variant too. It is not possible to get every single positive sample genome sequenced as it is an advanced test that is expensive and time consuming,” said a senior epidemiologist with the central government, who is also a part of several key committees advising the government on Covid-19.And death numbers, while on the rise, may be on account of comorbidities, or largely among the unvaccinated (or partially vaccinated), or both.The analysis of 97 deaths between January 9 and 12 in Delhi showed that nearly three of every four fatalities was of a person who did not have any dose at all, and, from a smaller subset of 34 people whose comorbid conditions were known, all of the deceased patients had some other illness that is established to raise the risk of death.At the directions of the Centre, several hospitals have put on hold all elective procedures to be able to spare beds, ventilators and other essential supplies, and human resources needed to manage a surge in hospitalisation. Only emergency patients are being managed at the moment.On Monday, the health ministry wrote to states asking them to bolster health infrastructure and personnel keeping in mind the 5-10% hospitalisation rate among Covid-19 positive cases that the country is reporting currently.“The rise in coronavirus cases seemed to be driven by a combination of the Omicron and Delta variants of concern,” Union health secretary, Rajesh Bhushan, said in a letter to states. “The situation is dynamic and evolving, therefore, the need for hospitalisation may also change rapidly.”“Things are pretty much under control at the moment but it is an evolving situation, and we have to remain prepared for the worst,” said another official from the government requesting anonymity.
15-01-2022||India||Draft bill proposing council of town, country planners in works||The Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) is working on a draft bill to bring focus on urban planning by creating a National Council of Town and Country Planners that will set standards, benchmarks and code of ethics for professionals working in the field, according to senior government officials aware of the matter.The concept of the bill is being discussed within the ministry at the moment, a MoHUA official said, asking not to be named.“Urban planning is crucial for the development of sustainable cities. The concept of a draft bill is being discussed at the ministry level to bring focus on urban planners. Like there are councils for architects, doctors, lawyers, the concept of a council for urban planners is being considered,” the official said.“The NITI Aayog had also recommended a bill and formation of a national council for town and country planners,” he added.In September last year, the government’s federal think tank, NITI Aayog, came out with a report titled “Reforms in Urban Planning Capacity in India”, which highlighted the shortage of urban planners in the country and recommended the need for building capacity and a regulatory framework for urban planners.Dr K Rajeswara Rao, special secretary, NITI Aayog, said that the advisory committee, which prepared the report, observed that concerted actions are required to bring in more structure, professionalism, and identity to the urban planning profession.“This will be important to improve the quality as well as quantity of planning professionals in the long run. It recommended a National Council of Town and Country Planners to be constituted as a statutory body of the government of India. The purpose would be to set standards, benchmarks and code of ethics just like it is done by councils for lawyers, chartered accountants and so on,” Dr Rao said.The report said that 63% of the 7,933 towns and cities (urban settlements) in India don’t have a master plan, which is considered critical for managing urbanisation challenges. Dr Rao said that cities where large-scale investment is being done are facing major planning-related problems due to the shortage of urban planners in the country.“Nearly 65% cities don’t have a master plan, and in the rest of the cities that have a master or development plan in place, it is not enforced and implemented properly. This results in urban sprawl,” he said.The draft proposes to standardise the recruitment rules for staff in town and country planning departments, urban development authorities, and urban local bodies, said a second MoHUA official aware of the development.The federal Town and Country Planning Organisation, which comes under MoHUA and assists the ministry in formulating policies for urban development, said that states often don’t adhere to the Centre’s advisories to hire qualified urban planners.Sabyasachi Das, former planning commission in-charge at DDA, “There is so much focus urban development and redevelopment in cities now. There is a need to have a proper planning done for cities for which government institutions should recruit qualified urban planners. There are government department where the posts are lying vacant for years. The government should focus on filling up these posts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/draft-bill-proposing-council-of-town-country-planners-in-works-101642183509639.html
15-01-2022||India||‘A sudden jerk and all came tumbling down’: Survivors recall horror||It had been months since Rukia Khatun had visited her mother in Barpeta, Assam. The daily wage labourer who works in Jaipur, set off with her seven-year-old daughter Sahida in tow on the Guwahati-Bikaner Express on Wednesday.On Thursday, 12 coaches of the train derailed in Maynaguri region of West Bengal and Sahida went missing in the resulting pandemonium.Rukia’s search came to a tragic end on Friday when she was told Sahida’s body was traced to the Jalpaiguri Jalpaiguri super speciality hospital.Sahida was among the nine people killed in the accident. At least another 36 people were injured. According to the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR), there were 1,053 people onboard at the time of the accident.While the accident shattered Rukia’s family, some like Gautam Barman, a resident of West Bengal’s Cooch Behar district, escaped with minor injuries. “I was to get down at New Cooch Behar station and I was preparing for the same. If I had died, it would have shattered my family. I have elderly parents, wife and three children,” he said.Barman was standing near the toilet of the S6 coach preparing to deboard when the train first jerked violently. “When the first jerk came at 5 pm, passengers started falling over each other. I would have died or been seriously injured had I not gone near the bathroom,” he told reporters at Jalpaiguri district hospital.Rishab Mishra, was travelling in the same coach as Barman.“The train had crossed the Jalpaiguri Road station and running at full speed,” Mishra said.“Just half an hour later, I felt a sudden jerk and most of the passengers tumbled down from the upper berths. Moments later, came a second jerk and by that time all passengers were on the floor. Immediately after, came the third jerk and everything was finished,” Mishra said.Train driver Pradip Kumar had something similar to say. “All the signals including the home signal, starter and advanced were showing green. The train was given the go-ahead by the station master of the approaching station and we were moving ahead. But as we approached the advanced signal I felt a sudden jerk. It was a massive jerk and the engine started swaying,” said Kumar.He applied the emergency brakes and the train came to a grinding halt. As he looked out of the window, he said he saw a cloud of dust. “I immediately climbed down and went to the rear end [of the train]. I didn’t have to go too far. The compartments were lying derailed and crumpled on top of one another like matchboxes,” he recalled.Siddharth had boarded the train at New Jalpaiguri. “All coaches after the one in which I was derailed around 5 pm... saw many dying in front of my eyes,” he said. He boarded a special train arranged by the railways and reached Guwahati on Friday morning.Krishna Das, a resident of Uttar Maumamari under Maynaguri police station, was out buying vegetables when he heard a big bang. “I saw train coaches derailing and coach S5 riding on S6. I rushed to the accident site and rescued four people. One of them died while I was still holding him,” he recalled.
15-01-2022||India||Toll at 9, Vaishnaw hints at mechanical failure as cause||The toll in the Bikaner-Guwahati Express train accident in West Bengal’s Jalpaiguri rose to nine on Friday, with Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw saying that a mechanical failure in the locomotive appeared to have caused the accident.“Preliminary probe suggested that the issue was with the locomotive’s equipment and not with speed restrictions or tracks. There will be marks on the equipment. Only after dismantling it and studying those marks, the actual reason behind the accident can be ascertained,” Vaishnaw, who inspected the accident site, told reporters. “The root cause (behind the accident) will soon come out. An inquiry into the unfortunate incident is underway. We pray for the departed souls and wish for a speedy recovery of the injured. Talks are on with the families regarding the distribution of ex-gratia,” he added. Five people were killed and at least 36 were injured after 12 coaches of the Guwahati-Bikaner Express derailed on Thursday evening. Four more bodies were recovered hours later. While 23 passengers were undergoing treatment at a super specialty hospital in Jalpaiguri, six were admitted at the North Bengal Medical College and seven at Maynaguri Rural Hospital, a spokesperson of the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) said.The condition of at least 10 passengers is said to be critical.“The fault could have been anywhere, from the train’s traction motor to the tracks. It will be ascertained only after a proper enquiry. An enquiry by the commissioner of railway safety is underway,” a senior railway official said, seeking anonymity. The train was bound for Guwahati and the accident took place in Maynaguri region around 5 pm, the NFR had earlier said in a statement, adding that 1,053 passengers were on board at the time.Recounting the incident, Pradip Kumar, the driver, said: “All the signals including the home signal, starter and advanced were showing green. The train was given a go ahead by the station master of the approaching station and we were moving ahead. But as we approached the advanced signal, I felt a sudden jerk. It was a massive jerk and the engine started swaying.” Besides Vaishnaw, Rajasthan power minister Bhanwar Singh Bhati and disaster management and relief minister Govind Ram Meghwal arrived in north Bengal and visited some of the injured passengers in Siliguri.Senior railway officials said while rescue operations were completed by the early hours of Friday, the restoration work by removing the derailed compartments and repairing the tracks were underway. As many as 10 trains, mostly intercity and DEMU (local) trains were cancelled along the affected route on Friday while a couple of others were short terminated or short originated. The routes of 10 other long-distance trains were diverted, the railways said. “Special trains and buses were arranged so that the remaining passengers could reach their destinations,” Moumita Godara Basu, Jalpaiguri district magistrate said. Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha MP and Bharatiya Janata Party leader demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toll-in-bengal-train-tragedy-reaches-9-vaishnaw-hints-at-mechanical-failure-as-cause-101642183210948.html
15-01-2022||India||Play, Pay, News: Why Google’s services are on CCI radar||Google is very much in the regulatory crosshairs, in India. The Competition Commission of India (CCI), the antitrust regulator’s recent order for a probe into the Google News platform practices, is the fifth such investigation opened into the tech behemoth’s practices in the country.Under scrutiny are products, services and policies, such as how the company allows purchases on its Play Store, its efforts to promote Google Pay, its licensing deals for Android TV and the perceived dominance of Android, which is seen to have restricted competition as well as choice for users. CCI has already fined Google ₹135.86 crore in 2018 for bias in Search results, a space where the tech giant is the leader globally.The news problemThe latest investigation is on how Google runs News, an aggregation service deeply embedded within Google Discover and Google Search platforms on phones and PCs.The Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA), which includes the digital arms of India’s biggest media houses (including Hindustan Times), has raised concerns regarding the opaqueness of the algorithms that determine which news website gets more visitors (that result in clicks) from search results and has questioned unilateral decisions on revenue sharing with publishers, whose snippets are often used in News and Search to enrich results.“As DNPA, we are very grateful to CCI that they have taken up the matter and we are confident that the justice will be served,” Sujata Gupta, secretary general, DNPA said. Google India did not respond to requests for comment.The probe order clarifies that Google is potentially violating provisions of Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002. “The allegations of the Informant, when seen in this vertically integrated ecosystem operated by Google, makes it prima facie appear that news publishers have no choice but to accept the terms and conditions imposed by Google,” said the CCI in the order. In a way, Google is the gateway between publishers and readers.Google News globally rivals aggregator platforms, such as Microsoft Start (this replaces Microsoft News) and Apple News. But neither has the advantage of being integrated in a platform as large as Google Search, though Microsoft is changing that with the optional taskbar integration for the news feed app in Windows 11.“A reading of CCI’s prima facie order against Google and Alphabet Inc. shows that there is adequate incriminating information and evidence demonstrating Google’s monopoly and abuse of dominance in the relevant market, that is online web search services and online search advertising services,” said Abhishek Malhotra, managing partner at TMT Law Practice.Revenue loss is a concern for news publishers. “The Informant alleges that Google is the major stakeholder in the digital advertising space, and it unilaterally decides the amount to be paid to the publishers for the content created by them,” the probe order notes.“Intervention through competition law or regulation is the right way to bring fairness and ensure viability of the news industry which is the fifth pillar of democracy,” said Vikas Kathuria, associate professor, School of Law and head, Centre on Law, Regulation & Technology, BML Munjal University.In many countries, Google has been under the scanner for how it negotiates with news publishers. The company was fined $592 million in France in July 2021 for breaches in negotiating payment terms with publishers for reusing content.Google has since made some proposals to the French authorities, such as “negotiate in good faith” with publishers and no impact on ranking for protected content, and five-year revenue agreements.In 2020, the Australian government first mooted the News Media Bargaining Code to ensure platforms such as Google and Facebook have content deals with news publishers. In 2021, ahead of a law being passed by Australia, Google scrambled to sign deals with major publishers.“It will ensure that news media businesses are fairly remunerated for the content they generate. Freedom of Media is a mandate as per Article 19 of the Indian Constitution. Bringing Google within the framework of Indian Law will ensure the Right of Life of crores of developers and users in India,” said Virag Gupta, a lawyer and Cyber Law expert.Google Play’s restrictionsThe tech giant is also being investigated for Play Store policies. The new Google Play billing system, which developers must mandatorily integrate in all apps and games they publish on the Play Store for Android, will be the sole route for in-app purchases. Be it one-time purchases or subscriptions. Google takes a cut from each transaction.“By forcing their choice of payment system on app owners and by denying the app owners their choice of payment provider, Google is indulging in anti-competitive behaviour by abusing their market,” said Sijo Kuruvilla George, executive director of Alliance of Digital India Foundation (ADIF).There are serious numbers at play here. Android has around 95.24% market share in India, according to latest numbers by research firm StatCounter. Apple’s iOS for iPhone follows as a distant second, with 3.76% share. Google Play Store is the official platform for downloading apps and games on Android devices. The Play billing system gives advantage to Google Pay, the company’s own digital payments platform.Google has insisted that a very small number of developers will be impacted by the changes. “Irrespective of how many app owners it affects, this practice is in violation of competition laws,” added George.Last year, Google slashed commission fee from 30% to 15%, for some transactions, such as subscriptions.In Korea, Google is now providing alternative payment systems for Play Store developers to choose from. A new law banned app platforms from monopolising payment methods, which has forced tech giants including Google, to widen the options available to developers. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) has already imposed a fine of $176.64 million on Google in September for antitrust practices.Advantage Google Pay?CCI has been scanning Google’s policies for perceived privilege given to payment app Google Pay, including being preloaded on Android phones being sold in India. Google Pay was earlier called Google Tez. The contention is that Google Pay’s rivals, which include PhonePe, Paytm, Amazon Pay and WhatsApp Pay, do not have the same privilege.The market is massive. Some of the most popular phones in India run Android.“A similar case in Europe was that of Internet explorer being preloaded on Microsoft Windows computers, thereby affecting the market of other browsers. Microsoft was forced to give an option to users to select the browser. Bundling of Google Pay on Android phones could be a similar case affecting competitors in the space,” says Prasanth Sugathan, legal director, Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC.in).George said the amount of user data Google already holds, when topped up with financial data of users, could serve to extend its dominance and monopoly.Android monopoly, a global problemSmartphone operating system Android is also under the scanner, for highlighting Google’s own apps. In a not-so-surprising twist, CCI said in September 2021 that it found Google guilty of anti-competitive behaviour and restrictive trade practices around Android and the phone market.Google Pay isn’t the only app that gets prime preloading privilege on Android phones. Ten apps, including Gmail, Chrome, Maps, Photos and Search, must be mandatorily preloaded on Android phones if the phone maker wishes to integrate Google Mobile Services (GMS) in the Android they use.If they don’t, they can only get access to a barebones Android version – that isn’t really an option in the highly competitive Android phone market.This specifically isn’t an India problem.The UK Government’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) released a report in December, which says that Apple and Google have too much control over operating systems (iOS and Android), app stores (App Store and Play Store), and web browsers (Safari and Chrome) that together form their ‘ecosystems’. There is a concern that when people buy a phone running either platform, they are largely controlled by this ecosystem.Google is still fighting a €4.34 billion ($5 billion) fine imposed by the European Union in 2018 after being found guilty of similar anti-competitive behaviour with Android.Bias in SearchCCI imposed a penalty of ₹135.85 crore on Google in 2018, after it was found guilty of bias in search results. The findings indicate Google’s search results were tailored to favour the company’s own services and partners while also deploying advertising services to disadvantage some advertisers over others.“Existence of monopolies in the tech space is a reality and we have seen actions being taken by various regulators in Europe and the US against Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon,” says Sugathan.This isn’t the first time Google has been fined. “In three antitrust cases, $9.7 billion fine has been imposed on Google by the European Commission. In the US, many states have filed a lawsuit against Google over alleged anti-competitive practices to boost its online advertising business by illegally working with social network Facebook,” Virag Gupta points out.TV agreements under lensGoogle’s agreements with smart TV manufacturers are also being investigated. In this case as well, there is the issue of Google requiring TV manufacturers to sign the Television App Distribution Agreement (TADA), and an Android Compatibility Commitment (ACC), which mandate that an entire suite of Google apps must be preloaded on TVs, including YouTube, Google Play Movies and Play Store.What to expect?It may be a while before any fines are imposed on the Android anti-trust verdict, and for the investigations in progress to be completed. There is expectation that the investigation on Play Store billing policies, will be completed within 60 days. That, and the Google News policies probe, are the two big ones.“There is a high likelihood that in both the cases, Google may be held liable for abuse of dominant position, given the extensive incriminating evidence available. Once held liable, the quantum of penalty will be imposed on the basis of Google’s turnover as per applicable provisions of the Act,” said Malhotra.CCI will be setting a marker with the verdict on Google’s Play Store practices. The antitrust regulator has already opened investigations against Apple’s App Store policies, including in-app transaction commission, not allowing competing application stores on iPhones, and approval policies for app submissions.
15-01-2022||India||16-yr-old girl found on Alwar bridge wasn’t raped or abducted: Police||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan police on Friday said that the minor girl with mental illness, who was found in a critical condition on an overbridge in Alwar on Tuesday night, was not raped or abducted but reached the Tijara Bridge on her own. The 16-year-old girl was admitted to a local hospital in critical condition and the same night, taken to a hospital in Jaipur for treatment. The girl later underwent surgery and her condition is stable now.Superintendent of Police, Alwar, Tejaswani Gautam said, “The panel of doctors submitted a report to the police in which they have said that injuries are not suggestive of any penetrative assault... So far, facts and technical information of medical experts suggest that there is no possibility of rape in the case.” Gautam also said the police have traced the route taken by the girl from her village to the city. “We found that the driver and the auto she travelled in along with 8-10 other passengers. The forensic science team searched the auto and found nothing suspicious. We have also questioned the driver. Now the passengers in the auto will be questioned. The girl travelled around 25 km from village and reached Alwar City in the auto. From there, she walked towards the bridge,” she said.The medical report of the girl has not come yet and several police teams are investigating the case, she said.Police said that after scanning footage of over 250 CCTV cameras it was found that the girl visited many areas of the city and in one video, was seen sitting on the footpath. “In one of the videos, she is seen walking towards the bridge but there is no camera on the bridge where she was found in distressed condition,” she said.Police said apart from the CCTV footage and from the statement of the auto driver and other people of the area, they have not found anything suspicious. “Now the investigation is happening to find what happened around the bridge,” another police officer said.Child psychologist and experts in dealing with specially-abled persons also interacted with the minor to get any information related to what happened with her. But she didn’t respond as she was in pain. The police are now preparing a questionnaire which will be asked through the experts.The Rajasthan State Human Rights Commission has already taken suo-moto cognizance of the case and sought reports from the Alwar district administration and Jaipur’s JK Lone Hospital for a report. The Alwar superintendent of police has been told to submit a factual report by January 18 and arrest the culprits involved in the crime.
15-01-2022||India||Normal train operations resume at West Bengal train accident site after two days||Train movement has regained normalcy at the site in West Bengal's Alipurduar district where the Bikaner-Guwahati Express derailed two days before, Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) chief public relations officer Guneet Kaur said on Saturday.She added that train operations resumed at 12am on Saturday after the track was certified for movement at 20kmph.

15-01-2022||India||Villagers clash with police at steel plant site in Odisha’s Jagatsinghpur||Bhubaneswar: Around two dozen villagers including women and teenagers protesting the proposed steel plant by JSW Steel at Dhinkia village of Jagatsinghpur district were injured after police resorted to lathi charge to disperse them.Police said Debendra Swain, a former member of the panchayat samiti spearheading the protest against the project, was arrested along with two others as he led a group of armed miscreants to attack the police and government officials.Jagatsinghpur SP Akhileswar Singh said police had to act as the villagers started throwing urine on them and some even attacked the police with razors. “We had to do mild lathi charge to disperse the villagers. At least 7 policemen have been injured in the scuffle,” said Singh.#WATCH | Jagatsinghpur, Odisha | Police baton-charged people in the Dhinkia village who were allegedly protesting over the proposed steel plant site in the district, today pic.twitter.com/fPQGBRMgDmAs many as 15 platoons (450 personnel) of police were deployed in Dhinkia area in view of the prevailing situation, news agency PTI said, quoting a local official said.Prashant Paikray, spokesperson of the Jindal Pratirodh Bheetamati Suraksha Samiti, the organisation protesting the steel plant in the area, alleged police personnel assaulted people when they tried to stop the cops from entering the village to demolish the betel vine plantations.Erasama Tehsildar PN Das, said the villagers had given consent to acquire their betel vines following which the administration demolished them.There is no illegality, he claimed, according to PTI.“When the villagers tried to stop the police from entering Dhinkia, police charged them with batons sparing none, not even women and children. Many villagers have received serious injuries,” said Paikray.The villagers alleged that the demolition drive was arbitrary and designed to expedite land acquisition for the JSW project. “I joined the protest against the demolition drive of our betel vine. But police beat us up mercilessly,” alleged an old woman.In 2017, JSW Utkal Steel Limited, led by industrialist Sajjan Jindal, proposed to set up a 13.2 million tonnes per annum integrated steel plant at the same site that was initially allocated to Korean steel major Posco more than a decade ago. The Korean company, which signed a pact with Odisha government, dropped out in 2017.The new steel plant by JSW in Jagatsighpur is expected to be connected with the company’s proposed 30 MTPA iron-ore grinding plant in Keonjhar district via a 312 km-long slurry pipeline.A 52 MTPA captive jetty located near the mouth of Jatadhar river will also cater to the import and export requirements of the company. But ever since the company signed up for setting the steel plant, it is facing similar protests in Dhinkia who say they did not want the project.Earlier on December 20 last year, tension prevailed in the village following a violent face-off between the villagers and the police. The villagers opposed the administration’s move to demarcate the boundary of the village which forms part of the project site of JSW. Since January 1, an uneasy calm prevailed in the area as the people of Dhinkia installed bamboo gates at the entrance of the village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/villagers-clash-with-police-at-steel-plant-site-in-odisha-s-jagatsinghpur-101642218972260.html

The question, which is animating all those who inhabit the universe of Indian politics is important — for the outcome will determine the fate of over 200 million citizens, affect inter-caste and inter-religious ties in the heartland, illustrate whether the political theatre remains governed by the hegemony of a single party or is opening up, and shape national politics in the run-up to the 2024 general elections. And, in this particular case, the result will also affect leadership dynamics within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the future.

The government believes that with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) back at pre-pandemic levels, it’s poised for accelerated growth. The International Monetary Fund possibly, agrees. It forecasts 8.5% growth in 2022, around 3 percentage points more than China. But the government’s former chief economic adviser has voiced strong dissent. Let’s carefully consider his arguments.

Earlier this week, I read about a letter that the Union home minister, Amit Shah, has written to chief justices, chief ministers and Members of Parliament involved in creating what he called a “people centric legal structure”. As part of that structure, Shah said the government is committed to ensuring speedy justice to all citizens. This is vital: 70% of the Indian prison population is on trial or waiting to be tried. To make matters worse, many die in Indian prisons either due to inadequate food, or lack of medical treatment, or both.
