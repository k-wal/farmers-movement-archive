In the first and second phases of the construction work, temple’s foundation and raft were laid. Champat Rai, general secretary of Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust, gave this information. After the completion of plinth work, construction of the temple’s main structure would start, he added. Each plinth will be six-and-a-half-metre high. Around 17000 plinths will be laid in the third phase of construction work. On the occasion, several members of the Trust, including Mahant Dhinendra Das, Dr Anil Mishra and Vimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra were present. Plinth or the granite stone is the lowest part of a building and it works as a base for any structure. It is in the form of a rectangular block or slab. In the foundation work, 47 layers of roller compacted cement (RCC) of one feet width have been laid. The foundation work began from 14-metre below the surface at the sanctum sanctorum of the temple in April 2021. The foundation is 107 feet above sea level and “gitti” (crushed stone) of Banda, coarse sand, fly ash and asbestos have been used.A raft is used when the soil is weak. It helps distribute the weight of the building over entire area of the building. This also helps reduce stress on the soil. Larsen and Toubro is carrying out construction work of the Ram temple. The Tata Consulting Engineers is working as project management consultant and is assisting the Larsen and Toubro in the construction work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/third-phase-of-ram-temple-construction-starts-in-ayodhya-101643048890866.html

24-01-2022||Pune||Educationists oppose amendment in Maharashtra Public Universities Act||Pune: A special discuss programme was organised at Vidyapeeth Vikas Manch on Monday to oppose the state government’s decision amend the ‘Maharashtra Public Universities Act’ and introduce a new post of ‘pro-chancellor’ which will be the state’s higher and technical education minister. Former vice-chancellors, SPPU senate members and senior educationists who attended the meet decided to challenge the decision in court. “There is no need to create such a post and allow rights to be reserved with the state government. Vice-chancellors are the authority for academic and administrative decisions in the university and the amendment if comes into force will make them toothless,” said Prof RS Mali, former vice-chancellor of the then Pune university (Savitribai Phule Pune University). As per the amendment, the pro-chancellor would be having various powers like chairing the university senate meeting — high-level body that takes policy decision — and to preside over the university’s convocation ceremony in the absence of chancellor who is the governor of the state. The state government has also altered the selection process of vice-chancellor in the state. The state government will shortlist five nominees by a selection panel and two of them will be sent to governor for final consideration. Prof Vidyasagar Pandit, former vice-chancellor of Nanded University, said, “Affordable quality education is needed for students coming from rural and below poverty line backgrounds. If the autonomy powers of the universities are reduced then quality of education will also suffer. And more political interference will increase in university functioning.” Prof Murlidhar Chandekar, vice-chancellor of Sant Gadge Baba Amravati University, said, “Creating a new post above the vice-chancellors and giving it powers in policy making decisions is unacceptable. Moreover, why it is that only the state higher education minister will only by on that post. Academic agenda should not change into political agenda while running state universities and we should oppose it together.” Educationists, senate members and owners of institutes present agreed to move the court, if need be, to oppose the state government’s plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/educationists-oppose-amendment-in-maharashtra-public-universities-act-101643048650905.html
24-01-2022||Lucknow||2014 hate speech case: Swami Prasad Maurya fails to appear before MP-MLA court||Former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) minister Swami Prasad Maurya, who is now a Samajwadi Party leader, failed to appear before the MP-MLA court in Sultanpur district on Monday in connection with a 2014 hate speech case. Maurya had to appear before the court of Yogesh Yadav, special judge, MP-MLA court, Sultanpur. The court fixed February 4 as the next date of hearing in the case. However, court did not pass any order against Maurya due to the Covid-19 pandemic. On January 12 earlier this month, the Sultanpur court had issued an arrest warrant against Maurya who had quit the Uttar Pradesh cabinet on January 11. The case relates to a speech made by Maurya in Lucknow on September 21, 2014, wherein he allegedly made objectionable remarks against Hindu gods. Back then, he was with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and was the leader of opposition in the state assembly. Maurya had given the statement at a gathering at the Karpuri Thakur Bhagidari Sammelan. “Goddesses Gauri or Lord Ganesha should not be worshipped during weddings. It is a conspiracy by the upper caste dominated caste system to mislead Dalits,” Maurya, an influential OBC leader, had allegedly said. Hearing a petition filed by advocate Anil Tewari, the court of additional chief judicial magistrate (Sultanpur) on November 20, 2014, had held the then BSP leader prima facie responsible for hurting religious sentiments.On December 1, 2015, an arrest warrant was issued against Maurya and the court had fixed January 16, 2016 as the next date of hearing. However, Maurya got a stay order from the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court against the arrest warrant. Hearing of the case is still going on in the MP-MLA court in Sultanpur district.

His father Maulana Masood Madani was a former minister in the Uttarakhand government, his uncle Maulana Mahmood Madani is president of Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind and his grandfather Arshad Madani is principal of Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Deoband,” said Shaukat Ali, president, AIMIM UP unit. The Samajwadi Party announced to field Kartikey Rana from Deoband while the Bahujan Samaj Party fielded Chaudhary Rajendra Singh. The Bharatiya Janata Party fielded sitting MLA, Brijesh Singh Rawat from the seat. In the 2017 polls, Rawat had defeated BSP candidate Majid Ali by a margin of 29,400 votes. The Muslim vote is decisive in deciding the fate of candidates in Saharanpur and adjoining districts. The SP, BSP and AIMIM are vying for Muslim votes to ensure victory of their candidates in the Muslim majority - Rohilkhand region. “The entry of the Madani family member in the assembly fray has made the contest interesting in the western UP region,” said Asif Khan a political observer.

Of these 151 deaths, 102 patients were unvaccinated whereas 49 had received either one dose or both. According to the Co-WIN dashboard, 7,022,464 beneficiaries have received both the vaccination doses in Pune district till Monday. And 100,921 precaution doses have been administered in the district so far. City-based doctors and experts noted that the trend is obvious and it emphasises that vaccination is important for protection against Covid. Dr Kapil Zirpe, member, Pune Covid-19 task force and head of the neurotrauma unit at Ruby Hall Clinic, said that due to vaccination, there has not been any admission in our hospital so far that requires oxygen. “Basically, it is evident that due to vaccination, patients can avoid moderate to severe Covid disease. In private hospitals, we have seen patients coming to us with double vaccines and even booster doses. But the symptoms are mild or the patient is completely asymptomatic. We have hardly seen any admission for Omicron cases. But we are managing comorbidities of the patients,” said Dr Zirpe. He said there are two purposes of the vaccine. “First is to avoid infection and second is to guarantee that the disease progression will not happen. This is exactly what we are seeing in our patients,” said Dr Zirpe. As of Monday, there 2,529 hospital isolation in Pune district against 91,113 home isolations, according to the data furnished by the district health department. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) Hospital Board of India, said Covid patients are reporting fever, sore throat, long lasting cough, dysphagia, fever and fatigue sometimes, but admission is not needed. “There is only 3.8 per cent hospitalisation and oxygen level needed is very low. However, associated ailments are needed to be diagnosed like dengue, swine flu like symptoms. It is true that unvaccinated people have around 70 to 75 per cent chances of complications. So, completing the vaccination schedule is important,” said Dr Patil.

Her husband Ashish is an MLC in Uttar Pradesh. On Sunday, Apna Dal (Sonelal) had fielded Haider Ali Khan, 32, from Swar Tanda seat of Rampur district from where the Samajwadi Party has now announced the candidature of SP veteran Azam Khan’s son Abdullah Azam.Patel, who was in Lucknow on a short visit, said her party would soon declare candidates on remaining seats. “These things do take time as the composition of each seat is different and there is a different political aspect in each seat,’ she added. In 2017 UP polls, the Apna Dal, in alliance with the BJP, had won 9 seats, two more than the Congress. “Together we will win more than 300 seats in UP,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/no-issues-with-bjp-will-jointly-win-over-300-seats-anupriya-patel-101643048230814.html
24-01-2022||Lucknow||UP IAS Association silent on Centre’s move to amend deputation rules||The Uttar Pradesh Indian Administrative Service Association (UP IAS Association) has maintained a studied silence on the Centre’s move to amend the service rules with regard to the deputation of officers of the IAS cadre and other all India services, including those working with the Indian Police Service.The UP IAS Association’s silence now is in contrast to the organisation, in the past, having been vocal on issues concerning the IAS cadre.The silence of UP IAS Association on the issue of the proposed amendment to Rule 6 providing for deputation of the IAS officers to the Centre may be an outcome of state government’s apparent support to the move. “The Uttar Pradesh IAS Association has not taken up the issue of proposed amendment to the IAS cadre rules. The state government is also favouring the move,” said a senior IAS officer.Amid the UP IAS Association’s silence, IAS officers (both serving and retired) are voicing their concern on the issue though opinions are divided.“The Union government will be able to take away key officers of the opposition ruled states at any point of time if the centre is given a free hand. A middle path should instead be followed by making consent of the officer concerned mandatory for going on deputation to the Centre. As principal secretary/additional chief secretary to chief minister and chief secretary of the state usually do not apply for deputation to the Centre, the Union government will not be able to remove them without the consent of the officers. Many states are not sending appropriate number of IAS officers to the Centre and are not giving good postings to them in the state too. This should be taken into account,” said a senior IAS officer of the UP cadre.“The Centre’s new found love for All India Services is baffling. Not very long ago they were being ridiculed and called names in Parliament. The positions hitherto being occupied by the IAS were being handed over to others. No wonder the states smell a rat in the amendment to the rules,” said Anil Swaroop in a post on Twitter on Monday.“There is no reason for the Centre to go for this amendment. A provision is already in the service rules that provide for the Centre’s opinion to prevail in case of difference between the Centre and the states. There is no need for the Centre to indulge in a game of political one-upmanship on the issue,” said VS Pandey, former secretary to the Union government.Former UP chief secretary Alok Ranjan said, “Willingness of an officer to go on deputation should be considered before taking a call on the issue. The states on their part should also ensure that appropriate number of officers go on deputation to the Centre. This is not happening now in many states. The deputation should be in consultation between the state government and the centre and not by force,” he said.A senior officer, on the other hand, said the Union government should have authority to call its officers as All India service officers are appointed by the Centre.The chief ministers of West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan have strongly opposed the move and voiced their concern in separate letters sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him not to go for the amendment.It remains to be seen whether the Centre will take various opinions into account before going for amendment to rule 6 that reads: “Deputation of cadre officers- 6(1) A cadre officer may, with the concurrence of the state governments concerned and the Central Government be deputed for service under the Central Government, be deputed for service under the Central Government or another State Government or under a company, association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, which is wholly or substantially owned or controlled by the Central Government or by another State Government.”It further reads, “Provided that in case of any disagreement, the matter shall be decided by the Central Government or State Governments concerned shall give effect to the decision of the Central Government.”

Although police have taken stern action against some of the accused involved in supply and sale of illicit liquor at countrymade liquor shops, it is believed that many other gangs may be active in the illegal business and may try to earn more profits in the poll season through supply of illicit liquor.Deaths due to illicit liquor in trans-Ganga areas had occurred ahead panchayat elections. Dozens of people had died after they consumed the alleged illicit liquor in Nawabganj, Handia and Phulpur. In Phulpur incident, police had attached properties of the accused while in other incidents some suppliers were arrested. However, questioning from them revealed that illicit liquor was being smuggled from neighbouring Pratapgarh district. To stop recurrence of such incidents and sale of illicit liquor, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Prayagraj, Ajay Kumar has constituted ten teams with seven members, including a sub inspector and six constables, in each team. These teams are working in different areas of the district to identify and trace illegal liquor manufacturers, suppliers and smugglers. The teams will also scan records of last ten years to identify those involved in illicit liquor trade. Once identified, they will be detained and questioned if their activities are found suspicious.The police will also take help of those who were earlier associated with liquor mafias but have now left the illegal trade to identify new liquor suppliers who have no police records. SSP Ajay Kumar said the police were keeping a close watch on those suspected to be involved in illicit liquor supply. “Reports are being reviewed on a regular basis and soon massive crackdown will be launched to end the menace,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-polls-police-scanning-records-of-illicit-liquor-suppliers-in-prayagraj-101643047991947.html

The residents of Kaluwas, Nathuwas and Ninan villages said that the students were struggling with online education and they are ready to give their consent to send their wards to school in writing. A resident of Nathuwas village, Kulvir Singh, said, “All residents of our village are healthy and we want the government to open government school. While most children, villagers, and teachers are vaccinated, most parents, teachers and students are ill equipped for online teaching, adding that under the new system all students were getting high marks, which was unfair to brilliant students. “Almost everyone has received 90% marks in the board exams in the last two years and this is not good for the education system. The board exams are just one-and-a-half months away and if the schools do not reopen now, how will the students perform well in the exams,” Kulbir Singh said.Sanjay Kumar of Kaluwas village said politicians have been flouting norms by conducting rallies and road shows, but educational institutions were closed.“ All these faulty policies are framed to keep the rural children away from education. We have submitted a memorandum to deputy commissioner and urged him to re-open the schools,” he said.Despite repeated attempts, Bhiwani deputy commissioner Rippudaman Singh could not be reached for a comment. Earlier, Haryana education minister Kanwar Pal said the state government is yet to take any decision on reopening of schools.“The educational institutes in the state will remain closed till January 26 and online education will continue till further orders. We were planning to open schools at 33% capacity on different days, but no decision has been taken so far,” the education minister added.Haryana health ,inister Anil Vij had earlier said children in the age group of 15-18 years who are not vaccinated against Covid will not be allowed to enter schools, when they reopen. Over 15 lakh children in Haryana between 15-18 years of age are eligible to get the Covid vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-bhiwani-residents-demand-that-government-schools-be-reopened-101643046851308.html

24-01-2022||Pune||PMC builds retaining wall at the accident spot in Ambegaon Budruk||Pune: After two months of the tragic accident that claimed the life of a 12-year-old boy who lost control of his bicycle because of the road’s steep slope and hit a barricade and fell into a nullah, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has started constructing a retaining wall at the accident spot near Dattanagar chowk road that leads to Ambegaon Budruk. The incident happened on November 3, 2021 when the boy died of serious head injuries caused due to the fall. The deceased was identified as Yug Jignesh Vadsola of Astonia Royale residential housing society in Ambegaon Budruk. Yug and his friend were returning home after cycling when he lost control of his cycle and fell in the nullah at around 6 am. Residents have raised concern over the steep slope on the road at the mishap spot and reported incidents of two-wheelers hitting the barricade on the small bridge over the nullah after losing control of their vehicles. “We have started work of barricading the spot with cement wall on the side of the nullah where the accident took place. The wall will prevent residents from falling into the nullah even as the road’s steep slope issue cannot be immediately addressed,” a PMC senior engineer said on condition of anonymity. Locals are demanding more safety measures than a retaining wall. Kiran Jadhav, resident said, “Constructing the retaining wall is not enough, there should be more speed breakers, signage boards and rumblers on this road to check speed of vehicles. There are several accidents happening on this slope.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-builds-retaining-wall-at-the-accident-spot-in-ambegaon-budruk-101643046670999.html
24-01-2022||Pune||Firms struggling to recruit as most students in Pune secure high marks||PUNE: Since last year, Amol Pol and his information technology firm have been struggling to recruit students from engineering colleges. The reason is that a majority of engineering students applying for job opportunities have scored above 90%. This trend of scoring high marks in semester examinations is in turn due to examinations being conducted online over the past two years by Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and other private universities in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. As most engineering students have scored above 90% and even average students have scored good marks, companies are now conducting special examinations to hire students through campus interviews.Pol said, “We had job openings in our company for various posts and when we got the applications, 28 out of the 30-odd students who had applied had above 90% marks. Earlier, this number was less with hardly a few of the students being able to score such good marks. So we took a separate examination to recruit people.”Since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, all semester examinations held by SPPU and other universities have been online. In addition to being online, the examinations have been conducted in the multiple-choice question (MCQ) format leading to many students scoring high marks. Earlier, many students were found cheating during these online exams but later, the exams were made stricter using the proctored method so that students would not cheat.Parag Kalkar, SPPU dean, faculty of commerce and management studies, said, “In the last two years, it has been noticed that most students are scoring above 90% marks across streams, especially in engineering courses. So while hiring students, companies are facing difficulties in shortlisting candidates. This is impacting genuinely bright students as everyone is scoring high marks. Also, students are given 150 hours of work to be done every week, and they are ready to work for less as they are given the ‘work from home’ option.”Satish Mistry, a student, said, “I have completed my Bachelor’s in computer science last year and as we have got a stamp of ‘Covid passed’ and exams were conducted online, there are a large number of students with high marks. When I apply for any job opening, there is strict scrutiny and separate exams are held by the recruiting companies. Getting jobs has become more difficult as compared to pre-Covid times.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/firms-struggling-to-recruit-as-most-students-in-pune-secure-high-marks-101643046430855.html

24-01-2022||Chandigarh||Panchkula industrial plot allotment scam: HC puts Bhupinder Hooda, 17 others on notice over ED’s bail cancellation plea||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday put former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and 17 others on notice in a bail cancellation plea from the enforcement directorate (ED) pertaining to the alleged illegal allotment of HUDA industrial plots in Panchkula in 2012-13. The ED had moved the high court on January 5 and the matter was taken up by the bench of justice Lisa Gill who sought responses from all respondents by April 5, said senior counsel for ED Arvind Moudgil.The case involves allotment of 14 industrial plots worth ₹30.34 crore to Hooda’s “acquaintances” in 2013, when he was the Haryana CM. The ED had initiated investigation in 2015 after an FIR was lodged by the Haryana vigilance bureau. The FIR was subsequently transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 2016. ED had filed its chargesheet in the case in February, 2021. The Supreme Court had in August 2021 stayed the trial in this case. Before the SC, it was argued that since the CBI has not filed a sheet in the case and no trial has begun for the predicate offence, the trial under PMLA cannot proceed.Hooda and others had got bail on different dates from the trial court with Hooda securing the same on March 15, 2021.Others include the then chief administrator HUDA, DPS Nagpal, the then chief controller of finance, HUDA, SC Kansal, 14 of the allottees and some other officers.The ED had argued that Hooda was ex-officio chairman of HUDA being the chief minister of Haryana. “He has been found to be actively involved in the criminal activities related to the scheduled offence. The whole conspiracy was made out by the then chairman playing a vital role in it,” the plea claimed adding that the accused persons were involved with each other and in collusion with each other, misused the government machinery and its power to gain undue benefits. “The investigations point out to a clear-cut nexus and bring out the exact relationship between the then HUDA chairman and the allottees,” it says, claiming that 12 of the 14 allottees have been found to be “acquainted” with Hooda.ED has further claimed that as the accused are influential persons, there is a strong likelihood of witness tampering. Hence, the bail granted should be cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-industrial-plot-allotment-scam-hc-puts-bhupinder-hooda-17-others-on-notice-over-ed-s-bail-cancellation-plea-101643046012435.html

24-01-2022||Chandigarh||3 Haryana districts show negative Covid growth rate||Even as coronavirus cases continued to increase in Haryana, the three worst-affected districts in the state – Gurugram, Faridabad and Ambala – have shown negative growth. As per health department data, the state recorded 61,921 infections between January 17 and January 23 against the 52,747 infections logged in the previous week (January 10-16), indicating a continued rise in infections. However, Gurugram, Faridabad and Ambala, which showed an infection growth rate of 128%, 210% and 188%, respectively, between January 10 and January 16 are showing a negative growth rate, thus indicating a decline in infection rate, as per health department statistics. State nodal officer for Covid, Dr Dhruva Chaudhary said the infection has already started showing a downward trend in Gurugram, Ambala and Faridabad. “The Covid growth rate has stabilised in Rohtak, and Panchkula, and other districts will soon follow suit. Every district will have a different peak period depending on when the surge started, and the decline will be commensurate with the peak,’’ he said. Dr Chaudhary said health-care providers and doctors need to lay emphasis on patients who are hospitalised and those in intensive care. “If the number of hospitalised patients and those in ICU is not increasing, it will be reassuring,’’ he said, adding that patients who come to the emergency with some other complaint, and incidentally test positive for the virus need special attention. As on January 24, the state had more than 51,864 active cases, with six districts – Gurugram, Faridabad, Panchkula, Ambala, Karnal and Sonepat – being the most affected districts. Around 2.93 lakh people got themselves tested last week. Data shows that the average daily positivity rate of the state since January 9 was 18.17%. The average daily positivity rate of Panchkula was the highest at 27.31% in the last fortnight, followed by Faridabad (26.02%), Gurugram (25.90%), Sonepat (25.09%) Kurukshetra (19.64%) and Ambala (19.11%). Palwal with an average daily positivity rate of 2%, followed by Mahendergarh (6.40%), Bhiwani (8.08%), Charkhi Dadri (8.69%) and Nuh (9.65%) ranked the lowest in the last fortnight.

The corporation plans to divert a total Rs40.46 crore for the purpose.The PMC had made the budgetary provision for HCMTR in the financial year 2020-21 but as the project could not be kick-started for the last many years, plans are afoot to divert these funds. Deputy mayor Sunita Wadekar put the proposal before the standing committee and requested that Rs40.46 crore be diverted for land acquisition for the Harris bridge. A land parcel of 900 square metre has to be acquired for the bridge project. The standing committee will take a call on this proposal in the coming meeting.Meanwhile, the HCMTR project, which was proposed nearly 20 years ago, has become a much delayed project.

24-01-2022||Lucknow||UP assembly elections: SBSP workers urge party chief Om Prakash Rajbhar to contest from Shivpur||Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) workers have urged their party president Om Prakash Rajbhar to contest the UP assembly elections from the Shivpur constituency in Varanasi. In 2017, the seat was won by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Anil Rajbhar, who is now a minister in the Yogi Adityanath government.Although the BJP is yet to announce its candidate for the Shivpur seat, there is speculation that the party may retain Anil Rajbhar.SBSP state vice-president Shashi Pratap Singh said, “SBSP workers, including me, have written a letter, urging our party president Om Prakash Rajbhar to contest from the Shivpur assembly constituency here. We are confident that the SBSP chief will respond positively keeping in view the sentiments of party workers.”Singh said that he also spoke to SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar on the phone and apprised him of the sentiments of the SBSP workers. Singh claimed that as an ally of the Samajwadi Party, the SBSP will get at least two seats —Shivpur and Ajgara (reserved) — to contest in Varanasi.Asked whether SBSP chief may consider any other seat, Singh said it may be Zahoorabad, which he represents in the Vidhan Sabha at present. Zahoorabad assembly constituency is in Ghazipur district of eastern UP. Rajbhar voters play a decisive role in this constituency.The SBSP was in alliance with the BJP in 2017 and won four assembly seats.SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar had won the Zahoorabad seat in 2017 and was made a cabinet minister in the Yogi Adityanath government. After the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Om Prakash Rajbhar was sacked from the Uttar Pradesh cabinet following his constant public criticism of the government on various issues.Rajbhar intensified his attack on the government thereafter. About three months ago, he formed an alliance with the main opposition Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh and vowed to make SP chief Akhilesh Yadav the chief minister again. Akhilesh Yadav was the Uttar Pradesh chief minister from 2012 to 2017.Shashi Pratap Singh may also contest the assembly polls, those aware of the issue in the party said.When asked, Singh said, “I am an SBSP worker. As a dedicated worker, I am working for the expansion of the party. As for the rest, whatever will be the party’s instruction, I will follow that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-assembly-elections-sbsp-workers-urge-party-chief-om-prakash-rajbhar-to-contest-from-shivpur-101643045350843.html
24-01-2022||Mumbai||22K fire calls reported in Mumbai in 5 years: Data||In the last five years, the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) received 22,764 fire-related calls, the data has revealed. Of the total calls, the maximum were related to minor fire incidents. Interestingly, over the last two years since the Covid-19 pandemic, the fire incidents have gone down in Mumbai, as per the data. Fire officials have attributed the dip to pandemic and lockdown restrictions.In 2017, MFB received a total of 4,454 fire calls which went up to 4,959 in 2018 and 5,324 in 2019. However, the fire calls dropped to 4,512 in 2020 and in 2021, the fire calls went further down to 3,515.According to the officials, the number of fire calls went down in 2020 and 2021 partly because of the lockdown. “In 2020 and 2021, several commercial units were shut and many of our fire calls are also due to standalone fires in vehicles. However, due to lockdown, vehicles remained unused, which in turn resulted in fire calls going down. However, increased awareness owing to several fire incidents in notable areas in the last couple of years has also resulted in fire calls going down,” a senior MFB official said.According to the data, in 2020 and 2021, the number of fire calls during Diwali went down in comparison to 2018 and 2019. Around Diwali in 2021, MFB got 142 calls between November 1 and 4, while it received 155 calls during the same period in 2020. Around 2019 Diwali, it got a total of 173 calls of which 47 calls were related to firecrackers, followed by 246 calls around Diwali in 2018 of which 50 calls were related to crackers.Meanwhile, the death toll in Tardeo fire incident went up to seven on Monday. 38-year-old Manish Singh was declared dead at Nair Hospital on Monday at 7 am. Overall, seven patients out of the 16 admitted in various hospitals are in critical condition.

24-01-2022||Mumbai||At 502, city records its worst-ever air quality||MUMBAI The city’s air quality index (AQI) on Monday morning plunged to an unprecedented 502 – indicating ‘Severe +’ air quality – as per the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research’s (SAFAR) network of nine monitors in the city. This is the worst AQI recorded since the launch of this monitoring system in Mumbai in 2015, confirmed Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR, who also described the pollution level as unprecedented. The corresponding 24-hour average AQI according to the Central Pollution Control Board was 381.Beig attributed the pollution spike to a recent western disturbance which passed over the region, bringing unseasonal rains to parts of the city on Saturday, followed by a large dust plume which rode in on prevailing westerly winds during the early hours on Sunday. Experts said that this dust originated from Pakistan and the Middle East. Western disturbances are storm systems that form in the Middle East and travel eastward, bringing sporadic and sudden winter rain to the northern parts of India, with their influence sometimes extending along the western coast and in central India.“The western disturbance induced a low-pressure zone near Rajasthan and adjoining parts of Pakistan on the night of January 21,” Beig said. “This caused an increase in the surface wind speed over Pakistan and adjoining eastern Iran, which started blowing the dust over these regions from the early morning hours of January 22. Within a few hours, the dust was visible over the Gulf of Oman and northern Arabian Sea, following which it entered Gujarat on the same day, and Maharashtra the following day,” added Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist at the University of Reading, UK.Beig described this event as “unprecedented” for Mumbai. “On Monday morning, the city’s air quality index touched ‘severe’ classification for the first time on record. This number, of 502, is an average of hourly AQI data over 24 hours, so on Monday morning it indicated that there was a high amount of dust in the air during the night and the previous day. During the day on Monday however, clearer skies and strong winds marginally improved air quality,” Beig explained.Despite the improvement, however, Mumbai continued to record ‘severe’ air on Monday evening, with SAFAR showing an AQI of 453. Data from individual monitors, however, accessible through the CPCB’s website, show uniform improvements across the city with PM2.5 and PM10 levels dropping consistently starting around 7am Monday. The CPCB’s daily air quality bulletin, released at 4pm each day, showed Mumbai as having ‘very poor’ air on Monday.The discrepancy between the SAFAR and CPCB numbers, experts explained, is due to the number of air quality monitors used by each. While SAFAR relies on data from nine monitoring stations in Mumbai, CPCB uses data from 17, spread over a larger geographic area, producing a lower geographic and diurnal average.Beig added that Mumbai had last witnessed such a high levels of air pollution owing to similar dust event in late 2016, but was unable to pinpoint the exact AQI value at the time. An AQI of 100 to 199 is considered ‘moderate’, while 50 to 99 is considered ‘satisfactory’ and below 50 is considered ‘good’. AQI in excess of 200 is considered ‘poor’, above 300 ‘very poor’, above 400 ‘severe’ and above 500 is considered ‘severe+’.On Sunday evening, immediately after the dust plume entered the Konkan and north Madhya Maharashtra regions, SAFAR recorded an AQI of 333, which climbed to 502 by the next morning. “Since AQIs, at both state level and in the CPCB’s daily air quality index bulletin are presented as an average of the past 24 hours, the previous day’s conditions are actually better reflected in the following day’s average,” explained Sachin Panwar, an independent air quality expert certified by the Quality Council of India. “There must have been an accumulation of dust during the night, owing to lower temperatures and slower wind speeds, and this likely pushed the AQI numbers past the 500-mark in the morning. For a coastal city like Mumbai, it is surprising to see such a high AQI,” he added.Other experts were also surprised. “I have never seen uniformly high pollution load across so many of the city’s air quality monitors before,” said Ronak Sutaria, founder of Respirer Living Sciences. “The nature of the pollution, however, is very different from a city like Delhi, which records such high AQIs more routinely. There, the sources of pollution tend to be local, whereas the event witnessed in Mumbai is clearly a regional event in that the pollutants were transported in a very large quantity from outside the region over a short period of time.”Mumbai had also witnessed a similar dust event in March 2012. The source of dust has always been the arid regions of the Middle East and Pakistan, experts said. However, such events over the Middle East are generally more frequent during spring and summer season when factors such as high temperature, atmospheric instability, strong northwesterly winds and thunderstorms create ideal conditions for the triggering of dust storms. Dust storms observed in June and July are not able to impact Mumbai due to the monsoon conditions. LOW TEMPERATURES CONTINUE As a result of the western disturbance and accompanying unseasonal rains, Mumbai continued to experience cooler than usual temperatures on Monday. The day’s daytime maximum settled six degrees below normal at 24.8 degrees Celsius (up from 23.8 degrees Celsius the day prior, which marked the lowest in January in at least a decade) while the minimum settled two notches below normal at 15 degrees Celsius, down from 21 degrees Celsius on Sunday. January’s highest maximum as per historical records stands at 37.4 degrees Celsius (in 2006) while the lowest minimum stands at 7.4 degrees Celsius (in 1962). With temperatures expected to rise from Tuesday, warmer conditions will further aid in the dispersal of accumulated dust. HEALTH IMPACT Chest physician Dr Prashant Chhajed from Santacruz based Lung Care and Sleep Centre said that nearly 20% of his daily consultations over the past few days have been people complaining of runny nose, burning of eyes, sneezing and cough triggered by the condition of the air. “Some patients mistake these as Covid-19 symptoms and end doing RT-PCR tests,” said Dr Chhajed. “Patients who already have underlying conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders (COPD) are highly sensitive. We make sure that their existing treatment is on track and enhance the level of treatment temporarily if needed. In patients with no such underlying conditions, we give symptomatic treatment and advise them not to step out early in the morning to avoid inhaling the smog particles,” he said. City-based physician Dr Hemant Gupta said that the high concentration of smog mainly impacts early morning walkers, senior citizens, and those with already existing lung ailments. “When such people inhale these particles, respiratory allergies are triggered or aggravated,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-502-city-records-its-worst-ever-air-quality-101643043373941.html
24-01-2022||Mumbai||Maharashtra ACB sees notable dip in corruption cases amid Covid-19 pandemic||Mumbai Maharashtra has seen a significant drop in corruption cases amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The Maharashtra Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has seen a 14 drop with 773 cases registered in 2021, down from 891 cases in 2019. In 2020, ACB had registered 663 cases, a 26 percent dip from the 2019 figures and 14.23 percent less than cases logged in 2021.In the recently released statistics for the year 2021, the agency stated that of the 773 cases registered in 2021, 764 were trap cases, 7 were disproportionate assets cases and two other cases. In the same period in 2020, the agency had registered 630 trap cases, 12 disproportionate assets cases and 21 other types of corruption cases. Before the pandemic, in 2019, the agency had registered 866 trap cases, 20 disproportionate asset cases, and five other corruption cases.ACB officials attributed the dip in fresh cases to Covid-19 pandemic-triggered lockdowns and closures of non-essential establishments.“Fewer people came out of their homes in the city and the state due to the several lockdowns and restrictions imposed during the year, leading to registration of less number of cases,” said retired IPS officer and former DGP of Maharashtra, Praveen Dixit, who has also worked as DGP of ACB.ACB sources said that in 2017, the agency had registered 925 cases and 936 cases in 2018.“We had even appealed to people and advertised that they can register their complaint on the app of Maharashtra ACB and we will approach them so they don’t have to leave their houses,” said an ACB official.“Though fewer cases were registered in 2020 and 2021, the number increased as soon as the Covid-19 situation improved in 2022. Despite the third wave, the agency has already registered 33 trap cases till January 20,” the ACB official added.The statistics revealed that Mumbai is the eighth corrupt city in Maharashtra. In 2021, the financial capital of India logged 46 corruption cases and the Mumbai Unit arrested 66 persons in total in relation to the cases.Pune topped the list in 2021 with 165 cases and 235 arrests, followed by Aurangabad where 130 cases were registered and 184 arrests were made. In Nashik region ACB registered 129 cases and made 173 arrests, whereas its Thane unit registered 88 cases and made 135 arrests, Amravati and Nagpur units registered 72 cases each with 103 and 94 arrests respectively, and the Nanded unit registered 62 cases and arrested 86 people.“All the other regions from Nashik, Aurangabad, Thane each division has more than four to five districts under it. Mumbai only had two districts Mumbai City and Mumbai Suburban which is the reason the cases are less in Mumbai,” said Laxmi Gautam, Additional Commissioner of Police, ACB, Mumbai, who heads the Mumbai Region, adding that Nashik ACB unit has five districts under -- Nashik, Ahmednagar, Dhule, Jalgaon and Nandurbar.However, former DGP Dixit believes the reason for fewer cases in Mumbai is the “busy life of citizens and corrupt bodies like the BMC where the process is two way so neither the complainant nor the government official is unhappy and nobody wants to report about it”.“When we launched the Maharashtra ACB app, the main aim was that the complainants did not require to come to the ACB office at Worli and can lodge their grievance online. Due to their busy lifestyle, Mumbai residents avoid approaching ACB officials and instead prefer paying bribe and carrying out the work. At times the process is two way, as people are also keen to get the work done by paying a little amount. We even carried out several seminars in schools and colleges to reach maximum people,” said Dixit, who has served as the DGP of ACB Maharashtra.RTI activist and convener of The Young Whistleblowers Foundation, Jeetendra Ghadge, believes that there needs to be a change in the attitude of the ACB officials, especially in the city.“Out of more than 5,000 complaints of financial misconduct, only one First Information Report (FIR) was registered by the Mumbai Region and 200 inquires ordered. The ACB’s concentration is only on small fishes and the bigger sharks or Class I official’s are sitting merrily. They only arrest people in traps but don’t want to inquire or question people on anonymous letters or suo motto action if they find somebody is having more wealth than his income,” said Ghadge.“Lot of political interference’s and no powers for independent decision making are killing the performance of the agency. While the figures of ACB might show a rosy picture the reality is something else,” Ghadge added.However, Gautam said that the Mumbai ACB unit registered a lot of high-profile cases in 2021. “The agency registered a case against Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Mumbai Monorail, Dr D L N Murthy for demanding bribe. Recently, the agency arrested another Class I officer Anil Jadhav who was posted with Maharashtra State Skill Development Society (MSSDS) after he was caught accepting a bribe. It even arrested a female inspector from Azad Maidan Traffic Division, Sheetal Malte for demanding a bribe from a transporter. 30 percent of the cases that Mumbai Unit did was of Class One officers,” he said.The statistics of the ACB in 2021 showed that the revenue department topped in corruption with 178 cases, followed by the police department 173 cases, followed by the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company’s 51 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-acb-sees-notable-dip-in-corruption-cases-amid-covid-19-pandemic-101643041758071.html
24-01-2022||Mumbai||Allow kin of Covid victims to claim ex-gratia physically: HC||Mumbai Chiding the state government for making the process of submitting claims for ₹50,000 compensation for families of Covid victims technology-based, the Bombay high court (HC) directed the state to permit individuals to submit documents physically or by post.While hearing a PIL filed by NGO Prameya Welfare Foundation, the bench said “getting compensation is their right” and the authorities could not deal with their claims in a “technical manner.”The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Makarand Karnik was hearing the petition. Advocates Sumedha Rao and Rumana Bagdadi for the NGO, which represents 56 applicants, informed the bench that it was seeking reliefs as applicants were unable to apply through the web portal specifically set-up for processing such claims.The advocates further submitted that as per a Supreme Court (SC) decision, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) had formulated guidelines for the state to disburse the ex-gratia compensation of ₹50,000 to dependents of Covid victims through the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). Certification of eligible victims is to be decided as per guidelines issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and the Indian Centre for Medical Research (ICMR).Referring to the work undertaken by the NGO, advocate Rao said that claim forms were distributed in several chawls and slum areas following which nearly 56 people, who are economically backwards, had filed claims before the Collector’s office, much before the Maharashtra government had initiated an online portal for claims and payments. She added that due to technical glitches in uploading forms on the online portal, claims should be granted based on the forms submitted physically.Advocate Kejali Mastakar for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) informed the bench that it had received nearly 34,159 applications for ex-gratia compensation, out of which the civic authority had approved 16,818 applications.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner incharge of BMC’s public health department said, “The number of applications is more than the Covid deaths on Mumbai’s list as some applications are duplicate. Multiple family members have applied for the same death. In other cases, some applications are also there as the patient is not a resident of Mumbai, but was treated in the city.” According to the BMC, there are 16,958 approved applications,8,052 multiple/duplicate applications, 9,474 outside Mumbai residents’ applications, remaining applications are under process of approval.Government pleader (GP) for the state government informed the bench that the online portal was intended to ensure that the amount was directly paid to the beneficiary account and hence the NGO should assist them in submitting the claim forms. After hearing the submissions, the bench chided the state and said, “The spirit of SC order is that the administration must reach families of persons who have died of Covid. Keep this in mind, Why should you be so technical (while deciding claims)?” The bench then observed that the online portal was for the convenience of the state but getting compensation was a right of the citizens and they could not be deprived just because the claims were filed through the physical mode.Thereafter, the GP sought time to take instructions from concerned officials which the bench accepted and posted a further hearing of the PIL to January 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/allow-kin-of-covid-victims-to-claim-ex-gratia-physically-hc-101643041751937.html

He added: “Dreams of those indulging in loot and pushing the state into riots have been shattered by the BJP government in the state. The BJP has worked with zero tolerance towards crime and corruption.” He said the BJP government was sensitive towards villages, poor, farmers, youth and women. “People had no expectations from the Samajwadi Party that indulged in humiliating Baba Saheb Ambedkar and changed names of institutions set up in the name of late Kanshi Ram. The SP had sided with criminals and rioters and those responsible for the exodus of Hindus in Kairana,” added Adityanath. He said the Lakhimpur Kheri violence was unfortunate and the state government acted effectively with regard to it. On SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav’s daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav, who joined the BJP recently, he said she was in touch with the BJP for four years. Adityanath said she had positive thinking about the BJP government’s work and had contributed for the construction of Ram temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-to-form-next-govt-with-300-plus-seats-yogi-101643041750454.html

They misbehaved with my uncle when he objected. On hearing this, when I reached there, they attacked us and even snatched my licensed gun,” said Niraj.Meanwhile, a complaint was also lodged by Harendra Prasad. “Further investigation into the matter is underway,” said the SHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-minister-s-son-among-7-booked-after-bettiah-clash-101643041093400.html

According to police, trouble erupted when the motorcyclist, identified as Nathu Das (30), a resident of Chhangraha Brita Toli, died after being run over by the official vehicle of Bettiah’s additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM) KK Sahi, who was on his way to Bettiah from Motihari along with his family members. “Police had to resort to mild lathi-charge and arrest 10 people after a team which went to rescue the ACJM and his family held captive by the villagers also came under attack,” said Dr Kumar Ashish, superintendent of police (SP), East Champaran. During the clash, over a dozen of policemen also sustained injuries.Sources, quoting eye witnesses, said that as the news of the motorcyclist’s death spread, enraged villagers disrupted the vehicular movement near Chhangraha village on Bettiah-Motihari main road, putting up the blockades. “Demanding compensation beyond the government rule, they also held ACJM and his family members captive,” said an eye-witness. When a police team arrived at the site, the crowd went berserk and started pelting stones at police after the ACJM and his family members were rescued. “Other miscreants are being identified,” the SP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/magistrate-family-held-captive-after-road-accident-10-cops-injured-in-rescue-bid-101643041092137.html
24-01-2022||Patna||JD(U) dares Bihar BJP chief to back special status demand||The Janata Dal (United) on Monday dared ally Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Sanjay Jaiswal to spearhead the campaign for getting the special status to Bihar, saying chief ministers of many backward states are united on the demand. JD(U)’s national general secretary KC Tyagi said CMs of states like Assam, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal had been campaigning for the special status to their respective states, apart from Bihar. “For Jaiswal’s knowledge, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar had held a meeting with Odisha CM Navin Patnaik and West Bengal CM Manata Benerjee in Bhubaneshwar on the issue of special status in February 2020 and asked for special attention from the centre towards the backward states,” Tyagi said. Responding to JD(U) national president Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh’s bid to revive the abandoned demand for special status to Bihar, Jaiswal had said he would support and join JD(U)’s campaign if its chief managed to bring the CMs of other backward states on the issue. Tyagi said the special status for Bihar was not JD(U)’s demand only. “It’s a matter of the state’s pride and identity. Leaders cutting across the party lines had unanimously passed resolutions in the state legislature for the special status. The party believes that the nation cannot prosper unless Bihar is developed. The special status is an undeniable necessity for Bihar to stand together with the developed states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, etc,” said Tyagi, adding that the special package would not help much. The BJP chief’s assurance to back the special status demand for Bihar was, however, ridiculed by the opposition leaders. Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha said BJP and JD(U) were playing a fixed match over the issue. “If Jaiswal, who is also an MP from West Champaran, is really concerned for development of Bihar, he should have reminded PM Narendra Modi about his commitment to the people of Bihar during 2014 Lok Sabha elections,” said Jha. Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MLA and chief spokesman Bhai Birendra said. “Why hasn’t a single Central minister from Bihar ever talked about the demand for special status? It’s because of BJP’s dithering approach that the Bihar CM’s bid to hold all-party meet on the caste census is pending.”
24-01-2022||Patna||No anticipatory bail for MU V-C in graft case||PATNA A special vigilance court in Patna on Monday rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Magadh University vice chancellor Dr Rajendra Prasad, who faces serious corruption charges and whose official residence in Bodh Gaya and ancestral house in Gorakhpur (UP) were searched two months ago. Anandi Singh, who appeared for the state government in the court, said, “The court had granted him interim relief earlier and said no coercive action be taken till the disposal of his bail application, which has now been rejected.”Prasad has been on medical leave since raids were conducted at his houses two months ago. He had appeared before the special vigilance unit (SVU) last week for the first time, but reportedly did not give satisfactory replies to the questions put to him. He is accused of corruption in the purchase of OMR sheets, answer books and books for libraries. During the searches, ₹90 lakh in cash, foreign currency worth ₹7.5 lakh and jewellery worth ₹15 lakh were seized from his premises, as per SVU officials. Several files related to guards’ recruitment were also recovered from his residence, which actually should have been in his Bodh Gaya office, sleuths said. Four Magadh University officials — Prasad’s personal assistant, university proctor, registrar and library in-charge — have already been arrested in the case.This is the first time that premises of a serving vice chancellor were raided in Bihar.

24-01-2022||Ranchi||Women banking correspondents widen financial inclusion in rural Jharkhand||“It’s is difficult to believe that life could actually change so much in just two-three years. But that is how my experience has been since I took over this work in 2018 after becoming a member of the women self-help group (SHG) in 2015,” says Poonam Surin, who works as banking correspondent sakhi (BCS) in the tribal-dominated Tethaitangar block of Simdega district in Jharkhand.Surin, a graduate, says she was a homemaker till she joined the SHG, giving tuitions to children in her Gargarbahar village and earning around ₹1000-1500 every month. “On an average, I now earn around ₹10,000 per month. And there is scope to increase it further as my income is linked to the number of banking transactions done through me. We get a commission of 0.5% of each transaction value,” says Surin. In November 2021, Surin did 795 banking transactions worth ₹31.95 lakh. There are others who have travelled far, doing monthly transactions of over ₹1 crore. In the same month, Anita Kumari of Jayshree Mahila Kalyan Samuh in Chitarpur of Ramgarh district did transactions worth ₹1.2 crore. Similarly, Gudiya Kushwaha of Vikash Mahila Mandal in Bela in Hazaribag district logged transactions worth ₹1.09 crore.Besides gender empowerment, SHG women like Surin are transforming banking in the rural areas, taking it to the doorsteps of the needy, especially the elderly and the divyang (handicapped), widening financial inclusion of rural populace like never before.These BCS are part of SHGs (Sakhi Mandals) formed under the Deendayal Antayodaya Yojana (DAY) under the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) of the central government. In Jharkhand, the programme is run by Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion Society (JSLPS), which works under the state’s rural development department. As per official estimates, the BC Sakhis are making 2.75 lakh transactions worth ₹120 crore every month.“Currently, we have 4,691 women working as banking agents. Some of them are working in the same panchayats if they are big in geographical spread and demography. Out of them, 1,491 are working as BCS after proper training. The target is to have at least one BCS in all of the 4,370 gram panchayats in the state,” said Dheeraj Horo, state programme manager (financial inclusion), JSLPS.These banking correspondents provide basic financial services such as customer identification, collection of information/applications, individual account opening, cash withdrawal, deposit, transfer, Aadhar seeding, pension services, scholarships to school children, wage payment under MGNREGA and fund withdrawal under PMAY etc.“While the concept of banking correspondent is to take banking into rural pockets, associating women with it has far-reaching consequences. It has the potential of a silent social revolution wherein women become self-reliant. It also promotes them as role models among the local populace,” said Manish Ranjan, rural development secretary, Jharkhand.JSLPS officials said women working as BC Sakhi also help SHGs in understanding the banking system and make credit linkages better. “If members from a SHG become banking agents, it boosts the confidence of other members of the SHG as most of them are illiterates. As per the state-level banking committee (SLBC) data, the credit linkage to women SHGs was only ₹27 crore in 2013. In 2021, it rose to ₹3,234 crore. It shows how confidence of SHGs has increased in seeking bank loans,” said Horo. During Covid-19 and curbs, officials said, banking correspondents played a key role, providing banking services closer to people’s homes, taking all precautions as per the set protocols. “Besides banking services, these BCS and SHGs also helped in cooking and distribution of food during the lockdown period,” said Ranjan.However, technical glitch, especially poor internet connectivity, is one of the major hindrances in functioning of the banking correspondents, besides safety issues for moving around with money for their job.BCS Gudiya Kushwaha of Vikash Mahila Mandal in Bela in Hazaribag district, who logged transactions worth ₹1.09 crore, said poor internet connectivity forces them to restrict their functioning from their kiosk, which operates like a mini bank. “We still try to reach out to the needy, especially the elderly and disabled. We try to organize a weekly visit to the villages to cater to the needs of the SHGs and their loan-related settlements. Even if the customers are required to visit our permanent centres, it is much more convenient for them. For example, people from our panchayat were required to visit the block headquarter Chouparan to avail of banking services, which is around six kilometres from here. But now they are required not beyond one to one-and-a-half kilometres,” said Kushwaha.Ranjan, while conceding that internet connectivity was a concern, said his department has issued an order making it mandatory for the BCS to make regular visits to the villages. “It is especially required when the customers are senior citizens or divyangs,” said Ranjan.

24-01-2022||Pune||Pune air quality drops to ‘Very poor’ as dust shrouds city||PUNE Pune’s air quality on Monday was worse as the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) soared to 400 and remained in the ‘red’ category of ‘Very poor’, data showed. In some parts of the city like Pashan and Lohegaon, the air quality was severe which means that pollutants were alarmingly high. Dust settled across Pune city on Sunday, causing the air quality to deteriorate on Monday. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) forecast said that the air quality may remain the same till January 27. Dr B S Murthy, director of SAFAR and scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) said that the dust is settled in Pune city but the air quality will improve only after January 27. “The situation is improving and the dust is settling now. The air quality will improve post January 26. Pune, usually has air quality between ‘Satisfactory’ to ‘Moderate’. As the dust settles, it’s effect will also not be seen,” said Murthy.On Monday, Pune city also reported night temperature at 10.4 degrees Celsius. As per India Meteorological Department (IMD) night temperature on Sunday was 17.2 degrees Celsius. The city witnessed a drastic drop in minimum temperature which is also a factor that contributed to the rise in pollution levels.Speaking about it, Murthy added that local conditions impact air quality. “Drop in temperature can increase the dispersion of pollution particles which deteriorates the air quality,” he said.According to SAFAR officials, dust storms in the gulf region along with high winds have taken to higher levels of the atmosphere. This has impacted Delhi, Gujarat and Maharashtra.“Dust storms are a regular phenomenon in pre-monsoon months like April and May when the gulf region is experiencing heat. However, it is very rare in winter,” said Murthy. “AQI of Pune indicates ‘Very poor’ air quality today and is likely to improve but remain within ‘Very poor’ for the next two days. Air quality is likely to improve gradually from January 27 onwards as the influence of dust storms subsides and local ventilation of pollutants increases,” said SAFAR officials.Scientists further added that the dust storm has degraded air quality in Gujarat and Maharashtra from January 23, noon onwards. AQI of Mumbai has degraded significantly to ‘Severe’ and likely to improve to ‘lower end of severe’ as upper level winds are expected to blow from northeast that minimises dust intrusion for the next few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-air-quality-drops-to-very-poor-as-dust-shrouds-city-101643038456009.html
24-01-2022||Mumbai||Congress urges PM and Thackeray to ban ‘Why I killed Gandhi’ movie||Mumbai: The Indian National Congress (INC) has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray seeking a ban on the movie -‘Why I Killed Gandhi’- that glorifies Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse. Nana Patole, president of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC), also attacked the Narendra Modi-led government for diluting the Mahatma’s legacy.“Any glorification of a despicable and inhuman act is against Indian culture, and hence, the Congress party is demanding that the film should not be screened in any cinema house in Maharashtra or on any OTT platform, and we request that this must be accepted,” said Patole in his letter to Thackeray on Monday.“An assassin is being converted into a hero. The country’s identity is the principle of ahimsa (non-violence) as espoused by Mahatma Gandhi and Gautama Buddha. The people of this country will not tolerate an attempt to glorify a killer,” Patole, who was accompanied by activist Firoze Mithiborwala and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Vidya Chavan, told the media.NCP Lok Sabha MP and actor Amol Kolhe has played the lead role in Godse’s biopic, which is scheduled to release on January30. This led to criticism from his party colleagues and Maharashtra housing minister Jitendra Awhad, though NCP supremo Sharad Pawar has said that Kolhe’s role should be seen as that of an actor. On being asked about Kolhe’s role in the movie, Patole said “they were against the ideology and not the actors.”Patole also attacked the merger and putting out of the icon Amar Jawan Jyoti at the India Gate in Delhi with the newer flame at the National War Memorial. Patole also decried attempts to dilute the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, by dropping Gandhi’s favourite hymn ‘Abide With Me’ from the Beating Retreat ceremony. On January 30, Congress leaders and activists will hold a fast as part of their protest at Gandhi’s statue near Mantralaya in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-urges-pm-and-thackeray-to-ban-why-i-killed-gandhi-movie-101643037790460.html

24-01-2022||Chandigarh||Tryst with unwanted visitor who’s overstayed welcome||My husband and I stepped into the New Year with a bang, and alas a sneeze. After all, we are only human and so for how long could we protect ourselves from a particularly unrelenting, obdurate and seemingly immortal visitor, who doesn’t belong to any sex, has no visible form, is weightless, odourless and colourless and doesn’t respect the word, no! It put its foot in our door, squeezed past barricades of double masks and sanitisers and in a vulnerable moment, taking advantage of the tiniest slip and momentary falling of guard, planted itself firmly in our household. An invisible but lethal presence that slyly floated from room to room, nostril to throat and then akin to a parasite, sat pretty and multiplied spitefully. Initially, I took the insidious entry and subsequent attack on the chin! Two years of playing hide and seek and it had eventually succeeded in seeking us out. In spite of all our evasive tactics and deployments, it had managed to cast us in its deadly embrace. It was unthinkable. I rued and blamed myself for the oversight or casual attitude that may have led to us getting infected. Soon hysteria and panic loomed easily within view. Worst case scenarios played out in my head as I searched for the Paracetamols, oximeters and nasal steamers. I was constantly noting down oxygen saturation levels and temperatures, throwing out old thermometers and buying new ones, marching up and down the rooms when I realised that my anxiety and fretting was having a ripple effect on the rest of the family. Taking in deep breaths, I resolved to calm down, and tried to remember and repeat the mantra of acceptance and faith, the key and solution to any unavoidable situation in life. But as Day 5 approached and still we were in the throes of cough and fever, frustration and resentment reared its head and I recalled the stoic words attributed to American philosopher and author, Benjamin Franklin who famously said, “Fish and visitors stink in three days”, a truism that undisputedly applied to our unwanted lodger who had clearly overstayed his welcome. My patience and goodwill were by now being stretched and tested to its limits. Of course, with medication and time, we managed to exorcise ourselves of the undesirable and unsolicited pestilence but realised that it has left behind a small cache of its belongings as a memento. A lingering backache, fatigue, some weakness and bouts of depression, too. I am left wondering what it will take to pack it up and send back to the owner! Rumour has it that the much-maligned intruder and rogue will only be beaten once it has paid us all a little visit. So, buckle up, the trip may be a little choppy but it will be short, I hope and pray. pallavisingh358@gmail.com The writer is a Jalandhar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tryst-with-unwanted-visitor-who-s-overstayed-welcome-101643028129623.html

24-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab drugs case: HC dismisses Majithia’s anticipatory bail plea||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday dismissed the anticipatory bail plea of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia in the drugs case registered against him in Mohali on December 20. Also read: NDA seals Punjab seat-sharing. BJP to contest 65 seats, Captain’s party eyes 37Majithia will now be approaching the Supreme Court for interim protection from arrest in the case. Earlier in the day, the high court bench of justice Lisa Gill heard arguments from both sides and the order was reserved for the pronouncement at 4pm. Though the detailed order is awaited, the pronouncement was made at 4pm. The high court had on two occasions given interim protection from arrest to Majithia on his plea. On January 10 and 18, it asked him to cooperate in the probe and also imposed some other conditions. On the last date of hearing on January 18, Punjab Police complained before the high court that Majithia did not cooperate in the probe, even though he joined the investigation on multiple occasions. The state government had roped in former Union minister and Supreme Court lawyer P Chidambaram, while apex court lawyer Mukul Rohtagi with senior advocate RS Cheema represented Majithia. On January 10, the high court acted on his anticipatory bail plea and asked him to join the probe on January 12. It directed the police not to arrest him. After remaining underground for 20 days, Majithia surfaced a day after the high court gave him interim protection. He was booked under Sections 25 (punishment for allowing premises), 27 (A) (whoever is financing any activities pertaining to narcotic drugs) and 29 (party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act on December 20. On December 24, a Mohali court dismissed his anticipatory bail plea. In his plea, Majithia termed the FIR an “election stunt” and alleged that the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government had changed three Punjab Police chiefs in three months to get this FIR registered. The plea also accused Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu of indulging in “unwarranted propaganda” and deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa of demonstrating “intense hatred” towards Majithia. Punjab Police, in its response, had said that the government machinery was used for the benefit of drug cartels during the Akali regime in the state. Majithia was a key minister in the Akali government and it was during the SAD’s term that the cartel was unearthed, the police submitted. The SIT also said incriminating material had come on record against Majithia.

This win comes after 14 years.The college had earlier won the trophy for 2 shoor directed by Alok Rajwade in 2009. The Purushottam Karandak, is an annual inter-collegiate Marathi one -act play competition where students from across Maharashtra representing their respective college participate. The competition is known for giving a platform to amateur actors, some of whom have become professional actors, directors and playwrights.“This year 50 colleges participated and 49 presented their plays following all the Covid norms. We held the Karandak after a gap of one year, but nothing could dampen the spirit and the energy of the college students participating,” said trustee Mangesh Shinde, Maharashtriya Kalopasak, who organises this competition.“We were expecting the students to look at a play on Covid, which no one did, instead presented some very interesting plays like, Manjamma Puranam (BMCC),Trip (Pemraj Sarda College, Ahmednagar) Bhag Dhanno Bhag – (Modern College), Complete Void (Abasaheb Garware College), Panipuri (Ganeshkhind Engineering College),Varat (IMCC), Safar ( Kaveri Mahavidyalaya), Art (Vasantdada Patil Institute of Technology), and Every Night in My Dreams (Kashibai Navale College of Engineering). There were nine finalists whose performance were judged by Chinmay Sumeet, Shailesh Deshmukh and Nitin Dhanduke,” he added. The preliminary round of the Purushottam Karandak was held from January 3 to 17, 2022. Although this Karandak has been held since 1963, it was not held in 2021 due to Covid, said organisers.Manjamma Puranam, the winning play is written and directed by Shantanu Joshi and Yogesh Sapre. “We all were discussing what to perform for Purushottam Karandak, that is when we came across Padmashree B Manjamma Jogati’s interview. She was the only transgender woman to win Padmashree this year. Her life story was appealing and intimidating. Also, we found some relevance with mythology. Performing it along with live music was a real task but also it did add a great layer to the play,” said Sakshi Deshpande, SY BCom student and part of the team. The Covid restrictions added many obstacles to the actors but they overcame them all to practice for the play with precautions. “We tried our best to not let these restrictions come in the way and had to practice the play with less than 20 people at a time,” she added.“Purushottam Karandak has always been a prestigious competition for the drama groups in colleges in Pune.

24-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: Sidhu complains to EC against AAP’s phone survey||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday submitted a complaint to the Election Commission against the Aam Aadmi Party’s ‘Janata Chunegi Apna CM’ phone survey to name its chief ministerial candidate, calling it “fake propaganda”. Also read: NDA seals Punjab seat-sharing deal: BJP to contest 65 seats, Captain’s party eyes 37The PPCC chief complained that prima facie the AAP’s survey seems to be fake as the data with respect to 21.59 lakh phone calls, voice messages and WhatsApp messages within just four days is not mathematically logical. “At the initial stage, this data pertaining to call logs is assumed to be fake,” Sidhu has written to the chief election commissioner, demanding the registration of a case against the AAP through its national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal if his charge is found to be true. Sidhu released his complaint to the media at a press conference in Chandigarh. Kejriwal had on January 18 named the AAP’s Punjab unit president and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann as the chief ministerial face of the party in the state following its phone survey. “The party received 21.59 lakh responses from people during the drive to pick the CM face. Of them, 93.3% respondents took Bhagwant Mann’s name,” Kejriwal had said while announcing his name at an event in Mohali. In his complaint, Sidhu said the AAP was claiming that they have received 7 lakh WhatsApp messages, 2.5 lakh voice messages and 8 lakh voice calls, but this does not make sense at all. “Usually, such calls take at least 15 seconds, then only 5,760 calls can be attended in one day and that shall add up to 23,040 calls in four days,” he wrote, asking the Election Commission to direct the AAP to shut this campaign and issue a public retraction. The Congress leader also requested the poll panel to direct the party to provide all call and message logs for verification. Terming it a “deceptive drive”, he said that the AAP had tried to fool people through this campaign.

24-01-2022||Punjab||NDA seals Punjab seat-sharing deal: BJP to contest 65 seats, Captain's party eyes 37||The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on Monday announced its seat-sharing formula for the upcoming Punjab assembly election.According to the division, the BJP is set to contest the Punjab polls on 65 seats, while the Punjab Lok Congress, led by former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, will field candidates on 37 constituencies.The Sikh-centric Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) (SAD-S), led by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, will contest on the remaining 15 seats.Leaders of BJP-Led alliance in Punjab jointly address a press conference at party headquarters in New Delhi. https://t.co/tDmvcwgizOWhile announcing the seat-sharing division in a press conference ahead of the Punjab polls, BJP president JP Nadda said the ‘grand’ NDA alliance not only sees the election as a change of regime but also as a means to secure the future generations in the state and provide the state a modicum of stability.“We are all concerned about Punjab, it needs special attention since security is a very important issue here,” said the BJP chief. “The NDA will bring an end to the ‘mafia regime’ in the state once we (the alliance) come to power. Our motto is to bring Punjab back on track.”As an example, Nadda said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had constituted a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the 1984 riots. "Today, all the accused are in jail,” he said.Union home minister Amit Shah, who was also present at the meeting, later tweeted saying, “The NDA, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is committed to restoring the glory of Punjab and the welfare of farmers, poor and the deprived.”Along with BJP President Shri @JPNadda Ji, met our NDA allies of Punjab, @capt_amarinder Ji and Sardar Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa Ji.NDA under the leadership of PM @NarendraModi Ji is committed to restoring the glory of Punjab and the welfare of farmers, poor and deprived. pic.twitter.com/WGNfwaDqwZIn the 2017 Punjab elections, Congress won 77 out of the 117 total seats. This landslide victory pushed the erstwhile ruling alliance between the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the BJP to third place with only 18 seats. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came in second, winning 20 seats and forming the official opposition in Punjab.However, a number of political developments in the state from then till now, including the widespread farmers' protests over three contentious agricultural laws, have resulted in shifting alliances and a reshuffle of key players ahead of the crucial polls this year.Singh had resigned as the chief minister of Punjab in 2018 owing to differences with other members of the Congress and was succeeded by Charanjit Singh Channi. The former Army captain later formed a new political party, the Punjab Lok Congress, and said he would contest the forthcoming polls as part of the NDA in alliance with the BJP.All 117 seats in the Punjab legislative assembly will go up for elections next month, with the polls to be held in a single phase on February 20. The votes will be counted on March 10, with the results being declared on the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/punjab-assembly-election/nda-seals-punjab-seat-sharing-deal-bjp-to-contest-65-seats-captain-s-party-eyes-37-101643019031492.html
24-01-2022||Patna||UP Polls: JD(U) leader seeks explanation from colleague over BJP alliance flop||PATNA: A top leader of Bihar’s ruling Janata Dal (United) or JD (U) sought an explanation on Monday from his party colleague and Union minister RCP Singh over the failure in having an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the February-March assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.“We are not blaming anybody. But he [R C P Singh] will be able to give a better reply and explain why there was no alliance. RCP was assigned the task to hold talks with the BJP. He was convinced of an alliance,” said JD (U) national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh.RCP Singh was inducted into the Union council of ministers last year even as there were other claimants for the induction from the JD (U).Rajiv Ranjan Singh said RCP Singh should be able to speak about the honesty of the BJP’s assurance as they were sure about the alliance. “RCP Singh said the BJP has asked for a list [of seats]. We gave a list of 30 seats which was handed over to [Union minister] Dharmendra Pradhan. We waited for over a month for any further communication.” He added when BJP chief JP Nadda announced the alliance partners, JD (U)’s name was missing.Rajiv Ranjan Singh said RCP Singh should make an honest assessment of the BJP’s offer as they banked on him. He ruled out any threat to the government in Bihar, which includes BJP, as JD-U has contested in several states independently.There was no immediate response from RCP Singh.
24-01-2022||Pune||Monday Musings: Undetected kidnapping case and Pune Police||Last week, when four-year-old Svarnav Chavan, son of a doctor couple, Satish and Prachi Chavan, returned safely after spending almost nine days in abduction, there was a sense of relief among many in the city. Those not just included the parents and family members of the kid, but many who had prayed every day for his release. The police too heaved a sigh of relief even as the family was hit by another tragedy the next day when the maternal aunt of four-year-old was killed in the accident near Ahmednagar while on the way to meet him.After the boy went missing, social media platforms were flooded with posts praying for his safe return. The return of the boy was as dramatic as his kidnapping. The entire episode and the alleged kidnapper still being at large, however, has posed several questions that police needs to answer. First and foremost, the police need to nab the kidnapper who is eluding arrest 12 days after the incident.As reported in Hindustan Times, one of the clues probe officials were looking at is to gather footage through the network of over 400 CCTV cameras installed by the civic body under the Smart City mission across the city.However, most CCTVs are non-operational as a result of which police officials could gather footage only from a few ones, where the alleged kidnapper is seen riding the two-wheeler with the child and another when the suspect dropped the child off at Punavle.His lack of arrest so far also points to missing ground contacts of police, whose reliance on electronic evidence including CCTV cameras has increased excessively.In the past, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad police have failed to detect some major crimes which included unresolved murder cases. The investigation into the murder of 23-year-old techie Antara Das has not reached anywhere even after five years. Das was returning home from work on the evening of December 23, 2016, when an unidentified person stabbed her to death near her office at Talawade. The person arrested by police in the case was later discharged as police could not gather substantial evidence against him.Das isn’t the only victim whose murder is yet to be brought to justice. Another techie Darshana Tongare (24), was hacked to death while she was returning to her residence in Bavdhan from work in 2010. Despite interrogating several suspects, the Pune police and Crime investigation department (CID) failed to make any breakthrough in the case.Two years before that Pune was startled to witness another gruesome crime. Suresh Alurkar, a prominent name for music lovers in Pune for his vast collection and knowledge regarding music and the shop he owned, was found dead with his throat slit. On December 14, 2008, Alurkar’s neighbour in Swapnanagari society found his body with limps tied in his flat on Karve road. In January 2010, the Deccan Gymkhana police filed a temporary closure report in the court after probing into all possibilities including family dispute, business rivalry, disputes about copyrights of the music records and even disputes over property deals. Over 310 criminals on police records were interrogated over 1,000 call records were analysed for generating leads they all turned out to be dead ends.According to yearly crime reports compiled by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) from 2016 onwards, about 750,000 complaints on an average registered under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) had to be disposed of due to lack of evidence.For multiple reasons, the police force is burdened with the job they are not supposed to be doing. Most of their energy is spent bringing order to the people. The policing in India, as mentioned by columnist Aakar Patel in his article that appeared in Mint Lounge a few years ago, is less about law than about order. This is how it has always been in a nation whose population tends to anarchy, even when under self-rule. In a country of 1.3 billion people, the order is something that is often missing and has to be forced using a mandate.This is exactly why police here are trained primarily for controlling the crowd rather than scientific investigation, a reflection of this is often seen in lower conviction rates or cases remaining undetected. Policing, as Patel argued, is carried out through “bandobast” when people are supposed to behave on their own. It’s also possibly because human behaviour, in reality, is not as rational.Yogesh Joshi can be reached at yogesh.joshi@htlive.com

A petition has also been filed in the Calcutta high court demanding the inclusion of the state's Netaji tableau at the January 26 parade in Delhi. The hearing is expected today.The tableau features a statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose to honour his role in the Indian freedom struggle.Due to the limited time and space owing to Covid-19 protocols, the Centre has selected only 12 states and union territories, and nine ministries, for the Republic Day parade this year. Chief ministers of West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala voiced against the decision after their tableaux were not selected for the parade.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee attacked the Modi government for citing no reason for summarily rejecting the tableau."We will roll out the tableau during the Republic Day parade on Red Road here (in Kolkata). You (People) will see how vibrant and creative it is, summing up the spirit of Netaji’s valour and our 75th Independence. The Centre cannot absolve itself of the injustice done to Bengal by rejecting its tableau," she had said during a speech in Kolkata.Banerjee slammed the Centre for building Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's statue in Delhi at a time when it rejected West Bengal's tableau, depicting the role of the freedom fighter. She said it highlights the indifferent attitude of the Centre towards the state.Notably, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh gave a written reply to Banerjee informing her, in fewer words, that the Central Public Works Department's float for the occasion was already featuring the same as a homage to Netaji on his 125th birth anniversary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/republic-day-2022-after-centre-s-rejection-bengal-takes-out-dress-rehearsal-of-netaji-tableau-on-kolkata-s-red-road-101643006991616.html

It is often said that a barking dog should be ignored, but if the dog barks, there is no alternative but to bark. Nana, activists will teach you the right lesson," the Pune BJP chief tweeted.Patole landed himself in a controversy after a viral news clip showed him saying that he could beat PM Modi and abuse him.He, however, later issued a clarification and said that he was referring to a local goon who shares his surname with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In the viral news clip, Patole can be heard speaking in Marathi to a group of villagers in Bhandara district. He said, "I have been in politics for the past 30 years. Being a politician, I never favoured anybody. I helped each and everyone who came to me. That's why I can hit Modi and abuse him."However, it is not clear when this video was filmed.After this video went viral on social media, several BJP leaders lashed out at the Congress party and Patole, questioning their respect and honour for the post of Prime Minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-bjp-chief-calls-nana-patole-stray-dog-on-remark-against-pm-modi-101643008755054.html
24-01-2022||Delhi||Kejriwal rolls out AAP’s poll campaign, cites party’s Delhi scorecard||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal on Monday launched his party’s campaign “Ek Mauka AAP Ko” ahead of the elections including in Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, focussing on the party’s achievements in Delhi.The campaign seeks to highlight the “good experiences” of the people of Delhi in terms of development in key sectors such as education, healthcare, power, and water supply under the AAP rule. It focusses on reaching out via social media and other platforms to people in the poll-bound states and convincing them to vote for the AAP if they want similar development in their states.Kejriwal urged the people of Delhi to make videos capturing development under his government with an appeal to those in the poll-bound states to vote for AAP. He also asked them to share the videos via social media with the people they know in the election-bound states. Kejriwal asked AAP volunteers to amplify such video messages on social media.“In the last seven years, the AAP government has done a lot of remarkable work in Delhi. People from United Nations came to visit Mohalla Clinics and the US president’s wife came to see Delhi’s schools. We are providing 24-hour free electricity to people. It was possible only because people of Delhi gave us the opportunity,” Kejriwal said.“Do you want that this good work should be replicated in other parts of the country? People of these (poll-bound) states should also get free 24-hour electricity, good roads, better schools, and better healthcare facilities.”Kejriwal said if they get an opportunity in other states, they will be able to repeat the good work there too. “Like others, we do not have crores of rupees. Our real wealth is you. If you spare some time, the people of other states will listen and our good work will spread.”After the polls, Kejriwal plans to host a dinner for around 50 Delhi residents, whose videos generate maximum views as part of the campaign.

24-01-2022||Kolkata||Covid-19: Bengal to launch neighbourhood schools to counter impact of shutdowns||KOLKATA: West Bengal’s education minister Bratya Basu will on Monday launch open-air “Paray Shikshalay” or neighbourhood schools for pre-primary and primary students even as educational institutions remain closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Officials said around eight million students will benefit from the project.Schools were shut for the first time in March 2020 due to the pandemic before they were reopened in February 2021 for classes 9 to 12. They were closed later due to the West Bengal assembly elections and the second wave of Covid-19 thereafter in summer of 2021. Schools for class 9 to 12 students resumed in November 2021 and were shut again on January 3 due to the latest surge in Covid-19 cases.“Even though the government could reopen schools for students from class 9-12 for some time in between, students studying up to class eight never went to schools after March 2020. Classes are being held online. Students have remained totally cut off from school education. This has severely affected them. Community schools could address this problem to some extent,” said an official.Supriyo Bhattacharya, state secretary of United Guardians’ Forum, said neighbourhood schools cannot be the alternative for conventional schools. He said they are meant for government school students and asked what about those in private schools.A public interest litigation was filed in the Calcutta high court last week seeking reopening of schools and colleges. The government is considering reopening higher secondary schools, colleges, and universities as the Covid-19 cases have dropped. The daily count of Covid-19 cases in the state crossed the 24,000-mark this month. On Sunday, 6980 cases were detected, taking the number of active cases to 1,3474. At least 36 people also died of the disease on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-to-launch-open-air-neighborhood-schools-for-pre-primary-primary-students-101643004787826.html

24-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality in ‘poor’ zone; Capital’s temperature expected to dip||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality was in the “poor” category on Monday morning as the mercury was likely to plunge to 7 degrees Celsius. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, the hourly Air Quality Index (AQI) was 241 at 7 am. On Sunday, the average 24-hour AQI was 202.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.On Sunday, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research said the AQI improved significantly to “moderate” due to wet deposition of particulate matter by rain. “Rain is likely to continue... leading to further improvement of AQI to lower end of ‘moderate’ or ‘satisfactory’. A dust storm originated from Gulf region headed towards Gujarat coast and parts of Maharashtra, however it is unlikely to affect the air quality of Delhi due to prevailing influence of western disturbance and associated intermittent drizzle/rain.”A maximum temperature of 16 degrees Celsius was expected on Monday. On Sunday, the maximum temperature was 14.9 degrees Celsius and the minimum 10.5 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-air-quality-in-poor-category-as-temp-expected-to-dip-101642993506927.html

Six people were killed in and 24 others wounded in the fire.The blaze erupted around 7.30am on Saturday at Sachinam Heights, a ground-plus-20-storey building located opposite Bhatia Hospital at Gowalia Tank in south Mumbai’s Tardeo area when many of the residents were still asleep. Deputy commissioner of police Sourabh Tripathi said primary information has indicated that the fire started on the 15th floor and spread upward to the 19th floor which was affected the most.A Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) official said the fire was extinguished nearly five hours later at 12.20 pm with the help of 15 fire-tending vehicles. The incident raised questions about the state of the fire-fighting equipment installed in the high-rise, he said.According to a BMC statement on Sunday, the probe committee will be headed by deputy municipal commissioner-level officer and a report has to be submitted within 15 days.The enquiry will look into three aspects: cause of fire in consultation with chief fire officer, reasons for the spread of the fire, illegal addition /alteration in the building beyond approved plans, if any, said an official familiar with the developments in the Mumbai Fire Brigade.The civic body has also started deliberations with the state government to formulate a policy on making periodic electrical audits mandatory, said an official familiar with the matter.The Maharashtra government has also assured of investigation into the fire incident.“The fire incident that occurred at the Kamala building in Mumbai’s Tardeo area will be investigated. Our guardian minister of Mumbai Suburban Aaditya Thackeray and Mumbai City guardian minister Aslam Shaikh will look into it,” Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said in a statement.Officials of the Mumbai Fire Brigade said they have jointly conducted a meeting with the state electrical inspector, along with BMC officials, to conduct periodic electrical safety audits of the buildings to help reduce the incidents of fires due to defective electric circuit“The general opinion is that residential societies should be asked to conduct electrical audits on the lines of fire audit currently conducted every six months. The electrical inspector can make an electrical audit mandatory once in a year or whatever period is decided, and later the compliance report with us. We will also give them inputs in formulating such a policy considering this will bring down the fire incidents in the city,” said Hemant Parab, Chief Fire Officer of the Mumbai Fire Brigade.“In many of the fire incidents we have seen that electric wires that are defected are either the cause of the fire or contribute towards the spreading of fire. Hence, we need to fix this issue for which we will require periodic electrical audits,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/probe-begins-in-mumbai-building-fire-8-still-critical-101642975339005.html

24-01-2022||Chandigarh||Covid shadow: Chandigarh airport’s footfall drops by 40% in two weeks||Amid the surge in Covid-19 cases in the region, the Chandigarh International Airport has recorded a 40% drop in its footfall in the past two weeks.With the number of daily fliers declining, various airlines have curtailed their operations. Out of the total of 38 flights at the airport, 10 have not operated for a week.According to Rakesh Dembla, chief executive officer, Chandigarh International Airport Limited, while the airport had a daily footfall of around 10,000 till January 10, it had now dipped to around 6,000.“Some airlines have reduced their flights due to the current situation. Last year, we had incurred a loss of nearly ₹40 crore on various accounts due to the pandemic and lockdown,” he said.Vaneet Sharma, director, Sheetal Travels, Sector 17, said, “Currently, most people are travelling only for work. Families that had planned winter vacations have either cancelled or deferred their trips due to the third wave and restrictions.”Amid the drop in demand, even the last-minute fares of popular domestic sectors had gone down by 10-15%, he added.The airport’s main source of earnings is the aeronautical revenue, wherein it charges ₹800 per passenger from the airlines. For instance, a Delhi-bound flight with 80% occupancy fetches the airport around ₹65,000. The other sources of income are retail shops, office spaces, vehicle parking and advertisements.Only Sharjah flight passengers being testedAt present, the Mohali health authorities are testing only international passengers for Covid-19 at the airport. While the Dubai flight has not resumed yet, the Sharjah flight is operating twice a week.“We are testing only international passengers, twice a week. Domestic passengers are tested randomly,” said Harmandeep Kaur, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Mohali.No visitor pass till January 30In view of Republic Day, the airport authorities will not be providing visitor passes till January 30. Dembla said the passes will not be issued due to security reasons, as directed by higher authorities.
24-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: 62.8mm rain in 24 hours makes January wettest of all time||With 62.8mm rain between Saturday night and Sunday, Chandigarh recorded its wettest January of all time, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).As per IMD records for Chandigarh, maintained since 1953, following the showers in the past 24 hours, the city had recorded 181.5mm rain in January, with a week still left. Before this, at 166.6 mm, the highest rainfall in January was recorded in 1983. Till January 23, 22.9mm is considered normal rainfall for January, making the 181.5mm rain so far this month eight times higher than the average. The 62.8mm recorded in this 24-hour period is also the highest in January since the 59.2mm showers on January 7, 2017.Higher rain than any monsoon month last yearInterestingly, showers in January 2022 have exceeded the rain received in any of the monsoon months in 2021, when 129.9mm rain was recorded in June, 128.6mm in July and 168.3mm in August. September 2021, which was the wettest month of the year, had slightly more rain at 176.8mm, although, with a week still left, January may cross this mark too.Speaking on the excess rain in January this year, IMD Chandigarh director Manmohan Singh said, “Rainfall in January is dependent on western disturbances (WDs). While January usually sees two to three WDs in the entire month, this year, two to three very strong WDs have already affected the city, along with an equal number of feeble systems, which brought trace rainfall (less than 0.1mm).” He added that earlier this month, two strong WDs, which arrived in quick succession, were also fed moisture from the Arabian Sea as well as the Bay of Bengal due to formation of low-pressure areas. “The confluence of moisture-laden winds from Arabian Sea with WDs also contributed to the above normal rain seen on Sunday,” Singh said.Light rain expected todayWith system having mostly passed the region, only light rain is expected on Monday morning, after which the rain will stop for now. “Thereon, we expect moderate to dense fog in the city for the next few days, especially in the morning, which can lead to the maximum temperature dropping below normal and leading to cold day conditions. With the cloud cover clearing up, the minimum temperature may also dip by 4 to 6 degrees. Meanwhile, another WD is likely to affect the region around January 30, but it’s too early to say whether it will lead to any rainfall,” the IMD director said.Tree causes damage in Sector 20Along with the heavy rain on Sunday, winds up to 25km per hours were also blowing in the city. Due to the winds and rain, a tree fell down near the Dhobighat in Sector 20 around 9.20am on Sunday. This damaged a shed, along with the boundary wall of the dhobighat, but the workers escaped injury.Meanwhile, city’s maximum temperature plunged from 16°C on Saturday to 12°C on Sunday, 8.3 degrees below normal. On the other hand, the minimum temperature went up from 9.8°C to 10.7°C, 5.1 notches above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh628mm-rain-in-24-hours-makes-january-wettest-of-all-time-101642974912693.html

The leaders, who had sought that Mukesh Gandhi, a veteran BJP leader, be picked for the Dera Bassi ticket, have handed over their resignations to district BJP president Sushil Rana. They include mandal presidents, state executive members, district executive members, and members of the Kisan BJP cell, BC morcha, SC morcha, kisan morcha, yuva morcha, minority morcha and Uttarakhand cell morcha.A realtor based in Dera Bassi, Sanjeev Khanna, 57, has been a state executive committee member of BJP’s Punjab unit since December 2020, apart from being an RSS activist.Shiv Kumar Tony, mandal president, Dera Bassi, who was among those who resigned, said the BJP leadership totally ignored the local leaders before declaring the candidate. “Mukesh Gandhi, who was a deserving candidate, has been left out and the ticket has been given in exchange for money,” he alleged.Rajeev Sharma, general secretary, BJP, Mohali, who also resigned, said their requests to the high command were completely ignored. “More than 60 local leaders have resigned. We will remain with the BJP, but will not support the candidate,” he said.Gandhi, a strong contender for the Dera Bassi ticket, said he had been neglected despite being with the BJP since 1985: “I will hold a meeting with my supporters to decide the next course of action.” Meanwhile, party’s pick Khanna said the resentment among some leaders will be sorted out and the BJP will win the seat with a thumping majority.Khanna has been fielded against Shiromani Akali Dal’s two-time MLA NK Sharma and Aam Aadmi Party’s Kuljeet Singh Randhawa.Congress has not nominated its candidate yet, though Deepinder Singh Dhillon, who finished second in the 2017 elections, and Amit Bawa Saini are the frontrunners.The Dera Bassi assembly constituency has always remained a stronghold of the SAD under former minister late Captain Kanwaljit Singh, with the party triumphing consistently for the past three decades.NK Sharma won the elections in 2012 and 2017, beating Congress’ Deepinder Singh Dhillon on both occasions.But in the civic body elections held in February last year, the Congress routed out the SAD from all three civic bodies in the constituency – Dera Bassi, Lalru, and Zirakpur.

These measures have been taken on 26 parameters very intensively. It is also because Delhi has always been a target for terrorists or anti-social elements.

We are receiving such inputs from the public and then we cross-check them,” Asthana said.He also added that a detailed advisory about traffic diversions and arrangements has already been issued.Anti-terror measures were intensified in the city after an improvised explosive device, containing RDX and ammonium nitrate, was found at Ghazipur flower market on January 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-27k-cops-deployed-ahead-of-r-day-delhi-cp-101642973378930.html
24-01-2022||Chandigarh||Guest column | Clearing the air on Chandigarh Golf Club elections||For well over half a century, the Chandigarh Golf Club (CGC) has had a proud tradition of being a democratically-run institution, committed to its core function: promotion of the sport of golf.Successive managing committees, elected over the years by its 1,800 members, have steadfastly upheld the club’s constitution in letter and spirit, and consistently raised the bar in management standards, making it one of the country’s finest golf institutions that has groomed generations of eminent international and national golf prodigies. The annual election cycle, which is the integral part of the club’s annual general meeting (AGM), however, was disrupted by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 and a new management committee was elected in January 2021.Since the Covid situation was under control in December last, the incumbent governing council lost no time in setting the ball rolling on holding the next AGM-cum-election on January 30, 2022.Unfortunately and unexpectedly, the third wave surged early this month, resulting in the UT administration bringing in restrictions again, leading to deferment of the club polls.Of late, a few members have approached me expressing disappointment and apprehension in the rumours, falsehoods and gossip being spread regarding the AGM-cum-election, which can potentially bring disrepute and disharmony to the club. That makes it extremely important to clear the air about the current factual position. Rulebook followed to a teeElection is only one part of the agenda of the club’s AGM as specified in Rules 47 (b), 51 (a) and 70 (a) (iv) of the club’s Rules and Regulations.In accordance with Rules 72 and 4, notice for the AGM-cum-election, to be held on January 30, 2022, was issued on December 26, last year.Brig JS Phoolka was appointed as the returning officer and the AGM-cum-election process was set in motion. As per Rule 46, the election process was to be supervised by a five-member standing committee, appointed at the last AGM under the chairmanship of Lt-Gen Depinder Singh (retd) and including senior members Virender Sharma (past vice-president), RS Mann (retired IAS officer and past president), Rajiv Atma Ram (senior advocate) and BC Gupta (retired IAS officer).As per Rule 78, the minimum quorum for constituting a valid AGM is 10% of the total resident permanent members; this figure currently stands at 132.Outdoor gatherings capped at 100On January 6, 2022, due to the rising Covid cases, an order was passed by the Chandigarh administration, limiting outdoor gatherings for any purpose to a maximum of 100 people with effect from January 7.Cognizant of this order and in the interest of the club members’ safety, the returning officer wrote to the standing committee, seeking postponement of the AGM and related election process.The standing committee deliberated on the matter and whilst agreeing with the returning officer recommended (a) immediate postponement of the AGM-cum-election with a direction to restart the process as soon as restrictions are eased and (b) the existing managing committee should continue as usual in the interim.An emergency managing committee, on January 7, accepted these recommendations.UT nod awaitedIn view of the new situation, I have written to the UT administration seeking permission to hold the AGM-cum-election at the earliest feasible date and a response is awaited.A few members have suggested that the club should consider electronic or other forms, and have also referred to the holding of five state assembly elections.However, the managing committee can only function under the aegis of the memorandum of association, and rules and regulations of the Chandigarh Golf Club, which clearly establish the procedure to be followed and the restrictions imposed by the Chandigarh administration, which are applicable to us as a responsible and reputed institution of the UT.Any alteration of rules and procedures is not within the ambit of the managing committee which, nevertheless, remains steadfastly committed to upholding the democratic spirit enshrined in the club constitution in the best interests of this premier institution.(The writer is the president of the Chandigarh Golf Club.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-clearing-the-air-on-chandigarh-golf-club-elections-101642971429290.html

24-01-2022||Noida||Noida STF arrests three members of a gang for impersonating in UPTET in Meerut||The Noida Special Task Force (STF) arrested three members of a gang on Sunday for their alleged involvement in impersonating in the Uttar Pradesh Teachers Eligibility Test (UPTET) in Meerut.The suspects were identified as Monu Prajapati (mastermind), 25, Anil Kumar (candidate), 23, and Raja Tomar (solver), 23 -- residents of Baraut, Bulandshahr and Baghpat, said police.  Raj Kumar Mishra, additional superintendent of police, Noida-STF, said that police received a tip that some men would impersonate as candidates and appear for the UPTET in Meerut.“The Noida-STF team conducted a search and arrested three people from the exam centre in Meerut. Police recovered an Aadhaar card, one OMR sheet, one marksheet, ₹1,690 in cash from their possession,” Mishra said, adding that Prajapati revealed during interrogation that he had called the two people for impersonating in the exam.“Prajapati is a Class XII pass out. He had joined coaching for a competitive exam after his schooling in Baraut in 2016, where he met a person named Shahnewaz. Shahnewaz, who was involved in fraudulent activities, promised Prajapati to facilitate a job in Indian railways and cheated him of ₹2.5 lakh,” Mishra added.  However, Prajpati failed to get a job and demanded his money back, police said, adding that Shahnewaz then engaged him in fraudulent activities and asked him to fetch candidates in the racket.  Mishra also said that Prajapati had met Kumar at a coaching centre and took ₹2.5 lakh from him to facilitate a government job. “However, Kumar failed to get the job as promised. Prajapati then promised that he would engage a solver and pass the UPTET on his behalf. Prajapati then engaged Tomar for the job and promised him ₹50,000,” he said.A case was registered against the three suspects under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) in Meerut on Sunday.“The suspects were produced before a court and sent to judicial custody,” Mishra said.Police have launched a search to nab Shahnewaz, who is absconding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/three-persons-arrested-for-impersonating-in-up-tet-exam-101642970824549.html

24-01-2022||Delhi||A stall is born||The large counter is stacked with very many egg cartons. A steel tray is serried with green chili and onion pakoris. Another tray is packed with bread pakoras. The adjacent platter is crammed with pooris. The plastic packets of fen and toasty rusks are plopped upon each other into a hill. The chipped pan for chai is atop an unlit burner. The pan is cold on touch.This is a new destination by the roadside. Name—Shyam Nashta Corner. Owner—Radhe Shyam Saini.In a time when the coronavirus pandemic is disrupting lives and professions, Mr Saini is adjusting to the odds by launching a fresh start. “I began about a month back,” he says. The stall is perched on the side of a road snaking up to Gurugram railway station, a short jog away. At this moment in the afternoon, it is the only such establishment to be seen on this portion of the pave. In the pre-pandemic era, and also in some of the easy-going months sandwiched between the second and the third wave, the lane was choc-a-bloc with food carts, selling meals from plain parathas to elaborate biryanis. In fact, the cart stands on the spot where a very friendly elderly man operated a coffee stall—his unique selling point was his instant coffee (so rare for a street) served in kulhar (doubly rare). That stall became history with the first lockdown.Mr Saini has no inkling of that landmark of the past. In a way, he too is a landmark of the past, but of another place. He earlier carried on with his street food living in Daulatabad, “but I was no longer doing well there, so I moved out.” Glancing towards the rail station’s direction, he draws hope from those would-be regulars who might restart commuting by train daily from Gurugram to adjacent towns once the pandemic eases. “I hope they will become my customers.” Mr Saini himself is a native of nearby Rewari but have been in the Millennium City for some years.The wider area is not absolutely deserted of street entrepreneurs. A chhole bhathure cart is standing across the road, along with a tikki stall in the distance. One cart is decked with handkerchiefs, masks, belts and soaps. A couple more wheeled stalls can be sighted, in addition to a watch repairer’s kiosk (sheltering a dog).The scene at Mr Saini’s is not looking promising. There are no customers, and the cart is loaded with just too much food. But he is not nervous. He explains that he prepares fresh snacks immediately after his “routine” midday break, and that the day’s earlier stock finishes by noon. “Somebody or the other will arrive sooner or later… people have been coming to me.” He turns to look at both sides, and freezes his gaze towards the bread pakoras. Soon, a masked man approaches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/a-stall-is-born-101642970155518.html
24-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab assembly elections: Kamaldeep Saini is PLC candidate from Kharar||Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) has declared Kamaldeep Saini, 46, as its candidates from the Kharar assembly constituency for the Punjab assembly elections scheduled on February 20. Former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Sunday announced the PLC candidates from 22 constituencies. Saini is the former president of the district youth Congress and is currently vice-chairman of National Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks Federation and general secretary in-charge (organisation), Punjab Lok Congress. SAD has picked realtor Ranjit Singh Gill, 57, as its candidate, while Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has fielded Punjabi singer Anmol Gagan Mann, 31. Congress is yet to declare its candidate from Kharar. Among the front-runners for the Congress ticket are former cabinet minister Jagmohan Singh Kang, Mohali District Planning Board chairman Vijay Sharma Tinku, senior advocate Natrajan Kaushal and Youth Congress senior vice-president Jaswinder Singh Jassi. With Kharar being the hometown of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, stakes are high in the semi-urban constituency, located on National Highway-21. Part of Mohali district, Kharar was declared an assembly constituency in 2012. In the 2017 Assembly elections, AAP’s Kanwar Sandhu had won from the seat by a margin of nearly 2,000 votes, defeating Congress’ Jagmohan Singh Kang. But, in November 2018, Sandhu, a journalist-turned-politician, along with Bholath MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira, was suspended from the party for “anti-party activities”. Though Khaira later resigned from the AAP and the assembly, Sandhu is still with the party, but has not been active in the constituency. During the Kharar municipal council elections in February last year, AAP won only one of the 27 seats. The Congress won 10, the SAD eight and independent candidates also grabbed eight seats. 
24-01-2022||Noida||Greater Noida: Higher compensation for land key issue for farmers this election||Ahead of the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, farmers in Jewar are in talks with the authorities for land compensation and mega industrial projects, which are the key issues for them as their land is being acquired for the Noida international airport and other developmental projects in the area.They are demanding higher land compensation from political parties seeking votes in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, which is scheduled to be held from February 10 to March 7 in seven phases. Polls are to be conducted in the first phase on February 10 in Gautam Budh Nagar’s three assembly constituencies -- Noida, Jewar and Dadri.Jewar, one of the three assembly seats of Gautam Budh Nagar, has grabbed attention in the polls because of the Noida international airport project, which is being developed along the Yamuna Expressway.Farmers in villages, where land acquisition is under process for the airport project, have been demanding higher land compensation and better rehabilitation facilities from the state government in this election season.“Political leaders from different parties have been visiting our villages, and appealing to the people for showing support to them. Our agenda is very clear... The party or candidate, whoever will assure us higher compensation for the land acquired by the authority for developmental projects here, will win our support. The Uttar Pradesh government is giving ₹2,500 per square metre for our land, which is two times the rate set by the government in power. Our demand is four times the (circle) rate set by the government,” said Ajay Pratap Singh, a farmer from Dayanatpur village.  The state government has acquired and handed over 1,334 hectares of land in Jewar to the Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL) -- a 100% subsidiary of Zurich Airport International AG, which was incorporated in 2021 as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to develop the Jewar airport project.The agency has started works on the ground to develop two runways of the airport. According to the concession agreement, the government has to provide 1,363 hectares of land to the subsidiary adjacent to the existing airport site for the third runway and further expansion. The process to acquire 1,363 hectares more land is underway.Six villages -- Karauli Bangar, Dayanatpur, Kureb, Ranhera, Mundhera and Nagla Hukum Singh village -- falling under the project area will be used for setting up the third runway, and a commercial maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) of aircraft centre for the project, and the land acquisition process is underway.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the ruling party in the state, has fielded Thakur Dhirendra Singh, sitting MLA from Jewar; Samajwadi Party-Rashtriya Lok Dal alliance fielded former MP Avtar Singh Bhadana; Congress fielded Manoj Chaudhary, a first-timer; and Bahujan Samaj Party fielded Narendra Dedha, a journalist, from this crucial seat.Most of the farmers said that the “main fight for this seat is between the SP-RLD alliance and the BJP”.Meanwhile, many farmers, who gave land for the first phase development of the airport project, expressed happiness with the land compensation and other benefits. “We are happy with the land compensation provided by the government. The airport and other big industrial projects such as Apparel Park, mobile manufacturing units, and food parks among others have pushed the property’s rate to a new high. Due to the development in the area, our children will easily get jobs and lead a better life here in the coming days, so we will support the BJP and local MLA,” said Devdutt Sharma, a farmer from Banwaribas village.Aarif Khan, a farmer from Nagla Sharif, said, “The airport project is a big one, and it will change this region completely. But we will also vote keeping in mind other developmental projects in the region, and the behaviour of the sitting MLA. He has built roads, colleges, renovated schools and worked in all fields for improvement in this region. So, we are with him.”  The SP-RLD alliance, the Congress and the BSP candidates have been assuring the farmers that they will ensure higher compensation and huge benefits to their families. “The farmers have been victims of injustice as the current compensation rate is very low. We will do justice to the farmers if elected to power,” Avtar Singh Bhadana has been assuring farmers during meetings.Congress candidate Manoj Chaudhary said, “Farmers are unhappy about the way the government has demolished their houses to make way for the airport project, without even providing them houses. We will not let it happen in villages where the land acquisition process is underway.”BJP MLA Thakur Dhirendra Singh, who has been conducting door-to-door campaigns ahead of the polls, said, “The airport, Film City, Medical Device Park, colleges, Skill institutions and Food Park are big projects that have come up in Jewar in the past five years. Apart from this, we have worked for all the communities in the region without any discrimination, which is why the people are with us. Farmers are happy with the land compensation provided by the government. If anyone is unhappy, we will address their issues.”

Some of the machinery will be replaced/repaired, as per requirement.The AAP contends that the MC is going against its own resolutions passed last year, wherein an IIT Roorkee report had stated the machinery cannot be repaired and must be replaced.“The report clearly stated that even after repair and maintenance of existing machinery, etc the existing plant will at best handle 60 to 65 TPD,” said senior AAP leader Chandermukhi Sharma.Defending the proposal, mayor Sarabjit Kaur, said, “The solid waste management needs of the city till the upgrade takes place requires the existing plant to be used to its full potential. For this, repair work is needed. This proposal couldn’t be brought last year because of election code of conduct.”Notably, the January 8 mayoral elections had witnessed large-scale ruckus in the House, after one AAP vote was declared invalid. AAP has approached the Punjab and Haryana high court demanding quashing of the polls
24-01-2022||Noida||UP elections: State’s deputy CM Sharma rakes up Kairana in Dadri poll campaign||Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister and BJP leader Dr Dinesh Sharma was in Greater Noida on Sunday to campaign for the party’s Dadri candidate Tejpal Nagar. He took part in a door-to-door campaign in Alpha-1 sector and held an election meeting with voters at a private college in Knowledge Park. Speaking to the media during his campaign, Sharma raised the issue of “palayan” (Hindu exodus)” during the Samajwadi Party (SP) rule and claimed that under the BJP, UP has been transformed into a state where development is the key. “UP has changed now. This is not a state of mass exoduses but that of development now. The state does not have a place for lawlessness and has become a place where employment, health and education are given importance,” said Sharma. “The elimination of regionalism, family politics and mafia-rule are BJP’s objectives, which fights polls on agendas of development”, Sharma added. Sharma was referring to the 2016 allegations of a few BJP leaders that there was an exodus of Hindus from the Muslim-dominated town of Kairana in Shamli district. However, a five-member team of Hindu seers in June 2016 (during the SP government) contradicted the BJP’s claim of an exodus but said there was an atmosphere of fear in the town because of criminals. Sharma’s statement comes a day after Union home minister and BJP stalwart Amit Shah was in Kairana to campaign for the upcoming polls. Sharma further said that the Opposition is giving tickets to their family members and tainted leaders. “The people of UP have tasted the benefits of development. Now, there is no space for caste-based or communal politics. There is a rising fear in the public that mafia and criminal elements will come back again as some parties have fielded criminals or their family members as candidates,” he said. Sharma was apparently referring to SP candidate from the Kairana seat, Nahid Hasan, who was arrested on January 15 by the UP Police under the Gangsters Act. Later, SP gave the Kairana ticket to Hasan’s younger sister Iqra. Sharma said, “There are criminals who are openly supporting some parties, indirectly warning people that if they do not support them, they will create an atmosphere of terror. But it will never happen, the entire state has changed under BJP rule”. Sharma added that rival parties, including the Congress, the SP, and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), will not be able to get even 100 seats in the upcoming polls. “I feel western UP will break its own previous record by supporting the BJP with more votes. We will get over 50 per cent of the votes and break our own record,” said Sharma. On Priyanka Gandhi Vadra denying she is Congress’ chief ministerial candidate, Sharma said he need not say much about it as numerous TV surveys are forecasting a mere 3-7 seats for her party. “Their combined figures (Opposition parties) in the upcoming polls will not reach three-digit,” he said. Sharma further alleged that earlier, political parties in UP fought elections on communal issues and polarised minority voters, even winning elections in the past. Dadri in western UP’s Gautam Budh Nagar district goes to the polls on February 10. BJP has fielded sitting MLA Nagar once again from the seat, which has 15 other candidates in fray. According to Vijay Bhati, BJP’s Gautam Budh Nagar district president, the campaigning was carried out by following Covid-19 norms. “At the election meeting held in a private college in Greater Noida, only 70 party workers and key voters were present in the hall, maintaining social distancing while the deputy chief minister’s door-to-door campaign was also carried out in accordance with guidelines issued by the Election Commission,” he said. Incidentally, BJP candidate Nagar was campaigning in Greater Noida west and did not accompany Sharma. Responding to Sharma’s allegations, SP’s Dadri candidate Raj Kumar Bhati said, “A number of sitting MLAs and leaders of the BJP have criminal cases pending against them. As they are in power, they are not pulled up and point fingers at us. However, the voters are smart enough to judge and the poll results on March 10 will say for itself”. Political analysts say that by highlighting the Kairana “exodus”, BJP is trying to revive the memories of the Muzaffarnagar riots. Before the 2014 general elections, the riots in August and September of 2013 between Jats and Muslims in Muzaffarnagar had left 60 people dead and displaced nearly 50,000. “Recently, during the farmers’ agitation, Jat and Muslim communities have come together, and this poses a serious challenge for the BJP. In this context, it becomes necessary for the party to revive the memories of the Muzaffarnagar riots in order to win the elections”, said Hilal Ahmad, associate professor, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), New Delhi, who had also conducted a study on the Muzaffarnagar riots. Psephologist and CSDS professor Sanjay Kumar said, “By raking up the Kairana issue, the BJP is trying to convey to the Hindu voters that the party cares for them while the Opposition does not. The bigger narrative that they are trying to put across the state, especially western UP where Muslims are in larger numbers, is that if the SP is voted to power, minorities will have a larger role to play”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-elections-state-s-deputy-cm-sharma-rakes-up-kairana-in-dadri-poll-campaign-101642969324285.html

24-01-2022||Noida||Sahibabad: UP CM Adityanath drums up support for BJP with door-to-door campaigns||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath conducted a door-to-door campaign in Sahibabad assembly constituency and held two indoor meetings with eminent persons on Sunday as part of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) campaign for the first phase of the UP assembly elections scheduled on February 10. While UP deputy chief minister Dr Dinesh Sharma was on a campaign trail in neighbouring Greater Noida, Adityanath himself led the campaign in the two key assembly seats of Sahibabad and Ghaziabad. Sahibabad seat has 10,12,154 eligible voters, while Ghaziabad assembly constituency has 4,69,505 voters according to the latest electoral rolls. The BJP has fielded all its five sitting MLAs from each of the five seats in Ghaziabad. From Sahibabad, the party has fielded Sunil Sharma, who is given ticket for the fourth consecutive time while UP minister (health) Atul Garg will contest his second consecutive election (third overall) from the Ghaziabad seat. Sources in the party said that there was dissent among BJP workers and some of its leaders because tickets were to the sitting MLAs. In several cases, some of those opposing the ticket distribution have filed their nomination papers as Independents, while some have also joined the opposition parties and secured a ticket, like in case of KK Shukla, who is contesting the Ghaziabad seat on a ticket given by the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). Adityanath, who is also BJP’s star campaigner, chose Sanjay Colony in Sahibabad and a slum cluster in Vijay Nagar to drum up support for his party. There was a heavy rush at Rajiv Colony with hundreds of locals arriving to get a glimpse of the chief minister, who arrived with Ghaziabad MP and Union minister General VK Singh (retired). People showered flower petals on Adityanath and handed over memorandums, highlighting their concerns to him. “There was a huge gathering as Adityanath came afoot for the door-to-door campaign and women wished him good luck while showering flower petals. Our locality has a dominant population of Valmikis and comprises about 20,000 votes that falls under Sahibabad seat,” said Tilak Ram, a local who was elated after the chief minister visited his house. In Sahibabad, BJP’s Sunil Sharma faces arch-rival Amarpal Sharma who is contesting this time on SP ticket and also against debutant Sangeeta Tyagi from the Congress, Chhavi Yadav from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Ajit Kumar Pal from the BSP. In Ghaziabad seat, UP minister Atul Garg faces BSP’s KK Shukla, SP’s Vishal Verma, Sushant Goyal of the Congress and Lalit Yadav from the AAP as key opponents. BJP office-bearers denied that dissent would have any impact on the poll campaign of the ruling party. “There is no dissent in the party and in the coming days you will see that some people will withdraw their nominations. Their issues have been taken up and discussed. Adityanath himself holding two meetings and door-to-door campaigns in Ghaziabad shows the significance of the district for the party. His visit will infuse a lot of energy among party cadres,” said Sanjeev Sharma, president of the BJP’s city unit. Political experts said that Adityanath holding a series of poll campaigns and meetings in a single day in Ghaziabad holds importance. “Speeches made from key areas such as Mathura, Varanasi, Gorakhpur and western UP hold a lot of importance and have a state-wide impact. His visit is significant as Ghaziabad district has five seats at stake for the party,” said Dr Virendra Singh, associate professor (political science) from MMH College, Ghaziabad. On Saturday, Union home minister Amit Shah campaigned in Kairana in western UP’s Shamli district and addressed small groups and also took part in a door-to-door campaign. “The door-to-door campaigns are the best form of meeting voters and garnering their support. This practice of late has reduced considerably unlike the way it used to happen during previous elections. It is one of the best forms of campaigning, which directly impacts voters. It will come in handy as rallies and roadshows have been banned for now due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said KK Sharma, associate professor (history) from MM College, Modinagar.

Sharma, a leader of the masses, who always worked for the weaker sections of society and was called ‘Sher-e-Poonch’ was deeply revered by the people from all communities.He is survived by his wife Parveen Kumari, brothers advocate Sunil Sharma (chairman of the municipal committee, Poonch), and Dr Sushil Sharma (head of the cardiology department at the government super speciality hospital in Jammu), two sons Kirtipal Sharma and Dr Udeshpal Sharma and two daughters Neetu Sharma and Dr Chaya Sharma.Poonch SSP Dr Rohit Baksotra said that the PDP leader died of cardiac arrest around 2.30 am on Sunday.He informed that the mortal remains of the late leader were consigned to flames around 4 pm in Poonch. Sharma was considered a veteran voice of the PDP.In March last year, he was among 14 leaders named by PDP president Mehbooba Mufti in the 14-member Political Affairs Committee (PAC).J&K PDP wrote on Twitter, “With great grief and remorse we announce the demise of a senior leader, ex-MLC and PAC member Yashpal Sharma.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the members of the family in this hour of grief. #RIP.”Sharma along with his family had migrated from PoJK and had settled in Poonch.Sharma had contested his first election for assembly from Poonch Haveli in 1983 as an independent candidate and later won elections for municipal committee Poonch.Yashpal Sharma was a close confidante of PDP founder Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.In 2012-13, he was nominated as a Member of Legislative Council (MLC) by the PDP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/veteran-pdp-leader-yashpal-sharma-cremated-in-jammu-and-kashmir-s-poonch-101642968544476.html
24-01-2022||Delhi||ED set to arrest Delhi minister Jain ahead of Punjab polls, says Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday told reporters he has learned that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is likely to arrest a senior minister in his cabinet, Satyendar Jain, ahead of the Punjab assembly polls, and said that the alleged move will be another example of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) using federal agencies to target political rivals.Kejriwal, whose government has been at odds with the BJP over several issues and government schemes, did not elaborate how he or his party became aware of this information.“We have learned from our sources that in the coming few days, before the Punjab election, ED is going to arrest Satyendar Jain (Delhi health minister). I welcome ED. The Centre got Jain raided twice before, but found nothing. Now if they want to come again and raid, they are welcome,” Kejriwal said in a digital press conference.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief went on to add that leaders of his party have nothing to fear from any agency because they have not done anything wrong.“If BJP-led central government wants to send ED, CBI, Income Tax, Delhi Police, or any other agency, they can go ahead and send them. If they want to raid and arrest anyone including Bhagwant Mann (AAP’s Punjab chief ministerial candidate), they can do that. We all will be very happy to host you and will welcome you with wide smiles. We are not afraid because we have never done anything wrong,” Kejriwal said.The Enforcement Directorate declined to comment on the charge.When asked about the apprehensions raised over his possible arrest, Delhi health minister Jain said he was ready to face any action.“It is due to Punjab elections. We will not buckle down and we will fight the Punjab election with all strength. The previous raids were also conducted during Punjab elections. ED has raided my house twice in past. I welcome CBI, ED, income tax and other agencies,” said Jain, who was in Ludhiana on Sunday.Jain was on ED’s radar in 2017 in connection with an alleged money laundering case.The case was filed by CBI, which claimed that Jain could not explain the source of funds received by four companies in which he was a shareholder. Jain and his wife were alleged holders of one-third of the shares of these companies.CBI in 2018 filed a charge sheet in the case against Satyendar Jain, his wife Poonam Jain and business associates in the disproportionate assets case. The agency said the extent of disproportionate assets amounted to ₹1.47 crore.Kejriwal said this was not the first time that AAP leaders were being targeted.“In the past, raids were conducted against him (Jain), Manish Sisodia (deputy CM), and other AAP ministers, but nothing was found. Our 21 MLAs were arrested, but in the end all of them came out clean through the court. Jain will also come out on bail within 5-10 days. They won’t have a single proof for the courts to see,” Kejriwal said.Talking about the recent raids against Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s nephew Bhupinder Singh Honey, he said that leaders of his party will not get “flustered” in the way the Punjab chief minister got.“Channi has been making a spectacle out of the raids conducted on his relatives because he knows he is the wrong one there. Everyone by now has seen the mountains of cash he was sitting on that got exposed during the raids.The people of Punjab are in utter shock that something like this could have panned out in a mere 111 days,” said Kejriwal.ED had on Wednesday said that it seized cash amounting to over ₹10 crore, including about ₹8 crore from the house of Channi’s nephew during raids conducted in connection with an anti-money laundering investigation against illegal sand-mining operations in the poll-bound state.Calling the raids “political motivated”, Channi on Wednesday denied any link with the cash allegedly recovered from his Honey’s residence.Channi also said on Friday that he would file a defamation suit against Kejriwal for making insinuations linking him to the cash recovered by ED.BJP leader and leader of Opposition in the Delhi assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, said Kejriwal’s allegations were nothing but a political stunt.“Kejriwal accuses the central investigative agencies of working on the directions of the central government, but when the same agencies carry out raids against Kejriwal’s political rivals, he hails the raids. Kejriwal has realised that he is going to lose the assembly elections, so he is trying to play an emotional card to gather sympathy. If Satyendar Jain has done nothing wrong, then why is the AAP government making a hue and cry?” Bidhuri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ed-set-to-arrest-delhi-minister-jain-ahead-of-punjab-polls-says-kejriwal-101642968247127.html

As per the India Meteorological Department Haryana had received 12mm rainfall on Sunday, of which Panchkula received the maximum rainfall at 35mm, followed by 34mm in Yamunanagar, 31mm in Ambala, 31mm in Kurukshetra, 20mm in Karnal, 14mm each in Panipat and Jind, 13mm in Rohtak and 11mm in Jind. Kurukshetra’s Ladwa sub-division has received 52mm rainfall, Thanesar 38mm, Ismailabad 32 mm and Babain 24mm rainfall on Sunday.“Around four acres of my paddy field has been submerged and more rain has caused waterlogging. The crop will be destroyed in the next couple of days,’ said a farmer, Naseeb Singh, Duddi village, Kurukshetra.A mustard grower, Nirmal Singh of Henori village, Karnal, said, “My crop had been flattened during the previous rainfall, and more rain is sure to impact the yield. Even, the potato growers are staring at huge losses. “We are already getting poor prices, but frequent spells of unseasonal rainfall have damaged six acres of produce, which was ready for harvest,” Krishan Kumar of Shahbad, Kurukshetra said.As per data collated before January 10, around 50-100% loss was reported on 2,000 hectares of wheat crops, 2,500 hectare of mustard and 100 hectare of pulses in Kurukshetra district. Karnal Haryana agriculture department deputy director Aditya Dabas said water stagnation is harmful for mustard and wheat and the agriculture department will collect reports of damage to crops due to waterlogging.A special girdawari (crop inspection) has been ordered by the revenue department and the agricultural department has also done its own survey of damage to crops during this month to compensate the aggrieved farmers.Additional chief secretary to Haryana agriculture and farmers’ welfare department Sumita Misra said fresh directions have been issued to the district authorities to send the reports of loss to the revenue department.
24-01-2022||Chandigarh||I’m not afraid of ED raids, says Delhi health minister Jain||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Sunday that he and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were not afraid of possible Enforcement Directorate (ED) raids on him.Canvassing in favour of AAP candidate KNS Kang in the Dakha constituency, Jain said on his party chief Arvind Kejriwal’s claim of his arrest by the ED, “We welcome them (ED). Earlier too, the agency had raided my house twice, but did not find anything. Such raids are politically motivated as the elections are around the corner.” Jain said that people of Dakha constituency had voted party leader and senior advocate HS Phoolka, “Phoolka could not continue due to certain reasons but his wishes and vision continues to guide us. Similarly, Kang has done a lot for society and particularly in the field of education.

Adityanath also lashed out at its key opponent, the Samajwadi Party (SP), contesting in alliance with the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) in western Uttar Pradesh, which goes to polls on February 10. It was Adityanath’s third visit to Ghaziabad in less than a month. He had earlier attended BJP’s ‘Jan Vishwas Yatra’ on December 25 and also took part in a Covid-19 review meeting on January 17. BJP workers said that Adityanath held a “Prabhavi Matdata Samvad” comprising key people from different groups such as resident welfare associations (RWAs), engineers, doctors and traders among others. He urged them to propagate the achievements of the ruling party during the five years of his regime. Among the key persons present at the meeting were Mahant Narayan Giri of the Dudheshwarnath Temple and Pawan Sinha, a spiritual leader. Targeting the Opposition, Adityanath drew a comparison between the SP’s return to power in 2012 and the BJP forming the government in 2017.“The first decision we took was to shutdown illegal slaughterhouses, formation of anti-Romeo squads and waiver of ₹36,000 crore of farm loans. Our decisions benefitted the ‘Gau Mata’ (cow, considered sacred by Hindus), women and farmers. When the SP came to power in 2012, the first decision they took was to drop cases against the terrorists,” Yogi told the gathering at Pandit Deen Dayal auditorium in Ghaziabad. The chief minister said that the SP allegedly provided shelter to professional mafias, and it incited a series of riots in places such as Kosi Kalan, Bulandshahr, Meerut among others and these ended only when they got a hint that the BJP was to return to power in 2017. During the 2012 assembly elections, the SP contested in 401 seats and won 224, while the BJP contested in 398 seats and won only 47. The BJP turned the tables in 2017 when it contested in 384 seats and won 312, while the SP contested in 311 and won only 47 and got voted out of power. “You celebrated Dussehra and Deepawali during the pandemic and when I inquired from the health minister, I was told that people get a sense of assurance that when Modiji (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) and Yogiji are there, Corona would not be able to harm them. During their (SP) regime, there was no Corona, but they imposed curfews. We imposed only a night curfew during this third wave... we are giving free vaccines, free tests and treatment to all without any discrimination but without any appeasement,” Adityanath said. Yogi also cited examples of the construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and development of the Kashi Vishwanath corridor project in Varanasi. “In Ghaziabad, we had seen development of the Haj House in violation of norms during the previous regime, but we gave you Kailash Mansarovar Bhawan. They stopped the Kanwar Yatras and even banned the Janmashtami celebrations. They thought only for their family, but we held a nationalist approach and thought about everyone, while respecting the faith of the people,” Adityanath said in an apparent dig at the SP. During his address, there were regular chants of “Jai Shri Ram”, “Bharat Mata ki jai” and “Har Har Mahadev” by the BJP supporters. Yogi cited the examples of the development of the War Memorial near India Gate in New Delhi and said that celebration of ‘the Samvidhan Diwas’ (Constitution Day on November 26), development of the Panch Teerth (sites related to Dr B R Ambedkar), celebration of the National Unity Day to remember the contributions of Sardar Patel in the integration of India, were due to the thought process of PM Modi. Adityanath also cited development projects such as the Ganga expressway, Jewar airport, film city, medical device park, sports university in Meerut and a civil terminal at the Hindon airport. “Their thought process was divisive and destructive while we believe in nationalism and inclusion of all communities. You just see the first two lists of candidates for the assembly election, and you will come to know about the people who got tickets. For them, the development was only restricted to the Saifai family. They promise 300 units of free electricity. One should ask them what they did when they were in power. In those days, there was no electricity,” Adityanath said. The chief minister said that people in the Opposition parties were not seen anywhere during the pandemic while BJP workers were busy trying to save lives. “A BJP government is needed in UP in order to uphold the rule of law so that history-sheeters don’t run police stations and criminals don’t get protection. Politics of appeasement should never return, and illegal properties of mafias must be bulldozed...,” Adityanath said. Meanwhile, SP office-bearers said that Adityanath himself is campaigning and making frequent visits to Ghaziabad for a reason. “He knows that the base of the BJP has shifted, and it is the SP which will form the next government. Many BJP leaders have joined the SP. We have promised 300 units of free electricity, and this will benefit the poor and middle-class people. During the pandemic, people suffered due to shortage of oxygen and there were many deaths during the second wave. The BJP workers were not seen anywhere. They know that they will lose the upcoming election,” said Rashid Malik, SP district president. Political experts said that Adityanath’s frequent visits to Ghaziabad is bound to boost BJP workers in western Uttar Pradesh. “Ghaziabad district has five seats and BJP is strong here compared to seats in Baghpat and Meerut, which are comparatively tough. Yogi wants to send a positive message in western UP, which goes to polls in the first phase. In the process, he has also targeted the SP, which is the key opponent of BJP. The frequent visits will also calm down internal dissents within the party after it gave tickets to all its sitting MLAs,” said KK Sharma, associate professor (history) from MM College at Modinagar.

Singh, a Padma Shri awardee, was centre half of the Indian team that won the 1975 Hockey World Cup and was part of India’s Olympic contingent in 1968, 1972 and 1976.“I never thought of contesting the elections but did so on PLC supremo and former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s insistence. I have had no alignment with any other political party. But it is high time to give direction to the state’s youth towards a bright future. There was a time when Punjab produced army generals and great players. But it is a thing of past now. The neighbouring Haryana is now way ahead of Punjab in sports,” he says. “To save Punjab, we have to generate employment for our youth which is migrating to western countries. We need to curb the drug menace,” added Singh, who served as a deputy commandant in the Border Security Force (BSF). He will be shifting to Sansarpur soon and will start campaigning in Nakodar, he added. Besides Ajit Pal and state cabinet minister Pargat Singh of the Congress, another former Indian hockey team captain and Olympian Surinder Singh Sodhi is also contesting from Jalandhar Cantonment seat.

24-01-2022||Chandigarh||It’s a bumpy ride on Ludhiana’s cremation ground road as repair work stopped midway||In a perfect example of a half-baked plan going awry, the carpeting work of the Cremation Ground Road in Model Town Extension has been stopped midway due to unsuitable weather conditions. The project was started by the municipal corporation in December, with an eye on assembly elections, but the work had to be suspended in January due to dip in temperatures.The result: One side of the road has been covered with premix while the other half continues to have potholes, with a height difference of at least two to three inches between both sides. Due to this, residents say driving on this stretch has become risky and several accidents have also taken place over the last few days. Preet Basant, a resident of Guru Gian Vihar, said, “In the first week of January, when I was passing through this stretch on my two-wheeler, I lost balance and fell on the road. I was fortunate that I got away with a few minor injuries, but such road conditions can also prove fatal.” He further added, “The civic body should not have started the project during cold weather conditions. If they start it, they should ensure timely completion. Authorities should not play with the lives of residents just for electoral gains.”Area councillor Harbhajan Dang, who owes allegiance to Shiromani Akali Dal, also slammed authorities for leaving the work midway. He claimed that the municipal corporation (MC) had failed to check quality of the road repair works at other places in the city too. “This (Cremation Ground) road has been crying for attention for a long time. The repair works started last month, but the authorities left it incomplete. The MC should have commenced the project a little earlier, as they knew that the cold weather conditions would hamper the work. When accidents take place, we end up facing the public ire.”“Authorities have also failed to ensure quality of repair works in other places in the city. On most roads, the bitumen starts wearing off within weeks of repair. It is a waste of public money, if substandard material is used for these projects.”MC superintending engineer Rahul Gagneja said, “We will resume the repair work on Cremation Ground Road, as soon as the temperature becomes favourable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/its-a-bumpy-ride-on-ludhiana-s-cremation-ground-road-as-repair-work-stopped-midway-101642967586048.html
24-01-2022||Chandigarh||Man thrashed over suspicion of sacrilege at Amritsar village gurdwara||A 30-year-old man was beaten up on Saturday evening over the suspicion of sacrilege attempt in a gurdwara at Bhindi Aulakh village of Ajnala sub-division in Amritsar district. The suspect, identified as Gursahib Singh of the same village, was handed over to police by the local residents. He was questioned about his ‘motive’ to enter the shrine after being caught by the villagers. Also, a video clip of the man being questioned by the residents has also surfaced on social media. In the video clip, the accused is heard saying that one Ganna told him that he would get a lot of money for tearing the Guru Granth Sahib but he rejected the offer. The man then asked him to go inside the gurdwara just to check for which he would be provided drugs, the suspect is heard saying. A case under Sections 380 (theft in a dwelling house, etc.), 454 (house trespass) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Bhindi Saidan police station against some unidentified persons on the complaint of gurdwara granthi (priest) Jarnail Singh. The complainant said he found the lock of the main gate of the hall broken when he entered the shrine around 5:30 pm. ₹4000 was stolen from the offering box that had also its lock broken, he added. Superintendent of police (SP) Jagjit Singh Walia said their investigation has suggested that it was an incident of theft. “The suspect is a drug addict. We are investigating the matter and we are looking for the other accused Ganna,” he said. Some Sikh organisations have demanded that Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings) be added to the FIR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/man-thrashed-over-suspicion-of-sacrilege-at-amritsar-village-gurdwara-101642967465473.html

The woman alleged that Bains has been roaming freely, conducting poll meetings while the police claim he is avoiding police.The woman, who has been protesting outside office of the Ludhiana police commissioner for the past few months, in her complaint to the commission mentioned that earlier she had moved court, seeking FIR against the MLA and his aides Karamjit Singh, Baljinder Kaur, Jasbir Kaur, Sukhchain Singh, Parmjit Singh and Gogi Sharma. The woman further stated that non-bailable warrants were issued by the court against Bains. On January 10, a police official appeared before the court and stated that the officer responsible for executing the proclamation proceedings is not well and sought an adjournment. She added that it suggests that the police are under political pressure for not taking action against Bains.It is learnt that a local court has already initiated proceedings against Bains to declare him a proclaimed offender as he has not responded to the warrants issued by the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-rape-victim-writes-to-ec-demanding-simarjit-bains-arrest-101642967406082.html

As I was unable to get those signed, I and some other students were denied entry to the exam centre,” Kumar said.Kumar also said that he went to the Noida Sector 30 school from Ghazipur to appear for the exam. In protest, the students briefly halted traffic movement on the adjacent road of the exam centre, however, a police team soon reached the spot and pacified the protesting students and cleared the road.A group of students at another centre in Noida Sector 25 faced similar problems.Amit Kumar, another student, said that the officials at the exam centre demanded original papers of the B.Ed for entry to the exam venue. Some students could not produce the documents and so they were barred. “Students who came after 9:30am were also denied entry,” he said.Dharmveer Singh, district inspector of schools (DIOS), Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the instructions were already being given to the students in the admit cards.“The candidates were informed to report before 9:30am. The original copy or certified copy of the mark sheet of B.Ed (Bachelor of Education)/Basic Training Course (BTC) by their college principal or a competent authority is mandatory for the UPTET exam. Non-certified photocopy is also not allowed,” he said, adding that all the candidates who met these criteria were only allowed to appear for the exam.Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), Noida,said that nearly 30 candidates at four exam centres faced the same problem in the morning. “A police team reached the spot and intervened into the matter. There were no problems in the second shift,” he said.Gautam Budh Nagar has 27 exam centres -- 11 in Noida, nine in Central Noida, and seven in Greater Noida -- where the exams were conducted in two shifts, 10am-12:30pm and 2:30pm-5pm.

Sudhir Rajpal, chief executive officer of GMDA, said, “The sustainable environment plan will focus on interventions that have to be made on a micro level in the whole metropolitan area to make all the aspects of environment like greenery, measures to reduce pollution, and water conservation, come together. It will be an integrated plan for the whole city which will be citizen centric and will be made using inputs from residents of the city.” Rajpal said that an agency will be hired soon to work on the plan. In December 2019, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), GMDA and the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) had jointly prepared a district-level environmental management plan for Gurugram. But officials said that this plan does not have specification for an urban population, and is a generic plan for the whole district. Subhash Yadav, head of GMDA’s urban environment division, said, “A district management plan is there for Gurugram but the issues and challenges of an urban area are different compared to the whole district. So, GMDA will develop an environment management plan for the urban area which will be based on the needs and demands of the population over the next 20 years. As the mobility plan has been made for 2041, we have to see what will be the environmental challenges along with it and mitigation measures will be offered.” An expression of interest to hire an agency for developing the plan will be issued by next week, said the officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gmda-to-make-environment-mgmt-plan-for-gurugram-city-in-six-months-101642967224095.html
24-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: BJP leaders’ hopes dashed as pre-poll partner Punjab Lok Congress names candidates from key seats||With Captain Amarinder Singh-led Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) releasing its first list of 22 candidates, several Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders who were eyeing tickets from Ludhiana South, Ludhiana East and Atam Nagar assembly constituencies were left dejected.Captain’s party is in alliance with the BJP for the upcoming Punjab assembly elections, which means the saffron party won’t be fielding candidates from the seats where PLC is fighting from. The PLC has named district president Jagmohan Sharma from Ludhiana East, Satinderpal Singh Tajpuri, son of a former cooperation minister in Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) government, from Ludhiana South and former SAD MLA Prem Mittal from Atam Nagar. Soon after the PLC’s announcement, several BJP workers started sharing messages on social media groups that in the past, the alliance with SAD had brought down the morale of the saffron party workers and now, it is the Captain’s party. BJP Daba Mandal president Surinder Sharma, said, “We strongly oppose the move of offering a ticket to a parachute candidate Satinderpal Singh Tajpuri. Today, a joint meeting of Dholewal, Daba and Giaspura Mandal was held in which it was decided that we will express our resentment to the party high command and ask them to review its decision. The workers are feeling neglected and have decided to not support parachute candidates.”Sources in the party said that Gurdeep Singh Gosha, former district president of the Youth Akali Dal (YAD), had deserted the SAD a few days ago and joined the BJP in hope of a ticket from Ludhiana South. With PLC announcing its candidate from this seat, Gosha is now vying to contest from Ludhiana North. But it won’t be a cakewalk for Gosha as BJP’s state vice-president Parvin Bansal, general secretary Jeevan Gupta and spokesperson Anil Sareen are frontrunners for Ludhiana North. Sources said that the Ludhiana East and South went into the kitty of PLC, after BJP and Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) led by Simarjit Singh Bains failed to forge an alliance.PLC candidates to fight on BJP symbol in urban areas: SharmaSoon after getting the party ticket, Jagmohan Sharma said that it has been decided that PLC candidates will contest on BJP symbol in urban seats, while in rural areas, the party candidate will fight on PLC symbol. The decision has been taken in view of the strong voter-base of BJP in urban areas, which will add to the vote share of the candidates, said the leader.Captain confidant get ticket from DakhaDamanjeet Singh Mohi, an active Youth Congress functionary who has formerly served as sarpanch, zila parishad member and chairman of market committee, Mullanpur, will fight from the Dakha seat. Mohi was an officer on special duty (OSD) to ex-CM and PLC chief Captain Amarinder Singh. Captain Sandeep Sandhu, former loyalist of Amarinder, has already got a Congress ticket here. On the other hand, Harpreet Singh Makhu is the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha candidate for this seat. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has fielded KNS Kang. SAD’s sitting MLA from Dakha, Manpreet Singh Ayali, has homeground advantage and has been credited with developing parks and facilities in the villages, stated to be at an advantageous position in the multi-cornered contest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-bjp-leaders-hopes-dashed-as-pre-poll-partner-punjab-lok-congress-names-candidates-from-key-seats-101642967044658.html

Officials from the authority said the move is aimed at ensuring that the dealers do not indulge in unfair trade practices.The authority will also reach out to the broker community and ensure that there is a wider compliance with regard to the norms as prescribed in the Rera Act, the officials said, adding that at present there are 1,800 registered brokers with H-Rera, Gurugram. KK Khandelwal, chairman of H-Rera, Gurugram, said that the Rera Act offers a real estate agent a formal and legal recognition, while defining their responsibilities and duties. “We have come across several instances where property dealers falsely represented products and services, and misled customers. The proposed code of conduct will resolve these issues,” he said. The code will also ensure that brokers maintain record of transactions and do not charge more than 1% commission rate on the sale of properties, the H-Rera chief said, adding that there will also be a provision for imposing a penalty in case of non-compliance by a real estate agent. The brokers are not very enthused with the proposed code of conduct or requirement of registration by the authority. “The proposed code of conduct will further make it difficult for brokers to operate as the realty market is already facing slowdown. The cost of registration with H-Rera is very high and there is no support from the authority,” said Ravinder Agarwal, president, Association of Certified Realtors of India (Gurugram chapter).Rajiv Sinha, a property consultant, said that the brokers are not finding any benefit from associating with the regulator. “Most of the brokers are engaged in secondary sales, so they avoid registering themselves with the authority,” he said. The brokers are worried about the compliances required by the proposed code of conduct. “The move will put more burden on us. Also, the authority must involve brokers in the exercise,” said Sanjeev Thakur, a city-based broker. 
24-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Ferozepur City all set for a four-cornered contest||For the first time, a close four-cornered contest is likely in the Ferozepur City assembly constituency which has been a traditional bastion of the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) never won from here.Four-time legislator Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi is set to pose a challenge to old Congress colleague and incumbent Parminder Singh Pinki from the segment located along the India-Pakistan border. The Aam Aadmi Party’s Ranbir Singh Bhullar, who is emerging as a formidable challenger, is harping on the popularity of the party’s chief ministerial face Bhagwant Mann. Sodhi, who represented Guruharsahai for the last four consecutive terms as a Congress candidate, switched over to the BJP in December.In the public meetings, Bhullar is trying to consolidate the support of the state government employees who have been protesting against the Congress government besides banking on anti-incumbency against Pinki. The Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the forerunner of the BJP, won from here on five occasions since the first elections in 1951 and the Janata Party retained the seat in 1977. The Congress captured the seat on 9 occasions in the last 71 years.The SAD has fielded its district unit president Rohit Vohra Montu from the seat.In the 2017 elections, Pinki was polled an impressive 54% votes and the BJP candidate secured 30%. The AAP nominee had secured 13% of the total votes polled last time.After moving to the urban segment of the border city, Sodhi is banking solely on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s political charisma.In his public address, he has been raising the issue of the cancellation of Modi’s rally in Ferozepur on January 5 when the PM’s security was breached. Now, he hopes to get sympathy votes over the fiasco that hogged national headlines. “Besides laying foundation stones of a series of development projects, the PM was expected to announce Punjab-centric welfare initiatives. The Congress government conspired to sabotage the Ferozepur event and people’s anger will be reflected in votes for the BJP,” says Sodhi who was a key Sikh face to join the saffron party in December last year after Modi announced to withdraw the 3 contentious farm laws.Political observers say the former minister opted for a new segment as the BJP’s new face may not consolidate agrarian support in the rural constituency like Guruharsahai.Since he joined the BJP, Sodhi, a Sikh Khatri, was hinting at contesting from Ferozepur City which has over 40% Hindu voters.On the other hand, Pinki is banking upon the development projects such as laying of underground drinking water, sewage, beautification of the city and installation of LED screens in parks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-ferozepur-city-all-set-for-a-four-cornered-contest-101642966804422.html

On Sunday, the city’s air quality entered the “poor” zone after remaining in the “very poor” category for five consecutive days. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4pm bulletin, the air quality index of the city on Sunday was 205, a climbdown from Saturday’s AQI reading of 304 with PM2.5 as the prominent pollutant. The last time the city had “poor” air quality was January 17 with an AQI value of 219, according to the CPCB data.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Gurugram received 23mm of rainfall in the past 24 hours. With the overnight rain, some parts of the city witnessed waterlogging which was mostly cleared by this morning, officials said. However, waterlogging at Narsinghpur Chowk stayed for long, and the rainwater receded by evening, said a traffic police official, seeking anonymity. The Narsinghpur-Khandsa stretch is one of the critical waterlogging points in the city. On January 11 too, the stretch had witnessed waterlogging after heavy rain leading to traffic disruptions.

The Provider Overseas Consultancy Private Limited was a key link between the CM’s nephew and a raid conducted by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in an illegal sand mining case. The central agency had seized a whopping ₹10 crore, a Rolex watch worth of ₹12 lakh besides gold worth ₹21 lakh from Honey and Sandeep during the raid on January 19. It has been probing money-laundering charges against the three as it suspects the proceeds of illegal sand mining were transferred to the firm. As per the details, the form was set up in Sector 44-D, Chandigarh, in October 2018 and has Kudrat Deep Singh, Bhupinder Singh and Sandeep Kumar as directors with 33.33% equal share. The firm has an authorised equity share capital of ₹5 lakh whereas its paid up capital is ₹60,000 and each director owns 2,000 shares. The audit reports, including balance sheets, submitted last in February 2021 reveal that the firm’s revenue of ₹18.37 lakh in the financial year ending March 31, 2020, came in the form of commission. It also shows that total expenditure of the company was ₹23.12 lakh, including ₹12.34 lakh in salaries to employees and ₹10 lakh as other expenses. The reports also reveal that the company has an unsecured loan of ₹3.88 lakh in the long-term liability category and ₹5.26 lakh amount was shown as advance from customers. The report mentions that the company had no revenue in the financial year ending March 31, 2019 whereas it had an expenditure of ₹22,954. The ED’s probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) is based on a 2018 case registered by Punjab Police for illegal sand mining in the state. The agency had lodged an ECIR (Enforcement Case Information Report) at its zonal office in Jalandhar in November last year after taking over the probe. According to the FIR, there are 26 accused, including Kudrat Deep, and mostly truck drivers. Bhupinder Honey was not accused in the FIR whereas Kudrat was also granted clean chit by the SBS Nagar police in a follow-up inquiry. The case was registered on the complaint of the Punjab mining department that found sand quarries being run without approval during its raids in 2018.

The market is currently situated on an unmetalled stretch which is pothole-riddled. The marble market is located along the 3km sector dividing road connecting Hero Honda Chowk on the Delhi-Gurugram Expressway and Subhash Chowk on Sohna Road. Without any bitumen covering, the entire market area is prone to waterlogging which also inundates portions of the 3km sector dividing road whenever it rains.Besides providing commuters with space to park their vehicles, the ₹4 crore project is also aimed at dust mitigation, officials said.Gurugram mayor Madhu Azad inaugurated the construction of the road on Saturday.“The completion of the construction of parking roads in both the sectors would not only benefit the traders here, but also the customers visiting the market. People have to face a lot of problems due to waterlogging in the market during the rainy season,” said Azad.Azad further said that she has also directed MCG officials and representatives of the construction agency to ensure that the project is completed within the stipulated time frame.As per MCG officials privy to the matter, the agency has been given a time period of nine months to complete the project, with emphasis to finish it before the 2022 monsoon season.The MCG officials said that market traders demanded to install streetlights in the area which is being taken into consideration. The MCG’s main office in Sector 34 is located in close vicinity to the marble market.Daily commuters said that the project will provide them with a lot of relief. “The mixing of rainwater and soil creates sort of a swamp during the monsoon season. Due to this, the three-lane carriageway reduces to a solitary lane through which vehicles have to navigate their way. Once constructed, it can save 20-25 minutes of travelling time during peak monsoon season,” said Satbir Yadav, who works in Sector 34.

Questioning the timing of the ED action, Sidhu said the case they put on Channi’s nephew was registered in 2018 by the then Capt Amarinder Singh government and four years have passed since the FIR was registered. They were sleeping for four years and have brought the ED near the elections, he said, slamming the political misuse of the central agencies. The PPCC president, who held an interaction with journalists here, also said that he was not giving a clean chit. “Let the law take its own course. If you prove a link, then I will be the first one to criticize. But if you are doing political vendetta, then I am not with you…today it is clear it is political vendetta,” he asserted. On the multiplicity of parties in the election this time, Sidhu said that people of Punjab always make up their mind and act decisively, never leaving things half-way. “Even if votes are split among four or five candidates, people do not cast their votes to defeat anyone. They vote for victory. They will not waste their votes on spent cartridges and people like Capt Amarinder Singh,” he added. On being asked how many seats does he expect the Congress to win in the upcoming polls, Sidhu said if the dilemma is removed and a clear agenda is given in the manifesto, then 70 seats. Asked if his agenda will be included in the Congress manifesto, Sidhu said he had a one-hour meeting with (manifesto committee chairman) Partap Bajwa in the morning, and will meet him again on Monday. “It (manifesto) will be with you soon,” he said. On the raging infighting, the PPCC chief asked which party does not have infighting. “In AAP, they are slapping each other. At least, we don’t have that kind of situation,” he said. He said the high command had set the ‘one family, one ticket’ rule. “There are going to be no exceptions, be it Sidhu, CM Channi or anyone else. Only one ticket will be given to one family,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ed-raids-a-political-vendetta-but-not-giving-clean-chit-to-anyone-sidhu-101642965785403.html

24-01-2022||Lucknow||Lucknow: Pro-quota body demands restoration of reservation in promotions||Lucknow: Condemning the political parties for not including the issue of quota in their poll announcements, the Arakshan Bachao Sangharsh Samiti, a body representing eight lakh Dalit and backward class government employees, on Sunday passed a resolution demanding restoration of the provision of reservation in promotions. The body also asked its members to assess political parties’ commitment and seriousness about the demand before they and their families decide to vote for a party in this assembly elections. It told political parties that only talking of 85% vs 15% would not do and demanded them to disclose their action plan to protect reservation in jobs and promotions. The Samiti, at its core group’s meeting here, passed three resolutions and demanded political parties to incorporate the same in their electoral manifestos. “We demanded restoration of the provision of quota in promotion for SC-ST employees, providing reservation in promotion for Backward Class employees as it was available to them prior to 1977. Besides providing 50% representation to SCs, STs and OBCs in all the commissions under the government,” Samiti convener Avadhesh Kumar Verma said. He said that it was deplorable that political parties were resorting to a lot of rhetoric on the issue of reservation without making any announcement as to what was their action plan if they came to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-pro-quota-body-demands-restoration-of-reservation-in-promotion-provision-101642964885518.html
24-01-2022||Chandigarh||Guest Column | ‘Fearless Governance’ is about ‘We’, not ‘Me’||Voters elect the persons they want to be governed by. The majority then forms the government. The administration recruits, selects and appoints its public servants for administering them. The elected and the recruited, therefore, govern and help the country. Thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, I got the opportunity to govern, administer and serve Puducherry as the Lieutenant Governor for nearly five years. His single instruction was to ensure financial prudence in administering the Union Territory. He said, “Kiran ji wahan ja kar paise ka dhyan rakhna.”And I did it against all herculean odds. The financial powers are with the Lt Governor, as per the rules, yet no political effort was spared to hound the officers advising financial prudence. The office of the Lt Governor was taken to the highest courts of the land to obstruct the exercise of correct use of public money. The legal battles cost energy and money. A thoroughly corrupt system was in place. Financial irregularities were enormous. The defunct state public sector companies were being given financial grants. Employees’ provident fund was abused to pay and meet office expenses; audit objections were pending compliance for years. The Cooperative Bank gave away loans without due securities, and to the persons of influence. I saw hundreds of excess recruitments, all as patronage. The book “Fearless Governance” is about “We”, not “Me”. It is an outcry for conscientious service and leadership. It is about people and their basic needs, which are expected to be provided by those in governance — appointed or elected — to serve fearlessly. It’s about the people, loving and respecting what officials ought to be doing. It’s about puncturing vested interests that corrode the vitals of administration. A lot depends on financial prudence. How public money is prioritised and spent? Not about transactional sops announced without provisioning for them. It is like robbing Peter to pay Paul. It is about opening up the doors and the systems. It’s about visible leadership and authentic communication. It’s about placing on the centre stage the ordinary person who has no powerful connections, and giving people the faith that one is for all, always. It’s also about the miracle of teamwork. Trust is what the country needs the most. Government is one organic whole The government is one organic whole. Constant upskilling and retraining is the need of the hour, always. Governance is about exercising responsibility for the present and future needs to provide quality of life. It’s about their responsible living and doing. It’s about clean living, about giving and not taking. It’s about joy and celebration, promoting openness and have no secrets. I have demystified governance through sustained communication and regular people engagement to remain responsive. The book explains the purpose of one’s power and position as it is a product of when I took up the responsibility of Puducherry as its Lt Governor. I saw a closed Raj Niwas. Not accessible at all. Not celebrating anything. An isolated palace with an entourage of personal staff for maximum comfort. But very rich in flora and fauna. Secretariat staff, too, was lean. To do minimum, perhaps. No practice of schedules of meeting with a periodicity. Also had occasional dinners with select staff and all the generosity of cuisine. I also did not see websites of any department updated, barring an exception. The Raj Niwas website was just for the sake of it. The book fleshed out the ideas in seven parts. The first is about the call, the calling and the strategy. It gives an insight into how I had to prepare myself for this onerous responsibility. When I began, I did not know any officer from my past postings. I also did not know Tamil. Only seniors and a few knew how to converse in English. Hence communication was limited. The position and gender kept most at bay. Now, comes the challenge. How do we clean up the city? How do we put systems in place where an ordinary person is heard? How do we track grievances? What is the role of the Lt Governor as the administrator? How should we open up the Raj Niwas? What about visitors wanting to see this iconic building of Puducherry? What about the mafias in medical seat sale and land grabbing of senior citizens, too weak to defend or away to France and unable to defend? What about the colossal funds going for no work done, just because unable to take politically decisions? Who would bell the cats? At the top of it, questioning the legal powers, as laid down under the law, I was before the high courts and the Supreme Court. Those not comfortable with my ways to set the things right held press conferences to misrepresent and misinform the people, and even challenge the office of Lt Governor. The book explains how this was countered, making the tenure one of trials and tribulations, yet making amendments to the broken-down systems by putting systems that started to deliver on autopilot. The challenge of Covid-19 finds a particular chapter in the book on how only the intervention of the Government of India rescued the day. In the end, the UT got the highest ratings in governance. What if we all had worked together in a more significant interest? Puducherry could have been a model for emulation. Fearless leadership practices which made the change possible are for future generations to learn from. These measures are suitable for private and government sectors, as Ms Indra Nooyi said at the book launch. She termed it “a blueprint for Good Governance”. For me, governing and administering is all about fearless, duty conscious, and patriotic governance — by the elected and the appointed — for a developed India. kiranbedioffice@gmail.com(Views expressed are her personal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-fearless-governance-is-about-we-not-me-101642964884110.html

Sharma urged his party workers to not lose their cool while responding to provocative speeches and instead, reply democratically by increasing the vote share of the BJP. Dinesh Sharma, who was in Agra, was interacting with party workers at a programme organised to establish effective communication with voters. He also led the door-to-door campaign for BJP candidate Dr GS Dharmesh who is contesting from Agra Cantt. “The opposition parties made every effort to dislodge the BJP but failed and so called their ‘B Team’ from Hyderabad (an indirect reference to AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi) who began using provocative language against BJP leaders and said that Yogi Adityanath would go to ‘math’ (religious center) and Narendra Modi to Himalayas, leaving none to save their supporters,” Sharma said. ‘These leaders making provocative statements should know that there is rule of law in Uttar Pradesh. Every child of Uttar Pradesh is Yogi and Modi. They should pack their bags as they will not find place in Hyderabad too because after UP elections, Yogi ji is going to Hyderabad to tackle such leaders,” he said. “Itna jaan lo ki abhi 25 se 30 saal tak BJP ko ukhadne wala koi mai ka lal paida nahi hua” (Let it be known that no one capable of dislodging the BJP for the next 25 to 30 years has been born yet) said Sharma. Sharma urged party workers to not get provoked by inflammatory statements against the party and its leaders and respond by increasing the vote share of the party. “A senior leader of the Congress termed Narendra Modi as ‘maut ka saudagar’ while another opposition leader named him ‘hatyara’ (murderer) but PM Modi did not reply himself and it was the masses in Uttar Pradesh who replied. As such, party workers should not lose their cool in election period and have patience,” he said. Later, Sharma went for door-to-door campaigning and began from Gihara Basti, a locality in reserved constituency of Agra Cantt, told voters about the achievements of the BJP in the state and at the centre and sought votes for party candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/no-one-can-dislodge-bjp-for-next-25-30-yrs-dinesh-sharma-101642963804546.html

As the police have failed to crack the murders till date and have instead sent three suspects behind the bars against whom no concrete evidence has still been found, the Dalit community in Phaphamau are up in arms over the gruesome murders and rape with one of the victims, a woman. Meanwhile, many senior leaders of different political parties, including Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, have visited the village and consoled the aggrieved kin while demanding justice for them. Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Rawan also met the kin of the victims and assured them of all support to get justice. While, around two months have passed and the dust has settled down in the case, anger still remains among them victims. On November 24 last year, the bodies of a middle-aged couple, their 25-year-old daughter and 10-year-old differently able son were found at their house in Phaphamau area. Their kin lodged FIR against 11 named persons of upper caste Thakur family following which they were arrested. However, police later arrested a 23-year-old labourer Pawan Saroj and claimed that he committed the rape and murders as the young woman refused his advances. The kin of the victims raised doubts on the police theory and demanded fair investigations in the case. Few days later, the police arrested two youths Shashi Patel and his cousin Rajneesh Patel of neighbouring villages. Police said that Shashi was in an affair with the woman and was in contact with her through chat. “Despite being pressurized for marriage by the woman, Shashi was reluctant to marry her as she was from different caste. Shashi came from Gurgaon on November 21 and killed the woman and her kin after raping her,” the police had said. A close relative of the victims, who is a CRPF man posted in Jharkhand, said that the family was unsatisfied with the police action till now. “Our different demands including CBI probe into the incident is still pending. We are still waiting for justice. Police should crack the case and arrest the real culprits. Moreover, our other demands which include jobs to family members of the victims should also be fulfilled,” he said. Congress district vice president Manoj Pasi said that police failed in taking action against culprits and instead sent innocent persons to jail. “Dalit community is in rage over the injustice and will give a befitting reply in state assembly elections. If Congress comes to power, then a CBI probe will be initiated into the gruesome murders,” he added. Meanwhile, BJP leader of trans-Ganga area Sushil Maharaj claimed that the family of victims was satisfied with the police action and compensation provided to them. “Some persons are unnecessarily making it an issue for political gains. BJP leaders will again meet the kin and will talk to them to learn if they have any complaints,” he further said. Local Samajwadi Party leader Sandeep Yadav said that not only the kin of victims, but Dalit community was still waiting for justice in brutal murders and rape. “Police implicated innocents to save the real culprits. Justice will be ensured to victims after Samajwadi Party comes to power,” he said. SP (trans-Ganga) Abhishek Agarwal said that investigations were still underway and teams were on work to identify suspects. “Justice will be ensured into the incident at any cost,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/phaphamau-multiple-murder-justice-for-victims-to-be-a-big-issue-in-poll-101642963744036.html

Sukhbir, who also addressed the media at Dhuri along with party candidate Prakash Chand Garg, said the AAP had told Punjabis that it would give tickets to ordinary persons but had instead sold seats to highest bidders.Lashing out at AAP’s Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann, Sukhbir said he was never given any recognition in the party. “For one year, Arvind Kejriwal kept telling Punjabis he was looking for the right face while sitting alongside Mann. Even now, when Mann has been announced as the party’s chief ministerial candidate, posters across Punjab are still demanding a chance for Kejriwal.

Mustafa said he had gone to an event of some Congress workers nearby and warned the AAP workers, who were also from the Muslim community.The purported video clip was played by the BJP at a press conference on Saturday. “I swear by Allah that I will not allow them (AAP) to hold any event. I am a ‘kaumi fauji (soldier of community)’. I am not an RSS agent who will hide in the house out of fear. If they (AAP) again try to do such a thing, I swear by Allah I will thrash them in their homes,” the video allegedly showed him saying at the meeting held on January 20.Mustafa said he used the word “fitno” (mischief makers) for AAP workers belonging to the Muslim community and there was no question of warning Hindus. “There was no Hindu-Muslim context to what happened in Malerkotla to which the quoted video clip relates. It was a verbal outburst unilaterally mischievously provoked by Jhaduwalas, all Muslims,” Mustafa said in a tweet.In another tweet, he hit out at the BJP, saying his “nationalist” credentials were superior than those from the party. “Your intended branding will not work on Mustafa, as my nationalistic credentials are far superior to yours with a history of life long fight against enemies of India and destroyers of communal harmony in the state,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-sidhu-s-adviser-mohd-mustafa-booked-for-provocative-speech-101642963445448.html
24-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Jalalusma is SAD candidate from Baba Bakala segment||Chandigarh : Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday announced Baljit Singh Jalalusma as the party candidate from the Baba Bakala constituency for the February 20 Punjab assembly polls. Jalalusma is former member of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and ex-MLA from the Jandiala Guru constituency. With this, the party has so far declared 95 candidates. It is yet to declare candidates on two seats --- Lambi and Amritsar East. Lambi is currently represented by former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal while Amritsar East by Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. The announcement of the candidate from Baba Bakala took time as party cadres were divided over Jalalusma and Manjit Singh Manna, who remained MLA from the constituency in the past. Baba Bakala falls in Amritsar district and on his recent visit, the SAD president met supporters of both Jalalusma and Manna to resolve the issue. Later, a consensus was reached at Jalalusma’s name. The SAD is contesting 97 seats of the total 117 and its ally BSP on 20. The SAD entered into a pre-poll alliance with the BSP last year after it broke ties with the BJP over the (now repealed) three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-jalalusma-is-sad-candidate-from-baba-bakala-segment-101642963265181.html
24-01-2022||Mumbai||Patole’s remarks on Modi anger BJP||Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole has landed in another controversy following his remarks reportedly against prime minister Narendra Modi. Speaking to media in Nashik, Patole said, “Whose wife runs away is named as Modi.” Reacting to this, the BJP has announced state-wide agitations. BJP workers in various parts of the state burnt the effigy of Patole. “His comments are shameful. He forgot that he was talking about the prime minister of the country. Patole needs to be given psychological treatment. He has insulted half a billion women of the country. We will stage state-wide protests against Patole,” BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule said. Patole later issued a video, denying to have said anything against the prime minister. “I repeated what a local goon said in a village. It was not against the prime minister. We do not have only one Modi in our country. There are many Modis…Nirav and Lalit too are Modis. In fact, BJP leaders are defaming the PM by linking my statement with him. They want to divert the key issues like unemployment etc. by politicising such a petty thing,” he said. Patole last week kicked up a row when he said “he can beat Modi, abuse Modi” as he ensured to remain clean in politics. The BJP submitted complaints in 100 police stations demanding an FIR against the Congress leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/patoles-remarks-on-modi-anger-bjp-101642963263911.html
24-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi: DDMA releases ₹100 crore more for aid to Covid victims’ kin||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has released an additional ₹100 crore to the city’s 11 district administrations to pay ₹50,000 aid to families of the Capital’s Covid-19 victims who are yet to receive financial assistance from the state’s disaster relief fund.So far, 25,586 people in the Capital have died of Covid-19, and the families of 21,914 have already received the one time ex-gratia ₹50,000 aid under the Delhi Disaster Relief Fund (DDRF) till January 22. The remaining applications are being processed, said officials. “All the district magistrates of revenue department are authorized to incur the expenditure for payments of ex-gratia assistance of ₹50,000 to the next of kin of the deceased due to Covid-19 as per guidelines,” said a revenue department order dated January 21, signed by the deputy controller of accounts. HT has seen the order.According to a DDMA order dated January 6, over 20,000 people who lost a family member to Covid-19 and have already received ₹50,000 as ex gratia under the Mukhyamantri Covid-19 Pariwar Aarthik Sahayata Yojna, were to be given an additional ₹50,000 each under DDRF. “It is a standing fund which does not lapse at the end of the financial year. The fund will be used by the districts to disburse ex-gratia payment against applications from Covid-19 victims. Our target is to ensure that no Covid-19 victim’s kin is left out of the financial assistance scheme. We have already initiated media campaign to create awareness for availing ex-gratia assistance.

24-01-2022||Delhi||Another extreme weather event as Delhi eclipses January rain record||The spell of extreme or unusual weather events occurring almost every month in the national capital has continued, with Delhi breaking its all-time rainfall record for January after receiving an additional 19.1mm of rain between 8:30pm on Saturday and 8:30am on Sunday.With this latest spell, Delhi has got 88.2mm of rainfall so far in January, beating the previous record for the month (79.7mm) set in 1989, data maintained by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) between 1901 and 2022 shows. And there are still eight days to go in the month.However, IMD has forecast no rain for the city till January 29, and said the impact of colder winds from snow-clad hills will lead to a drop in the minimum temperature, which is expected to hover around 6-7 degrees Celsius in the next five days. Meanwhile, the maximum temperature could also hover around the 16-degree mark for the next three days, before a gradual rise to 17 or 18 degrees. This could mean that ‘cold day’ conditions persist in parts of the Capital.Met officials said Delhi has already recorded six western disturbances (WD) so far this month, with the last two, including the latest spell this weekend, among the most active seen in January in years.“Last weekend, we saw over 40mm of rainfall at almost all stations, and this was the most active western disturbance of this winter season. Similarly, the latest western disturbance (WD) was also fairly active, and has brought moderate rainfall at the Safdarjung and Palam stations,” said RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD.He added that though six to seven WDs in January have been recorded in the past too, Delhi rarely sees them operating at such a high intensity. “This time, the frequency of WDs has not been the difference, but the intensity has. We normally see one active spell like this and even then, the rainfall is not much. This time around, we have seen two active spells with both spells bringing moderate rainfall, leading to several records tumbling,” Jenamani said.While no rainfall was recorded after Sunday morning, the Safdarjung station recorded 19.7mm between 8:30pm on Saturday and 8:30am on Sunday. It was 28.4mm at Palam, 27mm at Lodhi road, 25mm at Ayanagar and 17.8mm at Ridge during this period. IMD classifies rainfall as “light” when it is between 2.5mm and 15.5mm, as “moderate” when it is between 15.6 and 64.4mm, and as ‘heavy’ when it is above 64.5mm in a single day.Delhi’s maximum temperature remained low on Sunday, and was recorded at just 14.9 degrees Celsius – six degrees below normal for this time of the season. It was 14.7 degrees on Saturday, which is the lowest so far this winter. The minimum, meanwhile, was 10.5 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal. Delhi’s lowest maximum was 14.2 degrees at Mayur Vihar, however it was not classified as a “cold day” by IMD because the minimum temperature was not below 10 degrees Celsius.A “cold day” is when the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees or more below normal, along with the minimum being below the 10-degree Celsius mark.Delhi has only recorded six days this month where the maximum temperature was above normal. Till January 23, Delhi’s average maximum temperature was 18 degrees, 1.9 degrees below the normal average of 19.9 degrees.The trend in the Capital shows that 2022 has started exactly where 2021 had stopped -- breaking weather records every month.Not only did Delhi see extreme cold waves at the start and end of last year, it witnessed an intense summer, with a “severe heatwave” recorded in June, while Delhi recorded its second warmest February in the last 120 years. March was little different, bringing the hottest day that month in the last 76 years, data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) shows.It also saw an intense monsoon that continued well into late October as the city recorded 1,512.4mm of rainfall till December 29, the second highest ever, behind 1,534.3mm in 1933.CLEAR REPUBLIC DAY: IMDIMD on Sunday said there will be no rain and negligible impact of fog at India Gate during the Republic Day parade on January 26, adding that while a shallow fog is expected in the morning hours, visibility will not fall below 500 metres.In its forecast for India Gate on Sunday, IMD said the maximum is expected to hover between 17 and 19 degrees Celsius, while the minimum is expected to be around 5 and 7 degrees.On Monday, however, a moderate fog is forecast during the day, with “cold day” conditions expected at a few places. The maximum could hover around 16 degrees, while the minimum is expected to be 7 degrees Celsius.The rain over the weekend has also improved Delhi’s air quality, which dropped to the lower end of the “poor” category on Sunday. Delhi recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 202, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4 pm bulletin, a major improvement from 316 (very poor) on Saturday.A seventh western disturbance for the month is forecast in the northern plains on January 28, but IMD scientists said its impact over Delhi will be negligible. “No rain is likely at the moment, but it will lead to an increase in the maximum and minimum temperature,” said a Met official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/another-extreme-weather-event-as-delhi-eclipses-january-rain-record-101642962065220.html
24-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi: Man stabs wife multiple times, kills self in Ghaziabad flat||The husband of a 22-year-old woman stabbed her at least 30 times on her face and neck with a surgical blade at her mother’s house in West Delhi’s Khyala on Thursday, police said, and after thinking he’d killed her, died by suicide at a house in Ghaziabad’s Loni the following day.The woman, however, miraculously survived the vicious attack, and is undergoing treatment at the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital in west Delhi.The man’s actions were likely prompted by a petty argument between the couple, and the two would often quarrel with each other, the woman’s family told police during preliminary investigations.Deputy Commissioner of Police (west) Urvija Goel said the incident was first reported to the Police Control Room by the staff of a private hospital in Paschim Vihar on Thursday. The hospital staff told police that they admitted a woman with stab wounds, and that she was attacked at her mother’s house, possibly by her husband. The woman was later shifted to DDU hospital.A police team recorded the statement of the woman’s mother, and an FIR under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Khyala police station on the basis of the complaint. A team was formed to nab the accused, the DCP said.An investigator aware of the details of the probe said that, according to woman’s mother, her daughter had come to her house on Wednesday after a fight with her husband. The woman’s mother lives alone.In her complaint to the police, the mother said that her daughter’s husband followed her, and was trying to persuade her to return to their house in Loni’s Naseeb Vihar area. When she refused, the husband stayed back with her on Wednesday night. On Thursday, at around 7.30pm, while the woman’s mother was out to buy groceries, the man allegedly attacked his wife with a surgical blade. According to the doctors, there were at least 30 stab wounds on her neck and face.The police team raided multiple locations in the city after gathering details about the man’s whereabouts, but could not find him. On Friday, they got a tip-off that he was hiding in a vacant house owned by his brother-in-law in Loni’s Ambedkar Colony, the officer cited above said.The brother-in-law accompanied the police team to Loni, where they found the house latched from inside. When they peeked inside from a window, Ram Kumar was seen hanging from the ceiling, ostensibly dead by suicide, the DCP said.Police said that, according to the man’s family, he had a drug addiction and shared a strained relationship with his wife. They said that the woman complained to them about her husband.The incident came to light a day after a similar crime was reported from Saket where a 57-year-old man allegedly killed his wife at their home on Friday evening, and then tried to take his own life by slashing his neck with a kitchen knife, after an argument between the two. Police said they were trying to ascertain the exact motive and circumstances of the crime.Rajat Mitra, a clinical psychologist, said long relationships or social bonds are no guarantee against domestic violence. He said the reasons in each case are different, and each perpetrator is driven by different motives. “It is very difficult to generalise because each domestic or relationship violence case is unique. So, it can have a different motive like a 57-year-old man will have a different reason than the person in 20s or 30s. Having a relationship for a long time is no defence against violence. There can be a wide variety of reasons behind the domestic violence. For example, it can be a mental disorder, suppressed rage and humiliation that the man may be carrying inside, or may be the man completely feels that it’s a case of infidelity.”Mitra further elaborated that the law and criminal justice system see domestic violence as something that happens within the periphery of home. “They also feel that it is something that best be left to the couple. But when this first happens, it continues. The law usually takes the position that the couple can sort it out between each other with the help of counselling. But almost 35% cases cannot be solved through counselling, they need special care because the man may have a mental disorder, may be feeling suspicious, or is unable to hold back his emotions. He may have an explosive personality disorder, which cannot be cured by just counselling or medication. What is important is that the woman must get away at the very first instance of violence. It’s a warning,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiman-stabs-wife-multiple-times-kills-self-in-ghaziabad-flat-101642961823762.html
24-01-2022||Delhi||Bleak times for an ecosystem amid Delhi Metro's stop-start Covid journey||In 2020, Binod Mairta, was working on his second novel Last Train to Huda City Centre —part of a three-book series set in Delhi Metro-- when the pandemic struck and Metro services were halted for over five months. “I had to stop writing the book because Metro is my muse I and drew inspiration for every scene in my book from my daily travel on it,” says Marta, whose first book, A Rose on the Platform, a story of love and betrayal was set in Delhi Metro.“Over the years, Metro had also become a kind of social engine of the city, the hottest venue for socialising and dating. Today, it is a gloomy place. I can only resume my book when Metro returns to its pre-pandemic self,” adds Mairta, who works as a deputy director, editorial and translation services, in the Rajya Sabha Secretariat, and travels between Dilshad Garden and Central Secretariat in Metro.Indeed, many Delhi Metro stations such as Barakhamba Road, which, before the pandemic witnessed swarms of people, today look jarringly empty. Even some of the busiest interchange stations such as Rajiv Chowk and Kashmere Gate, whose restaurants and cafes were hot spots for social and business meetings and dating, continue to be the pale shadows of their former selves two years after the pandemic struck.With footfalls down sharply, most retail outlets and restaurants have witnessed a debilitating drop in business, with some shutting shop. According to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), average passenger journeys have come down from 6 million to 6.5 million a day before the pandemic to about 1.5 million to 2 million a day.It is 11 am on a Friday morning, and Café Coffee Day at Rajiv Chowk station is empty. “Before the pandemic, our sales were ₹65, 000 a day, but by Diwali last year it dropped to about ₹30,000. Now, with only takeaway allowed sales have come down to ₹3, 000 a day,” says Shiv Rathore, an assistant manager at the outlet.“Earlier, our restaurant was always packed. People celebrated birthdays here and also held business meetings. But most of our customers were young couples,” adds Rathore.One of the customers was Nidhi Khanna, who recently came to the café after one and a half years on her way to Noida—but was dismayed by the change she witnessed in how Metro ‘felt and functioned’.“Underground Metro stations have a charm and energy of their own. I loved spending time with my friends at CCD at Rajiv Chowk and watching people waiting, meeting, rushing in and out of the trains. Indeed a lot happened over coffee here ” says Nidhi Khanna, 26, a Noida-based IT professional.“But Metro is not the same now. The temperature checks at the entry and Covid-related stickers on the seats inside the compartments keep reminding you of the dangers of infection. Ironically, earlier people fought to grab the seats, now they prefer to stand as it allows more social standing, though standing is currently prohibited. Finding a seat in the Metro has never been so easy,” adds Khanna.Jatin Arora, who lives in north Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar and works in Gurugram, says that Kashmere Gate was the station where he often met his girlfriend, now his wife. “What made Metro so attractive for dating is that two young people could travel in close proximity in air-conditioned comfort without attracting too much attention. But now that anonymity is gone in the relatively empty compartments and stations, and that feeling of comfort and cosiness inside Metro has given way to fear, ” says Arora, a marketing professional.Like Shiv Rathore of Café Coffee Day, Shubham Goyal, manager at Namaste Delhi, a fast food outlet at Kashmere Gate station, says couples constituted a large part of his clients, but with most offices and colleges closed, his business is down by around 80%. “If you allow hundred per cent seating in the trains, sitting in the station’s cafes can also be allowed. After all, we are inside the Metro and unlike those outside, we cannot even do home deliveries,” says Goyal.Under the curbs imposed by Delhi Disaster Management Authority in the wake of surge in Covid cases, restaurants have only been allowed takeaways and deliveries.Prakash Joshi, who works at Sahitya Akademi bookshop at Kashmere Gate station, says that before the pandemic struck most of his customers were either elderly people or Delhi University students interested in Hindi literature. “Often, a lot of commuters would walk in and turn our shop into a literary saloon, discussing Munshi Premchand. But now hardly anyone comes. Even before the third wave began on December 15, our sales were down by 50%. Now, we have very few customers,” says Joshi, sitting at the counter of the bookshop whose walls have black and white pictures of Indian literary greats such as Toru Dutt, Devaki Nandan Khatri and Nagarjun. The teakwood shelves are stacked with hundreds of titles in over two dozen Indian languages.It is afternoon and Vishwavidyalaya station, which once buzzed with chitter-chatter of DU students, is eerily silent. Balbir Singh, who works at the NBT book store at the station, said with the universities and colleges closed there are no customers and it is hard to pass time. “ Before the pandemic, we sold books worth ₹7,000 a day. Now, we are lucky if our daily sale exceeds even ₹1,000,” he says as he watches 1966 ‎Dharmendra‎ and Meena Kumari starrer, Phool Aur Patthar, on YouTube. “This is the only way to pass time,” says Singh.Back at Rajiv Chowk station, Ravi Kumar, a sales associate with an eyewear retail chain, is worried that his store might close by February. “In October-November, our monthly sales were about ₹12 lakh a month. But this month it is barely ₹2 lakh so far. The rent for the shop is about ₹3.5 lakh, and the company has told us we might exit the station by February. We were 10 people here before the pandemic, but now we are only four. Our business is directly related to footfall at the station,” he says.The DMRC said it has taken several measures to help businesses running from the Metro premises. “We have taken a number of measures such as rent waivers, moratorium and lease period extensions to retain various retail and food outlets at stations. We are continuously interacting with the vendors to understand their requirements and challenges and necessary measures are being taken. A very small number of retailers have shut shops,” says Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, Delhi Metro.It is 5.30 in the evening, and the corridors of the Barakhamba Road station are pitch dark as most doors of the station are closed. The station which used to witness a maddening rush of commuters at this hour has a small queue of commuters today. Rajiv Arora, who works at a private bank on Barakhamba Road, says not just the atmosphere of the station, even the profile of the commuters have changed. “This is an office heavy area and earlier most commuters were office goers headed home in the evening, and I recognized a lot of them. Now, I do not see any familiar face,” says Arora.As we talk, there is an announcement on the public address system ‘wearing the face mask is mandatory’, Arora pushes his mask up to his mouth and gets into the almost empty train going to Dwarka.

24-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana consumer disputes commission penalises insurance company for deficient service||The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission directed National Insurance Company Limited to release an accidental claim of ₹2 lakh and pay ₹8,000 compensation to Naresh Kumar Jain of Rishi Nagar, who had submitted a complaint of deficient services.In his complaint, Jain claimed that the repudiation of the claim, of ₹2 lakh climbed after an insured car met with an accident, was wrong and amounted to deficiency of service on the part of the insurance company.A surveyor of the company had inspected the car after the accident, but no claim with regard to damages were paid. The insurer reasoned by saying that the complainant firm had no insurable interest in the car as one of the partners in the firm gifted the car to his daughter and delivered possession in 2006. The insurer had further said the same had been confirmed by Vipul Jain, son of Rajesh Chander Jain, the authorised signatory of the complainant firm.The Commission, in its order, observed that the insurance company has been accepting the annual premium of insurance from the complainant firm.“To prove the allegation that the car was gifted in the year 2006, no documentary evidence has been brought on record and the insurance company has relied upon just one evidence. Therefore, merely on the unproved allegations that the car has been gifted to the daughter of one of the partners of the complainant firm, the claim could not be validity repudiated when the complainant firm continues to be the registered owner of the car and has been getting insured it regularly,” the order read.The Commission further added that the insurance company shall consider and reimburse the claim in respect of the car as per the terms and conditions of the policy and also pay an additional ₹8,000 compensation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianaconsumer-disputes-redressal-commission-penalises-insurance-company-for-deficient-service-directs-it-to-release-accidental-claim-101642960143807.html
24-01-2022||Delhi||HC asks Delhi Police to explore feasibility of a ‘ballistics database’||New Delhi: The Delhi high court has asked the police force to explore the feasibility of maintaining a ‘ballistics database’ to connect each bulletto the weapon it was fired from.Hearing a 2018 anticipatory bail plea of an accused in an Arms Act case, justice Sanjeev Sachdeva said that the database, if created, could immensely help investigations and keep a check on the illegal firearms. The judge said that a committee constituted by the city police commissioner may consult the technical experts of Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory (CFSL) for the creation of such a database.“The committee appointed by the police commissioner, may also examine the possibility of creation of a Ballistic Database, where ballistic reports of all firearms, in respect of which licences are issued or which are endorsed on the licenses issued to public, can be stored so that the said database can be accessed in case of an investigation,” the court said in its order on January 10.In the 2018 anticipatory bail plea hearing, the court is examining the aspect that whenever any weapon is recovered, no fingerprints are taken from the weapon or the bullets/rounds/shells found in the weapon. In 2018, the court had noted the submission of the state’s counsel that there is no specific procedure laid down for investigating officers or other police officers for the same.During later proceedings, senior police officers had told the court that fingerprints from weapons and/or bullets/rounds/shells are taken on a case to case basis, depending on the facts and circumstances of each case.Even though the pre-arrest bail plea was later withdrawn after a few dates in 2018, the court continued to examine the aspect and conduct discussions with senior police officials on the issue.In February 2019, the court had suggested that the city police consider installing electronic sensors in the licensed firearms to monitor its GPS location and when the gun is fired, send alerts including the direction it is pointing and how many rounds were fired. The judge had also asked the city police to take cue from the global alternatives available.According to a 2019 news report, a Chinese firm, Beijing Bailineng Technology, developed a chip to pinpoint the location of firearms and trigger an alert when guns are taken out of designated areas. The firm had claimed that the chips used China’s BeiDou Navigation Satellite System to send real-time location to a control centre. Authorised handlers of the weapons would also be issued with BeiDou watches which will send alerts if they are separated from their firearms, with the aim of stopping the weapons falling into the hands of criminals, the report had said.However, the state’s counsel Hirein Sharma informed the court that installing GPS devices in licensed weapons “may not be a feasible option on the basis of the technical, financial and privacy concerns”.In a status report filed on January 15, the police said, “There are lakhs of different types of licensed weapons in the country and shall be a big challenge to install such type of additional fitment in all licensed firearms.” The report added that no such certified/patent company was found making such type of censors in India.Senior advocate and criminal lawyer Vikas Pahwa told HT that it is high time that India has a national database for firearms, ammunition and ballistic reports.“The access to ballistic reports can be of great help in investigations where arms are not connected with the fired bullets and cartridges in the crimes. Arms used in a crime in the past can be matched with the ammunition used again in a subsequent crime. Database can be accessed by the police all over the country. We need to use technology for expediting the process of investigations for an efficient criminal justice system in our country,” Pahwa said.On January 10, the court noted that the state’s status report is not on record and posted the matter for April.According to the Union ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), as many as 22,804 new gun licenses with all India permission have been issued by the government between January 2018 and September 2020. An overwhelming majority of these -- 17,905 – was issued to the residents of Jammu and Kashmir.According to the data, a total of 94,400 arms licences were renewed with all India permission between January 1, 2018, and September 15, 2020, of which 19,238 were in Uttar Pradesh, followed by Jammu and Kashmir (14,172) and Haryana (12,230).The maximum of 2,435 licenses cancelled nationwide between January 1, 2018, and September 15, 2020, were in Uttar Pradesh (1,911).
24-01-2022||Delhi||Rail body booked for felling 18 trees near Delhi’s Dwarka Sector 21||The state forest and wildlife department has booked the Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) for allegedly damaging or felling at least 18 fully-grown trees without permission at the site of the Bijwasan Rail Terminal Redevelopment Project near Dwarka’s Sector 21.Confirming the same, a senior forest official from the west division said, “During the first inspection, at least 18 trees were found to be damaged or cut. They (RLDA) could not show any permission during the inspection. An offence under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act (DPTA), 1994, has been filed against the agency and the hearing for this matter will take place in the first week of February.”The official said a second, detailed inspection will be carried out at the site to determine the extent of the damage.An RLDA official said that they did not seek any permission as the land was barren when the project was awarded eight years ago. “Over time, some trees have grown, but we have only cut smaller saplings to make room for trucks and supplies to reach the site. For the fully-grown trees, we will be applying for a permission,” said the official.HT had earlier reported how locals from the nearby Shahabad Mohammadpur village in Dwarka, along with a local NGO, had filed complaints with both the Delhi Police and the forest and wildlife department, alleging over 200 trees had already been felled from the forest patch behind Dwarka’s Sector 21 metro station. In their complaints, the locals had stated the RLDA, which is undertaking the redevelopment project, was unable to show them a permission to fell the trees.Naveen Solanki, a 20-year-old from the village who had alerted the forest department about the illegal tree felling, said the area was rich in biodiversity and had nilgai and other mammals too. “Deforestation work has only begun in the last two weeks or so. We were quick to object to it, the agency has no permission to cut these trees. An FIR has also been initiated to prevent trees from being cut any further,” he said.The Bijwasan railway station is undergoing an airport-style makeover on a public-private partnership (PPP) model. While the project was initially awarded to the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation (IRSDC), the government body was shut down last October and the project was later awarded to the Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) in December 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rail-body-booked-for-felling-18-trees-near-delhi-s-dwarka-sector-21-101642957863444.html
24-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: BJP, ally Apna Dal name candidates for seats in Azam Khan’s Rampur||The BJP ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) on Sunday named Haider Ali Khan, 32, as its candidate from the Swar Tanda seat in Rampur district for the UP polls, apparently sending a strong message with regard to Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Azam Khan’s political turf. The move comes days after the BJP fielded Akash Saxena, 46, the man behind 30 of the over 100 FIRs filed against Samajwadi Party veteran Azam Khan in its first list from the Rampur (Sadar) assembly seat. Azam Khan, currently a Lok Sabha MP from Rampur, has won the Rampur (Sadar) assembly seat a record nine times. Both Rampur (Sadar) and Swar Tanda assembly seats in Rampur district go to polls in the second phase of the seven-phase UP assembly elections on February 14. The BJP had released its first list of 107 candidates on January 15. It has named 195 candidates in four tranches so far.Azam Khan’s son Abdullah Azam had won the Swar Tanda seat in 2017 to become a first-time lawmaker. But in December 2019, he was disqualified for allegedly forging his birth certificate and for being below 25 years of age when he had filed his nomination on the seat. It is from Swar Tanda that Abdullah had defeated Haider’s father Kazim Ali Khan, a sitting four-term lawmaker in 2017. Haider is from the family of the Nawabs of Rampur, arch rivals of Rampur’s Lok Sabha MP Azam Khan, currently in jail. The BJP anticipates that the Samajwadi Party would again name Abdullah Azam, currently out on bail, on the seat for the UP polls.The Rampur (Sadar) is now held by Azam’s wife Tanzeen Fatima after Azam Khan became a Lok Sabha MP in the 2019 polls, defeating the BJP candidate, actor-turned-politician Jaya Prada.BJP leaders have been targeting the SP list. Party leaders admit that once Abdullah is named, they would again up the ante over “candidates being either in jail or out on bail”.The BJP top leadership held several rounds of discussion with its two other backward classes (OBC) allies in UP – Apna Dal (S) and Nishad Party – before finalising the seat-sharing pact for the UP polls, political leaders said. Political experts were quick to notice that the BJP’s arrangement with its OBC ally in Rampur’s Swar Tanda appears to be part of a carefully crafted plan in the context of Muslim votes on the seat that Abdullah had won despite a BJP wave in 2017. The victory was attributed to Azam Khan’s political clout in the region. Abdullah, who holds an engineering degree and who has learnt the nuances of political oratory from his father, was recently seen in a viral video, weeping bitterly while talking to his supporters about the plight of his parents – his mother Tanzeen Fatima, a former Rajya Sabha MP and current MLA from Rampur (Sadar), and MP father Azam Khan. While Tanzeen and Abdullah have got bail in all the cases against them, Azam is still to get it in a few cases. Haider Ali Khan was all set to be a Congress candidate before joining the Apna Dal (S) last week after some quick back-channel discussions he had with the BJP’s ally, which promptly declared him as its candidate on the seat. Haider, a graduate from University of Essex, is the lone candidate to be declared by the Apna Dal (S) on Sunday. “No more declarations for today,” the party’s spokesperson Rajesh Patel confirmed. Rampur has for decades been witness to a traditional political rivalry between Azam Khan and the Nawabs of Rampur, to whose family Haider belongs. Though Haider’s grandfather Zulfiqar and his grandmother Noor Bano have both been former MPs, and popular in the district, Azam Khan has dominated the politics of the district for decades. However, for all his political clout, Azam Khan’s victory margins had been dipping. He won by 60,000 votes in 2012 and by 47,000 votes in the 2017 elections. With him now embroiled in political controversies, and battling over 100 cases that have been filed against him since the BJP government came to power in 2017, political experts sense that the fight for Rampur could be an interesting one. In 2017, the BJP won two of the five assembly segments that make up the Rampur Lok Sabha seat.Now with Azam Khan unwell — twice during his jail term he had to be rushed to a hospital for treatment — the BJP is eyeing the assembly polls as its best chance to weaken Azam’s political hold, political experts say. During his rallies in UP, Union home minister Amit Shah has been targeting Azam Khan consistently. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, too, has not minced words in hitting out at Azam Khan. Besides the BJP, the Aam Aadmi Party candidate from Rampur (Sadar) seat – Faisal Lala – too is one who had been consistently targeting Azam Khan. “Khan sahib is hugely popular. Nothing can diminish his appeal here but yes, now, with him in jail and battling not just cases but ill health too, the opponents are targeting Rampur,” an Azam Khan aide said on condition of anonymity.

In addressing delegates, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organization’s director-general, urged collective vigilance in continuing to fight the pandemic. “There are different scenarios for how the pandemic could play out and how the acute phase could end. But it’s dangerous to assume that omicron will be the last variant or that we are in the endgame,” he said. “On the contrary, globally, the conditions are ideal for more variants to emerge.”The organization is asking member-states and donors for an additional $480 million for its next two-year budget period, including $430 million for its emergencies program to coordinate the global response to Covid-19.Tedros said that without the increase in funding, the WHO will be “set up to fail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-omicron-offers-plausible-hope-for-stabilization-normalization-of-pandemic-says-top-europe-s-top-who-official-101643046859807.html
24-01-2022||World||US lawsuits accuse Google of tracking data without users' permission||A group of top US justice officials accused Google in lawsuits Monday of tracking and profiting from users' location data, despite leading consumers to think they could protect their privacy on the tech giant's services.Google builds detailed profiles and sells highly targeted advertising with data collected from its billions of users – with the location being a key piece of information, argued the suits that seek to block the alleged practices."Google falsely led consumers to believe that changing their account and device settings would allow customers to protect their privacy," said Karl Racine, the attorney general in the nation's capital Washington.These suits are the latest legal threats against Google and other US Big Tech giants, which have long faced probes and court cases but a lack of new national laws that would regulate their businesses.Attorneys general -- states' top law enforcers and legal advisors -- from Indiana, Washington, and Texas were to file suits making the same allegations against the tech colossus.Google said the officials' claims were inaccurate and based on outdated assertions about its settings."We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data," Google said in a statement. "We will vigorously defend ourselves and set the record straight."Racine argued that from 2014 to at least 2019, Google claimed that users could turn off their "Location History" setting and "the places you go are no longer stored.""That is false. Even when Location History is off, Google continues to collect and store users' locations," Racine's office said in a statement.The officials also allege the Silicon Valley giant has used "dark patterns," or design tricks aimed at subtly influencing consumers' choices in ways that benefit the company.Racine's office cited the example of repeatedly prompting users to provide location in certain apps and claiming products would not function properly without it, when in fact location was not needed for the app."Even a limited amount of location data, aggregated over time, can expose a person's identity and routines," Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said in a statement.He noted that information can be used to infer "sensitive personal details" like political or religious beliefs, income, health, or life events like births and divorces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawsuits-accuse-google-of-tracking-data-without-users-permission-101643041713010.html
24-01-2022||World||After Covid-19, smog alert in Beijing ahead of Winter Olympics||After logging around 43 positive Covid-19 cases in little more than a week, Beijing’s notorious smog has re-emerged as a new irritant for the city days ahead of the Winter Olympics.Authorities have warned that weather conditions are likely to be extremely unfavourable during the Games, beginning on February 4, triggering heavy pollution. “The Beijing Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games coincide with the end of winter and the start of spring in northern China, when weather conditions are extremely unfavourable,” China’s environment ministry spokesperson Liu Youbin said on Monday.“When heavy pollution is predicted, all localities will launch emergency plans,” Liu was quoted as saying by Chinese state media.Beijing has experienced severe pollution in the last couple of days with concentrations of hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 at 205 micrograms per cubic metre on Monday morning. The World Health Organization says the count should not be more than 5.Liu said local authorities will initiate emergency responses to manage and control businesses and vehicles to tackle air pollution but balance it with economic activity.Meanwhile, the Games organisers have said that there have been 177 confirmed Covid-19 cases among 3,115 Olympics-related international arrivals from January 4 to January 23; one among who was an athlete or support staffer, as per Beijing 2022 data released on Sunday and Monday.Beijing on Monday reported nine locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, including five confirmed cases and four asymptomatic carriers until Sunday 4pm.Since January 15, the city has reported a total of 43 local Covid-19 cases, with six attributable to the Omicron variant and 37 to the Delta variant, Pang Xinghuo, deputy head of the municipal disease prevention and control centre was quoted as saying by the Xinhua news agency.Beijing 2022 eases Covid curbs for GamesThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Chinese authorities have lowered the threshold for producing a negative Covid-19 test for any participant arriving at the Games, dropping the cycle threshold (Ct) value from 40 to 35.A communication by Beijing 2022 was sent out on Sunday explaining the change, reports said.The changes, which take effect immediately and apply retrospectively, “have been developed in order to further adapt to the reality of the current environment and support the Games participants”, the IOC was quoted as saying in a statement.“The slight relaxing of rules for Games participants comes despite four more Chinese provinces finding recording infections linked to the Beijing cluster amid the Lunar New Year travel season,” Reuters said in a report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-covid-19-smog-alert-in-beijing-ahead-of-winter-olympics-101643037610055.html
24-01-2022||World||UK to end Covid-19 testing for fully vaccinated travellers||Fully vaccinated travellers entering England will soon be exempt from any Covid test requirements, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed on Monday.Speaking to reporters during a visit to a hospital in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, Johnson said the daily Omicron variant data is getting better and it was time for the country to be more open for travellers. Over the weekend, the UK recorded 74,799 cases and 75 Covid deaths.“Although we have to be cautious, we are now moving through the Omicron wave, and you can see the figures are starting to get better,” Johnson said.“So what we're doing on travel, to show that this country is open for business, open for travellers, you will see changes so that people arriving no longer have to take tests if they have been vaccinated, if they have been double vaccinated," he said.Fully vaccinated travellers currently need to do a lateral flow or PCR test within two days of arriving in England after a pre-arrival test requirement was done away with earlier this week. The devolved regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland usually adopt similar rules on travel.UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is expected to make a statement in the House of Commons outlining the Covid travel update when the exact time frame for the rule changes is likely to be confirmed.The move will be welcomed by the travel and tourism industry, one of the sectors most badly affected worldwide by coronavirus lockdown measures. There had been widespread calls for the government to abandon the burden of tests for those who have had at least two doses of a Covid vaccine.The government has indicated that the third booster dose is also likely to be added to the so-called Covid vaccine pass to qualify as fully vaccinated, sometime in the future.Under current rules, travellers who are not fully vaccinated must take a pre-departure test and two post-arrival PCR tests, which are more expensive than the lateral flow version. They must also self-isolate for 10 days.From Thursday, England’s stricter Plan B restrictions come to an end, which means Covid passes for entry to larger venues, and the mandatory wearing of face masks will be scrapped and people are no longer being told to work from home. It follows an announcement in Parliament last week confirming that the Omicron wave has most likely peaked in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-end-covid-19-testing-for-fully-vaccinated-travellers-101643033844328.html
24-01-2022||World||Taliban hold first talks in Europe since Afghan takeover||The Taliban and western diplomats have began their first official talks in Europe since they took over control of Afghanistan in August.The closed-door meetings were taking place at a hotel in the snow-capped mountains above the Norwegian capital. Taliban representatives will be certain to press their demand that nearly $10 billion frozen by the United States and other Western countries be released as Afghanistan faces a precarious humanitarian situation.“We are requesting them to unfreeze Afghan assets and not punish ordinary Afghans because of the political discourse,” said Taliban delegate Shafiullah Azam on Sunday night. “Because of the starvation, because of the deadly winter, I think it’s time for the international community to support Afghans, not punish them because of their political disputes.”Ahead of the talks, western diplomats met with Afghan women’s rights activists and human rights defenders to hear from civil society in Afghanistan and the Afghan diaspora about their demands and assessment of the current situation on the ground. The meeting was attended by representatives of the EU, the U.S., Britain, France, Italy and hosts Norway.Standing silent as attendees gathered, women's rights activist Heda Khamoush, who lives in Kabul, held up the photos of Tamana Zaryabi Paryani and Parwana Ibrahimkhel, two women arrested by the Taliban last week following an anti-Taliban protest against the compulsory Islamic headscarf, or hijab, for women. They haven't been seen since.Rejecting the accusation the Taliban had abducted them, Azam said he was “not aware of that” and suggested activists may be using this event to seek asylum.Speaking after the meeting, women’s rights activist Mahbouba Seraj angrily rejected this and warned that “if they continue this way —to tell us something and do something else — that’s when the trust is going to break, completely."The three-day talks opened on Sunday with direct meetings between the Taliban and civil society representatives.A joint statement tweeted overnight by Zabihullah Mujahid, the Afghan deputy culture and information minister, said “participants of the meeting recognized that understanding and joint cooperation are the only solutions to all the problems of Afghanistan,” and emphasized that “all Afghans need to work together for better political, economic and security outcomes in the country.”Seraj acknowledged the progress made. “Yes, they were listening. I should say that," she said Monday morning. "We gave them a paper. We asked them what we wanted. They took it. They were very, very cordial about it.”The talks come at a crucial time for Afghanistan as freezing temperatures are compounding misery from the downward spiral that has come with the fall of the U.S.-backed government and the Taliban takeover.Aid groups and international agencies estimate about 23 million people, more than half the country, face severe hunger and nearly 9 million are on the brink of starvation. People have resorted to selling possessions to buy food, burning furniture for warmth and even selling their children. The United Nations has managed to provide some liquidity and allowed the Taliban administration to pay for imports, including electricity.Faced with the Taliban’s request for funds, Western powers are likely to put the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan high on their agenda, along with the West’s recurring demand for the Taliban administration to share power with Afghanistan’s minority ethnic and religious groups.Since sweeping to power in mid-August, the Taliban have imposed widespread restrictions, many of them directed at women. Women have been banned from many jobs outside the health and education fields, their access to education has been restricted beyond sixth grade and they have been ordered to wear the hijab. The Taliban have, however, stopped short of imposing the burqa, which was compulsory when they previously ruled Afghanistan in the 1990s.The Taliban have increasingly targeted Afghanistan’s beleaguered rights groups, as well as journalists, detaining and sometimes beating television crews covering demonstrations.A U.S. delegation, led by Special Representative for Afghanistan Tom West, plans to discuss “the formation of a representative political system; responses to the urgent humanitarian and economic crises; security and counterterrorism concerns; and human rights, especially education for girls and women,” according to a statement released by the U.S. State Department.The Scandinavian country, home to the Nobel Peace Prize, is no stranger to diplomacy. It has been involved in peace efforts in a number of countries, including Mozambique, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Colombia, the Philippines, Israel and the Palestinian Territories, Syria, Myanmar, Somalia, Sri Lanka and South Sudan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-hold-first-talks-in-europe-since-afghan-takeover-101643023442696.html

"The respondent's application for leave to appeal to the supreme court is refused."This means the Supreme Court will have to decide whether or not it should hear his challenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-wins-permission-to-appeal-against-extradition-to-us-101643022096408.html

We cannot let it continue to drag on, lurching between panic and neglect,” the WHO chief was quoted as saying by Reuters.Ghebreyesus made the statements during the 150th session of the WHO Executive Board meeting. During the week-long meeting, several key elements of the United Nation health agency, including Ghebreyesus' second term as the director general, and a proposal to make the agency more financially independent, are expected to be discussed, Reuters said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-conditions-are-ideal-for-more-covid-variants-to-emerge-who-chief-101643018361484.html
24-01-2022||World||Pakistan swears in Ayesha Malik as first woman supreme court judge||Pakistan swore in Ayesha Malik as its first female supreme court judge on Monday, a landmark occasion in a nation where activists say the law is often wielded against women.Malik attended a ceremony in the capital Islamabad where she now sits on the bench alongside 16 male colleagues at Pakistan's highest court."It's a huge step forward," lawyer and women's rights activist Nighat Dad told AFP."It is history in the making for Pakistan's judiciary."Malik was educated at Harvard University and served as a high court judge in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore for the past two decades.She has been credited with rolling back patriarchal legal mores in her Punjab province jurisdiction.Last year she outlawed a deeply invasive and medically discredited examination used to determine a woman's level of sexual experience.Women in Pakistan often struggle to gain justice in rape and sexual assault cases, and the test was deployed as a means of discrediting victims by casting aspersion on their character.Malik's elevation to the apex court of Pakistan may clear the way for more women to enter the historically conservative and male-dominated judiciary of the Islamic republic."She has broken all barriers in the judicial system and it will allow other women in the system to move forward," said lawyer and women's rights activist Khadija Siddiqi."I hope this will lead to more women-centric decisions by the judiciary in the future."But her appointment has been mired in controversy for the past four months, with claims she jumped a queue of more senior male candidates qualified for the post.Earlier this month the Pakistan Bar Council staged a strike to protest against Malik's nomination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-swears-in-ayesha-malik-as-first-woman-supreme-court-judge-101643017938576.html
24-01-2022||World||Mexican journalist murdered in Tijuana, second in less than a week||A journalist was killed in Tijuana Sunday, the local prosecutor said, the second media worker murdered in less than a week in the northern Mexican border city.Lourdes Maldonado Lopez was "attacked with a firearm while she was in a vehicle," said the Baja California state prosecutor's office.Mexico is one of the world's deadliest countries for reporters.Media rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders regularly ranks it alongside Afghanistan and Yemen among the world's most dangerous places for news media.Maldonado had worked for several media outlets, including Primer Sistema de Noticias (PSN), which is owned by Jaime Bonilla, who was governor of Baja California from 2019 to the end of 2021.She won a lawsuit a few days ago against PSN, which she had been suing for nine years for unfair dismissal, Mexican press reported.Two years ago, Maldonado had asked Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador for "support, help and justice" as she feared for her life, according to a video republished on social media after news broke of her assassination."I have been on trial for six years with him," she added about the governor, during one of Obrador's press conferences.NGO the Committee to Protect Journalists said on Twitter it was "shocked by the murder of Lourdes Maldonado, the second reporter to be killed in the city of Tijuana in less than a week."The group called on local authorities to "thoroughly and transparently investigate the attack."Its representative in Mexico, Jan-Albert Hootsen, added that he was "shocked and horrified by four brutal attacks on journalists in Mexico in barely two weeks," including a non-fatal knife attack on a media worker in Merida, Yucatan state.On Monday, photojournalist Margarito Martinez was found dead near his home in the city.The 49-year-old, who specialized in news related to the police, had a gunshot wound to the head, according to prosecutors.Authorities were also urged to investigate an attack earlier this month that led to the death of journalist and social media activist Jose Luis Gamboa in the eastern state of Veracruz.Gamboa was taken to the hospital on January 10 after he was stabbed and left lying on the street, but his body was not identified until Friday.It was unclear if the killing was related to his work.At least seven journalists were murdered in Mexico in 2021, according to an AFP count, although it has not been determined if all the killings were linked to their work.More than 100 reporters have been murdered since 2000 in Mexico and only a fraction of the crimes have resulted in convictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexican-journalist-murdered-in-tijuana-second-in-less-than-a-week-101643011033538.html
24-01-2022||World||‘Leave Ukraine’: US tells American citizens, families of diplomats amid tensions||WASHINGTON: As diplomatic talks over Ukraine fail to yield a breakthrough, and tensions with Russia deepen, the United States has ordered family members of its diplomats to leave Ukraine, and advised all US citizens to do the same, citing “the increased threat of Russian military action”. In an advisory on Sunday night, the US state department authorised the “voluntary departure” of US direct hire employees, and “ordered the departure of eligible family members” from its embassy in Kiev “due to the continued threat of Russian military action”. The advisory added that US citizens in Ukraine “should consider departing now using commercial or other privately available transportation options”.“There are reports Russia is planning significant military action against Ukraine. The security conditions, particularly along Ukraine’s borders, in Russia-occupied Crimea, and in Russia-controlled eastern Ukraine, are unpredictable and can deteriorate with little notice. Demonstrations, which have turned violent at times, regularly occur throughout Ukraine, including in Kiev.” In an additional nudge, the advisory said that US citizens “should be aware that Russian military action anywhere in Ukraine would severely impact” the American embassy’s ability to provide consular services, including assistance to citizens in departing Ukraine. The advisory comes in the backdrop of US President Joe Biden saying last week that while he thought Russian president Vldimir Putin would invade Ukraine. It also comes in the backdrop of sustained diplomatic talks between the US and Russia, including most recently in Geneva where secretary of state Antony Blinken met his Russian counterpart, foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, that have not yielded a breakthrough – during the talks, Blinken agreed to give written US responses to Russian security proposals, while reiterating the US demand that Russia de-escalate its military presence along Ukraine’s borders. It also comes in the backdrop of the United Kingdom claiming, based on intelligence assessments, that Moscow had plans to destabilise the government in Kiev and install a pro-Russian leader in power. Over the weekend, Biden also met his national security team at Camp David to review the situation, where, according to a report in The New York Times, the administration considered the option of sending 1,000 to 5,000 troops to NATO allies in eastern Europe – with the option of increasing the number 10-fold.Following the advisory, a senior state department official, “These decisions were made out of an abundance of caution due to continued Russian efforts to destabilise the country and undermine the security of Ukrainian citizens and others visiting or residing in Ukraine.” Also Read: US signal to China: Stay away from Taiwan during Ukraine crisisReferring to Biden’s statement that military action could take place at any time, the official said that the US government would then not be in a position to evacuate its citizens.But the official added that while these decisions were meant for the safety of its citizens and government employees, they do not undermine US support for Ukraine, and the American embassy would continue to operate. “In addition to our diplomatic coordination, we are assisting Ukraine with new lethal defensive security assistance, including ammunition for the front-line defenders of Ukraine. The first of several shipments for Ukrainian armed forces, totalling $200 million, arrived in Kiev on January 22, and more will arrive in weeks to come. With this new authorisation, the United States has committed more than $650 million of security assistance to Ukraine in the past year and more than $2.7 billion in total US security assistance to Ukraine since 2014.”When asked if the experience in Afghanistan – where the sudden Taliban takeover in Afghanistan had left many stranded, provoking widespread criticism of the Biden administration back at home – had prompted the advisory, the senior official quoted above said, “I can say for my part, this is very much a decision that is focused on the situation in Ukraine and what is best for embassy Kiev and American citizens in Ukraine.”

Here's what WHO has to say||With Omicron overtaking pre-existing coronavirus variants like Alpha, Beta and the deadly Delta across the world at a rapid pace, the World Health Organization's technical lead has urged to remain cautious as the variant is ‘efficiently transmitted between people’.Replying to query at a programme, WHO technical lead Maria Van Kerkhove said that Omicron is less severe than Delta but it can still lead to the full spectrum of disease as seen in the previous strains. "People who are infected with Omicron have the full spectrum of disease, everything from asymptomatic infection all the way through severe disease and death," she replied to a question on why people still ended up in the hospital or died."People with underlying conditions, people with advanced age, people who are unvaccinated can have a severe form of Covid-19 following infection from Omicron," Kerkhove said.On a query regarding if everyone will eventually get Omicron, the WHO tech lead said, "Omicron is overtaking Delta in terms of circulation, and it is very efficiently transmitted between people."Also Read | ‘Omicron will find everybody’: Fauci as US on 'threshold' of living with CovidKerkhove noted that although cases were high around the world, it still did not mean that everybody will get Omicron.The UN health agency had previously said that the preliminary evidence indicates that the available vaccines against Covid-19 may be less effective against Omicron transmission, which also carries a higher risk of reinfection."As a result of this, the overall risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron remains very high," it had said earlier this month.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had also reiterated that the pandemic was far from over. "This pandemic is nowhere near over," he had told reporters from the agency's headquarters in Geneva in response to people dismissing Omicron as a mild infection.Currently, the United States is at the top of the chart for coronavirus cases, followed by India at the second spot.However, US President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci has expressed optimism that the Omicron surge will soon peak, though the decline won’t be uniform throughout the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-everyone-get-infected-with-omicron-here-s-what-who-has-to-say-101642994501057.html
24-01-2022||World||Faculty members oppose caste in US university's non-discriminatory policy||Over 80 faculty members of the prestigious California State University have opposed a recent announcement of the university to include caste in its non-discriminatory policy as a "misguided overreach", saying it will actually cause discrimination by unconstitutionally singling out Hindu faculty of Indian and South Asian descent.According to the anti-discrimination policy recently announced by the California State University (CSU), caste-oppressed students will now be able to report anti-Dalit bias, which many students claim is a regular occurrence.According to the Dalit civil rights organisation Equity Labs, Dalit people are those who are at the bottom of India’s social caste system, one that is estimated to be thousands of years old, and who face discrimination and violence. They used to be called “untouchables” in India.Discrimination because of one’s caste status has been outlawed in India, but the practice continues, even in South Asian diasporas in the US, it said.In a blistering letter to the CSU Board of Trustees opposing the move to include caste in its non-discriminatory policy, the faculty members have written that the new policy would unfairly target a minority community for policing and disparate treatment.Adding caste as a specific and separate protected category would apply only to the faculty of Indian and South Asian descent, they said."The addition of caste is a misguided overreach given the existence of comprehensive policies that already protect against various forms of discrimination" said Praveen Sinha, professor of accountancy at CSU, Long Beach."We cannot but oppose the unique risk that CSU's move puts on us as they add a category that is only associated with people of Indian descent such as myself and thousands of other faculty and students in the CSU system. It is going to create divisions where they simply do not exist," he added.The faculty members have written that there are more than 600 CSU faculty of Indian and South Asian origin who would be rendered vulnerable should the collective bargaining agreement be passed as currently written, according to a media release."As a faculty member of Indian origin, I am well aware that discrimination is a daily reality for many students of varied backgrounds, and there is a robust mechanism to address all such complaints under the existing laws and the CSU policy," said Sunil Kumar, professor of engineering at the San Diego State University."But this policy change has been made in the absence of any scientifically reliable evidence or data. Rather than redressing discrimination, it will actually cause discrimination by unconstitutionally singling out and targeting Hindu faculty of Indian and South Asian descent as members of a suspect class because of deeply entrenched, false stereotypes about Indians, Hindus and caste," he said."We are disappointed that the CSU faculty association championed this move without holding discussions with the faculty concerned, even when three professors had alerted them way back in May 2021. In their meeting with these three professors on January 14 this year, some of the CFA leaders admitted that they did not understand the complexity of caste and that they dropped the ball," Kumar said.Earlier, lawyers at the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), Suhag Shukla, Samir Kalra and Nikhil Joshi, also sent a letter to the CSU Board of Trustees, the CSU Office of General Counsel, the CSU chancellor and the president of the California Faculty Association on behalf of the CSU faculty."It is simply unfathomable how system-wide leaders and a faculty union, which is contractually obligated to protect and represent all of its members regardless of their background, could negotiate a clause that will discriminate against faculty of a particular background or faith, especially where existing laws and policies already provide redress," Shukla said.Scheduled Castes is the official term for Dalits as per the Constitution of India. They were excluded from the four-fold varna system of Hinduism and were seen as forming a fifth varna.Although the caste system was abolished in India, discrimination is still rampant in many places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/faculty-members-oppose-caste-in-us-university-s-non-discriminatory-policy-101642996232975.html
24-01-2022||World||Omicron spread: Daily cases in US drop, anti-curbs protest continue in Belgium||The Omicron variant of coronavirus continues to spread rapidly all across the globe with a massive surge in daily infections.The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Sunday that Omicron is less severe than Delta but is still a dangerous variant. Unvaccinated people, those at advanced age and with underlying conditions can have a severe form of Covid-19 following infection from Omicron, the global health body added.Omicron is currently the dominant variant in the European Union with a 78% pooled prevalence. In the United States, daily infections have begun to fall, indicating that Omicron is relenting. On the other hand, in India, the spread of the variant has reached the community transmission stage.Here are the latest updates on Omicron from across the world:> Russia's daily Covid-19 cases spiked for the third consecutive day with the highest ever single-day surge on Sunday at 63,205. According to authorities, Omicron has so far been detected in 64 of the 89 regions in the country.> In South Korea, daily cases shot up to 7,630 in the last 24 hours, the second highest single day spike seen in the country since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. The government is currently working towards a plan to change the medical response system to contain the spread of Omicron.> Even though the national daily tally of Covid-19 has started falling, in the United States indicating that the Omicron variant is relenting, fatalities are still surging, according to a report by the New York Times.> Protests in Brussels against the restrictions imposed to curb the spread of Omicron continue with police resorting to water cannon trucks firing powerful jets and tear gas to disperse the protesters.> Amid the variant's surge in New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called off her wedding. The government has pushed back its phased border reopening until the end of February, according to a report by CNN.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-spread-daily-cases-in-us-drop-anti-curbs-protest-continue-in-belgium-101642990765317.html
24-01-2022||World||US signal to China: Stay away from Taiwan during Ukraine crisis||With two nuclear powered aircraft carrier strike groups patrolling the Philippines Sea and another one forwardly deployed to Yokosuka, Japan, the US has sent a strong message to China to stay away from Taiwan while the former is locked with Russia over Ukraine.The PLA on Sunday responded to the massive US naval drills by sending as many as 39 warplanes, largely fighters like J-10 and J-16, into Taiwan’s south-western air defense identification zone (ADIZ) as tensions escalated over the breakaway island country. The Taiwan air force resumed combat air patrol and activated surface to air missile systems to deter the aggressive PLA Air Force. This is the first time after October 2021 that the PLA has responded to US drills with so many fighters.This large-scale Taiwan airspace transgression by Chinese fighter took place when the US Navy has three aircraft carrier strike groups in support of Taipei and freedom of navigation operations in Philippines Sea. While USS Carl Vinson and Abraham Lincoln are patrolling near Taiwan, the USS Ronald Reagan is on standby near Yokosuka in Japan. The US has also large scale marine presence with presence of USS Essex amphibious ready group and USS America expeditionary strike group joining the aircraft carriers. Patrolling with the massive carrier force is Japanese Hyuga class helicopter destroyer with USS strike groups deploying as many as 26 F-35 fifth generation fighters.The US Navy build-up near Taiwan is a clear message to China that it cannot have a free pass to Taipei while Washington is locked up in a confrontation with Russia over Ukraine. “The message to China is that US has not taken off its eyes from Beijing and wants PLA to stay away from Taiwan till such time the Ukraine crisis gets resolved,” said a former Indian ambassador to US.Since the US-Russia escalation over Ukraine has started, many believed that this would give President Xi Jinping a free pass to aggressively pursue what China calls its core interests. The Biden administration has this month already conveyed to China that it is watching PLA build-up in Ladakh as the India-China stand-off on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) completes second winter on Tibetan plateau.
24-01-2022||World||China sends 39 warplanes into Taiwan defence zone, largest incursion in months||China sent 39 warplanes – mostly fighter jets – into Taiwan's air defence zone on Sunday, the island's government said, in the largest daily incursion since October.Taiwan lives under the constant threat of invasion by China, which sees the self-ruled, democratic island as part of its territory to eventually be reclaimed, by force if necessary.The final quarter of 2021 saw a massive spike of incursions from China into Taiwan's air defence identification zone (ADIZ), with the biggest single day coming on October 4, when 56 Chinese warplanes entered the zone.Taiwan's defence ministry said in a statement late Sunday it scrambled its own aircraft to broadcast warnings and deployed missiles to track 39 Chinese jets that entered the ADIZ.The incursions included 24 J-16 fighters -- which experts say are among China's favourite jets for testing Taiwan's air defences -- 10 J-10 fighters and one nuclear-capable H-6 bomber.Taiwan only started regularly publicising its data on air incursions in September 2020.October remains the busiest month on record, with 196 incursions, 149 of which were made over just four days as Beijing marked its annual National Day.The defence zone is not the same as Taiwan's territorial airspace but includes a far greater area that overlaps with part of China's own ADIZ.Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taiwan since Tsai Ing-wen was elected president in 2016, as she views the island as a sovereign nation and not part of "one China".Last year, Taiwan recorded 969 incursions by Chinese warplanes into its ADIZ, according to a database compiled by AFP -- more than double the roughly 380 carried out in 2020.Taiwan's air force has suffered a string of fatal accidents in recent years as its ageing fleet is kept under constant pressure by China.The air force temporarily grounded all F-16 fighters earlier this month after one of its most advanced F-16V jets crashed into the sea during a routine training mission, killing one pilot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sends-39-warplanes-into-taiwan-defence-zone-largest-incursion-in-months-101642992603287.html
24-01-2022||World||US advises citizens against travel to Russia amid tensions on Ukraine border||The United States has warned its citizens against travelling to Russia in the wake of tensions on the border with Ukraine. Russia has amassed 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border, a move which the US-led countries say is a prelude to war."Do not travel to Russia due to ongoing tension along the border with Ukraine," a statement from the US State Department said, adding that Americans could also face "harassment" and that the embassy would have "limited ability to assist US citizens."The families of American diplomats in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv have been ordered to leave the country “due to the continued threat of a Russian invasion”.Along with troops, Russia has also deployed tanks, fighting vehicles, artillery and missiles on its border with Ukraine.Intense diplomatic efforts have been launched to convince Russia to tone down its aggressive posturing but they have yielded little results.The Kremlin has so far denied any intentions to invade its neighbour - but is making de-escalation conditional on treaties guaranteeing non-expansion of Natos, especially to Ukraine, and a withdrawal of the alliance from Eastern Europe.On Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken dismissed the idea of slapping punitive sanctions on Moscow before any potential invasion, saying they should be used as a means of "dissuading" an attack.However, British Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab warned Russia of “severe consequences” if it tries to invade Ukraine or install a puppet regime there.The minister made the accusation while speaking to Sky News on Saturday, also saying that Russian intelligence officers had been in contact with a number of former Ukrainian politicians as part of plans for an invasion.The New York Times said that US President Joe Biden was mulling plans to send 1,000 to 5,000 troops to Eastern European countries, with the possibility of increasing the number should tensions flare further.The United States has described the alleged plotting over Ukraine as deeply concerning, and US officials said they were bracing for Russian action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-advises-citizens-against-travel-to-russia-amid-tensions-on-ukraine-border-101642990982980.html
24-01-2022||World||New COVID-19 rapid tests to arrive in US schools this week: White House||US schools should receive the first additional COVID-19 rapid tests being made available by the federal government in about two weeks, a White House official said, as Washington races to keep classes open amid a record-setting Omicron surge.The new tests must be ordered through state governments, but the White House is also making available lab capacity to support five million monthly PCR tests that schools can order themselves if their states are not being helpful, the official said. Those should arrive in seven to 10 days.The Biden administration on Wednesday announced a new set of measures to keep classes open, including doubling COVID-19 testing capacity in schools with 10 million more tests, as the Omicron variant spreads rapidly through the United States.COVID-19 hospitalizations in the United States have increased by about 33% and deaths are up by about 40% from a week earlier, Rochelle Walensky, head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said on Wednesday.The Biden administration has urged states to spend $10 billion in resources distributed to them for testing under coronavirus legislation signed into law last year, although some have been slow to disburse the funds, the official said.Education sources said some school districts in states such as Pennsylvania, Texas and elsewhere have struggled to get access to tests, partly due to differences over safety protocols, as well as supply constraints."We don't want any state to stand in the way. Period," said the official, adding the administration would find other ways to provide resources to schools if they ran into trouble with their state governments."We've been really trying hard to make sure that everyone knows all the resources that are available to them right now," the official said.The U.S. Department of Education last year provided grant funding to a Florida school district that had state funds withheld because it mandated students wear masks in defiance of the Republican governor's ban on such mandates.The issue of school closures has remained politicized and contentious, but the White House says nearly 96% of schools nationwide held in-person classes this month, up from 46% of schools in January 2021.The official said the extra rapid tests would come from a "dedicated portion" of an existing contract, and sufficient capacity would be available given contracts the administration is now signing to procure 500 million rapid tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-rapid-tests-to-arrive-in-us-schools-this-week-white-house-101642989886505.html

Police said more than 60 people were arrested, with three officers and 12 demonstrators taken to hospital.Belgium announced a slight easing of coronavirus restrictions on Friday despite record infections, but also said people must have booster shots after five months to keep passes for bars, cinemas and many other public spaces.‘Anti-dictator, not anti-vaxxer’ “I'm angry about the blackmail that the government is doing,” said protester Caroline van Landuyt, who had herself been vaccinated. Her children did not want to be inoculated but had to so as to travel and play sport, she said.Sunday's scenes in the Belgian capital were reminiscent of clashes last November, when around 35,000 protesters took to Brussels' streets and there was also violence.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell thanked police and condemned "the senseless destruction and violence" in a tweet that showed him standing in front of a broken pane of glass.Some protesters let off fireworks as police advanced into a park. Riot officers ringed the water cannon. "I'm not an anti-vaxxer, I'm anti-dictator," read another placard.Belgium is facing a fifth wave of Covid-19 infections, with the peak not expected for at least a couple of weeks.Some 89% of Belgian adults are fully vaccinated and 67% have now also received a booster shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/belgian-police-fire-water-cannon-tear-gas-during-protest-against-covid-curbs-vaccine-passes-101642981802848.html

24-01-2022||India||Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM to field candidates for 24 Bihar legislative council seats||The All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) is set to field its nominees in all 24 constituencies for the upcoming legislative council elections, likely in February-March this year. State AIMIM chief and member of the legislative assembly from Amaur Akhtarul Iman said that the party has decided to contest all local bodies’ seats of the council alone or in adjustment with like-minded parties. “A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting attended by the party MLAs and other senior functionaries on the direction of national party chief Asaduddin Owaisi. The party will also field its nominees in the by-elections for Bochahan assembly constituency in Muzaffarpur,” announced Iman, while talking to the media in Kishanganj. This is for the first time that the AIMIM is gearing up for the upper house elections. Earlier the party had contested 20 seats in the 2020 assembly elections from north eastern districts of Bihar in alliance with Upendra Kushwaha-led RLSP and Mayawati-led BSP, and won five seats. It was the first electoral success of the party in Bihar. Iman said that the massive support of the people during the past assembly polls had emboldened the party to fight the by-election at Bochahan seat, which fell vacant on the demise of Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) MLA Musafir Paswan, who died in November last year after prolonged illness. The State AIMIM chief claimed that the party was approach by many leaders, who are capable enough to wrest the seats for the party in the council. “We are confident of having party members in the upper house,” said Iman. The election from local bodies constituencies to the council was due since July last year. Elected members of the panchayati raj institutions and the urban local bodies are the electors for the council elections from the local bodies’ seats, which spread across the state. The election on these seats could not be held owing to delay in PRI and urban bodies’ elections in the aftermath of Covid-19 pandemic. 
24-01-2022||India||KCR writes to Modi, opposes changes to IAS rules for deputation to Centre||Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday expressed strong reservations against the proposed amendments to the All India Services (Cadre) Rules, 1954, by the Centre, seeking to acquire overriding powers to transfer IAS and IPS officers through Central deputation and doing away with the requirement of taking the approval of state governments.The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) wrote to the states on January 12 that the Union government proposes to amend Rule 6 (deputation of cadre officers) of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules 1954.So far, 10 opposition chief ministers including KCR have opposed the proposed amendment to the rules, even though the Central government has said that the change was proposed to meet shortage of officials in Central departments and ministries.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Telangana chief minister said the proposed amendments were totally against the federal structure of the Indian Constitution, both in letter and spirit. “They will also seriously erode the All-India Service character of the IAS, IPS and IFS. We, therefore, strongly oppose the proposed amendments,” he wrote.KCR, as the chief minister is called, said considering the criticality of functions discharged by IAS officers in the states, the present rule position and practice provides for concurrence of state governments in the matter of deputation of officers to the Central government.He said the Central Government assuming the power to take officers on deputation without concurrence of the officers or state governments concerned is a dangerous move which is against the Constitutional framework and spirit of cooperative federalism.“If the proposed amendments are effected by the Centre, the state governments would be reduced to insignificant entities,” he said.Pointing out that the proposal is clearly a move to exercise indirect control by the Central government on officers working in the states, the chief minister said it amounted to interfering in the functioning of the state governments, targeted harassment of officers and their demoralisation, besides impacting accountability of officers to the state governments.KCR said the amendments were nothing but amending the Constitution of India relating to Centre-State relations. “Instead of such a backdoor method of amending the AIS Rules, Govt. of India should muster courage to amend the provisions by the Parliament,” he said.He further said the proposal showed scant regard for the administrative exigencies and requirements of the states. They threaten the spirit of mutual adjustment and accommodation between states and Central governments in the matter of shared All-India Services and will further strain the Centre-State relationship.“I demand that the Centre cease and desist from the proposed amendments in the interest of administrative fairness and federal polity of our constitution,” KCR added.

24-01-2022||India||Bengal BJP suspends two former vice-presidents who joined dissidents||A day after the West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) issued show-cause letters to two of its former state vice-presidents, Jay Prakash Majumdar and Ritesh Tiwari, charging them with making statements against the party, both were “temporarily suspended” on Monday evening, before they could reply to the letters. As cracks in the Bengal BJP widened, the party’s media cell released the suspension order issued at the direction of state president Sukanta Majumdar. “The two persons (Majumdar and Tiwari) are being temporarily suspended till the investigation into charges of violating party discipline is not over,” said the one-line order. Tiwari was attending a live television show on a popular channel when the news broke. “Sukanta Majumdar is a good person but he is under tremendous pressure from state general secretary (organisation) Amitava Chakraborty and Amit Malviya (head of the BJP’s national information technology cell). This is a conspiracy to destroy the Bengal BJP. There are leaders in the current setup who have taken favours from the Trinamool Congress (TMC)….. These people have no support base. I don’t care if they expel me. I am not leaving the party. I will create such a situation that they will be compelled to apologize and take me back,” Tiwari said on the live show, virtually announcing a war on the leadership. BJP’s former state president and former governor of Meghalaya and Tripura, Tathagata Roy, said: “I am surprised. Tiwari is an old and sincere worker. The show-cause letter did not mention any charge. They were not given the opportunity to reply. It is apparent that the decision to suspend them was taken much earlier.” Neither Amitava Chakraborty nor Malviya made any statement till 9.30 pm Hours before the suspension order was issued, Tiwari alleged that the action was taken without any meeting of the state disciplinary action committee. “How could there be a meeting of the state disciplinary action committee? Sukanta Majumdar has dissolved all committees till the new ones are formed. Members of the old committee told me no meeting was held,” Tiwari told HT. Sukanta Majumdar, on the other hand, maintained during a press conference on Monday afternoon that the committee took the decision. He also said similar action might be taken against some of the other senior leaders who have criticized the party in public in recent times. “There are disciplinary action committees at various levels. All leaders are under watch,” said Majumdar. Tiwari had also alleged on Sunday that the letters were leaked to the media before the intended recipients received them. “The party will probe this. Show cause letters are e-mailed,” said Majumdar, adding that the party expects a reply as early as possible although the letters did not mention any deadline. The suspension order was issued four hours later. Jay Prakash Majumdar and Tiwari were dropped from the state committee on December 22 when the Bengal unit announced the names of 11 new vice-presidents, five general secretaries, 42 organizational district unit presidents, 12 state secretaries, the new morcha (front) presidents and the heads of several cells. Several old-timers such as Pratap Banerjee, Biswapriyo Roy Chowdhury, Union minister of state Dr Subhas Sarkar, Raj Kamal Pathak and Debasish Mitra were also dropped from the panel of vice-presidents. Jay Prakash Majumdar was made a spokesperson while the others were left with no portfolio. General secretary Sayantan Basu was dropped as well. Most of these leaders left the Bengal BJP’s WhatsApp groups. The rejig led to repercussions in at least five districts and also left leaders from the Dalit Matua community, headed by union minister of state Shantanu Thakur, upset. The dissidents got united under Thakur’s leadership. Thakur demanded the removal of Amitava Chakraborty, holding him responsible for the crucial organizational changes. Following the protests, Sukanta Majumdar dissolved the cells and departments on January 13. The party also postponed the formation of district committees. Senior state BJP leaders said Thakur held a meeting with the dissidents for more than two hours on Sunday and met some leaders of the Matua community on Monday. Leaders in Thakur’s camp said he may meet BJP national president J P Nadda and Union home minster Amit Shah with the Matua community’s demand for immediate implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The law offers citizenship to non-Muslims who entered India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh before 2015. The Matuas are a part of the large Dalit Namasudra community that migrated from East Pakistan (Now Bangladesh) during India’s partition in 1947 and the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War to escape religious persecution. Sukanta Majumdar said a Union minister can meet Nadda any time. “The Matua organisations are not part of the BJP. They are independent. They can always seek an appointment with Shah as he announced the Centre’s decisions on the CAA,” Majumdar added. Trinamool Congress (TMC) Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said the dissidence in the BJP state unit is exposing its weakness. “Some dissident leaders may wish to switch sides but our party has not given any thought to it so far,” said Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-bjp-suspends-two-former-vice-presidents-who-joined-dissidents-101643043970593.html

24-01-2022||India||Bihar goes slow on Omicron testing, lone lab runs out of reagents||The molecular biology laboratory at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), Bihar’s lone setup approved by the Indian SARS CoV-2 Consortium of Genomic Sequencing (INSACOG) for whole genomic sequencing, a test to ascertain the strain of coronavirus, has run out of reagents. This has slowed down the process to ascertain the strain of coronavirus, despite Omicron having reached the community spread stage, said officials familiar with the development. The other reason for the slow detection of the Omicron variant among the Covid-19 samples is the absence of the S-Gene Target Failure (SGTF), the S-Gene Mutation Amplification (SGMA) or the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) diagnostic kits at government facilities, said scientists aware of the development. The Tata Medical and Diagnostics has developed a kit ‘OmiSure’ that claims to detect the Omicron variant of Covid-19. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has already approved the kit. Besides being cheap, the kit, which costs ₹250, can give result within four hours while the whole genomic sequencing takes 7-10 days and its reagents cost ₹12-15 lakh for one round of test in which a maximum of 96 samples can be tested. Bihar is yet to buy the kit in absence of directions from the ICMR, said officials quoted above. The Odisha government, however, has already placed orders for procuring 5 lakh kits, said a representative of the company. Bihar, on its part, placed orders last week to purchase reagents for genomic sequencing at the IGIMS and is waiting for them to arrive. It also awaits the Centre’s approval to its recommendation to allow a private laboratory to conduct SGTF test. “We are awaiting approval from the competent authority after having recommended a private laboratory, which applied for permission to conduct the [SGTF] test,” Pratyaya Amrit, Bihar’s additional chief secretary, health, had said during a press conference on January 18. He, however, did not respond to this reporter’s text message on Monday if the state government was getting the SGTF kits for quick detection of the Covid-19 strain. Sanjay Kumar Singh, managing director of the Bihar Medical Services Infrastructure Company Limited (BMSICL), tasked with infrastructure upkeep and purchases at government health facilities, also did not respond to calls or text message in this regard on Monday. “After two rounds of genomic sequencing at the IGIMS, indications are that Omicron is the predominant strain in Bihar,” Amrit had then said. Epidemiologists now say that Omicron has reached the community-spread stage in the state. Omicron was found in 93% (67) of the 72 samples so far tested at the IGIMS in two rounds of genomic sequencing on January 9 and 18.The ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRIMS) also awaits the Centre’s decision after it requested its head office in New Delhi last December to allow it to have a genomic sequencing set up at its bio-safety level 2-plus laboratory in Patna. While the ICMR was yet to respond to its request, government sources said the WHO had shown interest to support it by installing a genomic sequencing setup at RMRIMS, Patna. The state government early this month decided to install an additional genome sequencing setup at the IGIMS. The procurement and installation of the apparatus will, however, take some time, despite Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar having shown interest in it. “Genetic sequencing is done for sentinel surveillance of the Covid-19 virus and is a more accurate method to track its variants. It identifies the exact presence of Omicron sub-variant (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, etc.). The BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron is predominant in Bihar. However, sequencing has the drawback of being slow, which means it is not suitable for monitoring a rapidly spreading variant,” said Dr Prabhat Kumar Sinha, visiting professor (research), IGIMS, and a former scientist G of ICMR-RMRIMS, Patna.With 1,821 new infections of SARS-CoV-2 on Sunday, Bihar ranked 21st in terms of new infections added among Indian states and union territories. Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra were the top three. New cases have come down from the month’s peak of 6,541 reported on January 14. The total tally of active cases was 14,833, as per a government health bulletin released on Monday. The state’s positivity rate, which is the number of samples testing positive for Covid-19 out of the total tests done, had gone down to 1.73% on Sunday, while that of Patna was 8.20%, as it reported 224 cases, the highest among Bihar’s 38 districts during the day.

24-01-2022||India||SC tells Delhi HC not to delay execution of award against DMRC over Airport Express line||The Supreme Court on Monday directed the Delhi high court not to further delay the execution of an award of over ₹7200 crore payable by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to a consortium headed by Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infrastructure Limited (RInfra) which operated the Delhi Airport Metro Express till 2012. The decree became ripe for payment after DMRC’s challenge against the award was dismissed by the Supreme Court on September 9.The Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited (DAMEPL) – a consortium of Reliance Energy Limited (renamed as Reliance Infrastructure) and Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles SA –had subsequently approached the Delhi high court on September 12 for execution of the award but complained of delaying tactics by DMRC. On eight occasions, the petition was listed and on January 11, the high court posted the matter to March 29. The DAMEPL approached the top court challenging this order. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai, while disposing the petition asked the two sides to appear before the high court on January 31 and request for an early disposal of the execution proceedings. “Without commenting on the submission of either side we are of the opinion that hearing of the execution application does not brook any further delay…. We request high court to dispose of the execution application without any further delay as consequence of delay is detrimental to the petitioner and respondent (DMRC).”Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi who appeared for DAMEPL informed the Court that so far, only a token sum of ₹1000 crore has been paid by DMRC on December 8 in the execution proceeding and as on January 11, the sum recoverable from DMRC is ₹6268.87 crore. Rohatgi pointed out that his clients are not willing to settle the matter out of court with DMRC and urged that a deadline should be set for DMRC to make the payment.The bench asked DMRC, “There is an award in their favour approved by this Court and now you are seeking a settlement.”Senior advocate Parag Tripathi appearing for DMRC said, “There are several issues in execution. The whole Metro operation will come to a close, not just here in Delhi but in five other cities.” He referred to a communication addressed by DMRC to DAMEPL on January 6 making an offer to consider undertaking the outstanding liability of DAMEPL and its holding company, RInfra towards banks. Tripathi informed that in this regard talks were on as DMRC will be better placed to negotiate with banks.Rohatgi opposed saying, “I am not interested in talking to them anymore. With over ₹6000 crore hard cash in my account, I will be better placed to talk to my lenders. Let them give a plan by when they will pay. I will deal with my debtors.”Tripathi informed the Court that following these negotiations, the Delhi high court had directed DMRC to place on record all assets. “We have since disclosed to the Court and they are agreeable to settle,” DMRC told the Court.The bench said, “Who is to benefit from the pendency of these proceedings. You cannot compel a party to compromise. Now that they have disagreed to settle, we will request the high court to take up the matter at the earliest.”Before the high court, the DAMEPL had stated that the total decree amount payable by DMRC as on September 10 was ₹7045.41 crore. Further, the DAMEPL in its petition before the top court said that delay of each single day was resulting in incremental daily interest on the decreed sum. Between September 10 and January 11, this amount cumulatively stands at ₹223.46 crore, DAMEPL stated in its petition filed through advocate Mahesh Agrawala.With the HC ordering the matter to be listed on March 29, the petition said, “The high court instead of executing the decree by attaching the funds to the tune of ₹6208.03 crore admittedly available with the DMRC and lying in its various bank accounts towards partial satisfaction of the decretal amounts payable under the Award, embarked on a journey of acting as a conciliation court.”The DMRC had filed an affidavit before the Delhi high court on January 10 making full disclosure of its funds that stood at ₹6208.03 crore. DMRC had entered into an agreement with DAMEPL in August 2008 for the design, installation, commissioning, operation and maintenance of the 22.7 km Airport Metro Express Line from New Delhi Railway Station to Dwarka Sector 21 via Indira Gandhi International Airport. The agreement in the nature of public-private partnership required DMRC to undertake the design and construction of a basic civil structure for the project. In May 2012, the Anil Ambani-led company complained of defects in design and quality in the installation of viaduct bearing that was denied by DMRC. A joint inspection committee was set up that gave its report in July 2012. This was followed by another letter by DAMEPL, giving 90 days for DMRC to cure the defects. On completion of 90 days, DAMEPL issued a notice terminating the agreement on 8 October 2012, accusing DMRC of defaulting on the agreement. DMRC, however, said that it had carried out the required rectifications. While the dispute between the parties was pending before the arbitral tribunal, DMRC restarted the line after obtaining a certificate from the commissioner of metro rail safety on 18 January 2013.The tribunal undertook a detailed enquiry into all aspects and found as many as 1,551 cracks in 367 girders and 80 girders with twists varying between 10 to 20 mm. The tribunal was of the opinion that these defects adversely impacted the integrity of the structure. As effective steps were not taken within the cure period of 90 days, the tribunal held that DMRC was in breach of the concession agreement. The top court’s September 9 order upheld the order of the single judge of the high court, said, “It cannot be said that the view of the tribunal is perverse. Therefore, we do not concur with the high court’s opinion that the award of the tribunal on the legality of the termination notice is vitiated due to the vice of perversity.” On November 23, the Supreme Court even dismissed the review petition filed by DMRC, making the judgment final for execution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-tells-delhi-hc-not-to-delay-execution-of-award-against-dmrc-over-airport-express-line-101643034850089.html

Gilon was speaking at a virtual event that he addressed along with Sanjeev Singla, the Indian envoy to Israel, to mark the launch of a commemorative logo for the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries. The Israeli envoy recalled his visits last year along with external affairs minister S Jaishankar to “some places commemorating more than 900 Indian soldiers buried in Israel”. These were soldiers “who fought during World War 1 as part of the British Indian army to liberate this area that later became Israel”, he said. Gilon said Jews have lived “for over 2,000 years in India in total equality and peacefully”. He added, “And as someone who arrived [in India] after serving quite extensive periods in Europe, I was very much surprised to see how much love and appreciation there is in India towards Israel. There is another element – there is no anti-Semitism in India, this phrase just doesn’t exist.” The envoy’s remarks came against the backdrop of a debate in India over the role of Indian soldiers who served in the British Army before independence and whether their legacy should be part of the Indian Army’s history. The debate began following the merging of the 50-year-old eternal flame or Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate with the flame at the adjacent National War Memorial (NWM) on Friday. Gilon described bilateral ties as “really exceptional” and said this was a strategic partnership “not only by name but also by action”. Both Gilon and Singla described the relations as a civilisational bond. “Israel and India enjoy really vast cooperation in a lot of fields – economically, agriculture, water, security, innovation, health, tourism, education, culture and more,” Gilon said, adding the two sides are hoping to increase activities and looking forward to a visit by the Israeli prime minister and other officials. The new logo features the Star of David and the Ashoka Chakra – symbols that adorn the flags of the two countries – forming the numeral 30 to depict the 30th anniversary of bilateral ties. The two sides launched a logo design contest last year for students of Israel’s Holon Institute of Technology and India’s National Institute of Design. The winning design, created by Nikhil Kumar Rai, was chosen jointly by the embassies and consulates of both countries. Singla said the Jewish people had thrived in India for centuries and enriched the country’ composite culture. He said the large Indian Jewish community in Israel forms an “organic link” between the two sides. Following the launch of a strategic partnership five years ago, India and Israel are now looking towards greater cooperation in areas such as innovation, AI and quantum computing, he added. India and Israel established diplomatic ties on January 29, 1992. Today, they share a very close relationship that encompasses fields such as health, agriculture, trade, science and technology, and defence and homeland security. The 30th anniversary of relations will be marked by an array of cultural events throughout 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/really-exceptional-israeli-ambassador-naor-gilon-on-bilateral-ties-with-india-101643028429806.html

Now only Republic Day, Independence Day and Gandhi Jayanti would be observed as dry days. The new excise policy, notified last year, promised to reduce the ‘dry days’ but a formal order was awaited.“In pursuance of the provisions of Rule 52 of Delhi Excise Rules, 2010, it is hereby ordered that – Republic Day (January 26), Independence Day (August 15) and Gandhi Jayanti (October 2) – shall be observed as “dry day” in the national capital by all the licensees of the excise department and vends located in Delhi for the year 2022,” an order issued by the excise department said.ALSO READ | Lower legal drinking age to 21, reduce number of dry days: Delhi panelHT reported on January 20 that though Delhi had a new liquor policy, but two of the key promises made previously -- the lowering of the legal drinking age to 21, and a reduction in the number of dry days to 3 -- remained just that for now, promises. In a press conference on March 22 last year, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also the city’s excise minister, announced that the union territory’s government would embark on a new excise regime by slashing the legal age of drinking to 21, exiting the retail alcohol business, overhauling a labyrinthine tax system, and reducing the number of dry days to 3. The promise of reducing the drinking age still awaits a formal order. To implement the drinking age reduction, the excise department has to issue a separate order.The 21 dry days was one of the highest compared to most states and UTs in India.

The high court heard the arguments from both sides earlier in the day and pronounced the order at 4pm.The SAD leader was granted interim protection from arrest on two accounts -- January 10 and 18. The high court had also asked him to cooperate in the probe and imposed some other conditions.When the court heard the matter last on January 18, the Punjab Police had informed the high court that Majithia was not cooperating in the probe, even though he had joined the investigation on multiple occasions.While former Union minister and Supreme Court lawyer P Chidambaram presented the state government, Majithia had roped in apex court lawyer Mukul Rohtagi and senior advocate RS Cheema.The 46-year-old Akali leader was booked on December 20 last year under the NDPS Act on the basis of a report filed by anti-drug special task force (STF) chief Harpreet Singh Sidhu in the high court in 2018. On December 24, Majithia had moved the high court seeking anticipatory bail.Majithia is the brother-in-law of SAD president Sukhbir Badal and the brother of former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-hc-rejects-anticipatory-bail-plea-of-akali-leader-bikram-singh-majithia-in-drugs-case-101643023998968.html

24-01-2022||India||Double-engine govt euphemism for dictatorship, says Yashwant Sinha||Former Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha on Monday said that the BJP’s oft repeated slogan of a double-engine government is a sinister euphemism for dictatorship in which a single party is seeking absolute control of a nation as large and diverse as India. Addressing the media in Goa, the senior leader of the Trinamool Congress, said that while the slogan was hollow with the two engines pulling in different directions, it was also a serious issue. “If the Central government or the BJP speaks about a double-engine government, it means they want to run a dictatorship in Goa. It implies that there will be no government of another party anywhere. They are speaking about double engines vis a vis the state government,” Sinha said. “Tomorrow, they will speak about double and triple engines when it comes to panchayats. How can this work? Our country has so much diversity that a double engine can never work. Double engine is a wrong slogan,” he added.The BJP has been seeking votes claiming that if elected to power, Goa will be run by a ‘double engine sarkar’ (government) which implies that the Centre and state government would be working together. Sinha, however, said the engines were pulling in different directions. “Sometimes what happens with a double-engine phenomenon is that one engine goes one way and the other goes in a different direction. Double engine can pull you in different directions also. We are talking about a double-engine government,” he added. The former finance minister also said that the Trinamool Congress’ pre poll announcements, which were criticised for being impractical considering Goa’s precarious economic scenario and schemes, were definitely doable within the limits of Goa’s budget and he promised that if elected to power, he would personally monitor the roll out of the schemes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doubleengine-govt-euphemism-for-dictatorship-says-yashwant-sinha-101643020509000.html

The government has directed the additional director of health to make a detailed inquiry and submit a report in a month’s time. After the suicide of the activist, who was also the first radio jockey from the transgender community, her male friend also committed suicide and LGBTQ community members have been seeking a probe into their deaths for quite some time. She also contested the last assembly elections from a constituency in Malappuram district but later withdrew her papers. Days before her death, she posted a message in social media about her “botched operation and how painful after-effects immobilised her”. The activist’s friends said she underwent a sex reassignment surgery in a private hospital in Ernakulam in 2020 but after some time many problems started haunting her. Though she approached the same hospital it failed to address her woes, they said adding severe physical discomfort later led to her suicide. Her body was found hanging in an apartment and three days after the incident her male partner was also found dead in Kochi in a similar way. “There is no uniform protocol in sex reassignment surgeries and LGBTQ community members often end up in traps set up by private hospitals. We need ethical committees to end this exploitation. We need a proper protocol, standard and treatment methodology,” said Syama S Prabha, state transgender justice board member. Activists working in the area say Section 15 of the Transgender Act stipulates the government to provide various health care facilities for community members such as sex reassignment surgeries, hormonal therapy and treatment and separate sero surveillance centres but implementation of them are lethargic and abysmal. “Hospitals need qualified healthcare professionals associated with sex reassignment surgery equipped with queer affirmative surgical and counselling practices. We need a health manual guided by world professional association for transgender health guidelines,” said another activist Renju adding for many private hospitals such surgeries are mere money making exercise. Kerala is the first state to formulate a transgender policy in 2015 aimed at ending discrimination and bring them to mainstream. In 2017 it also set up a transgender justice board to deal with their complaints and a separate column called “third sex” was introduced in birth and death registration forms in the state. It was also made mandatory for all government buildings to have separate washrooms for the third sex. According to transgender board there are at least 35,000 third sex and trans persons in Kerala. Five years back, the Kochi Metro gave job to 23 transgenders, though some of them have left. Despite some initial moves, activists working in the area say more is required to bring them into mainstream and they need recognition, not sympathy. In 2019, a hostel for transgender persons was opened in Kochi. (Suicide is no solution to anything.

24-01-2022||India||Assam’s oldest literary body attempts to reconnect with youngsters||GUWAHATI: Over a century after it came into being, the Asam Sahitya Sabha, Assam’s oldest literary-cultural organisation, is attempting a reconnect with the state’ youths in a bid to stay relevant with the times. Headed now by Kuladhar Saikia, a retired IPS officer and a Sahitya Akademy Award winner, the organisation has started a series of events called Swadesh Swabhiman where young minds deliberate on relevant issues with the guidance of some of the state’s noted academicians and scholars. Constituted in 1917 with the aim of development of Assamese language, literature and culture, the Asam Sahitya Sabha has been closely associated with the independence movement and all important events in Assam’s history in the past century. But over the years, the organisation’s image has taken a beating with accusations of it becoming aloof from the society and being a select club of intellectuals and writers with not much connect to present happenings. Swadesh Swabhiman is an attempt to respond to those views. “The basic reason behind starting the programme was to encourage the young generation to debate, discourse and study and give them a platform. They are asked to choose a topic related to Assam, research on it and speak about it within five minutes,” said Asam Sahitya Sabha president Saikia. “The idea was to find young talents who are able to do research on a relevant topic and voice that out through strong communication skills at any platform anywhere. We want to form a group of people who can reflect on issues and represent the state,” he added. Since the starting in November, the Asam Sahitya Sabha has organised three editions of Swadesh Swabhiman where topics have ranged from naval strategy of Ahom rulers, history of textiles and jewellery in Assam to the state’s famed mobile theatre and food habits. “One important objective behind the programme was to make the Asam Sahitya Sabha accessible to the young generation by bringing in new ideas and using new technology. We can’t think of advancement of language and literature without participation by young generation,” said Saikia. “I believe, the century-old organisation must open our windows and doors to allow youths to enter and take a lead as well. Otherwise, we will become old and irrelevant. The Asam Sahitya Sabha is not only about literature or writers, it’s an organisation for all who loves Assam and should be all-inclusive,” he added. In order to help students and youths taking part in the event, the Asam Sahitya Sabha selects resource persons who are academicians and scholars of repute who guide the students on selecting topics for their speeches and point out how to do value addition in them with inputs. “I was enthused on hearing about the idea and immediately agreed on being on board. This is a very good initiative and will give us a select group of youths who can be good public speakers and may become good intellectuals in future,” said Alok Buragohain, former vice-chancellor of Dibrugarh University and academic chairperson of Guwahati-based Royal Global University. “The Asam Sahitya Sabha had become a moribund organisation. Besides being a bridge with youths, this initiative is a revival of sorts for it. The organisation was started by youths and now it’s reconnecting with today’s youths. This would help shed the image of being a closed group with limited access for outsiders,” he added. While the Asam Sahitya Sabha is organising the event and giving the platform, students from various reputed colleges in Assam and those studying outside the state are also getting involved in holding the lectures and helping with preparations. “I was involved with co-curricular activities and debates while studying in Cotton College in Guwahati. When Saikia Sir was looking for a few students to start Swadesh Swabhiman, I got a chance to be its part,” said Barnil Medhi, a student of Botany at Hindu College in Delhi. “Prior to this it was also our feeling that there was disconnect between Asam Sahitya Sabha and students and youths. This programme will help bridge that gap a lot, but a lot more still needs to be done. We want to take this initiative to all corners of the state,” he added. After taking part in the first edition of the event held at Cotton College in November last year where he spoke on comparison between architecture in Assam in the past with that of the other parts of India, Medhi has been involved in organising the next two editions where he also performs the role of an anchor. “I had been associated with the second and third editions of Swadesh Swabhiman as one of the speakers. This initiative has helped us with a platform to do research and communicate with others and also get intellectual guidance from experts,” said Ananya Saikia, a student of psychology in Guwahati’s Handique Girls College. The Asam Sahitya Sabha will soon publish the speeches delivered at the Swadesh Sabhiman events so that they can help others learn more about the state. The organisation is also trying to popularise storytelling among children. It started a bi-weekly programme with All India Radio (AIR) where popular stories from the state are aired and conducted storytelling workshops.

The death toll surged to 4,89,848 with 439 new fatalities.Notably, as high as 60 per cent of the patients who have died in the third wave of pandemic in India were either unvaccinated or had received only a single dose.India's active caseload, driven by the Omicron surge, currently stands at 22,49,335. The active numbers are up by 62,130 since the previous day, recording 5.69 per cent of the total infections. A total of 2,43,495 people recovered from the viral infection in the last 24 hours, the health bulletin stated.The daily positivity rate showed a 3 per cent rise to 20.75 per cent as compared to yesterday's 17.73 per cent, while the weekly positivity increased to 17.03 per cent.Also Read | Omicron spread: Daily cases in US drop, anti-curbs protest continue in BelgiumMore than 27 lakh vaccine doses have been administered in the last 24 hours, recording a cumulative total of more than 1.62 billion jabs under nationwide vaccination drive.A study conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras showed that the existing Omicron-driven Covid-19 wave in India is likely to peak in the next 14 days, meaning that cases will be the highest around February 6. The result is based on the institute's analysis of the national ‘R-value,' which, it said, declined further in the week of January 14-21.The data shared in the study revealed that in individual cities like Kolkata, Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai, the R-value stood at 0.56, 0.67, 0.98 and 1.2, respectively. If this number goes below 1, the pandemic is considered to have ‘ended’, the researchers explained.Currently, Maharashtra continues to top the Covid-19 chart in India, although new cases in Mumbai have dropped significantly. The southern states of Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh hold the next few spots due to a Covid-19 surge in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-logs-over-3-lakh-covid-19-cases-439-deaths-positivity-rate-surges-to-2075-101642997818164.html

A leader who fought imperialism and compelled decolonization is being fittingly recognized," Jaishankar said in his first tweet."This is a message from a New India. We will be true to ourselves when dealing with the world," he added in subsequent Twitter post.This is a message from a New India. We will be true to ourselves when dealing with the world.#ParakramDivasThe digital statue was unveiled on the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji on Sunday. The 3D hologram will later be replaced by a 28-feet high and six-feet wide granite statue of the freedom fighter.Addressing the gathering during the unveiling ceremony, PM Modi said that Bose, who had established the first independent government in India, gave the country the confidence to achieve a sovereign and strong India.“This statue is a homage to the hero of freedom by the grateful nation and will keep on reminding our institutions and generations the lesson of national duty,” he said.Also Read | In unveiling of Netaji's statue, PM Modi's message to the worldThe hologram statue will be powered by a 30,000 lumens 4K projector. The 3D image of Netaji will be projected on a transparent holographic screen to create the effect of a hologram.The installation of the granite statue of Netaji under the India Gate canopy, which once housed the statue of King George V, is in recognition of the leader of INA as one of the foremost freedom fighters of India. INA was the army that faced maximum attrition (26,000 out of total 90,000 died) but never surrendered to the British. Its officers and men were captured and put on trial but never signed any surrender document before the British.According to officials, the decision to install Netaji's statue was not taken in the spur of the moment by Prime Minister Modi but through intensive deliberations with the culture ministry and those manning historical archives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/long-awaited-correction-of-history-jaishankar-on-netaji-statue-at-india-gate-101642997097888.html
24-01-2022||India||Vijayan, Stalin add voices to chorus against proposed changes to IAS rules||NEW DELHI: Chief ministers of Kerala and Tamil Nadu Pinarayi Vijayan and M K Stalin have added their voices to the chorus from non-Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states against the proposed changes to the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) Cadre Rules to allow the central government to summon any official for central deputation without the consent of the state governments.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Stalin cited natural disasters while asking him to revoke the proposal. “The States also face frequent natural disasters which demand services of IAS officers in the State more than elsewhere,” he said. “Given this situation, forcing the State Governments to depute officers would surely aggravate the governance deficit in various States due to shortage of officers and also it is an affront to the administrative framework of the States.”Vijayan urged Modi to drop the proposed amendments saying it will “induce a fear psychosis and an attitude of hesitancy among All India Service Officers to implement policies of a state government, which are formed by party/parties politically opposed by the ruling party at the Centre.” He added the deputation rules are “heavily loaded in favour” of the Union government.Earlier on January 18, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee wrote to Modi expressing her “strong reservations” over the move. She urged Modi to roll back the proposed amendments saying they were “against the spirit of cooperative federalism and that it upsets harmonious arrangement between Centre and States in the matter of posting of IAS and IPS officers.”Banerjee said the move goes “against the… basic structure of India’s Constitutional scheme.” Her Jharkhand counterpart, Hemant Soren, urged Modi to set aside the proposed amendments, calling them “draconian” and against the spirit of “cooperative federalism”. Soren said the move is likely to further strain the stressed Centre-state relations. “It has immense potential to be misused for harassment of officers and vendetta politics against the state government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijayan-stalin-add-voices-to-chorus-against-proposed-changes-to-ias-rules-101642997107179.html
24-01-2022||India||Wary of RJD’s apathy, Congress plans to fight all seats in Bihar council polls||PATNA: Wary of the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s (RJD) reluctance to give a respectable share of seats, the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) is gearing up to field its candidates on all 24 local bodies seats of the state legislative council, the elections to which is scheduled to be held in February-March this year. “We have discussed and prepared the panel of candidates for 12 constituencies in our meeting with Bihar party in-charge Bhakta Charan Das in New Delhi on Saturday. However, the final decision, whether to stay in the alliance with the RJD or go it alone in the upcoming elections, rests on the party high command,” said BPCC chief Madan Mohan Jha. Jha and BPCC campaign committee chairman Akhilesh Prasad Singh initiated the party’s plan to take a plunge into the council polls with Das after the RJD unilaterally decided to field its nominees on 20 out of 24 seats, leaving only four seats for the Congress. Apparently sulking after a humiliating defeat of the party’s candidates in recently held by-elections for Tarapur and Kusheshswar Asthan assembly seats, the Bihar Congress is anxious to resume its ties with the RJD. The coalition between the RJD and the Congress went for a toss after the former rejected the seat-sharing claim and fielded its candidates on both the seats. However, the RJD too faced the defeat. Soon after the declaration of results of the assembly by-elections, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav announced that the RJD’s alliance with the Congress will remain and the party will be offered seven-eight seats in the council to contest. Worried about the RJD’s plan for the upcoming elections, Akhilesh Prasad Singh, who is also a Rajya Sabha member, met Lalu Prasad in Delhi on January 18 to know his mind. Senior Congress leaders said that the RJD chief asked them to wait till January 28 to formalise the seat-sharing deal on return of opposition leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav from abroad. “Unlike the assembly by-elections, we are well prepared to meet any eventuality. We are not willing to accept anything which is unreasonable and hence unacceptable,” said Congress legislature party leader Ajit Sharma. Senior party leader Kishore Kumar Jha said the party high command must rethink the plan to tie up with the RJD, which always pursued opportunistic politics and thereby demoralised the Congress workers. “Organisational presence of the Congress has been wiped out from a majority of areas, including Mithilanchal, after the party started depending on the alliance with the RJD. Some of the key leaders of Bihar Congress are desperate to team up with the RJD as their kin are preparing to contest the council elections,” said Jha. Former BPCC vice president and MLC Ajay Kumar Singh said that the party had strong winning prospects in the constituencies of Bettiah, Darbhanga, Rohtas & Kaimur, Katihar, Begusarai, Jamui, Saharsa, Purnia and Nawada, owing to strong presence of dedicated party workers. Last time, Congress fielded its candidates on four seats, including Bettiah, Purnia and Saharsa and spared Katihar for the NCP. RJD and the Janata Dal (United), which was then part of the Grand Alliance (GA), were offered ten seats each.

We know that the licensed monoclonal antibody products in India do not neutralise omicron. Yet doctors in private hospitals are prescribing monoclonal antibody therapy (and admission)," she added in her tweet.The Doctor further pointed out that there is little data in India which is why we do not know if the percentage of vaccinated elderly with Omicron will progress."Please remember that even among clinical vulnerable, most contacts will stay asymptomatic or have mild symptoms & recover. Small no. develop severe illness (in India, we have little data so we do not know whether 5% or 20% of vaccinated elderly with omicron will progress)," she tweeted."In any case, all the ones who would have gotten better anyway will do fine--but having given antibodies, doctors will ascribe that to their treatment and the hospitals will laugh all the way to the bank. The argument I hear from well-meaning doctors (thankfully not infectious disease specialists) is that it is only one lakh and my patient can afford to buy it, so why not?" Dr Kang said in the tweet.Dr Kang said that it is unethical, immoral and unscientific to provide the antibodies treatment and asked the doctors to practise better medicine."Why not? It is unethical, immoral and unscientific. Surely, as doctors, we can teach and practise better medicine than this. And as patients, please ask for what each drug is expected to do and the evidence to back that up," Dr Kang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dr-gagandeep-kang-on-covid-antibody-therapy-unethical-immoral-unscientific-101642991378651.html

24-01-2022||India||Niti Aayog plans to set up EV charging infra at railway stations||The Niti Aayog has prepared a draft policy for the Indian Railways to set up electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure at railway stations across the country, in a bid to promote the use of such vehicles. The draft policy, which has been shared with the ministry of railways, also recommends supply of renewable energy to the charging facilities in line with Indian Railways’ aim to become net-zero carbon emitter by 2030.The policy is under discussion with the ministry of railways, said Amitabh Kant, Niti Aayog’s chief executive officer. The apex public policy think tank has recommended that while the railways can plan to put in place EV charging facilities at all stations in a phased manner till 2030, the facility can be immediately provided at 123 redeveloped railway stations.“Railway stations are landmark locations and they play a unique role in the entire transport sector, which make them strategic locations for providing public charging solutions for EVs,” Kant said. Niti Aayog officials have recently discussed the draft policy with the railway ministry officials. Rajeev Jain, additional director general, PR, railway ministry, said, “We have very recently received the communication. We are working on it.”Under the Centre’s FAME-II (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and EV) scheme, the push is towards adoption of EVs, especially in public and shared transportation, in a big way in the country. The aim is to support approximately 7,000 e-buses, 500,000 electric three-wheelers, 55,000 electric four-wheeler passenger cars and one million electric two-wheelers through subsidy, said a NitiAayog official.For this, providing a good and accessible EV charging infrastructure network is critical. While the Centre has taken several initiatives to scale up EV charging facilities, NITI officials said, railway stations can provide a secure and accessible charging infrastructure to city residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/niti-aayog-plans-to-set-up-ev-charging-infra-at-railway-stations-101642980050942.html
24-01-2022||India||Ball in Centre’s court: Himanta on border row||Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Sunday that it was upto the Centre to decide on the recommendations forwarded by the state and Meghalaya to resolve a part of the long-standing boundary disputes between the two sides.Addressing a press conference here, Sarma said, “The ball is now in the Centre’s court. We have submitted our recommendations to Union Home Minister Amit Shah.” “It is up to them when they call us for further discussions,” he added.Sarma’s statement came following opposition from Congress and other parties to the recent agreement between Assam and Meghalaya to sort out differences in 6 disputed areas through a give and take formula of land swap.As part of the deal, of the total disputed area of 36.79 sq km in the 6 areas Assam would get 18.51 sq km while Meghalaya would get 18.28 sq kmBesides Meghalaya, Assam has border disputes with Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Meghalaya. As per Assam assembly records, the total area of border disputes with all four states is around 690 sq km.“Before criticising us, Congress should realise that Meghalaya was carved out of Assam by them. We had to give up Shillong, which was our capital, and set up a new capital in Dispur,” said Sarma.“Not just Meghalaya, Congress was responsible for creating Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland by dividing Assam. If they had not done it, or sorted out the boundary issues at the time of creation of these new states, we wouldn’t have been facing disputes till now,” he added.“If states fight amongst themselves, we can’t go to Delhi and ask for something together as a region. It was Congress’s game plan. We are trying to correct that after 50 years. People in northeast want to live in peace. We have to create such an atmosphere,” Sarma added.Sarma said border talks were likely to be held soon between Assam and Arunachal Pradesh as well as with Mizoram in the near future.Since the border dispute with Nagaland is pending in Supreme Court, he expressed the hope that it would get sorted in another 2-3 years.Sarma said that creation of new states within northeast was part of a Congress plan to weaken the region.“As a result of Congress’s policies, people in northeast are suffering and we are fighting among ourselves. It was the design of Congress to keep the region in a weak and defensive position,” he said.Earlier, Congress and All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), the two biggest opposition parties in the state assembly, had also opposed the land swap deal with Meghalaya and urged the BJP-led Assam government to discuss the issue in detail in the assembly before taking any hasty decision.Two regional parties, Raijor Dal and Assam Jatiya Parishad stated that while Assam government is trying to portray that each state would get nearly 50% share of the 6 disputed areas, in reality Meghalaya would gain control of half the areas it had encroached while Assam will only get back half of its land, which the neighbour had earlier captured.(With PTI inputs)

The teen, officials believe, was allegedly abducted by the PLA when he and a few others had gone hunting in the bordering region last week. “The Chinese PLA has confirmed that they have an Indian boy on their side. Further details, including about his identity, are awaited,” Lt Col Harsh Wardhan Pande, PRO (Defence), Tezpur, Assam, said.However, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Arunachal East, Tapir Gao, who had earlier tweeted about the alleged abduction, claimed the teen found by the PLA was Taron. “I have been informed that the Chinese PLA confirmed to the Indian Army that the youth missing from Upper Siang has been located on their side. This was disclosed in a meeting with Union defence minister Rajnath Singh today as well. It could take a few more days to complete required formalities and bring him back to India.”Officials familiar with the matter also said that once the identity of the teen found by the PLA is confirmed, it may take another one week before he is returned to India.On January 19, the BJP MP tweeted that the teen was “abducted from inside Indian territory at Lungta Jor under Siyungla area (Bishing village) of Upper Siang district” by the PLA.Gao said the news of Taron’s abduction was revealed by his friend who managed to escape from the PLA. He also claimed that China has built 3-4 kms of road in that area inside Indian territory in 2018.HT tried to reach out to authorities in Upper Siang district about Sunday’s development but could not get a response immediately.It is not for the first time that Indian citizens have gone missing from the border region. In September 2020, five people from the Tagin tribe who worked as porters for the Indian Army, went missing from Upper Subansiri on the Indian side of the McMahon line bifurcating Arunachal Pradesh and the Tibet Autonomous Region.

24-01-2022||India||Tamil Nadu crosses 200,000 active Covid cases||Tamil Nadu’s active cases breached the 200,000 mark on Sunday with detention of 30,580 new cases. Health authorities, however, said the rate of transmission was showing signs of reducing. On January 1, Tamil Nadu had 8,340 active cases and it took only 12 days for the number of people carrying the virus to cross the one-lakh mark on January 13. And it has taken another 10 days for the state to cross the 200,000 mark. The highest caseload among Tamil Nadu’s 38 districts is from Chennai. However, the daily number of cases has been reducing in the capital city which reported 6,383 on Sunday.“Chennai saw almost 9,000 cases and the infection’s spread was rapid and increasing rapidly. But in the last two days we are seeing a decrease similar to the pattern in other major cities across the country,” health minister M Subramanian told reporters. Chennai’s positivity rate has also fallen to 23.6% with districts of Coimbatore and Chengalpattu overtaking in this figure of 26.6% and 25.5%. Chennai’s test positivity rate had surged from 3.3% on January 1 to twice the state’s average in a week’s time. On January 23, Tamil Nadu’s average test positivity rate was 19.8%.Experts warn that the state administration now has to focus on districts where cases are likely to increase, especially since people travelled back to their native towns and villages during the long Pongal weekend from January 14 to 17. “Mask compliance has gone down in Tamil Nadu and it’s especially poor in the districts,” said Dr Prabhdeep Kaur, deputy director, National Institute of Epidemiology. “We know with Omicron how rapid the transmission is so the state will have to insist on Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.”Last Thursday, the state health minister had said that out of 129,000 hamlets in Tamil Nadu, 24,199 had positive cases. He however said that there was no reason to panic as the state has 1.92 lakh beds earmarked and roughly around 9000 were occupied. Health authorities attributed to few fatalities and non-severity of the illness to vaccinations.From January 1 up to January 15, out of the 191 patients who died 131 were either not vaccinated or were partially vaccinated, according to the directorate of public health. Meanwhile, the state conducted its 19th mass vaccination camp on Sunday across 50,000 sites. As of Sunday, 9.04 crore people have been vaccinated across all age categories.
24-01-2022||India||Telangana: Probe ordered after tribal women file molestation, assault complaint||Police in Telangana’s Bhadradri Kothagudem district are investigating a complaint lodged by four Adivasi women alleging assault on them and molestation attempt on a minor girl by a forest guard on Friday.The tribal women belonging to Rajannagudem gram panchayat of Mulakalalapalli block filed a complaint on Saturday. At the same time, the forest official, too, lodged a counter complaint against the tribal women stating that they had violated forest rules and obstructed his duties, Mulakalapalli assistant sub-inspector Tirumala Rao told HT.“We are conducting a preliminary investigation into both the complaints. We are yet to register a case. We shall do that after gathering details,” Rao said.According to Potu Ranga Rao, state joint secretary of Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), the three Adivasi women and a 15-year-old girl, who all originally belonged to Chhattisgarh and were taking shelter in the forest areas of the district, had gone deep into the forests to fetch firewood on Friday afternoon.“A forest guard, who saw them cutting wood, shouted at them and when they revolted, he beat them up indiscriminately. In their bid to escape from him, the girl fell into a deep ditch and sustained injuries on the body. On the pretext of pulling her from the ditch, the forest guard tore her clothes and tried to molest her,” Rao alleged.The tribal women managed to escape from the spot and reached their hamlet by evening. They met the gram panchayat sarpanch and explained everything to him. “On Saturday, the sarpanch took them to Mulakalapalli police station and made them lodge a complaint with police,” the CPI (ML) leader said.As the news spread like wildfire, local left party activists and Progressive Organisation for Women (POW) workers took out a rally in Mulakalapalli town and demanded action against the forest official. “The forest guard should be immediately arrested and booked for molestation and also for violation of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act,” POW president G Jhansi said.State tribal welfare minister Satyavathi Rathod ordered a comprehensive inquiry into the alleged molestation of a minor girl and assault on three other women by the forest guard.“The tribal women went into the forest to fetch firewood for their domestic use. How can the forest guard obstruct them and beat them? The government will take stern action after due inquiry,” she said in a statement.District forest officer Ranjit Naik said the forest department had initiated a probe to ascertain the facts and would take appropriate action against the accused.

It isn’t a common sight for a chief minister to oversee road laying work but politics around Chennai’s perennial flooding situation is a key aspect which Stalin promised to fix during the northeast monsoon in November last year. “The chief minister met several people on the ground during the northeast monsoon so he is very particular that all the roads which were battered are removed completely and re-laid before the next monsoon,” said Sekar Babu, minister for Hindu religious and charitable endowments department, who accompanied Stalin on these visits. “Since he is directly inspecting road works, officials are taking this very seriously and there is no room for any substandard work or irregularities.” The minister said while road infrastructure was a prime focus, the chief minister is also engaging with a recently constituted committee headed by retired IAS officer V Thiruppugazh to devise flood mitigation plans and long-term plans for water management. Following a late night inspection on January 14, Stalin warned of action against officials in the Greater Chennai Corporation and the highway department if they laid roads without milling. When roads are laid without milling it raises the height of the road and as a result residential homes especially old buildings are below the road level so their homes are inundated during the rains. “Because of the recent northeast monsoon rains, roads were affected so a lot of emphasis has been made by the chief minister, chief secretary and senior officials that the roads should not only be laid fast but also be laid with good quality so that these roads are long lasting,” said Gagandeep Singh Bedi, commissioner, Greater Chennai Corporation. “The CM insists that milling should be done. We have put 15 IAS officers for 15 zones (into which Chennai is divided). And we have given instructions to them and the chief engineers that they should particularly check that the quantity of bitumen being poured, the temperature of the hot mix, and the road camber should conform to norms so that there is no water stagnation.” Back in November when life was thrown out of gear in Chennai due to incessant excess rains which caused flooding, there was a war of words between Stalin and former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami. Stalin had accused the AIADMK’s former municipal administration Minister SP Velumani, a close aide of Palaniswami, of just “collecting commissions” instead of taking efforts to mitigate floods. Palaniswami in turn questioned what Stalin had done when he was Chennai mayor in the 1990s.

The salesman said that he would deliver the car in less than half hour if they were able to produce the money.The video surfaces at a time when classist and casteist remarks have become far too common in the southern state where discrimination on such grounds have become the norm in several places.Kempe Gowda is heard saying that he would not leave the issue and fight till justice is served.“This has happened to me and I am an educated person and have completed my SSLC (10th grade). If this has happened to me, imagine how farmers will be treated. This should not happen to anyone,” he is heard saying.The video also shows Kempe Gowda trying to express the humiliation he faced due to the mindset of the salesperson.The police intervened and a complaint was filed with the showroom personnel tendering a written apology.Several netizens tagged Mahindra group and its Chairman, Anand Mahindra, on Twitter but there has been no response on the platform as yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-after-car-showroom-staff-misbehaves-with-farmer-101642967404704.html
24-01-2022||India||Jarkiholi, Hebbalkar slugfest intensifies||BelagaviThe political rivalry between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Gokak, Ramesh Jarkiholi, and the Belagavi rural MLA, Laxmi Hebbalkar, of the Congress continues to take bitter and personal turns, adding to the challenges of both the parties and their prospects in the border district, about 505 kms from Bengaluru.The latest in the feud is when Hebbalkar said Ramesh Jarkiholi resembled a “demon” that has gone viral on social media and added to the personal nature of politics in this region of Karnataka where constituencies are treated like fiefdoms.After laying foundation stone of a road work at Mavinakatte, a village in her constituency, Hebbalkar used the platform to express her anger against Jarkiholi. Hebbalkar alleged that Mavinakatte road work, which had been sanctioned two years ago, and was blocked by Jarkiholi. “There are such demons that come and go in life. But I will work for you until I have your blessings,” Hebbalkar said addressing a gathering.Hebbalkar did not stop just calling Ramesh a ‘demon’. She said, “Eclipses don’t spare even sun and moon. Finally I am a human being. But the moon and sun shine again once the eclipse is over.” The rivalry between the Congress and BJP has little to do with the relationship of these two elected representatives in the border district where the Jarkiholi brothers wield significant influence over the region, often by overruling their counterparts.Hebbalkar has often been at the receiving end of such targeted attacks, especially by Ramesh.The spat had sparked the fire between Ramesh, his brother Satish, and Hebbalkar who was believed to be nudged by Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president DK Shivakumar, leading to the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy-led coalition government in 2019.The collapse of the coalition rule and the next government under BS Yediyurappa, in which Ramesh was the irrigation minister, had stopped all public works, including Mavinkatti road work sanctioned to the constituency as sort of a “revenge”, people aware of the developments said.That the Jarkiholis favour family over party ideology was seen in the December 10 legislative council polls in which the fourth brother, Lakhan, who contested as an independent, won against the BJP.Ramesh and his brother Balachandra are BJP legislators while Satish is with the Congress and Lakhan is an independent MLC.Ramesh was forced to step down from the cabinet last year after he was alleged to be involved in a “sex for job” scandal. He has been busy trying to win his place back in the Basavaraj Bommai-led government.Ramesh could not be reached for comment.Ramesh had made sexist remarks against Hebbalkar when he was an accused in the sex scandal. Hebbalkar just said, “It was his (Ramesh Jarkiholi) culture”.Interestingly, it was Ramesh who had initially helped Hebbalkar in her early political career and things got sour when she moved closer to Shivakumar.Hebbalkar has over the years mustered enough support and influence to take on the Jarkiholis and was successful in getting her brother, Channaraj Hattiholi, elected to the upper house of the state legislature in the December 10 polls.Before the video leak of the alleged sex scandal, Ramesh was actively working in Belagavi (rural) constituency and attracting Hebbalkar followers towards BJP as a part of strategy to give a tough fight in the upcoming assembly elections. Even some of the zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat members had joined the BJP. Jarkiholi had openly announced spending ₹5 crore on behalf of the BJP candidate against Hebbalkar in the election. Hebbalkar too has moved to an offensive stance after being on the back foot for several years, owing to her growing influence and strength in the border district.“Both Hebbalkar and Ramesh Jarkiholi have drawn their swords and the personal nature of the political rivalry would only get more aggressive. Ramesh played a key role in Hebbalkar to become district Congress president and later get elected as legislator. But rivalry started when Hebbalkar tried to overtake Jarkiholis in PLD bank elections. Now, both are engaged in engineering strategies to defeat each other. Hebbalkar thinks her strength has doubled after her brother was elected to legislative council. However, the next assembly election will show the result of who won the rivalry”, a senior political analyst from the district said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jarkiholi-hebbalkar-slugfest-intensifies-101642967344101.html

The accused will be questioned in connection with the conspiracy to eliminate the police officer who was investigating Dileep’s involvement in a woman actor’s abduction and assault case. Dileep reached the crime branch office in Kalamassery around 8.50 am. A senior officer said the questioning session will be recorded for transparency. The court had asked Dileep to appear before the investigating team for three consecutive days. It also asked officials to submit a report on the interrogation in a sealed cover by Thursday and asked all the accused to co-operate during the investigation. The actor, who is seventh accused in the case, and others had moved the court after a fresh case was registered against them following the disclosure of film director Balachandra Kumar.Last month, Kumar had claimed that Dileep was in possession of the woman actor’s assault video and had tried to influence case witnesses. He also claimed to have met the main accused, Pulsar Suni, at Dileep’s residence in 2016. After Kumar’s revelations the Kerala government had approached the Supreme Court to extend the trial for six more months.The crime branch had registered a fresh case against Dileep, his brother Anoop, a relative Suraj, and two others Appu and Babu for allegedly conspiring to eliminate police officer Baiju Paulose.The conversation allegedly took place in November 2017 at the actor’s house in Aluva in Ernakulam district, crime branch said in its first information report(FIR). They were charged under Sections 116 (abetment of offence), 118 (concealing design to commit an offence), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).A leading woman actor was waylaid, kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a criminal gang in Kochi while she was returning home after a shooting assignment in 2017. Six months after the incident, Dileep was arrested in the case. Prosecution alleged that the attack was planned at the behest of Dileep to settle an old score with the woman.Meanwhile, the actor has decided to move the apex court on Monday with a plea to conclude the trial by February-16 deadline set by the court. In the plea he said fresh charges were framed to delay the trial. The Supreme Court is also expected to take up the state government’s plea to extend the trial by six months in view of fresh disclosure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-actress-assault-case-crime-branch-quiz-actor-dileep-four-others-101642967046123.html
24-01-2022||India||Another BJP legislator presses for expansion of CM Bommai cabinet||BengaluruAnother Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator in Karnataka on Sunday said the Basavaraj Bommai-led cabinet should be expanded at the earliest, indicating rumblings within the ruling party over the delay in the exercise.“If the party does decide to expand the cabinet, it should be done now,” said Abhay Patil, the BJP legislator from Belagavi Dakshin. “I had said this earlier as well that if the cabinet has to be expanded, it has to be done now.” He, however, said that it was up to the party to decide on who becomes a minister.“Anyone who becomes a minister should be doing so by exhibiting performance and not because they can put up a board as a former minister. It is about performance and for this adequate time should be there. Right now there is not enough time. For ministers to show their ability, they need at least two years but for inevitable reasons, it keeps going back and forth,” he added.Patil said that a minimum of six months should be given to new ministers. The statements come at a time when BJP legislators in the state are growing impatient over the cabinet expansion after several leaders from the old guard or those who have served for decades in the party were overlooked once again in favour of those who recently defected to the saffron fold in 2019.On Thursday, senior BJP legislators Basanagouda Patil Yatnal and M P Renukacharya held closed-door discussions and pushed for a cabinet rejig, by replacing what they called ineffective ministers who are in the party only for the sake of power.There is also growing discontentment after Bommai was chosen to replace BS Yediyurappa who was forced to step down over allegations of corruption in July last year. Bommai has been with the BJP for around 13 years and was picked as the chief minister while several other leaders, who have helped shape the party in Karnataka for decades, were overlooked.Speculations that the BJP high command will replace Bommai over allegations of corruption and non-performance have also died down as the party focuses its attention on poll-bound states like Uttar Pradesh, Goa and Punjab among others.A meeting of BJP legislators was also held at the residence of food and civil supplies minister Umesh Katti on Saturday evening, fuelling speculation of a growing divide within the party.The divide within the party had cost it the Hanagal assembly seat in last year’s bypolls and other crucial seats in the December MLC elections. The fear remains that if the same continues, the Congress is likely to gain from this in the upcoming elections including zilla and taluka panchayati, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the 2023 assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-bjp-legislator-presses-for-expansion-of-cm-bommai-cabinet-101642966864667.html

They could even be seasonal symptoms due to winter. Since the symptoms are very mild and most of them are recovering within three to four days, the affected people are refusing to get tested,” the official said.The authorities, however, are advising them to remain isolated in their homes for a week and use the complete course of medicines given to them by the department.The fever survey taken up by the state health department began on Friday all over the state. In every village, teams comprising local panchayat secretary, accredited social health activists (ASHA), auxiliary nurse midwives (ANM) and anganwadi workers have been conducting the door-to-door survey to find out Covid-19-related symptoms.“All public representatives including MLAs, MLCs, mandal parishad and zilla parishad members, and gram panchayat sarpanches are supervising the fever survey. The health teams as well as the public representatives are sensitising the people to get vaccinated to conquer the virus,” Harish Rao said.Health workers are distributing fever kits to each person suffering from Covid-related symptoms along with a prescription chart on how to use the medicines. “We have kept one crore such medical kits ready for distribution so that the people don’t have to throng the hospitals for treatment,” the health minister said, adding that the fever survey would continue for another week.Saying that the fever survey was taken up with an objective to reach out the patients, Rao said anybody suffering from severe symptoms should immediately get admitted to government hospitals, instead of running around private hospitals.“More than 56,000 Covid-19 beds are vacant in the government hospitals across Telangana. Separate facilities have been made even for pregnant women who tested positive for Covid-19 or suffering from symptoms,” he said.He said the number of Covid-19 cases has started coming down in various states and hoped that the cases would come down in Telangana, too. He said people must wear masks besides washing their hands frequently.Telangana on Saturday reported 4,393 new Covid cases and two deaths. The stated had recorded 4,416 positive cases on Friday, according to the health department data.

She died ten days later.An undated video clip had surfaced on social media in which the girl said that two years ago, her school warden had urged her parents to convert her to Christianity with the promise of sponsoring her education. An unidentified man who is recording the video asks her if the alleged harassment happened because she didn’t convert. “Could be,” the girl responds. HT was not able to independently verify the authenticity of the video clip.On Sunday, the BJP demanded SP Gandhapuneni’s dismissal for stating that the parents of the child had not complained of religious conversion in the first complaint they filed. “This is a white lie and the SP has to be dismissed,” Khushbu Sundar, BJP’s national executive committee member, who led the protest told reporters. “Why is the chief minister M K Stalin not speaking of this child? Why has no one from the coalition spoken about this? Is it a fear that they will lose minority votes if they speak on religious conversion in Tamil Nadu?”Congress leader and commissioner of TN’s minority commission S. Peter Alphonse took to Twitter to dismiss the allegation. “Of the approximately 1000 students currently studying (in the same school), 70% are Hindus, 5% are Muslims and 25% are Christians,” he said. “Hindu teachers also work. Will conversion that has not happened in three centuries take place now? Tamil Nadu will not allow hate politics which is full of social unity and religious harmony!” The girl’s father has moved court seeking an inquiry either by the CB-CID or any other independent investigation agency. In an interim order passed on Saturday during an urgent hearing of the case, justice G R Swaminathan of the Madurai bench of the Madras high court directed the principal district judge of Thanjavur to nominate a judicial magistrate for recording the statement of the petitioner and his wife under Section 164 of Cr.Pc on Sunday.A copy should be made available in a sealed cover for the Court to examine during the next hearing on Monday, the court said.“The respondent police are restrained from harassing the person who had taken the video of the child, in which, she is found making an allegation that she was called upon to convert to Christianity. The focus of the police authorities should be on the circumstances that led to the suicide of the child and it cannot be directed against the person who had taken the video,” the court said in its orders.In his statement on Sunday, Pappusamy said that they are in support of legal action to be taken against those responsible, including the arrest of the warden. He denied that proselytising activities were being carried out in these schools which are run by nuns.“Religious political forces which have sought to find a real cause for the tragedy at the school, have resorted to the lie of proselytising to divert attention from the problems and to disturb religious harmony through false propaganda,” he said.This issue took a political and religious turn after the video began circulating on social media, most prominently shared by Tamil Nadu’s BJP president K Annamalai. “Conversion–a poisonous plant is spreading fast in Tamil Nadu,” Annamalai tweeted tagging chief minister Stalin demanding that the state bring this under control and compensate the victim’s family. A hashtag has also been trending since Friday seeking justice for the girl. Since then the BJP and Hindu outfits have been protesting over this issue.A minister close to Stalin said that there has been no bias in investigations. “We will take action against whoever is wrong. The opposition parties do not have issues to take up so they want to create trouble over this,” the minister said.Speaking to this correspondent on Friday, SP Gandhapuneni had said that the time, date and person who recorded the video has not been ascertained. “As of now, we cannot consider that video as a dying declaration. There are certain procedures to be followed to consider something as a dying declaration,” she had said.“It can only be considered as a video and based on this video; we are recording statements of the probable eye-witnesses.” She added that the parents had filed an additional petition on Thursday, regarding which, an official statement was recorded on Friday. When asked if this petition mentions a complaint of religious conversion, Gandhapuneni denied. She was not reachable for comment on Sunday.The Thirukattupalli police station recorded the child’s statement on January 15 and police registered a case under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015. Police have now included 305 (abetment to suicide) under the IPC.During a press conference on Thursday, the SP had warned of action against those sharing the video revealing the identity of the victim and the family -- an offence under the JJ Act. “We cannot reveal the identity of not just children who are victims of sexual crimes but also children who are in need of care and protection,” she had said. Reacting to the SP’s press conference, Annamalai took to Twitter to say that the police are “hell bent” on changing the course of the case. “There is a videographed confession statement of the girl. Did the SP come to the conclusion it’s fake? If yes, how?”
24-01-2022||India||Mukherjee panel ignored nod for DNA test of ashes: Bose’s kin||Tokyo’s Renkoji temple gave permission to Indian authorities to conduct DNA tests on ashes said to be those of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, according to fresh translation of a letter which refutes claims that the temple was “reticent”, placing doubts on Justice MK Mukherjee Commission’s ruling that the ‘ashes were not Netaji’s’.A new translation of the Japanese letter , written by the chief priest of Tokyo’s Renkoji temple to the Indian government in 2005, revealed that permission was given to the commission to conduct the DNA test.However, for inexplicable reasons this portion of the letter was not translated and a bland edited English version was attached to the Justice Mukherjee Commission’s report on the disappearance of Bose as evidence that “on account of the Temple Authorities reticence... the commission could not proceed further (on the issue of DNA tests)”.The commission later used this to conclude that the ashes were not of Netaji’s, giving credence to speculations that he may have survived to become an ascetic or prisoner in a Russian prison.Madhuri Bose, the legendary freedom fighter’s grand-niece -- the grand-daughter of his brother Sarat Bose, told PTI, “We recently commissioned the fresh translation after we found inconsistencies in the Mukherjee Commission report and found several paragraphs in the letter written in Japanese missing from the official English version in the inquiry report.” The new translation by a Japanese language expert revealed that Nichiko Mochizuki, the chief priest of the Renkoji Temple -- a 427-year-old Buddhist temple, had written “I agreed to offer my cooperation for the testing. The same was agreed upon at the meeting with (Indian) Ambassador (M.L) Tripathi (to Japan) last year (2004)” in the omitted portion. The translation could not be independently authenticated by PTI.“We do not understand why this permission was not made public earlier or why DNA tests were not conducted,” said Madhuri Bose, who has served in the Commonwealth Secretariat and at the United Nations, besides authoring books on the Bose brothers.The Mukherjee Commission, which tabled its report in Parliament in 2006, had concluded that Bose “did not die in the plane crash, as alleged” by eye-witnesses, including his close confidantes from the INA, and that “the ashes in the Japanese temple were not of Netaji”.Eye-witnesses, including Col Habib-Ur-Rahman of the INA, had said Bose died in a plane crash in August 1945 in Taipei.Theories that he survived or was never on the aircraft that crashed gained ground as a result of the report, as also a hypothesis that he may have turned into an ascetic or imprisoned in a Russian gulag.A movie suggesting that he might have become someone called ‘Gumnami Baba’ was also made in the recent years, while several news reports indicated he might have been imprisoned by Russian leader Joseph Stalin in Siberia.“We had great faith in the Mukherjee Commission and we saw a glimmer of hope at one time that the truth about Netaji’s disappearance will come out with the final report... However many glaring discrepancies in the report forced us to look at it again,” said Madhuri Bose.“What we find is that the Japanese temple wanted a DNA test and we (India) never conducted one,” she said.The portion of the chief priest’s letter, which was omitted from the official translation, also said that after the Japanese lost the war, conditions under US-UK occupation were severe, yet the temple authorities undertook the then dangerous task of preserving Netaji’s ashes as sought by an Indian delegation, which included “Col Raman (Habib-ur-Rahman), Mr (SA) Iyer and Mrs (Sati) Sahay”, and by the Japanese foreign minister.The letter went on to say “therefore, I strongly believe these to be the same remains, the ashes of Subhas Chandra Bose without a doubt”.Mochizuki also said that his late father, then chief priest, “would sleep while embracing them (the urn with the ashes) in his arms so no tampering or harm would come to them”.Three members of the Bose family, including Netaji’s daughter Anita Pfaff, Dwarka Nath Bose -- a well-known physicist and son of his elder brother, and Ardhendu Bose -- another nephew of Netaji, wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October 2016 and December 2019, asking him to order a DNA test of the ashes at Renkoji.The letter written in December 2019 said that “in view of the fact that some Indians, also some members of our family, have previously voiced their doubts regarding the death of Netaji in Taipei, we hope the scientific evidence of such a test will bring closure to the discussion in India”.However, Madhuri Bose said no response has yet been received by the family for “a DNA test and final closure” to the mystery of Netaji’s disappearance and the ashes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mukherjee-panel-ignored-nod-for-dna-test-of-ashes-bose-s-kin-101642965784052.html
24-01-2022||India||Unfortunate that Shiv Sena nurtured BJP for 25 years: Uddhav Thackeray||Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said he believes that the Sena wasted 25 years in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and accused his former partner of using Hindutva for its political convenience, adding that the Sena never used it to gain power. Responding to BJP’s jibes that Sena had abandoned Hindutva for power, Thackeray said: “Today, the hollow Hindutva they display is nothing but a charade for power. It is unfortunate that we nurtured them for 25 years... We did not leave Hindutva and will never do so. We left BJP and not Hindutva. BJP is not synonymous with Hindutva... We wanted power for Hindutva. We did not use Hindutva to get power.”The chief minister was speaking during his virtual address to Shiv Sainiks on the 96th birth anniversary of the party founder and his father Bal Thackeray when he made the remarks. Thackeray’s party fell out with BJP after the 2019 Maharashtra elections and tied up with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. “We supported the BJP wholeheartedly to enable them to fulfill their national ambitions. The understanding was they will go national while we will lead in Maharashtra. But we were betrayed and attempts were made to destroy us in our home. So we had to hit back,” Thackeray said. He also accused the saffron party of using and dumping its allies as per its political convenience. BJP leader Atul Bhatkhalkar said: “Thackeray’s speech was full of hatred for the BJP and loaded with contradictory statements. If he thinks they rotted in the alliance with us for 25 years, why were they not able to perform in the recent local body elections?”

24-01-2022||India||Goa elections: TMC’s offer for alliance not considered as it poached Congress leaders, says Chidambaram||Congress veteran P Chidambaram on Sunday said the Trinamool Congress’s (TMC) proposal of a pre-poll alliance for the next month’s Goa Assembly elections was not considered by his party as the Mamata Banerjee-led party “poached” Congress leaders in the state.His statement comes three days after TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee said that if the Congress fails to dislodge the BJP from power in Goa, then Chidambaram, who is Congress’ state election in-charge, should own up the responsibility and resign. Banerjee had also said that the TMC had approached Chidambaram with a formal offer for a pre-poll alliance for the February 14 Goa polls.Talking to reporters here, Chidambaram said there was a suggestion from the TMC for a pre-poll alliance with the Congress in Goa.“What I can say is that there was a suggestion from the TMC that we should form an alliance (in Goa). (But) Before and after that, certain incidents took place,” the senior Congress leader said.He alleged that the TMC poached Congress leaders in the coastal state.“They poached Luizinho Faleiro, and even after the proposal of alliance, they poached Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, whose name was in the Congress’s first list of the candidates. They also poached in other constituencies, like Mormugao and Vasco,” he said, without naming any leader from these two seats.The former Union minister said that after these incidents, he did not get any instructions from the top leaders in the Congress over the alliance proposal.When asked about Abhishek Banerjee’s statement against him, Chidambaram said, “I don’t want to engage with the TMC general secretary. I occupy a humble position in the Congress party and I would not like to comment.”He said that Congress leaders had met Shiv Sena and NCP leaders over a pre-poll alliance in Goa. “But there was no meeting point, so we did not take it further,” he said.The Shiv Sena and the NCP have joined hands to contest the elections to the 40-member Goa Assembly, while Congress will be fighting the polls with the Goa Forward Party (GFP). The TMC has tied up with the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP).Replying to another question, Chidambaram said that Congress candidates in Goa will give their suggestion on whether to announce a chief ministerial candidate in the state.“We will take views of the candidates once nomination process is over and then communicate it to AICC (All India Congress Committee),” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-elections-tmc-s-offer-for-alliance-not-considered-as-it-poached-congress-leaders-sayschidambaram-101642965364104.html
24-01-2022||India||Mumbai air quality drops to poor as dust from Pakistan, Iran shrouds city||A day after a western disturbance and cyclonic circulation in Rajasthan triggered unseasonal rains in Mumbai, a thick layer of haze and dust engulfed the financial capital on Sunday, pushing the city’s air quality index (AQI) from to the “poor” category.As per the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily AQI bulletin, Mumbai recorded an AQI of 247 on Sunday, up from a “satisfactory” AQI of 99 a day earlier. As per the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the AQI on Sunday evening stood at an index value of 333, the highest in at least six months.While several citizens believed that a dust storm had hit the city, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and weather experts said the haze was caused by “dust raising winds” triggered by the same western disturbance which resulted in rainfall on Saturday. It also reduced Sunday’s temperature to its lowest January maximum temperature on record – 23.8 degrees Celsius (January’s highest maximum temperature, as per historical records, was at 37.4 degrees Celsius in 2006).“Hazy skies over parts of North Konkan (including Mumbai) and North Madhya Maharashtra today was due to suspended dust particles which were carried into the region along with the westerly winds,” KS Hosalikar, scientist, surface instrument division, IMD, said.“A prominent dust event is affecting parts of Maharashtra (including Mumbai-MMR), Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. This dust event has been triggered by a recent western disturbance, which is also causing the ongoing dip in Mumbai’s temperature,” independent meteorologist Akshay Deoras, who analysed the circumstances surrounding the haze, said. Deoras explained that even though the western disturbances were present at high altitudes, they can induce a low pressure nearer to the Earth’s surface.“This western disturbance induced a low pressure zone near Rajasthan and adjoining parts of Pakistan on the night of January 21. This caused an increase in the surface wind speed over Pakistan and adjoining eastern Iran, which started blowing the dust over these regions from the early morning hours of January 22. Within a few hours, the dust was visible over the Gulf of Oman and northern Arabian Sea, following which it entered Gujarat on the same day,” he said.“Winds from the northwest direction near the ground pushed the dust into Mumbai-MMR on January 23. Apart from Mumbai-MMR, this dust has already spread across several districts of Maharashtra such as Nashik, Ahmadnagar, Pune, Dhule, Nandurbar, Jalgaon, Buldhana, Akola and Aurangabad districts of Maharashtra on Sunday afternoon,” he added. Mumbai has seen multiple such dust events in the past, including a prominent one in March 2012. The source of dust has always been the arid regions of the Middle East and Pakistan, experts said. However, such events over the Middle East are generally more frequent during spring and summer season when factors such as high temperature, atmospheric instability, strong northwesterly winds and thunderstorms create ideal conditions for the triggering of dust storms. Dust storms observed in June and July are not able to impact Mumbai due to the monsoon conditions, they explained.Officials clarified that the haze witnessed on Sunday comprised more inert, crustal materials than pollutants. “This haze comprises mainly sand, because it originates from the Middle East where the conditions are sandier. It cannot be defined as smog, which comprises a more complex mixture of pollutants,” Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR, said. Sachin Ghude, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune, warned that the air quality and visibility will remain poor till at least the afternoon of January 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-air-quality-drops-to-poor-as-dust-from-pakistan-iran-shrouds-city-101642965063987.html
24-01-2022||India||Vijayan, Stalin write to PM Modi objecting to proposed amendments in IAS rules||Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin and his Kerala counterpart, Pinayari Vijayan, on Sunday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to drop the proposed amendments to IAS (Cadre) Rules,1954, saying the rules will “weaken the very root of co-operative federalism”. The chief ministers of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Jharkhand have in the past also opposed the proposed amendments which allows the Centre to summon any official (Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service and Indian Forest Service) for central deputation without the consent of the concerned state governments.In his letter to Modi, Stalin said the amendments “strikes at the very root” of the nation’s federal polity and state autonomy, “State governments are on the forefront of implementation of various programmes, including the schemes of the Union government at state level. The states also face frequent natural disasters which demand services of IAS officers in the state more than elsewhere,” he said. “Under such circumstances, forcing the state governments to depute officers would surely aggravate the ‘governance deficit’ in various states due to shortage of officers and also it is an ‘affront’ to the administrative frame work of the states,” he added. The Tamil Nadu chief minister also claimed that the proposed amendments “would cause irreparable damage to the spirit of cooperative federalism that exist between Union and the states and result in concentration of powers with the Union Government”. Vijayan said the Centre’s move will create “fear psychosis” among civil service officials to implement the state government policies.“The proposed amendments in the Deputation Rules of All India Services will definitely induce a fear psychosis and an attitude of hesitancy among All India Service Officers to implement policies of a state government, which are formed by party/parties politically opposed by the ruling party at the Centre,” he said in his letter to the Prime Minister. “The present deputation rules are themselves heavily loaded in favour of the Union and bringing further stringency will weaken the very root of co-operative federalism. The government of Kerala is of the opinion that the proposed amendments may be dropped,” he added. The Kerala chief minister said that in a federal setup, the state governments are on par with the central government because both are elected by the people, though the division of authority in the constitution gives the Centre jurisdiction over a wide range of subjects. At least five states have written to the Union government against the proposed changes so far. On Saturday, Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren had urged Modi to “bury” those proposals.Likewise on January 21, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel wrote to Modi, saying the amendments were in “contrary to spirit of federalism enshrined in the Constitution of India”. A day earlier, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had told the Prime Minister that the amendment will “destroy” the federal polity and basic structure of the Constitution.The chief ministers of the above states believe that amendments in the transfer rules would lead to shortage of staff even as Union government officials have claimed that the proposed changes would bridge the deficit gap between the central ministries and departments.The present rules provide that an officer, after working with states for a certain period, be made available for central deputation with the consent of the state concerned. If the Centre’s proposed amendments are implemented, the state’s consent will no longer be required in such matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-vijayan-stalin-write-to-pm-modi-objecting-to-proposed-amendments-in-iasrules-101642964583943.html
24-01-2022||India||Row, clashes mark Netaji’s birth celebrations in West Bengal||Celebrations to mark Subhas Chandra Bose’s 125th birth anniversary in West Bengal were marked by political tussle and violence on Sunday as chief minister Mamata Banerjee accused the Centre of ignoring the state and not doing enough to clear the controversy surrounding the freedom fighter’s final years. Speaking at a public event in Kolkata, Banerjee said the Centre was building a statue of Bose in Delhi but rejected a tableau that depicted his contributions to the freedom struggle. She was referring to a row that erupted last week over the Bengal tableau not finding a place at the Republic Day parade. The Centre later clarified that it was not a political decision and that only 12 out of 29 proposals were cleared. “Lighting a torch or setting up a statue of Netaji does not bestow the respect he deserves. Why is Netaji’s disappearance shrouded in mystery 75 years after Independence?” asked Banerjee. “This (central) government promised to reveal the truth but it did nothing. Our government released all documents on Netaji that we had in our archives,” she added. Since independence, at least three commissions have been set up by various governments to look into the final years of the freedom fighter who suffered a plane crash in 1945, but there has been no conclusive end to the controversy. Banerjee said Bengal was being ignored. “Whether it is the clarion call of ‘Jai Hind’ raised by Netaji, the national anthem composed by Rabindranath Tagore or the national song penned by novelist Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Bengal has been the torchbearer. Why is Bengal being ignored today in this manner? Nobody can ignore Bengal. I challenge them. Nobody can wipe out the history of Bengal and India,” she said. She attacked the Centre over the rejection of Bengal’s tableau. “Would it harm anyone if our tableau on Netaji was allowed at the Republic Day Parade?... Why is there an allergy for Bengal? In the past, our tableau on Gandhi and Rabindranath were rejected. Today you are setting up a statue under pressure from us. What were you doing all these years?” she said. The Centre has clarified that the decision to clear proposals for tableaus is taken by an independent expert committee. “You have spent crores on statues. Have you ever read the history of India? Have you protected our history? Today, everyone is afraid to speak up. Everybody is scared,” she said. The 125th birth anniversary of Bose, who remains incredibly popular in West Bengal, was celebrated across the state but the occasion was also marred by violence. Gunshots were allegedly fired during a scuffle between Trinamool Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers at an event at Bhatpara in North 24 Parganas district. The programme was organised by the TMC-controlled Bhatpara municipality. BJP Lok Sabha MP Arjun Singh alleged that he was stopped from garlanding Bose’s statue and subsequently attacked. TMC lawmaker Partha Bhowmick alleged that Singh’s security personnel fired seven rounds during the scuffle while Singh accused ruling party workers of opening fire, hurling bombs and ransacking his car. “Arjun Singh is trying to unleash terror in this region. His security personnel fired seven rounds although not even a stone was hurled at him. I am asking local people to be on the alert. Singh’s men may try to create more disturbance,” said Bhowmick. “Does the TMC hold exclusive rights to honouring Netaji? I was targeted. My security personnel were attacked with guns and bombs. My car was damaged,” said Singh. Video footage captured by local TV channels showed one of Singh’s security personnel loading a pistol and pointing it at some people who confronted the MP, police said the allegations of firing were being probed but there was no evidence of any clash, bombing or ransacking. “The fiasco started after a minor scuffle between two men. Only one man was injured. It has been alleged that shots were fired but no cartridge case was found from the spot. We are looking into this. The MP went to the celebration without informing the administration, which is mandatory according to protocol. Policemen deployed at the spot said there was no violence or bombing,” said Manoj Verma, commissioner, Barrackpore Police. Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar rushed to the spot. “A bullet narrowly missed one of the Central Industrial Security Force personnel accompanying Singh. We demand a probe by the Centre. Singh enjoys ‘Z’ category security cover,” said Majumdar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-clashes-mark-netaji-s-birth-celebrations-in-west-bengal-101642964524100.html
24-01-2022||India||In run-up to UP polls, BJP makes fresh campaign pitch with women politicians||Union minister for information and broadcasting Anurag Thakur, who has been coining interesting slogans to target the main opposition Samajwadi Party, on Sunday made a fresh campaign pitch with women politicians who have joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from other parties recently. After standing at the busy Hazratganj crossing with five-member teams holding placards with slogans like women’s safety written on them, Anurag Thakur again took to the streets on a cold Sunday afternoon. This time, he was with a delegation of women leaders, three of whom have made news by joining the BJP. The delegation included Aparna Yadav, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav’s sister-in-law who recently joined the BJP in Delhi, Congress’ rebel lawmaker from Rae Bareli Aditi Singh who joined the BJP recently, and Priyanka Maurya, who till a few days ago was on the posters of the Congress’ ‘Ladki Hoon Lad Sakti Hoon (I am a woman and can accept a challenge)’ campaign. Holding placards with women safety slogans written on them, Anurag Thakur and the women politicians held door-to-door campaigns in Hazratganj and Lalbagh areas before arriving at the BJP office. Aditi Singh, named as the BJP candidate from Rae Bareli, is among the 26 women to have found a place in the list of 195 candidates that the party has declared in four tranches so far. Aditi has been fielded from the same Rae Bareli (Sadar) seat from where she won in the 2017 UP polls.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had launched a women-centric poll campaign in Uttar Pradesh, declaring 40 per cent tickets to women candidates. The BJP is also up against a spirited Samajwadi Party (SP) and is seeking to target it on issues of women’s safety. The participation of women voters has steadily increased in UP, from 47 per cent in the 60s to around 60 per cent in 2019, the reason why all parties are wooing women, say experts. There is a buzz about the Congress mulling fielding Priyanka Gandhi Vadra from Rae Bareli. Through Aditi, the BJP has targeted the Congress leader and her party’s pitch on ensuring women’s safety. Priyanka Maurya, too, has left the Congress after mocking the party’s campaign “Ladki Hoon, Lad Sakti Hoon”. She has accused the party of denying her a ticket.In Aparna Yadav’s presence, Anurag Thakur hit out at the previous SP government for faring poorly on women’s security during its tenure.Aparna Yadav herself kept gesturing at her placard that read “Bahu beti suraksha aur adhikar (safety and share to daughter and daughter-in-law).” “It is the BJP where both Mulayam Singh Yadav’s bahu Aparna Yadav or Swami Prasad Maurya’s daughter Sanghmitra Maurya feel safe,” Thakur has been stating.Swami Prasad Maurya, the OBC leader that BJP imported from the BSP ahead of the 2017 UP polls, has now walked out of the BJP and joined the SP. But his daughter Sanghmitra continues to be a BJP MP from Badaun. The BJP has rolled out Kamal clubs and has entered the campaign with slogans like “Atmanirbhar naari hamara sankalp, ujjawal bhavishya yahin vikalp (committed to making women self-dependent, this is the only alternative to a brighter future)”. BJP leaders like Union home minister Amit Shah, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and the party’s state chief Swatantra Dev have all been talking of women’s safety. 
24-01-2022||India||Key aide of Sidhu booked in hate speech case ahead of Punjab elections||Punjab’s former director general of police, Mohammad Mustafa, who is a principal strategic adviser to state Congress unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, has been booked for allegedly making “communal remarks” at a public meeting in Malerkotla, triggering a political slugfest in the poll-bound state.However, Mustafa, the husband of Punjab cabinet minister Razia Sultana who is the Congress candidate from Malerkotla, has denied the charge. A video of Mustafa making the purported remarks was shared by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders Sambit Patra and Shazia Ilmi on their Twitter handles on Saturday.Malerkotla senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ravjot Kaur Grewal said: “The police registered a case for provocative speech on Saturday night. We have also sent a report to the Election Commission on Sunday morning.”The FIR has been lodged on the complaint of a police officer in Malerkotla, said an official.The purported video clip was played by the BJP at a press conference on Saturday. “I swear by Allah that I will not allow them (AAP) to hold any event. I am a ‘kaumi fauji (soldier of community)’. I am not an RSS agent who will hide in the house out of fear. If they (AAP) again try to do such a thing, I swear by Allah I will thrash them in their homes,” the video purportedly showed him saying at the meeting held on January 20.Mustafa said he used the word “fitno” (mischief makers) for AAP workers belonging to the Muslim community and there was no question of warning Hindus. “There was no Hindu-Muslim context to what happened in Malerkotla to which the quoted video clip relates. It was a verbal outburst unilaterally mischievously provoked by Jhaduwalas, all Muslims,” Mustafa said in a tweet.In another tweet, he hit out at the BJP, saying his “nationalist” credentials were superior than those accusing him. “Your intended branding will not work on Mustafa, as my nationalistic credentials are far superior to yours with a history of life long fight against enemies of India and destroyers of communal harmony in the state,” he wrote.AAP leader Raghav Chadha slammed Mustafa for his remarks and alleged that the Congress was trying to disturb the atmosphere in the state ahead of the state assembly polls BJP general secretary Tarun Chugh also took strong exception to Mustafa’s remarks and demanded that party leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi clear their stand on the matter.Chugh accused Mustafa of trying to foment communal hatred in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-aide-of-sidhu-booked-in-hate-speech-case-ahead-of-punjab-elections-opposition-mounts-attack-101642963984042.html
24-01-2022||India||SP urges poll panel to ban UP opinion polls||The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Sunday wrote to the Election Commission of India (ECI) seeking a ban on opinion polls being aired by television news channels, claiming that these could affect the outcome of the elections. The state president of the SP, Naresh Uttam Patel, in a short letter to the ECI asked for a “ban, with immediate effect” on the opinion polls. Patel, also marking a copy of the letter to the chief electoral officer (CEO), UP, wrote in Hindi: “The state is going to have polls in seven phases for which the last date of polling is on March 7 and counting of votes will be held on March 10. Several television news channels are running opinion polls that are misleading the voters, and the elections are getting affected. At the same time it is also an open violation of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) for elections...So for the free, fair, fearless polls it is necessary to ban opinion polls...”By law, TV channels are allowed to run opinion polls ahead of the polls, but not allowed to run exit polls (those conducted after elections) till all phases of voting are over in a multiphase election. That would mean that legally, the TV channels are allowed to run opinion polls ahead of the polls. Election Commission officials did not immediately respond to HT’s request for comment.The ABP-CVoter opinion poll this month predicted that the BJP and its allies will win with 223-235 seats in the state, with SP and its allies coming in second with 145-157 seats. The poll predicted the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress will trail with 8-16, and 3-7 seats, respectively. The Zee-DesignBoxed poll gave similar results.This has worried the SP, considered to be the main competition to the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party. UP votes in seven phases between February 10 and March 7 with the results on March 10. SP spokesperson Abdul Hafiz Gandhi said: “What’s the point in having an election, if TV channels are issuing verdits like this that might affect voters’ mindset. It is necessary to ban the opinion polls to make it a level playing field for all in the fray.”Manveer Singh Chauhan, Uttarakhand BJP spokesperson, said the party did not see any problem with opinion polls as they reflect the mood of the people. “If opinion polls are held in the right way, I think they tell you what people are thinking about different parties and governments,” he said.The party’s media incharge, Manish Dixit, hit out at the Samajwadi Party, saying, “If they had their way they would have stopped the electorate from delivering mandate in 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls, in 2017 UP polls too. The Samajwadi Party doesn’t believe in constitution, nor on constitutional bodies and now has problems with poll surveys by independent news channels too.”
24-01-2022||India||Assembly polls: Multiple high-stakes battles in Goa contest||Battle lines are drawn in Goa ahead of the assembly polls with the lists declared by all major political parties well ahead of the final date of nominations serving up more than a few heavyweight clashes that will be keenly watched as the state goes to the polls. Here is a look at some of them.Panaji: Utpal Parrikar (Independent) vs Atanasio Monserrate (BJP)At the top of the list of key battles -- pitched as one for the “soul of the BJP” -- features Utpal Parrikar, the son of former Union defence minister and four-time Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar and the party’s officially nominated candidate Atanasio “Babush” Monserrate.In its statutory public declaration of the criminal antecedents of candidates, the BJP said it was choosing Monserrate because he “can best represent the aspirations of the people”. The leader faces charges of rape, rioting, and assault -- all of which he has denied. He is seeking election from Panaji for the second time, and the first time from the BJP, which he joined along with nine other Congress MLAs in 2019 as part of a mass defection.A seat that was traditionally a Congress seat turned into a BJP seat after Mahohar Parrikar first contested from the seat and won it back in 1994 thanks to a split in the vote between two rival Congress candidates. Parrikar represented the seat since then, and when he moved to Delhi to take charge as the country’s defence minister, he ensured that the BJP-nominated Siddharth Kuncaliencar won. Monserrate’s first shot at the Panaji seat proved unsuccessful, losing to the Kuncaliencar at the 2017 polls. It was at the second attempt in -- the bypoll to fill the vacancy resulting from Parrikar’s death in 2019 -- that Monserrate emerged successful as a Congress candidate defeating Kuncaliencar.Doubts remain over whether Utpal Parrikar, who has little political experience and hasn’t yet walked the length and breadth of the constituency, can be successful against a seasoned politician well-versed in the finer elements of election management, solely on the power of his surname.Hoping to benefit from the split is the Congress candidate Elvis Gomes, a former bureaucrat who served as Panaji’s commissioner across several stints, and who was earlier the state convener of the Aam Aadmi Party.Margao: Digambar Kamat (Congress) vs Manohar Ajgaonkar (BJP)In the south Goa district headquarters of Margao, former chief minister Digambar Kamat is pitted against tourism minister Manohar Ajagaonkar. Ajgaonkar, who hails from Margao and has been a municipal councillor, has never represented the constituency before. His battleground has been the North constituency of Dhargal/Pernem, which he has represented twice. Increasingly unpopular in the constituency due to anti-incumbency, the BJP leadership decided to deny him that ticket, and instead offered that he contest against the Leader of Opposition for the seat the BJP has been struggling to find a candidate for.Kamat, on the other hand, has been representing the Margao constituency since 1994 -- first on a BJP ticket and then as a Congress legislator after he switched sides in 2005. He will, however, face his toughest challenge yet against Ajgaonkar, who served in his council of ministers between 2007 and 2012.Mandrem: Laxmikant Parsekar (Independent) vs Dayanand Sopte (BJP)Former Goa chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar quit the BJP in a huff on Saturday. A leader who earned ignominy as a sitting chief minister who lost his election, Parsekar will be up against the man who defeated him in 2017. Sopte was with the Congress at the time.Parsekar is miffed with the party leadership for handing the ticket from Mandrem, a coastal constituency in North Goa that includes the picturesque beaches of Arambol and Morjim, to Sopte. Sopte, who used to be with the BJP in the past as well, shifted to the Congress prior to the 2012 assembly elections after his seat Pernem was subsumed with another during a delimitation exercise, and contested from Mandrem against Parsekar. Unsuccessful, he remained with the Congress, tried again five years later, and this time proved victorious. In 2018, Sopte resigned from the party, and was welcomed into the BJP, much to Parsekar’s displeasure. After the party’s decision to choose Sopte over him, Parsekar has said he’s going it alone.The two are up against the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party’s (MGP) Jit Arolkar, a businessman and first-time candidate whose popularity has grown over the years in the area.Poriem: Pratapsingh Rane (Congress) vs Divya Rane (BJP)Will senior Congress leader and former chief minister Pratapsingh Rane run for office one final time? The octogenarian six-timeCM has kept his cards close to his chest despite being named as the Congress candidate for the Poriem seat.Rane has never lost an election. A 10-term legislator, he is Goa’s longest-serving MLA representing his seat since 1972 -- starting with the former legislative assembly of the Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu, until Goa got full statehood in 1987. He also holds a record for having served as chief minister (first of the UT and then of the state) for 16 years in different stints between 1980 and 2007. He was assembly speaker between 2007 and 2012.Now 82, Rane has been offered lifetime cabinet status by the ruling BJP in a bid to dissuade him from contesting, but has done a series of flip flops -- first saying his workers want him to contest, and then that it was perhaps time to call it a day. Rane was present at the meeting of Congress candidates on Saturday afternoon, but wasn’t among the 36 who went to pledge before the temple, church and dargah that they will not change sides after the polls.Should he contest, Rane will be up against his daughter-in-law Divya Rane, who has been named as the BJP’s candidate. Son Vishwajit had earlier said that the matter would be resolved “internally within the family”, hinting that this clash may not materialise.Fatorda: Vijai Sardesai (GFP) vs Luizinho Faleiro (TMC)The Trinamool Congress (TMC) took everyone by surprise when, in its first list of candidates, it declared that former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro was being fielded from the Fatorda seat represented by Goa Forward Party supremo Vijai Sardesai.Rajya Sabha MP Faleiro counts the Navelim constituency, located on one side of the Margao town, as his stronghold. There is a connection between the two constituencies though. Back when Goa was a Union territory with a 30-member legislative assembly, the two constituencies were part of a single Navelim constituency. Faleiro was an MLA then too, but much has changed since.Sardesai, a two-term MLA from the constituency, is eager to defend his turf from the party he snubbed in favour of the Congress for a pre-poll alliance. Hoping to win the seat at the expense of the two is former MLA Damodar “Damu” Naikof the BJP, who is eager for a repeat in the vote split that helped him win the seat in 2007.Benaulim: Churchill Alemao (TMC) vs Venzy Viegas (AAP)Veteran Goa politician Churchill Alemao has been a mainstay of Goa’s political scene since the late 1980s. A former chief minister, he declared earlier this month that the 2022 elections will be his last.Eager to ruin his farewell party is a young and meticulous first-time contestant Venzy Viegas of the Aam Aadmi Party. A mariner by profession, having risen up to the rank of captain in the merchant navy, Viegas has been steadily gaining popularity in the constituency that has a fair share of seafarers locally referred to as “shippies” and even ensured that the party’s candidate won the district panchayat polls held a little more than a year ago.Benaulim was the lone constituency where the AAP candidate was able to save her deposit in 2017, and this time the finish line is in sight as the party contests the elections with renewed vigour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assembly-polls-multiple-high-stakes-battles-in-goa-contest-101642963683446.html
24-01-2022||India||CII calls for lifting of curbs, offers 1% extra CSR for jabs||Indian industry has urged the government to curb social gatherings in pandemic-affected areas but to keep economic activities out of Covid restrictions, and offered an additional 1% contribution under corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds for a year as an aid to the 2022-23 Budget, specifically to fund booster doses of the vaccine.Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) president TV Narendran said Indian industry is keen to contribute to the world’s most ambitious vaccination mission.“CII suggests that 1% of mandated CSR funds be earmarked for vaccination. We also recommend that an additional 1% be added to CSR requirements in the Budget, for a specified period of 12 months, so that boosters can be made available to all age-groups.”Companies are ready to contribute an additional 1% under CSR norms to the national vaccination mission, apart from the mandated 2%, and this can be part of the Budget for a period of 12 months, he explained in a statement. .CII is an apex industry body with over 9,000 members from private as public sectors, and also has an indirect membership of over 300,000 enterprises from 294 national and regional sectoral industry bodies.CSR is mandatory for entities incorporated under the Companies Act, which says firms with a net worth of at least ₹500 crore or revenue of ₹1,000 crore or net profit of ₹5 crore must spend at least 2% of their average net profit made during the three preceding financial years on welfare activities. The CSR spend in 2019-20 was about ₹24,700 crore, with Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services, and state-run Oil and Natural gas Corp (ONGC) being top three contributors.“In fact, our recommendation has been that if companies spend on vaccines for their employees, their families and members of the community, then that expense can be set-off against this additional CSR spend,” said Narendran, who is also CEO & managing director of Tata Steel Ltd.The 2% mandatory CSR is the minimum requirement; companies can spend more if they wish to, a government expert in company matters said requesting anonymity. “There are many private and public sector companies who spend more than 2% on CSR. Besides, the law allows companies to front-load their CSR spend in one year and take offset in the next two years,” he added.‘Lift restrictions’The CII president also urged states to lift restrictions on economic activities given that the occupancy rate of hospital beds due to the Omicron variant of Covid is well within the manageable level. “While vaccinations have helped in dampening the impact of Omicron on the lives of people, the present conditions are conducive to opening up the economy completely while keeping large social gatherings to a minimum,” Narendran said.According to a dashboard maintained by Hindustan Times, on Sunday, 86.7% of Covid-19 hospital beds across 13 regions were vacant.“With a bounce back in demand, the economy is expected to achieve 9.2% growth rate over 2021-22. However, this pace must continue for full recovery and faster growth in the medium term and to ensure that workers and small enterprises do not suffer,” he added.A similar demand for a roll-back of restrictions in the national capital was also made by market and trader associations, HT reported on Sunday.The Covid-19 outbreak in March 2020, followed by a 68-day nationwide hard lockdown, had a devastating impact on the economy. India’s GDP shrank 24.4% in the first fiscal quarter ended June 2020. It plunged into a technical recession – negative growth for two consecutive quarters – as it contracted 7.4% in the next three months. Thereafter, the economy saw a V-shaped recovery on the back of a ₹20.97 trillion stimulus package and policy reforms announced since March 2020. A positive 0.5% growth was reported in the third quarter, followed by 1.6% expansion in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2021.The Indian economy started the current fiscal year with a 20.1% expansion in the first quarter (April-June 2021) followed by 8.4% growth in the second quarter ended September 2021, signalling a strong revival in business activities. The new wave caused by the Omicron variant, however, threatens to slow the growth pace. In its economic outlook on December 8, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) predicted India’s GDP growth at 9.5% in 2021-22, but cautioned “new mutations of the virus” as one of the downside risks to its outlook. The first advance estimates of NSO released on January 7, 2022, estimated India’s GDP growth at 9.2% in 2021-22, which is lower than RBI’s projection of 9.5% a month ago.CII asked states to consider curbs at micro containment zones only when hospitalisation rates are over 75%. “With a lower level of hospitalizations seen in the Omicron variant, it is possible to maintain normal economic activities and protect lives and livelihoods,” said Narendran.The industry body also urged state governments not to disrupt economic activities even in micro containment zones and allow all factories to function under certain conditions related to hygiene and safety. “There should be no distinction between essential and non-essential goods and services. All shops may be permitted to open without restrictions on timing to avoid crowding at certain times. However, crowd control is essential to enable social distancing,” Narendran said.CII hoped that the Budget, to be announced on February 1, will focus on measures for strengthening economic recovery.“The investments under National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) and Gati Shakti program must be fast-tracked and it is expected that the Budget would provide for this. These activities will be dampened if curbs on economic activity were to continue,” Narendran said in the statement.According to Aditi Nayar, chief economist, ICRA Ltd, the third wave would adversely impact the economy. “Following the re-imposition of state-wise restrictions to curb the third wave of Covid-19, the early data for January 2022 is expectedly weak; the daily average generation of the GST e-way bills dipped to 2.1 million during January 1-16, 2022 from 2.3 million in December 2021. After a YoY growth in December 2021, the sales of petrol and diesel of state refiners slipped back to a contraction in the first half of January 2022.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cii-calls-for-lifting-of-curbs-offers-1-extra-csr-for-jabs-101642963624668.html
24-01-2022||India||Homage to Netaji on his 125th birth anniversary||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday unveiled a holographic statue of freedom fighter Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at central Delhi’s India Gate, and exhorted citizens to build a new India before the 100th year of Independence in 2047. The 3D hologram, which will later be replaced by a 28-feet high and six-feet wide granite statue of the freedom fighter, was opened to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Bose. On the occasion, the PM also conferred the Subhas Chandra Bose Aapda Prabandhan Puraskar to seven individuals and organisations. “We have a goal to fulfil the dreams of independent India. We have the goal of building a new India before the hundredth year of Independence,” the PM said. He said that it was unfortunate that after Independence, work was done to erase the contribution of many great personalities along with the culture of the country. “The freedom struggle involved the penance of lakhs of countrymen, but efforts were made to confine their history as well. But today, the country is boldly correcting those mistakes,” Modi said while citing the development of the Panchtheerth in honour of BR Ambedkar, observing Birsa Munda Jayanti to remember the contribution of the Adivasi leader, and building the Statue of Unity in honour of Vallabhbhai Patel. The PM said that the granite statue of Bose will soon be installed at India Gate. “This is a historic location and a historic occasion. Netaji refused to bow before the British. His statue will inspire democratic values and future generations,” said Modi.Addressing the gathering, he said that Bose, who had established the first independent government in India, gave the country the confidence to achieve a sovereign and strong India. “This statue is a homage to the hero of freedom by the grateful nation and will keep on reminding our institutions and generations the lesson of national duty,” he said. The hologram statue will be powered by a 30,000 lumens 4K projector. The 3D image of Netaji will be projected on a transparent holographic screen to create the effect of a hologram. “If Netaji Subhas was determined to do something, then no power could stop him. We have to move ahead taking inspiration from Netaji Subhas’s ‘Can Do, Will Do’ spirit,” the PM said. The PM also conferred the Subhas Chandra Bose Aapda Prabandhan Puraskars for the year 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 in the investiture ceremony. This award was instituted by the Union government to recognise and honour the contribution and service by individuals and organisations in disaster management. The Gujarat Institute of Disaster Management (GIDM) and Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority’s vice-chairman Vinod Sharma were selected for the award for 2022, the government announced. The PM said that there was a transformational change in India’s preparedness to deal with disasters in the past few years. After the 2001 Bhuj earthquake, the Gujarat government was the first to formulate a state disaster management Act, which was followed by a National Disaster Management Act. “We have laid emphasis on reform as well as an emphasis on relief, rescue and rehabilitation. We have modernised the National Disaster Response Force and expanded it across the country. Space technology and other best possible practices have been adopted for planning and management,” Modi said. He said the country’s disaster preparedness played a crucial role even during Covid pandemic, as there were earthquakes, cyclones and floods in various parts of the country. But lives were saved due to quick response of the disaster management teams, he said. President Ram Nath Kovind also paid his tribute. “India gratefully pays homage to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on his 125th birth anniversary. The daring steps that he took to fulfil his fierce commitment to the idea of a free India — Azad Hind — make him a national icon. His ideals and sacrifice will forever inspire every Indian,” he said. Speaking at the event, Union home minister Amit Shah lauded the memory of the freedom fighter. “The hologram will be soon replaced with a granite statue. It is not just a statue but a befitting tribute to the legendary Netaji, who gave everything for India’s freedom.”Shah congratulated Modi for announcing the Bose statue and said, “For decades, efforts were made to erase the names of people who contributed to India’s freedom struggle and worked towards it.” Bharatiya Janata Party chief JP Nadda said the Modi was fulfilling the dream of new India first seen by Bose. Modi also paid floral tribute to Bose’s portrait in Parliament’s Central Hall but Congress leaders could not be seen at the function, according to some parliamentarian and a Lok Sabha functionary.Across state capitals, chief ministers paid rich tributes to Bose. In Kolkata, CM Mamata Banerjee said the Centre should declassify files to clear the controversy surrounding the freedom fighter’s final years. In Mumbai, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and state minister Aditya Thackeray paid their respects to Bose.The Congress party said that if the government was serious about celebrating Bose’s legacy, it would start safeguarding freedom and rights. “Netaji would never have let the Amar Jawan Jyoti, a tribute to our soldiers, be extinguished and our martyred heroes be insulted in such a way,” the party tweeted, referring to the controversy around the merging of the eternal flames at the Amar Jawan Jyoti India Gate with that at the National War Memorial on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/homage-to-netaji-on-his-125th-birth-anniversary-101642963563312.html
24-01-2022||India||Punjab elections: Capt Amarinder Singh releases Punjab Lok Congress’s first list of candidates, to contest from Patiala||Former chief minister and Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) supremo Captain Amarinder Singh on Sunday released the first list of candidates for 22 constituencies for the February 20 assembly polls in the state, and announced that he will again contest from his home constituency of Patiala Urban.The party, which also named former Indian hockey team captain Ajit Pal Singh as its nominee from Nakodar, has been allotted 37 out of the 117 seats as part of its alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt). The line-up announced by the former chief minister includes several former leaders from the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Congress, the party Amarinder quit after being removed from the chief minister’s post four months ago. However, contrary to Amarinder’s claim that several sitting MLAs and cabinet ministers will join his party, there was no sitting Congress legislator or minister on the list. Three sitting MLAs, Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi, Fatehjung Bajwa and Harjot Kamal, who quit the Congress in recent weeks, have all gone into his alliance partner BJP’s fold. “We have given a good set of candidates with clear focus on winnability while ensuring due representation across regions and various sections of the society,” Amarinder said while releasing the first list of candidates at a virtual press conference. He said discussions were continuing with the BJP on five more seats for the party. As per the present arrangement, the BJP will contest 67 and the SAD (Sanyukt) 13 seats. Of the PLC’s allocation of 37 seats, 26 are in the Malwa region, 7 in Majha region, and four in Doaba region.A five-time MLA, Amarinder has won from Patiala Urban three times in the past. Besides being a part of his stronghold of Patiala district, the assembly segment also falls in his MP wife Preneet Kaur’s Patiala Lok Sabha constituency. “Will contest from Patiala, won’t leave my family’s home of 300 years. Will seek votes on my government’s achievements and Modi govt’s accomplishments at the Centre,” Amarinder’s media adviser Raveen Thukral tweeted, quoting him. In this seat, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has fielded turncoat and former Patiala mayor Ajitpal Singh Kohli, who jumped ship from the SAD two weeks, to take on the former chief minister, while Harpal Juneja is the Akali nominee. The Congress is yet to name its candidate. In Malwa, the PLC has fielded Farzana Alam Khan, a former SAD legislator and wife of late DGP Izhar Alam Khan, from Malerkotla. She is the only woman among the first batch of candidates. The list includes eight Jat Sikhs, four from the Scheduled Caste community, three from the OBC community, and five Hindus. One of the candidates from the Malwa region is the current Patiala mayor Sanjeev Sharma, who was the president of District Youth Congress for several of years. He will contest the Patiala Rural seat.Kamaldeep Saini, former Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee secretary, has been fielded from Kharar, while Jagmohan Sharma, former president of the Ludhiana district Congress committee, will contest from Ludhiana East. The Ludhiana South seat will be contested by Satinderpal Singh Tajpuri, the son of the former cooperation minister in the previous SAD government.Prem Mittal, a former SAD MLA from Mansa and former senior deputy Mayor of Ludhiana, has been fielded from Atamnagar, while Damanjeet Singh Mohi, an active Youth Congress functionary and former chairman of Market Committee Mullanpur, has been named as the PLC candidate from Dakha. Retired bureaucrat Mukhtiar Singh has been fielded from Nihalsinghwala. Other candidates include Ravinder Singh Garewal from Dharamkot, Dr Amarjeet Sharma from Rampura Phul, Raj Nambardar from Bathinda, Sawera Singh from Bathinda Rural, Subedar Bhola Singh Hasanpur from Budhlada and Dharam Singh Fauji from Bhadaur.Bikramjit Inder Singh Chahal, son of Capt Amarinder Singh’s close associate and adviser BIS Chahal, has been named from Sanaur, and former Punjab Congress secretary Surinder Singh Kherki will contest from Samana. In the Majha region, the party has fielded Tejinder Singh Randhawa, former vice president of DCC Gurdaspur, from Fatehgarh Churrian, while former MLA Harjinder Singh Thekedar will fight from the Amritsar South seat. Amandeep Singh, former Punjab Congress spokesperson, has been fielded from Bholath and Satvir Singh Palli Jhikki from Nawanshahr in Doaba. AAP MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan said Amarinder has lost his political relevance. “There can be no bigger proof than the PLC’s first list of candidates which is nothing more than a document. He is just banking on the BJP for survival.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-elections-capt-amarinder-singh-releases-punjab-lok-congress-s-first-list-of-candidates-to-contest-from-patiala-101642963444022.html
24-01-2022||India||Mamata Banerjee’s UP drive part of TMC’s national plan||West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) president Mamata Banerjee’s decision to campaign for the Samajwadi Party (SP) in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh is not a one-off political move but a model that can be replicated in other states as well, two senior party leaders said.Banerjee is expected to hold a virtual campaign for the SP and subsequently address a joint press conference with SP chief Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow on February 8. The TMC president is also likely to visit Varanasi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency, to campaign exclusively for the SP ahead of the February 10 elections. The Bengal chief minister’s plan to get involved in the Uttar Pradesh elections for the SP also comes in the backdrop of TMC’s growing tension with the Congress (after TMC poached several lawmakers and senior leaders and attacked the Congress in the last few months) and her ambition of bringing together opposition parties for a united battle against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the next national election. “We are fighting in states such as Goa or Tripura. But it doesn’t mean we would be fighting in all states. Like, we have no long term plan to contest in Maharashtra. We would not fight the polls in Tamil Nadu or Kerala,” TMC’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien said. According to Trinamool leaders, it is in states where the BJP is in power that the Bengal-based party would try to take on the ruling side. The TMC is unlikely to contest in states where there is a strong regional party or a strong opposition party on the ruling side. “In Uttar Pradesh, it is in our best interest to support the SP. In other states, if the local parties want Mamata di to support them, she will definitely try to help the regional parties,” another senior TMC leader said, seeking anonymity. TMC leaders also point out that Banerjee herself has been advocating this model. “Wherever an opposition party is strong, other opposition parties should try to support it. This can be a solid foundation for an opposition unity,” a second leader said, also seeking anonymity.The second leader also pointed out that a major reason behind the friction between the Congress and the TMC is the fact that the Grand Old Party, in alliance with the left parties, had contested in all 294 seats in the West Bengal assembly elections last year. A senior Congress strategist, however, argued that Banerjee’s decision to campaign in other states for opposition parties, other than the Congress, would have “little impact.”“She is certainly the biggest leader in Bengal. But her appeal is restricted in Bengal and perhaps in other Bengali speaking areas. But beyond that, Banerjee is not a vote catcher,” a senior Congress strategist said, wishing not to be named.
24-01-2022||India||Netaji’s statue at India Gate an attempt to save face: Former Tripura CM Manik Sarkar||Former Tripura Chief Minister and opposition leader Manik Sarkar on Sunday criticised the Centre’s rejection of a proposed Republic Day tableau on Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose’s role in India’s freedom movement and said that the Centre’s decision of setting up the freedom fighter’s statue at India Gate was an attempt to save face. Pointing out that the Centre had rejected tableaus of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, apart from West Bengal, the former Tripura CM said, “The Centre only selected the tableaus of their choice. The states didn’t have any rights or freedom. The Centre’s decision to set up Netaji’s statue at India Gate was in order to save their faces. They can better explain how much respect they pay to Netaji through unveiling the statue.”On the rejection of West Bengal’s tableau, Sarkar said, “What mistake did the Bengal government make by choosing Netaji as the theme for the Republic Day Parade? Netaji’s birthday is of importance as this year is his 125th birth anniversary. Why did they (Centre) reject the tableau?”The Tripura opposition leader added that though Netaji was born in Odisha, studied at Presidency College and moved to London for his IAS, he had started his revolution from Bengal. Sarkar was attending a blood donation programme at Bamutia, a few kilometres away from Kolkata.After their proposed tableau was rejected by the Union government, the West Bengal government decided to display a similar tableau during the Republic Day Parade held annually in Kolkata. The Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) did not make any comment on the issue. However, BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya said, “His comments show a secret understanding between CPM and the Trinamool Congress.

The youth, who sustained a bullet injury in his leg, is undergoing treatment at the Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH).While the police allege that Bora was shot at after he attacked a police team and some vials of heroin were found in his possession, the youth’s family members maintain he is innocent and accused the police of targeting him without reason.“I had earlier issued strict instructions to the police to deal with criminals with a firm hand. But if any innocent is hurt by police actions, it won’t be tolerated. Measures will be taken against policemen, if they are found involved in wrong doing,” said Sarma on Sunday.Earlier, Assam Police had informed that the police personnel involved in the shooting have been sent to the police reserve with immediate effect and assured that if there’s any lapse, “guilty personnel will be taken to task”.“Police in police clothes were questioning a person suspected of carrying drugs. At that time, Bora reached the spot and asked the police team if they were police personnel. When the team members replied in affirmative, Bora started attacking the policemen,” Nagaon police superintendent Anand Mishra told journalists.“It was while trying to overpower Bora that the police team resorted to firing. If they had not done it, there could have been a fatal injury. If there is any lacuna on the part of the police, it will come out during investigation,” he added.Bora is a member of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU). On Sunday, its members and representatives from other student groups staged a protest rally outside Nagaon police station demanding the arrest of the police personnel who shot at Bora.“I strongly condemn police action against Bora, an innocent youth. Incidents such as this one have created an atmosphere of police terror in the state. It is an example of a brutal state. We want strict action against those guilty and warn police to refrain from such things in future,” AASU chief advisor Samujjal Bhattacharya tweeted.Opposition parties also picked the issue to target chief minister Sarma.“I visited Bora’s home on Sunday. He comes from a simple family and was trying to earn a living by giving tuitions. Police attack on such a youth is a reflection of licence to shoot given to police by the CM,” said Congress state president Bhupen Kumar Borah.“We have been witnessing such extra-judicial shootings in the state in past months. Today it was Bora, but tomorrow it could be anyone of us. Public should come out against such police acts,” he added.Raijor Dal president and Sivasagar MLA Akhil Gogoi condemned the shooting and demanded the arrest of the accused policeman. He also sought suspension of the Nagaon superintendent of police.On January 11, the Gauhati High Court had directed the Assam government to file a detailed affidavit within two weeks on alleged fake encounters by the state police since May last year.Hearing a petition filed by lawyer Arif Jwadder, a division bench of justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Soumitra Saikia had directed that a detailed counter affidavit should be filed by Secretary (Home) or Additional Secretary (Home).In his petition filed in December, Jwadder mentioned that 80 incidents of fake encounters had happened in the state since May 2021 (since the new government under Sarma took charge) and they resulted in 28 deaths and left 48 injured.

There were also several people with postgraduate degrees -- 90 in arts (MA), 41 in science (MSc), 11 in business administration (MBA), and 25 masters in Commerce -- who opted for the course. Apart from this, some other people with other postgraduate degrees, including M.Ed, M. Arch , and MCA, also signed up.Six customised course have been developed under two larger categories – fresh training and upskilling – by the Healthcare Sector Skill Council (HSSC). The training duration is between three and four months. The candidates are trained in working basic equipment such as oxygen concentrators and pulse oximeters, and to provide support in handling clinical, trauma, and mass casualty emergencies. They are also trained to provide support in home aide services, maintain record of patients, collect samples including swabs, and conduct rapid antigen tests (RAT). The training programmes are being conducted at Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras (PMKKs) and other affiliated government training centres.“I was working as a data entry operator in a private firm in Lucknow and was earning ₹8,000 a month when I got to know about this course. I have had interest in the medical field since the beginning, and it was a great opportunity for me. I am soon going to complete the course and hope to get a decent paying job in a hospital after this,” said Atiq-ur-Rahman, a resident of Gorakhpur, with a Master’s degree in Hindi Literature.Officials at the ministry said that they are yet to compile the data of candidates who have been placed in different jobs after completing the course. “A large majority of the candidates opted for the fresh training category that was meant for persons new to the medical field, and therefore, they are yet to reach the placement stage. However, some of those from the first batches have started getting placed,” said a senior official who asked not to be named.Nitu Kumari, a resident of Darbhanga in Bihar, recently got a job in a private hospital in Noida as a nursing assistant at a salary of ₹12,000 per month after completing the crash course. “I wanted to further study after my graduation but I could not pursue my dream due to the poor financial situation of my family. When I got to know about this crash course I decided to take it. Also, I wanted to help people amid this pandemic in any possible way. I have seen people dying at home during the second wave of pandemic last year,” she said.
24-01-2022||India||Omicron in community transmission: INSACOG||The Omicron variant of the coronavirus is now in community transmission in India and has become the dominant strain in multiple major cities, according to the Indian Sars-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) based on whole genome sequencing results of positive Covid-19 samples.The findings by INSACOG are in line with what has been observed by scientists across the world regarding the Omicron variant’s key characteristic of high transmissibility, which enables it to quickly outstrip the circulation of all other variants in any region.Experts said that this development is not a cause of immediate concern as Omicron is known to cause milder infections compared to other variants such as Delta. This means that it will likely lead to a rapid spike in cases, which cause a far smaller proportion of hospitalisations, and an equally sharp fall in cases – all trends that are already visible in several metros across the country that were the early hot spots of India’s third Covid wave.“Omicron is now in community transmission in India and has become dominant in multiple metros, where new cases have been rising exponentially,” read the latest INSACOG bulletin, dated January 10, released on Sunday.A senior expert from INSACOG, a consortium of 10 central laboratories and 28 regional ones, said that the results were not surprising.“This particular variant is known to spread much faster and it would have spread rapidly once it entered into the community. Therefore, the extent of spread is not surprising that way. The silver lining being it does not seem as severe clinically as the Delta variant,” said the expert, who asked not to be named.The data further shows that while cases continue to rise nationally, cases appear to have already peaked in the major metropolitan areas (the earliest outbreak centres of Omicron variant in India) such as Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai, without leading to any crisis in hospital resources such as beds, medical oxygen, and medication.In Mumbai, the seven-day average of new cases has dropped more than 67% from the peak of 17,523 cases a day witnessed on January 12. In Delhi, this number has dropped 45% from the January 15 peak of 23,529 cases a day. In Kolkata it has dropped 70%, while it has dropped 10% in Chennai. Most importantly, neither of the cities mentioned above were on the cusp of facing a crisis like they did during the Delta wave. Despite the rapid rise in cases, nearly 80% of beds earmarked for Covid were consistently available through these cities.Experts said that the Omicron variant is very different from the original virus detected first in Wuhan in 2019, and is far less lethal. “Omicron is a different disease than the original Covid-19; it’s not a killer disease like Covid-19 as show the mortality data. It is a deviant as it has shifted so far antigenically its virulence,” said T Jacob John, former head, virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore.“As for national peak, rural areas have to be saturated for that and it has not happened yet. However, cities individually may attain peak, like it happened with Mumbai a few days ago, and is currently happening in Delhi. At most of the other places cases are going up,” he added.The INSACOG bulletin added that India may not be able to utilise screening for Omicron based on “S-gene dropout”, like many countries have been able to, as a substantial proportion of Omicron infections in India appear to be a lineage (BA.2) that may give higher false negatives in S-gene dropout screening.“Tests suitable for PCR-based screening applicable to all Omicron lineages have been approved for use,” the researchers from INSACOG said.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country’s apex biomedical research regulator, has begun approving test kits that it says are capable of detecting all sub-lineages of the heavily mutated Omicron variant. “Among the non-genome sequencing method of detecting Omicron, there is an S-gene target failure which is being used in the UK (TaqPath RT-PCR kits); however, Omicron has three lineages— BA. 1, BA.2, and BA.3, and sub-lineage BA.2 does not cause S-gene dropout and that is 30% of the times and is a problem with the TaqPath kit. Now, an innovative solution has been developed in India which is detecting the S-gene drop-out as well as all three sub-lineages with very high sensitivity and specificity that has been developed by TataMD, and is validated by ICMR,” said Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR, in one of the recent weekly Covid briefings.The overall aim of INSACOG has been to monitor the genomic variations in the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, on a regular basis through a multi-laboratory network. There are 269 sentinel sites identified across the country from where samples are being collected for testing.Of the total number of samples sequenced so far, 127,697, sequences have been analysed.The bulletin also says that the recently reported B.1.640.2 lineage is also being monitored.The World Health Organization (WHO), in November last year, classified B.1.640.2 as a variant under monitoring.“There is no evidence of rapid spread and while it has features of immune escape, it is currently not a variant of concern. So far, no case detected in India,” confirmed the INSACOG bulletin.The rate of hospitalisation during this wave has been much lower compared to the previous wave with Delta, which caused India’s brutal second wave of infections in April-May 2021. The researchers at INSACOG said that due to very high rate of new infections, the absolute number of hospitalisations has crossed previous highs in many countries and is therefore creating stress on health care systems.However, such a phenomenon of hospitals being overburdened has not yet been observed in India. According to a hospitalisation tracker by HT, which covered 13 regions, more than 85% of Covid beds are currently unoccupied in the country.While deaths have also been much lower during the new wave, the majority of severe cases and deaths have been seen in unvaccinated subjects or those with severe comorbidities. “The broadest possible protection is going to be through hybrid immunity, which is a result of previous infection plus vaccination,” said Gagandeep Kang, senior vaccine expert, and faculty at Christian Medical College, Vellore.
24-01-2022||India||Assam woman who was declared foreigner gets citizenship after HC intervention||Shefali Rani Das, an Assam resident who was declared an illegal migrant in 2017, has become Indian citizen again after intervention of the Gauhati high court.She was declared as foreigner in an ex-parte judgement by member (judge) of Silchar’s Foreigners Tribunal because her lawyer didn’t appear before the court on the days of hearing. The 2017 opinion was challenged in the Gauhati high court last year and Shefali got another chance to prove her identity. She has now proven her claim before the tribunal court and become Indian citizen again.Daughter of Lakhi Das, Shefali Rani Das is a resident of Mohankhal village under Sonai constituency of Cachar district. A case was filed against her in 2015 questioning her citizenship. Foreigners Tribunal court sent Shefali a notice and asked her to appear with necessary documents to prove her Indian identity.Shefali appeared before the court accordingly and appointed a lawyer in her support. Tribunal Court gave her dates to appear further and she depended on the lawyer she appointed. But the lawyer didn’t appear before the court on several dates. The lawyer didn’t even communicate with her resulting in Shefali becoming a declared foreigner on 19 September 2017.Advocate B.P. Sinha challenged tribunal court’s 2017 opinion on behalf of Shefali Das in the Gauhati high court last year. The HC agreed that the claims made by Shefali Das are true and on July 20, last year asked the Silchar’s FT-6 to hear the case again.Member (judge) of Silchar’s FT-6 Dharmananda Deb accordingly heard the case again and declared Shefali an Indian on January 17 this year.Deb’s judgement/opinion copy read as, “on the basis of the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act, 1983 (which was struck down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in Sarbananda Sonowal -Versus- Union of India 2005) the case of Shefali Rani Das reached to the Foreigners Tribunal No.1, Silchar, Cachar for opinion as to whether the proceedee (Shefali Rani Das) is a foreigner or not under the Foreigners Act, 1946. The case was registered in Foreigners Tribunal No.1, Silchar as FT Case No. 3433/2012.Thereafter, the case was transferred to the Foreigners Tribunal No.6, Silchar and the said case was again registered on 04.12.2015 as FT-6 Case No. 404 of 2015. Notice was duly served upon the Opposite party in accordance with the provisions of para 3(5) of the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964 to appear and file written statement (representation).Upon receiving the Notice, the O.P. appeared and filed her written statement (representation) on 16.06.2016 along with some copies of documents.However, Sefali Rani Das failed to appear before this Tribunal to face the cross-examination on 20.02.2017, 09.03.2017, 26.05.2017, 25.07.2017 and 11.09.2017 without any steps and the reference was proceeded exparte judgement and declared her as foreigner.”“As the Gauhati high court opined that citizenship being a very important right of a person which should not be decided one sided, we heard the case again. We found that Shefali Rani Das’s documents are authentic and genuine. After examining the case thoroughly, we are in opinion that she is an Indian citizen,” Deb wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-woman-who-was-declared-foreigner-gets-citizenship-after-hc-intervention-101642931038859.html
24-01-2022||India||German Navy chief quits after controversial Ukraine remarks at Delhi think tank||The German Navy chief, Vice Admiral Kay-Achim Schönbach, has resigned following a controversy over his remarks on the situation in Ukraine at a think tank in New Delhi, casting a shadow over Berlin’s maiden effort to project its role in the Indo-Pacific.Schönbach’s visit to India last week coincided with a port call in Mumbai by the German frigate Bayern, the first visit to India by a German warship in almost a decade. The warship was deployed in the region for seven months and sailed through the South China Sea as a manifestation of Germany’s new Indo-Pacific policy.During an interactive session on Friday at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA), a government-backed think tank, Schönbach said he didn’t believe Russia intends to occupy Ukraine and that all Russian President Vladimir Putin is looking for is respect, and complying with this would be a “low cost” option.In unusually blunt remarks, Schönbach also said China is “giving money to dictators, to killers, to criminals” to gain access to the natural resources of their countries, and that India and Germany need Russia to take on China.The remarks – especially Schönbach’s contention that the Crimean Peninsule will “never come back” to Ukraine following its annexation by Russia in 2014 – caused consternation in European security circles, and Ukraine’s foreign ministry summoned the German envoy on Saturday to stress “the categorical unacceptability” of the German Navy chief’s comments.As pressure grew on the German government to fire the navy chief, Schönbach resigned late on Saturday. “I have asked Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht to relieve me from my duties with immediate effect,” he said in a statement. “The minister has accepted my request,” he said.Earlier, Schönbach apologised for his remarks on Twitter, saying his security policy statements at a think tank event in India were his personal opinion and didn’t correspond in any way to the official position of the German defence ministry. “There is no need to quibble, it was clearly a mistake,” he tweeted in German.Russia is accused of having amassed 100,000 troops at the border with Ukraine and the US and its allies have demanded these forces be withdrawn. The European Union (EU) and the US also contend that Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine is unacceptable and must be rolled back, and Schönbach’s remarks directly contradicted this position.Schönbach’s resignation also comes at a time when Germany is facing criticism for blocking Estonia from providing German-origin weapons to Ukraine. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Germany refused to issue permits for the weapons to be sent to Ukraine.The three Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – have decided to send US-made Javelin and Stinger missiles to Ukraine as part of defence-related assistance. The US state department has permitted Estonia to send US-made weapons to Ukraine.In a video of his interaction posted on the YouTube channel of IDSA, Schönbach is heard saying: “Is Russia really interested in having a small, tiny strip of Ukraine soil to integrate in their country? No, this is nonsense.”He added, “I think Putin is probably putting pressure on it because he can do it, and he knows that if [he does it], he splits the European Union. But what he [Putin] really wants is respect...and my God, giving some respect is low cost, even no cost.“So, if I was asked, it is easy to even give him the respect he really demands and probably also deserves.”Schönbach described Russia as an “important country” while referring to its background as a Christian nation. “Even we – India, Germany – we need Russia because we need Russia against China,” he said.His remarks reflect divisions among European nations and the US in responding to the situation in Ukraine.Schönbach was tougher on China while responding to questions. He said the Belt and Road Initiative was getting countries in Africa mired in debt while the Chinese side made inroads into the infrastructure and security sectors.He said he spoke about the money that China gives to countries under its Belt and Road Initiative with the foreign ministers of Mali and Niger and noted that China is the biggest lender in Africa. “When you do this, you can never pay back the credit. This is impossible,” Schönbach said.“Who is working there? Chinese engineers and workers. Who is controlling this infrastructure? Chinese. Who is installing CCTV cameras for controlling the whole society? China. What is your outcome? Zero,” he said.He added, “China is giving money to dictators, to killers, to criminals. It doesn’t matter as long as they give their resources to China.”
