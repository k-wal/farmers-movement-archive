26-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi: Cold last hurdle between Pragati Maidan corridor, Feb 15 deadline||Construction work on the 1.2-km-long Pragati Maidan tunnel project and six underpasses under the integrated transit corridor development plan for Pragati Maidan is expected to be completed by February 15, government officials overseeing the key infrastructure project said. However, the deadline would be met only if the ongoing extreme cold conditions abate soon, they added. The officials explained that though more than 95% work on the project has been completed, they are yet to fix the road surface in the tunnel since the cold weather is not conducive for the use of bituminous construction material which is the key ingredient laying coaltar-asphalt roads. The tunnel road and six underpasses — five on Mathura Road and one on Ring Road — will decongest the roads around Pragati Maidan which is being redeveloped. The tunnel road goes beneath Pragati Maidan, starting near National Sports Club of India on Purana Qila Road and ends on the Ring Road near the Pragati power station.The project is also expected to cut traffic jams for at more than 100,000 commuters who use the key arterial roads. The Bhairon Marg section will also face less traffic congestion after the opening of this tunnel. Two of the five underpasses on Mathura Road are near Sundar Nagar and three are between Pragati Maidan and Supreme Court. The underpass on the Ring Road connects it with Bhairon Marg.A senior government official said the work on the underpasses and the tunnel “is in very advanced stage”. “The civil work in both tunnels and underpasses is complete, and an informal deadline for completion of remaining electrification/lighting, artwork and road surfacing has been fixed at February 15. We will carry out the safety audit of underpasses along with Delhi Traffic Police in the second half February,” the official said.The bitter cold that has gripped Delhi through January, leading to several weeks where the maximum temperature has been unrelenting, has caused the second coldest spell of winter recorded in the city in more than seven decades, and the coldest start to a year in 19 years, HT reported on Tuesday.Delhi is also currently also in the middle of the sixth longest spell of consecutive days since 1951 where the day temperature has been significantly below levels considered normal, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) gridded data set. A senior official of the Public Works Department said if the agency goes ahead and use hot asphalt mix to lay roads, they won’t last long. “An optimum temperature of at least 14-15 degrees Celsius is required for laying good quality bituminous surface roads. The project is in final stage, and the extremely cold condition is the last hurdle in its completion. Most of the hot mix plants are located outside Delhi and we need to factor in the travelling time and subsequent cooling of asphalt mix too,” the official explained. The project has so far missed six deadlines with the agency citing flooding of underpasses during monsoon and ban on operation of hot mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi NCR during November and December 2021 on account of rise in air pollution levels as some of the reasons behind the delays.PWD estimates show that the ITO-bound traffic on the stretch is around 62,000 passenger car unit (PCU) per day and Bhairon Marg users account for 57,000 PCUs per day. PCU is a vehicle unit used for expressing highway capacity.Dr. S Velmurugan chief scientist, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) said the tunnel and the underpasses are estimated to reduce the congestion in the region by at least 15%-30%. “The project will help reduction in traffic on key arterial roads that lead to the stretch from east and south Delhi. The congestion nodes at Bhairon Marg and Sunder Nagar will be relieved. The Pragati Maidan corridor is a very important project which will be helpful in reduction of traffic in central Delhi while facilitating movement from south, south east and east Delhi,” he added. Velmurugan said the agency may use cold and warm mix technologies for road laying to reduce the road construction time during winters.Prof Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning in the School of Planning and Architecture, said the project may play a key role in de-cluttering central Delhi. “The main tunnel directly provides connectivity between Ring road and Mathura Road both of which face frequent traffic snarls. The link will make for a smoother flow of vehicles on both the arterial roads. It also provides regional traffic connectivity for commuters moving from east towards central Delhi. The impact will be felt up to the end point of Barapullah where new congestion nodes have emerged near Lodhi Road and AIIMS,” he added. The construction work on the integrated corridor started in 2017 and its first deadline was March 2019, after which five more deadlines have been missed so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhicold-last-hurdle-between-pragati-maidan-corridor-feb-15-deadline-101643221487924.html
26-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi HC orders man accused of sexual assault to do community service||New Delhi: The Delhi high court has asked a man to do community service on weekends for a month and imposed a cost of ₹35,000, as the condition for quashing an FIR registered against him for groping a woman and outraging her modesty. The man had earlier reached an amicable settlement with the accused and subsequently moved the court to quash the FIR.The FIR claims that the accused allegedly groped and forcefully kissed his tenant when she went to the bathroom on July 26, 2016. The complainant said she didn’t make any noise due to fear and went to her room.The woman claimed that on July 28, 2016, the accused again allegedly misbehaved with her and tried to outrage her modesty, following which she approached the Gandhi Nagar police station.In April 2019, both the parties made an amicable settlement and moved the court seeking quashing of the FIR.On January 20 this year, the complainant told the court that the accused has sought for her forgiveness. She said she has forgiven him for his misdeeds and does not intend to proceed with the matter any further.Noting the submission, justice Subramonium Prasad, while quashing the FIR, directed the man to do some community service “to atone for his sins” and also warned not to repeat such actions in the future.“Accordingly, the petitioner is directed to do community service at Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital on every Saturday and Sunday for one month i.e. from February 1, 2022 to March 2, 2022. He shall report to the Medical Superintendent, Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital on February 1, 2022,” the court noted in its order.The court asked the accused to file a certificate from the medical superintendent of Lok Nayak hospital after completion of one month to show compliance of the order.“In case of any absenteeism/default or any misbehaviour on the part of the petitioner, the same shall be conveyed immediately by the Medical Superintendent, LNJP, to the concerned SHO, who shall in turn inform the counsel for the State, for bringing the same to the notice of the court and for seeking recall of the orders passed today (January 20),” the judge added.Meanwhile, on January 3, the same judge directed two persons to do community service at Safdarjung hospital änd GTB Hospital for a month in exchange of quashing an FIR where they had beaten people with wooden rods in the Punjabi Bagh area in 2016.The court said that considering that both the accused were aged 25-26 years and that they have amicably solved the matter, it would not be appropriate to keep the FIR pending.The judge, however, directed the accused to do social service “so that they can understand the pain and suffering of an injured victim and hope that they will not indulge in such activities in future”.“The petitioner No 1 is directed to report to the medical superintendant, Safdarjung Hospital, and the petitioner No 2 is directed to report to the medical superintendent, GTB Hospital, on January 15, 2022. It is directed that the petitioners shall do the work assigned to them and on completion of their one month community service from January 15 to February 15 in the concerned hospitals, the petitioners shall obtain a certificate from the medical superintendant concerned and file the same in the registry of this court to show compliance,” the judge noted in his order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-orders-man-accused-of-sexual-assault-to-do-community-service-101643221127531.html
26-01-2022||Delhi||More beds free up in Delhi, fewest admitted with Covid-19 since Jan 10||Covid-19 hospitalisations in the national capital are at a two-week low, amid an overall downturn in the city’s infection tally and active case count, shows data from the Delhi government, which doctors across the city’s health care facilities said is an indication that the fifth wave of the pandemic is well under control.Also Read | Delhi sees slight surge in daily Covid count with 7,498 new cases, positivity rate at 10.59%Delhi government data shows that while Covid-19 hospitalisations in the city started plateauing around 10 days ago, a visible fall in admissions started from January 19, when 2,734 dedicated beds in the city’s hospitals were occupied. This number dipped to 2,698 beds on January 20, then 2,656 on January 21, then 2,504 on January 22, and 2424 on January 23.The trend continued on January 24, when 2,394 hospital beds were occupied and on January 25, when 2,304 beds in the city were taken up. As on Wednesday, of the 15,420 Covid-19 beds in Delhi, just 2,137 (13.86%) were occupied, showed state data, the fewest since 1,999 on January 10.The drop in the number of occupied hospital beds between Tuesday and Wednesday, was the largest so far during the fifth wave, with 167 beds being freed up in 24 hours.Also Read | DDMA meet: Delhi govt to suggest reopening of schools as Covid crisis easesThe seven-day average of infections in Delhi fell to just over 9,000 on Wednesday, the lowest since 8,370 on January 7 this year.Data shows that in Delhi, the highest proportion of beds occupied was on January 17 when 18% of the city’s 15,505 available beds were in use.Doctors at the city’s major Covid-19 hospitals confirmed that these numbers mirrored the downward trend of infections in the Capital.Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak Hospital, the largest Covid hospital in the city run by the state government, said the facility has 98 positive patients admitted, as against 140-150 patients around a fortnight back.“Admissions are declining at a faster rate over the last three or four days. Usually, when we see a fall in infections, the consequent dip in hospitalisations lags a few days. This seems like a positive sign that we have passed the worst of this wave,” Dr Kumar said.He added, “Currently, those admitted with Covid-19 are either senior citizens or those with severe co-morbidities.”This is in line what has been observed globally in Covid-19 surges caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus that is fuelling India’s third – and Delhi’s fifth - wave of infections. Most patients who are infected by the variant of concern are able to recover at home without needing medical care in an institution.Further, deaths during the current surge have been a fraction of those seen during previous surges. For instance, on April 20 last year, as the fourth wave hit its crescendo, the infection claimed 277 lives. In fact, the daily death toll, even at its highest during the fifth wave so far (45 on January 22), has been lower than that during the peak of infections during the third wave of infections in November 2020. On November 11 that year, Delhi added 8,593 Covid-19 cases, which was the highest daily count at that point, but logged 85 deaths.Two sets of analyses by the Delhi government earlier this month showed that those most at risk of mortality during the Omicron surge remain the unvaccinated and those with pre-existing comorbid conditions.A senior official of Delhi government’s health department concurred and said hospitalisations were much lower compared to the previous waves.“We were prepared to deal with the worst situation, and that was initially projected to be around 70,000 to 100,000 cases per day. We have managed to avert the worst... In this wave most people have recovered at home and have not required hospitalisation. The people who needed hospital care were either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, senior citizens and people with severe illnesses,” the health official said.At no point since cases of Covid-19 began surging in the Capital this year has the hospital bed occupancy rate been beyond 20% of capacity, data released by the Delhi government every day shows.Doctors at private hospitals also confirmed similar trends.Dr DS Rana, chairperson of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said, “There are definitely more discharges now than admissions, and this can also be attributed to greater awareness among people. In the earlier waves, people panicked more and rushed to hospitals but now they can see that they are getting better at home. We are seeing people in ICUs (intensive care units) but these are mostly people who had severe diseases like cancer, kidney problems etc. They were already in ICUs and were shifted to Covid ICUs when they tested positive.”
26-01-2022||Delhi||In a first, Delhi Police wings builds security infra for R-Day parade, tableaux||New Delhi: The physical security infrastructure for the Republic Day parade and tableaux this year was built by the Delhi Police’s own engineering wing, the Delhi Police Housing Corporation Ltd (DPHCL), for the first time, said police officials aware of the development. Until last year, the security infrastructure, such as building fences, boundaries and erecting watch towers, was built by the Public Works Department (PWD).Delhi police officers said that the force will use its own engineering wing to build the security infrastructure for the Independence Day celebrations too. The housing corporation, which has been in existence for more than a decade, is otherwise primarily involved in construction and maintenance of police buildings. The Capital was put on high alert as just weeks ago, an improvised explosive device (IED), made of RDX and ammonium nitrate, was found outside the Ghazipur flower market. It was diffused through a controlled explosion by experts from the National Security Guard (NSG). Coupled with an explosion inside a court in Ludhiana last month and recovery of RDX in Punjab’s Gurdaspur five days ago, the Delhi Police was forced to take up extra security measures.At least 27,000 police personnel were posted for the Republic Day security arrangement apart from personnel from the paramilitary forces.Special commissioner of police Jaspal Singh, who is also the managing director of the police’s housing corporation, said, “Since the work was of sensitive nature and had a direct correlation with the security of the route and that of tableaux, a high degree of planning and meticulous execution was required. The task was entrusted for the first time to DPHCL. The arrangements included the barricading and fencing of around 6km on either side of the road on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg and Netaji Subhash Marg (ITO to Jama Masjid), provisioning of 14 watch towers for commandos to overlook the route security, and provisioning of sand bags.” The engineers also placed water pumps at five low–lying areas along the parade route. Special commissioner Singh said that the pumps were placed to remove water in case of rain, along with a maintenance vehicle manned by 10 workers. “In the future, the corporaton will undertake similar security infrastructure work,” added Singh.

Instead of going to schools and spending time in playgrounds, all their activities now take place on mobile phones."The pandemic-induced school closures have not only affected their studies, but also their mental health. During Covid, our priority was children's safety. But since various researches have now found that Covid is not so harmful for kids, it is important to reopen the schools, as now is the time for exams and related preparations," Sisodia said.Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio, said schools are being reopened in several countries and even many Indian states."On this basis, the Delhi government will recommend reopening of schools in the DDMA meeting scheduled on January 27," he said."While the Covid cases and positivity rate are on the decline in Delhi, it would not be suitable to keep children away from schools. With children returning to schools, not only will the schools witness a buzz but it will also indicate lives coming back on track," he said.Meanwhile, a delegation of parents led by Chandrakant Lahariya, an epidemiologist and public policy specialist, and Centre for Policy Research president Yamini Aiyar, met Sisodia and submitted a memorandum signed by over 1,600 parents demanding that the schools be reopened."Why are we the last among major countries to decide on this? I agree with their demands. A generation of children will be left behind if we do not open our schools now," added Sisodia.Thursday's meeting will be chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and will discuss whether Covid-19 curbs should be eased in Delhi. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will also be present in the meeting that is expected to take place at 12.30pm.Apart from reopening of schools, easing of other restrictions in Delhi is likely to be discussed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ddma-meet-delhi-govt-to-suggest-reopening-of-schools-as-covid-crisis-eases-101643214883869.html

In some cases, they also clashed with security forces and vandalised railway property.On Wednesday, some protesters in Gaya allegedly set a bogie of the Bhabua-Patna Intercity Express on fire. Police said the situation is under control and some of the miscreants had been identified.The Indian Railways, meanwhile, has constituted a committee to look into the concerns of the candidates over NTPC CBT-1 Result.“Candidates are given three weeks time up to 16.02.2022 to submit their concerns and the committee after examining these concerns will submit their recommendations by 04.03.2022,” an official statement read.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rrbntpc-exam-row-yogendra-yadav-lists-4-demands-of-protesting-candidates-101643188826501.html

26-01-2022||Mumbai||Tracking Mumbai’s three waves: How treatment for Covid-19 has evolved||MUMBAI: Soon after the Covid-19 pandemic started in March 2020, patients occupied hospital beds right up until their Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests to detect the coronavirus were negative, which often took several days. Two years later, as we face a third wave of cases in Mumbai, the treatment protocol has changed. Today, a repeat RT-PCR is strictly disallowed, except when symptoms worsen.To track the pandemic is to understand how our treatment and hospitalisation protocols have transformed over the past two years. Doctors now know that SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 disease, can be detected in upper respiratory tract for up to three months of the onset of illness.Also Read: Tracking three waves of Covid-19 pandemic in MumbaiHowever, the virus after a five to 10-day time period is not “replication competent” if the symptoms have subsided, which means that it is not likely to be infectious.Protocols changedIn the third wave some therapies remain significant, while others have disappeared from the protocol followed by treating physicians. There is still a lot to learn, doctors said.The earliest guidelines for clinical management of Covid-19 was issued by ministry of Health and Family Welfare in March 2020. Members of the Covid-19 task force in each state also developed treatment guidelines, based on evidence from the West, clinical practice and the Centre’s suggestions. The Indian Council of Medical Research ICMR) national Covid-19 task force has since then issued clinical guidance.“Three therapies — oxygen, steroids and anticoagulants — have stood the test of time and have made a difference when it comes to saving lives,” said infectious disease expert Dr Tanu Singhal, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital.Singhal said that many drugs were re-purposed for Covid-19. For instance, in the first wave, doctors commonly used the antibiotic, azithromycin and anti-malarial drug, hydroxychloroquine which is also often used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Drugs like antibiotic doxycycline and anti-parasitic ivermectin became a part of the unspecified treatment protocol.“All these drugs have gone away from the current line of treatment,” Singhal said. Two medicines — antiviral remdesivir and an anti-inflammatory drug tocilizumab — used in the first wave, stayed on.“We have conflicting data over the past two years on these two drugs, but they are useful when administered at the right time,” she said.A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in December 2021 showed that early Remdesivir could prevent progression to severe disease if the drug was given on an outpatient basis.Till now, the common remdesivir course has been for five days and it has been administered only to hospitalised patients. This drug was also in short supply in the second wave of the pandemic, leading the Bombay high court to order the state to procure more vials as well as monitor its sale.Some of the treatments used in the first wave were downright wrong. For instance, the use of convalescent plasma, a blood component taken from recovered patients— there was insufficient evidence to show that it worked.By the second wave, the medical fraternity was slightly more confident in dealing with patients. But the enormity of the wave, driven by the Delta variant, overwhelmed the healthcare system.“We began intubating patients much earlier in the second wave in order to reduce mortality,” said internal medicine specialist Dr Anita Mathew from Fortis Hospital. “Early oxygen therapy also played a key role in recovery,” she said.“Continuous overuse of antibiotics to deal with a virus, high doses and unwarranted use of steroids and unnecessary CT scans were some of the biggest errors we saw. We risked antibiotic resistance, allowed the spread of life-threatening fungal infections such as mucormycosis and further caused the spread of infection as crowds gathered at radiology centres. It felt like there was a lack of common sense,” Dr Sujeet K Rajan, a respiratory medicine specialist from Bombay Hospital, said.Third wave, new treatmentsIndia granted an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) to the monoclonal antibody cocktail drug in May 2021, but by the time it came into use, the second wave had started receding.The cocktail drug gained prominence in the third wave, but data has now shown that the two monoclonal antibodies — casirivimab and imdevimab — available in India failed to neutralise the Omicron variant in a laboratory setting, according to a study published by Frankfurt-based researchers in December 2021.“Timing is everything when it comes to Covid-19,” said critical care specialist Dr Kedar Toraskar from Wockhardt Hospital, who is also a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force.“We now know that antivirals like remdesivir, and even the new drug molnupiravir works best during the viremia phase [presence of the virus in the bloodstream]. It goes without saying that doctors should select the patients carefully considering all the contraindications. Steroids, anticoagulants, and immunomodulators drugs are to be used in the inflammatory and cytokine storm phases,” said Toraskar.Experts also said that a lot has also changed because the virus is up against a population that has vaccine-induced immunity and past infection-induced immunity. “Proper use of masks and vaccinations will continue to be the key,” said Dr Mathew of Fortis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tracking-mumbai-s-three-waves-how-treatment-for-covid-19-has-evolved-101643190944764.html
26-01-2022||Bhopal||Disquiet in Madhya Pradesh over demolitions without due process||BHOPAL: For years, Vijay Bhawsar ran a grocery shop from his home in Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain. He extended it by making a temporary shed to keep more items. There were no problems till January 15 when a banned Chinese kite string ended up slitting a woman’s throat. The woman died and drew attention to shops selling the strings. The district administration soon raised three shops including that of Bhawsar over illegal constructions.“I have lost my only source of income,” said Bhawsar. He added it would now be difficult for him to feed his family of five. Zubair and Hrithik, who also lost their shops for selling Chinese strings, claimed they were unaware of the ban on them. They alleged police did not take any action against the wholesale suppliers and targeted them.At least 1,453 properties of 779 people have been raised over illegal constructions over the last year in Madhya Pradesh. The authorities have maintained this was part of action against mafias and goons and involved properties worth ₹558 crore. In 2020, the government said 2,000 hectares of land worth around ₹10,000 crores was freed from 1,271 alleged encroachers.Officials said similar action has been taken against people found involved in rape, murder, food adulteration, selling of spurious liquor, inciting communal tension, harassing tribals and Dalits, and recently for selling Chinese kite strings.A campaign against land encroachers was started in 2019 when Kamal Nath was the chief minister. It was expanded when Shivraj Singh Chouhan took over in 2020 and properties of those involved in heinous crimes such as rape and murder were also raised.Officials said district administrations take calls on demolishing illegally constructed property after registering cases. The action was accordingly taken against those involved in adulteration of milk in Chambal, murder of a tribal man in Neemuch, for inciting communal violence in Dhar, Khandwa, Ujjain, and Indore.In September, a 25-year-old man was burnt to death when he was found with a married woman in Sagar. On the complaint of his family and dying declaration of the man, four people, including the woman’s father, were arrested. A few days after their arrest, the district administration demolished their house and triggered protests from their Brahmin community. The community asked the government to reconstruct the house. As the matter escalated, the state government transferred the district collector and police superintendent for taking action in haste and handed over the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation.“Without court’s judgement, police and district administration declared us guilty of murder and demolished our house. We are now living in rented accommodation in Sagar,” said a member of the family.In Dhar, a three-storey building of one Khalil Khatri was demolished after a stone was pelted from it on a procession. Police registered a case against 30 persons.Police superintendent Aditya Singh said they asked Khatri to show the building permission but he failed to do so. “The house was constructed illegally.”Khatri said the land on which the building was constructed belonged to him and he did not take the permission for constructing it. He added other houses constructed in the locality were built also without any permission. “They should have given us time but they did not listen to our plea and demolished my house.” Khatri is moving court for compensation.Rights activist Madhuri Singh said by demolishing houses, the government was punishing entire families with the person alleged to have committed a crime. “This demolition drive is unconstitutional, illegal, and a complete failure of the rule of law.”Ehtesham Hashmi, a lawyer who is researching the demolition drive, said in most of the cases, the state government says constructions were illegal but should have given prior notices for demolition. “This (demolition drive) is a violation of human rights and I will move a petition to the high court against it.”After the demolition of three houses in Ujjain, Congress leaders Digvijaya Singh and Arif Masood condemned the drive. “Shops of retailers were demolished but no action was taken against the wholesalers because he is a (ruling) BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) leader. Why? Discrimination? Be fair Mr CM you have taken oath of Constitution,” said Singh in a tweet.Masood accused the state government of targeting minorities through the demolition drive. “The government is trying to terrorise Muslims by demolishing their houses. We are making list and I am sure out of 1,400, maximum demolished houses belong to Muslims.”Home minister Narottam Mishra rejected the allegations. “Whoever does wrong, irrespective of their caste and community, lawful action is taken.”Chouhan has appreciated the action against the “mafia” and encroachments. “Action should be taken against both common encroachers and mafia.”
26-01-2022||Mumbai||Tracking three waves of Covid-19 pandemic in Mumbai||Since March 11, 2020, Mumbai has seen three waves of the Covid-19 pandemic, each one registering a higher peak than the previous. Our understanding of the virus — and how to fight against it — has also changed tremendously. From being under one of the strictest lockdowns imposed across the globe as cases hit three-digits in the initial months to cautious restrictions that ensure daily livelihood is impacted the least, even as cases touch five-digits every day, the administration’s handling of Covid-19 too, has changed tremendously.“I would say that the first wave was about learning, in the second wave we were hand to mouth for oxygen supply. Though we never ran out of oxygen, we had to shift patients due to oxygen supply issues. In the third wave, we are much more comfortable but are on alert. The second wave was the most stressful. But now, with vaccination and as two years have passed, there is more data available. We are able to get clear-cut guidelines from the state and Central government on handling of cases. Earlier, there were frequent amendments due to the evolving situation,” Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of BMC said.Also Read: &lt;strong&gt;How Covid-19 treatment through Mumbai's 3 waves has evolved&lt;/strong&gt; Here’s a look at some of the most important changes over the past three years:Civic responseIn January 2020, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) announced that it will start screening international passengers arriving from China, Hong Kong, United Kingdom among other countries for symptoms of Covid-19 like fever, cold or cough. The first test was conducted on February 3, and the result was negative. The BMC continued to screen and trace passengers for another month, and detected the first case of Covid-19 in the city on March 11: a senior citizen couple, travelling in a group of 40, returning from Dubai tested positive for the coronavirus. The other members of the group, who travelled to other cities outside Mumbai, tested positive for the virus too. The couple was isolated in Kasturba hospital, the city’s first infectious hospital.In the first week of February, the then municipal commissioner of the BMC Praveen Pardeshi announced a sum of ₹2 crore for the upgradation of the civic-run Kasturba Hospital — and equip it with a 100-bed isolation ward to treat Covid patients. As of today, the corporation has spent close to ₹3,000 crore for Covid-19 infrastructure, with nine Covid-19 jumbo centres with 15,000 beds (ranging from isolation beds to oxygen, ICU and ventilator beds). In all, the city now has 35,000 beds, of which around 11,000 beds are in 186 private hospitals in the city.Test, trace, containIn the initial days of the pandemic, suspected cases were isolated in the civic-run Kasturba Hospital, and tested. Their close contacts were traced and tested to. ‘Test, trace and track’ became the basis of the protocol. If several cases emerged in a building or due to a super-spreader event, the civic body made containment zones around the hotspot.The BMC conducted its first test on February 3, 2020 and by March, private laboratories were given permission to conducting Reverse Transcription – Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Since then, more than 14.2 million tests have been conducted over two years. At first, the BMC used to send a team at suspected patients’ home to test them. Starting March 2020, only symptomatic close contacts of a positive patient were tested. Asymptomatic high-risk contacts were tested on the seventh day, and if negative, they were asked to remain in home quarantine for seven days. Low risk asymptomatic close contacts were not tested but were asked to remain in home quarantine for 14 days.Mumbai became the first city in India to open up testing starting July 7, 2020 — anyone wanting to get tested could do so without a doctor’s prescription.Post this, several mild cases were home quarantined after tracing and their building, slums and chawls were sealed. By the second wave, the BMC started sealing slums, chawls or buildings only after a cluster of cases were found. In the third wave, a building is only sealed if more than 20% of the flats have Covid cases. As of now, the city has 58 sealed buildings.In terms of tracing, initially, at least five to 20 close contacts were identified and screened. However, the ratio has changed. At present, two to 18 close contacts are traced for screening. The BMC continues to fumigate the premises of a positive case.In the first wave, densely populated slum clusters and chawls including Dharavi and Worli Koliwada were among the worst-hit areas. In the second and third waves, a majority of the cases have been found in high-rises. According to BMC officials, this is because in the first wave, those living in high-rises did not mingle much on account of the lockdown. After the curbs were relaxed, socialization ensued and since then, far more cases are reported from high-rises. Even today, 80-90% of the cases in the third wave are from high-rises and the remaining is from slums and chawls.According to civic officials, this shift has also meant that the demand for beds in private hospitals went up.As daily caseload increases, the number of tests conducted increases, and in each of the waves, this has resulted in a backlog at private laboratories causing longer waiting periods for test results. At the height of the second wave, patients complained of test reports taking up to four days. The BMC guidelines make it mandatory for private laboratories to release reports in 24 hours after collection of samples, but that doesn’t always happen.Owais Mirza, a resident of Mazgaon said, “My sister was tested positive for Covid-19 last week and we had to wait for two days to get a slot for home collection of Covid-19 samples. We also ended up buying a home kit due to this, but considering they are not very reliable we went on with the laboratory reports.”Since June 2021, home test kits have been available, and in the third wave, their sales have skyrocketed. However, this has posed a problem for the BMC: many positive patients are not declaring their result to the civic body. In order to keep a tab on this, the BMC recently asked chemists to share details of the persons buying such home kits, so that the civic body can follow up with them.On January 13, a senior civic official said that at least 100,000 kits were sold on that day, and between 1 and 2% of those who tested themselves at home were positive for Covid-19.Isolation and hospitalisationBetween May and October 2020, as cases began to spiral upwards, symptomatic and high-risk age groups, and persons with co-morbidities were isolated in hospitals. The rest were advised home quarantine or isolation in government facilities.In the second wave — the demand for oxygen, ICU beds and ventilators shot up drastically resulting in patients hunting for beds. A long waiting list greeted anyone contacting the BMC ward war room in a bid to find a hospital bed, and the BMC helped admit patients on priority depending on their clinical symptoms. Several patients were advised by doctors to isolate at home with oxygen concentrators, if their situation warranted it.By comparison, in the third wave, around 80% of the beds out of the total around 35,000 beds are vacant, and the BMC has anticipated that even if the city reports double the number of cases, it is currently reporting (i.e 40,000 or more) the civic body will be able to arrange beds for everyone. This is because, starting June 2021, the BMC began to ramp up the infrastructure.Close to 80-90 % of the cases reported daily basis are asymptomatic. Those with mild symptoms are now advised seven-day home quarantine.Ward war roomsBetween March and August 2020, the bed allotment system was centralised — all calls by Covid-19 positive patients were made to a toll-free number, 1916, of the Disaster Management System. On August 10, the BMC created 24 ward war rooms and decentralised the bed-allotment system. Each war room consisted of health officers, interns and doctors who evaluated the patient’s case history — and their blood oxygen level — before taking a call on allotting a bed in a Covid-19 hospital or quarantine facility.This arrangement depended on seamless coordination between the control room and hospitals. Thousands were helped. However, as the caseload spiked, the war rooms found themselves overwhelmed. Many citizens took to social media platforms to complain; even the BMC upped its communication game. It began to tweet out ward war room information and asked citizens to trust the civic body. “Please understand that the Ward War Rooms have no reason to hold back beds if there are any vacant. If you aren’t getting a bed, it’s because beds are full. War Rooms will surely update you with an alternative arrangement as soon as they can,” its official Twitter handle posted on April 24, 2021.At present, the burden on ward war rooms is lesser. As a majority of the cases are asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, positive cases and close contacts are mostly in home quarantine. The war rooms in each of the city’s 24 wards remain active.Vaccination programmeTowards the end of 2020 had conducted a door-to-door survey in which it had identified around three million people who were both vulnerable and senior citizens. Conducted between the first and second waves, this helped the civic body execute treatment and pandemic management protocols. It also helped in the roll out of the vaccination programme in January 2021.The second wave began in the city in February 2021 and it had reached its peak in April. This was also the time when India was rolling out its newly-launched national vaccination programme: after health care and frontline workers, whose vaccination started in January, the programme began for senior citizens starting March 1. By May 1, everyone above 18 could get their jabs.For BMC officials, the second wave surge went hand in hand with rolling out the vaccination programme. Staff management was one of the biggest challenges. By the third wave, the city has achieved over 100% first dose coverage and 90% second dose coverage.In the past few weeks, with the inclusion of booster shots for senior citizens and jabs for 15–18-year-olds, the civic body is focused on ensuring this target population is covered.Dr Madhav Sathe, Former Professor of Microbiology at Nair Hospital said, “The unvaccinated population will remain to be a concern considering they have the potential to bring further spikes in the near future. We have to ensure that the maximum number of citizens is fully vaccinated.”Dr Balkrishna Adsul, dean of civic-run Seven Hills hospital in Andheri, which was one of the first dedicated Covid-19 hospitals in the city said, “We are at it (on Covid-19 duty) since two years now and let me tell you that we are the most comfortable and confident in the third wave despite the fact that caseload is much higher compared to second and first wave. Patients are getting discharged within five days, and it is easier to manage bed distribution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tracking-three-waves-of-covid-19-pandemic-in-mumbai-101643189564572.html

An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.The System of Air Quality And Weather Forecasting and Research said the air quality improved slightly but remained within “poor” category. “Prevailing foggy conditions and low temperatures as well as low mixing layer height are preventing efficient ventilation of pollutants leading to AQI to be within ‘Poor’ on the Republic Day. From 27th (Wednesday) onwards, AQI is likely to improve due to relatively clear sky and moderate wind speed enhancing ventilation of near surface pollutants.”The minimum temperature on Tuesday was six degrees Celsius and the maximum 12 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-air-quality-in-poor-category-amid-continuing-cold-weather-101643166162062.html

26-01-2022||Delhi||From the pages of Hamlet||‘Crenellation’.Many of you know the meaning of this word. Some of us might not, and we can always Google it. But certainly, all of us ought to head to a particular monument in Delhi and gaze upon this word as it exists in the real world.Cambridge dictionary explains ‘crenellation’ as “a wall around the top of a castle, with regular spaces in it through which the people inside the castle can shoot”.This detail is most clearly illustrated at Dilli Gate in central Delhi. The top of the stone gateway is punctuated with large tablets of stone, which are separated from each other by vertical slits through which the warriors of old times must have aimed their guns, or spears, at the barbarians gathered outside the gate.A landmark of more than 400 years, Dilli Gate is one of the 14 gateways that punctuated the protective wall of the Walled City of Shahjahanabad. Even as most of those gateways are lost to Delhi’s violent history, along with most of the wall, this gate is not unique. Three other gateways of its kind survive. But there is something distinctive about Dilli Gate. Stranded amid the hubbub of a modern-day avenue (Netaji Subhash Marg), it is imbibed with a spirit of wilderness, and it feels far, very far.In contrast, its other cousins — Ajmeri Gate and Turkman Gate — have evolved to become a seamless appendage to Delhi’s contemporary pulse.You see neighbourhood men hanging out 24/7 in front of Turkman Gate, with a police chowki attached to it like a limpet; while snack carts abound around Ajmeri Gate. But Dilli Gate stays deserted. Maybe because it is in the middle of a busy road, where it stands aloof like a monumental divider.The gateway is always locked. From a distance, it looks like a rugged Hebridean island, with stones protruding from a stormy sea (of traffic). The stairs going towards the top are easily noticeable.Until some weeks ago, they were covered with weedy grass. At night, as the darkness descends, the gateway appears like a translucent monolith exuding mystery and gloom, and acquires the solemnity of a forgotten tragedy.Indeed, it will be a most appropriate place to stage Hamlet, arguably William Shakespeare’s greatest tragedy, with the doomed hero seeing the ghost of his murdered father dissolutely passing down the stone stairs.Naturally, the most dramatic time to view the gateway is late at night. In the day, the crenellations teem with peacetime pigeons, compromising Dilli Gate’s intimidating essence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/from-the-pages-of-hamlet-101643148781712.html
26-01-2022||Delhi||Eight-year-old girl raped by two minor boys in Shastri Park||An eight-year-old girl was allegedly raped on Monday by two minor boys, aged 12 and 10, in northeast Delhi’s Shastri Park area, police said on Tuesday, and added that the two suspects have been apprehended.A senior officer said that the matter was reported to the police on Monday evening. He said during the initial inquiry it was found that the girl was playing near her house when the two boys who live in her neighbourhood, took her to a vacant house close by and raped her.Quoting the complaint given to the police by the girl’s mother, the officer said the girl went outside to play around 2pm and returned home around 4.30pm on Monday, and told her mother about pain in her abdominal area. When her mother asked further, she told her about the incident, the officer said.The mother went to the local police station, following which officials from Child Welfare Committee were roped in to counsel the victim.Subsequently, the girl was sent for a medical examination that confirmed sexual assault. A case under sections 363 (punishment for kidnapping) and 376 (AB) (punishment for rape by those under 12 years) of the Indian Penal Code and POCSO Act was registered at Shastri Park police station.The boys were apprehended on Tuesday from their houses in Shastri Park on the basis of the information given by the victim and her mother, the officer said.The girl’s mother also reported the matter to the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) on the helpline number 181 on Tuesday, following which the women’s body issued a notice to the Delhi Police on Tuesday and sought details of the FIR.DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal said on Tuesday said, “The eight-year-old girl has been brutally raped and is in unimaginable pain as she is battling for her life in ICU due to severe damage to her private parts. The people gang-raping an 8-year-old are not humans. The strongest punishment needs to be given to the guilty.”A second senior district police official said they were taking all actions under appropriate sections of the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/eightyearold-girl-raped-by-two-minor-boys-in-shastri-park-101643148426299.html

But we are still treading with caution. We urge people to wear masks and adhere to Covid appropriate behaviour,” said a senior Delhi government official.The city also added 31 Covid deaths on Tuesday.With Tuesday’s cases, Delhi’s cumulative Covid count reached 1,803,499, at a positivity rate of 5.22%.Currently, the city has 42,010 active Covid cases.Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant (internal medicine), Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, said, “Covid cases in Delhi seem to be declining and we are in the right track, but we need to be cautious... There needs to be a balance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-reports-just-over-6-000-covid-19-cases-positivity-rate-at-1055-101643147880923.html
26-01-2022||Delhi||Covid restrictions to go soon, govt mindful of impact on people: CM Kejriwal||Restrictions imposed in the Capital to contain the spread of the new wave of Covid-19 infections are likely to be lifted soon with the test positivity rate down to 10.5% and hospitalisation rates staying low, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday during his Republic Day speech at a flag-hoisting ceremony at the Delhi secretariat.Kejriwal’s remarks come at a time when multiple stakeholders, including traders, shopkeepers, schools and parents, have called for stringent curbs to be rolled back to restart business activity and get children back in classrooms. Delhi currently has weekend and night curfews, allows stand-alone shops to open on an odd-even basis, has shut all educational institutions, and allows 50% attendance in offices, among other restrictions.“Last week, a group of traders visited me and raised concerns about the Covid restrictions. I assured them that we will lift the curbs as soon as we can. We sent a few proposals to the LG (lieutenant governor) on it. He accepted a few and deferred the rest. I noticed that the people are showing resentment towards him. I want to tell them, our LG has imposed restrictions in his wise wisdom... We all gain no pleasure in imposing restrictions. I assure everyone, we are working together to find solutions. As soon as we can, we will lift these restrictions. We will work to ensure everyone’s lives come back on track,” Kejriwal said during his address.The Delhi government last week recommended to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), which is headed by LG Anil Baijal, that the weekend curfew be lifted, the odd-even rule for shops end, and 50% attendance be allowed in offices (which were shut until then). But last Friday, DDMA accepted only the last recommendation, and decided to wait on the other two. DDMA is now scheduled to meet on Thursday to consider lifting more restrictions.“We were forced to impose weekend curfews, night curfews and odd-even systems. All of this painfully impacts the economy. We understand how difficult it is, how it affects livelihood. But I will request everyone to have faith in us, and understand that we only impose the least of the restrictions we are bound to. We don’t want anyone to suffer. We don’t want to hurt the economy. But protecting lives is paramount,” Kejriwal said.He added that the decline in cases could be attributed to two major reasons: the Omicron variant which is driving the surge is relatively mild, and the vaccination programme run by the Delhi government on a war footing. “Vaccination significantly curbs the impact of the virus, and Delhi stands as a proof. We are now on track to vigorously administer the booster doses too,” the CM said, while underlining the contribution of doctors and front-line warriors in Covid managementDelhi added 6,028 new Covid cases, at a positivity rate of 10.55% on Tuesday. The city also added 31 deaths.Medical experts also support the lifting of curbs. “Since the test positivity rate has reduced to almost 10%, keeping the strict curbs like weekend and night curfew and restrictions on commercial activities will not help in decreasing cases. Omicron is known to be mild, so there is no point in keeping the curbs which affect the economy and livelihood,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-restrictions-to-go-soon-govt-mindful-of-impact-on-people-cm-kejriwal-101643147667942.html
26-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | 50% of those who succumbed since January 1 were unvaccinated||Around 50% of those who succumbed to the coronavirus since January 1 were unvaccinated, while 32% were partially vaccinated. Of the 61 deaths reported till January 23, as many as 31 persons were not vaccinated, and 20 were partially vaccinated, while the vaccination status of 10 victims is not yet known. The fatalities include 47 men and 14 women. Of the total victims, 44 hailed from urban areas of the city. Civil surgeon Dr SP Singh said, “Of the victims, 36 were above the age of 60, and most of them were suffering from co-morbidities.” A study carried out by the health department, following a rise in the mortality rate in the second week of January, has revealed that many urban men remain unvaccinated. “The report has indicated that vaccination has mitigated the risk of serious infection. Thus, we urge residents to get vaccinated and senior citizens with comorbidities should take a precautionary dose,” said Dr SP Singh.Earlier, Covid task force member Dr Bishav Mohan and Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) community medicine head Dr Clarence J Samuel said there were three reasons for the surge in cases. Firstly, apart from the new Omicron variant, the lethal Delta variant was also found to be active in the state. Secondly, a large section of the population was not fully vaccinated, and thirdly, the majority of those infected were suffering from comorbidities, which was also adding to the mortality rate.District sees 4 deaths, 492 new casesThe district reported four deaths and 492 fresh coronavirus cases on Tuesday.Among those who succumbed to the virus were a 56-year-old man and three 69-year-old men from Tibba Road, Kidwai Nagar, Manuke village and Shimlapuri areas of the district, respectively.There are at present 6,571 active Covid cases in the district, of which 6,327 are under home isolation, while 213 are admitted at private hospitals and 13 at government hospitals.Around 26 persons were on ventilator, of which 14 were Ludhiana residents, while 12 were from other districts or states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-50-of-those-who-succumbed-since-january-1-were-unvaccinated-101643147431436.html

The Akali leader, who was in the city, alleged that former minister Bikram Majithia had been implicated in a false drug case by the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government. “I will leave politics if a single shred of evidence is found against Majithia in the drug case,” he said. Asserting that all evidence against Chattopadhyay was in the public realm, Badal said it was surprising that the Congress government had not taken any action against him till now. “We have an audio tape of a DGP taking orders from a proclaimed offender. They are also heard talking about postings and transfers and the establishment of an illegal interrogation and detention centre,” he said, adding that the Congress was also dragging its feet in taking action against Sidhu Moosewala, a singer turned Congress leader, who is also a proclaimed offender. “Even LIP leader Simarjit Bains has not been arrested despite being booked in a rape case. In Majithia’s case, not only was false case registered against him, but Section 37 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act was included to ensure he could not secure pre-arrest bail. “Pre-arrest bail has been rejected on a technical ground, but we will approach the apex court,” he said. The SAD president said that if the SAD- BSP government was voted to power, a commission headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court would be established to probe all false cases registered during the tenure of the Congress government. Later, senior leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal said that Badal had been unanimously chosen as the chief ministerial candidate of the SAD-BSP alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/audio-tapes-leak-sukhbir-badal-demands-arrest-of-former-punjab-dgp-101643146591096.html

No clarity was brought forth at the time of hearing as to whether any action has been taken against him,” the bench said directing that matter be placed before the DGP who will look into the matter.The direction was passed after P Chidambaram, appearing for Punjab, had told the court that a statement of Janpal Singh was recorded in Majithia’s case on January 22, which indicates complicity of the SAD leader. Janpal had told in his statement that he interrogated Maninder Singh Aulakh in a May 2013 FIR registered in Banur and that Aulakh and Majithia remained associated from 2006 to 2010.

For years I’ve worked as a journalist and then worked in prisons, which is the extreme end of crime. From these places, I’ve tried to gain sensibility, and know what is to be conveyed and how. We are also learning new things while working on the podcast. And the challenge is to keep oneself at every place, think like a cop as well as an audience member.”In fact, it’s fun to see how Delhi Police personnel are learning the nuances of podcasting, shares Nanda, adding: “I’m happy to see that they have started understanding media. This I didn’t see happening earlier. This is a huge change. All praise to the team for adapting to the new technology. The way they have picked up the vocabulary, and developed a good sense of how TV is different from radio, is commendable. This has happened under the able leadership of the commissioner (Rakesh Asthana), who has a very deep understanding of the need for communication.” Available on the Delhi Police’s Twitter, Facebook and Instagram handles, the first episode of this podcast narrated the story of constable Than Singh, who is running a school, Than Singh ki Pathshala, for the slum children. Singh, whose happiness is unparalleled since his story became the first in line to be shared as an inspirational tale for the listeners, says: “Bahut achha laga... isse badhi koi cheez ho hi nai sakti mere liye. Podcast sunke mere sare seniors ka phone aya aur woh bole ki aur achha kaam karte raho. Aur jo main kaam kar raha hun, kayi districts mein aisa aur kaam shuru bhi hua hai. Bachhon ko toh bahut acha laga apne bare mein sunkar. Unki khushi ka koi thihana hi nahi raha!” Rakesh Asthana, Delhi Police commissioner says, “The relationship between the police and the citizens is one of constant engagement. When in need, people look up to us for support, help, lending our ears to their problems, stories. Likewise, we also look up to them for suggestions and guidance. Our podcast, Kissa Khaki Ka, takes our relationship to the next level where we share our stories with people with an open heart. It helps grow more mutual trust and bonding, thereby enabling better policing. The Capital’s police is new media savvy, even as we are available through traditional communications channels. We are ever ready to rise to the new age communication needs.”Talking about the thought process and the feedback received, Nanda adds, “The response is better than what I had expected. It is very, very good. The moment we put up the promo of the podcast, we started getting phone calls and mails. The best thing is that were are able to fulfil our purpose, which is to make people understand how cops are working 24X7, to bring a difference and help out at all fronts.”Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/khakitales-crime-stories-to-be-part-of-delhi-police-s-podcast-101643143172584.html

Addressing a press conference along with Amritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla in Amritsar, Randhawa said, “After securing bail earlier, Majithia mocked the Punjab Police. He did also not cooperate with the police officials investigating the case. This was one of the grounds behind dismissal of his anticipatory bail plea.” The high court has justified the Punjab government’s action of filing FIR against Majithia. “I would like to ask Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal if he will take back the apology he tendered to Majithia on the drug issue after the court order. Both Kejriwal and Bhagwant Mann had said that the case against Majithia was weak. Now, they should speak on this,” said the deputy CM who also distributed the copies of HC order to mediapersons. Aujla said tightening the noose around Majithia is a big achievement of the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bail-plea-rejection-vindicates-state-govt-s-action-against-bikram-majithia-punjab-deputy-cm-randhawa-101643142992439.html

Addressing a press conference here, the BJP leader claimed that whatever Kejriwal was projecting as his achievements in Delhi are core lies and the people of Punjab should not fall prey to his juggleries.“Kejriwal’s commitment to drugs and liquor has been exposed as Punjabi’s should know that he has cut the number of dry days from 21 to three. Shops selling alcohol have been opened in front of schools and religious places,” said Tiwari. Dubbing Kejriwal’s state government as “total failure”, he said the Jal Board in Delhi used to run in profit, but today it has a whopping deficit of ₹6,200 crore. He warned that Punjab should know that the health infrastructure in Delhi, touted by Kejriwal as “mohalla clinics”, is literally non-existent as even the Delhi high court in its judgment in May 2021 said the state government failed to provide basic services to Covid patients. “The clinics were recently responsible for the death of three children as they were administered a medicine which should not have been prescribed to children below four years. Unfortunately, molestation of patients has also surfaced at these clinics,” said the BJP leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dont-fall-prey-to-arvind-kejriwal-s-juggleries-manoj-tiwari-tells-people-of-punjab-101643142692119.html
26-01-2022||Chandigarh||Notice to ED, Punjab on Khaira’s plea to file nomination papers||Mohali: A Mohali court on Tuesday issued a notice to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the state of Punjab on an application filed by Congress leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira, 56, for allowing him to submit his nomination papers for the February 20 Punjab assembly polls before the returning officer. The next date of hearing has been fixed for January 27.Khaira, who is lodged in the Patiala jail in a money laundering case, has been declared the Congress candidate from the Bholath assembly seat in Kapurthala district. The Election commission has fixed February 1 as the last date for filing of nomination papers in Punjab.Last week, the ED filed a chargesheet against Khaira for allegedly laundering money in the 2017 Fazilka drug smuggling racket.Khaira was arrested by the central agency on November 11 for his links with drug smugglers and forgers making fake passports. At the time of the arrest, Khaira denied any wrongdoing and said he was being targeted by central agencies as he has been vocal against the Centre’s three new farm laws (since repealed).Khaira won the assembly election in 2017 from Bholath in Kapurthala district on an Aam Aadmi Party ticket. However, in January 2019, he quit the party and formed the Punjab Ekta Party (PEP), which he merged with the Congress in June 2021.Khaira came under ED’s scanner in January 2021 in two matters -- the first pertaining to a cross-border drugs smuggling network unearthed in Fazilka in 2015 in which 1.8 kg of heroin, 24 gold biscuits, two weapons, 26 live cartridges and two Pakistani SIM cards were seized by the Jalalabad police; and a fake passport racket being run in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/notice-to-ed-punjab-on-khaira-s-plea-to-file-nomination-papers-101643142690430.html
26-01-2022||Chandigarh||Drug case: Akali leader Bikram Majithia gets protection from arrest for 3 days, approaches SC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has granted three days protection from arrest to Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia to enable him to approach the Supreme Court for an anticipatory bail in a drug case registered the Punjab Police on December 20. The interim protection for 3 days from Monday was granted by the HC bench of Justice Lisa Gill the same day even as the bail plea was dismissed. The detailed order was released on Tuesday. Also, Majithia’s lawyers made a request for early hearing in the Supreme Court on Tuesday and got the listing date of plea for January 27, it is learnt. Majithia had moved the high court after he failed to get anticipatory bail plea from Mohali court on December 24. On January 10, the HC, giving him interim protection, asked the SAD leader to join the probe two days later. ‘Petitioner was at the helm of affairs’ The high court in its order observed that “complete and thorough investigation should not be a casualty in this political slugfest especially keeping in view grave and serious charges of drug trade”. The matter indeed calls for an in-depth investigation without being coloured by political overtones, it added. The court also observed that the allegations of “mala fides and political rivalry” are not considered to be substantial enough to consider his case for anticipatory bail. “It cannot be denied that the petitioner indeed was at the helm of affairs at the time of occurrence of alleged offence(s),” the bench said, adding that Majithia is not entitled to relief merely because no action was taken by the state government for these long years. It also took note of the fact that he was related to former deputy chief minister and former union minister. Majithia is the brother-in-law of SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal who was Punjab deputy chief minister till 2017. The drug racket case was unearthed in 2013 and allegations against Majithia had cropped up by 2014. The special task force (STF) report, which became the basis of the FIR, was submitted in 2018 in the high court. “The report in question was duly handed over to the state and therefore delay in the case has occurred due to tardiness of the state machinery. The allegations that entire official machinery has been roped in to register case against him are not substantiated. Such an averment indeed appears to be far-fetched in the given circumstances,” the bench said. An effort is now being made by the state to break the nexus between the state machinery and the drug traffickers and the courts find no ground to scuttle the same at this stage, it said. The court also took serious note of the state police’s allegations of non-cooperation by Majithia when he was quizzed after interim protection on January 10. The state has successfully made a case of custodial interrogation in the face of his conduct, the court said, referring to an instance where Majithia told the police that a photo album of his marriage has got misplaced. However, his counsel told the court that he was ready to produce in court or give it to an inspector general of police or a director general of police but not to the investigating officer. “This manner and conduct of the petitioner lends credence to the assertion of learned counsel of the state that the petitioner has not extended full cooperation to the investigating agency,” the court said. The bench observed that there was no embargo on the state government from proceeding to register FIR against Majithia even as STF report is lying in a sealed cover in the high court. On the allegations of “bias” against then STF head Harpreet Singh Sidhu, who had prepared the STF report, the court said he has clarified that the inquiry was conducted in an impartial manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/drug-case-akali-leader-bikram-majithia-gets-protection-from-arrest-for-3-days-approaches-sc-101643142570315.html
26-01-2022||Chandigarh||Conjoined Amritsar twins Sohna, Mohna to cast ballot as separate voters||Conjoined twins from Amritsar — Sohna and Mohna Singh — will cast their ballot for the first time on the polling day in Punjab on February 20 as separate voters. Born on June 13, 2002, the twins had turned 18 in 2020 and were handed over separate “EPIC voter cards” on Tuesday by state chief electoral officer (CEO) S Karuna Raju. Inmates of Pingalwara orphanage in Amritsar, the two were invited by the election officials to Chandigarh on the National Voters’ Day so as to motivate the voters in Punjab. “We will vote separately and independently and would not let each other know whom we are voting for,” said the two who were abandoned by their biological parents in a Delhi hospital after their birth. The twins have two hearts, two pairs of arms, kidneys, and spinal cords but a single liver, gall bladder, spleen and one pair of legs. “We have decided to vote for new thinking, a new Punjab,” they added over phone. They are employed as an electrical supervisor by the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL). CEO Raju said a special permission was taken from the Election Commission of India (ECI) to give them individual voting rights. Special arrangement will be made so that for Sohna and Mohna could vote separately so as to maintain privacy. The event was also attended virtually by deputy commissioners-cum-district election officers who handed over EPIC cards to first-time voters in the districts. Raju, who was accompanied by additional CEO DPS Kharbanda and other officials, said the EC’s theme this time was “making elections inclusive, accessible and participative”. Raju also unveiled the poster of ‘Know Your Candidate’ mobile application, using which voters can know the particulars and criminal antecedents of any candidate. He said the mobile app was developed to access criminal antecedents of contesting candidates to ensure transparent elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/conjoined-amritsar-twins-sohna-mohna-to-cast-ballot-as-separate-voters-101643142210297.html

26-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab rice millers allege corruption in grain quality testing system||The Punjab rice millers’ association on Tuesday demanded computerised quality testing of foodgrains, alleging corruption in the manual testing system. Accusing the Food Corporation of India (FCI) of harassing rice shellers, association president Tarsem Saini said they have decided to move the Punjab and Haryana High Court if the issue was not resolved by adopting computerised quality testing of grain. Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh, Saini said, “The quality assessment mechanism adopted by FCI for grain is flawed. For the past 4-5 years, we have been demanding computerised laboratories, but in vain. To sustain corruption in FCI, the authorities in the Punjab region are not ready to bring transparency.” “All testing is still done in manual laboratories, which give conflicting values. If the FCI management does not make its functioning transparent, our association will be constrained to move to the high court and stage protests,” he added. Union food, civil supplies and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal, he said, had promised to streamline the functioning of FCI but on-ground situation was contrary. Association office-bearer Gurdeep Singh Cheema aid last month some FCI officials from its Punjab region office visited Ropar depot and trucks carrying rice were returned on verbal orders. FCI general manager Arshdeep Singh Thind said the modernisation was in progress. “Computerised rice analysers have been set up at different places in the state for quality tests . For redressal of grievances there is a set procedure and anyone who has any problem can opt for it,” he added. He rejected allegations of FCI officials’ involvement in corrupt practices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-rice-millers-allege-corruption-in-grain-quality-testing-system-101643142031982.html

26-01-2022||Chandigarh||Panchkula: Widower of 26-year-old woman awarded ₹46-lakh compensation||The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Panchkula, has awarded a compensation of ₹46 lakh to a Zirakpur resident who lost his wife in a 2020 road accident.Sherry, 25, of Peer Muchalla, Zirakpur, had filed a claim petition against Satish Kumar of Kharak Mangoli, Old Panchkula, who was the driver and owner of the tractor-trailer that hit his wife’s scooter.The complaint, which was also filed against Oriental Insurance Company Limited, Panchkula, stated that his wife, Kangna, 26, was headed from IT Park, Panchkula, to Peer Muchalla, Zirakpur, on her scooter on February 17, 2020.As she reached near the dumping ground in Sector 23, Panchkula, a speeding tractor-trailer, moving on the wrong side, hit her scooter, leaving her injured. Kangna was rushed to Alchemist Hospital, Sector 21, Panchkula, but she could not survive the injuries.It was stated that Kangna was a young and well-qualified woman, working with a multi-national company. “Due to the accident, I have suffered a great loss, a loving wife and life partner,” the petitioner said.In the tribunal, Satish Kumar claimed that his vehicle was not involved in the accident, so the question of paying any compensation did not arise at all.“Present claim petition has been filed with malafide intention just to extract the compensation from the insurer of vehicle in question,” Kumar said, while praying for dismissal of the petition.The insurer, in a separate written statement, stated that Kumar was not holding a valid driving licence on the date of the alleged accident, and had thus violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.Considering the arguments, the tribunal in its order on January 12 awarded a compensation of ₹46.8 lakh to the claimant, to be paid jointly and severally by both the respondents, and interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of institution of the petition till realisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-widower-of-26-year-old-woman-awarded-46-lakh-compensation-101643141440046.html
26-01-2022||Delhi||R-Day merch: From mufflers to caps, warm options aplenty||Due to the reduced scale of celebrations amid the present Covid situation, and educational institutes still operating on a virtual mode, the sale of Republic Day themed accessories continues to be low. But ahead of the day, the weekend curfew and odd and even scheme seem to have further plummeted the sales, according to wholesale shopkeepers at Sadar Bazar. However, they say necessity is the mother of invention, and that has led to many shops in this market sell tricolour version of seasonal accessories, to boost their business. So from woollen caps to mufflers and jackets, a lot of variety has been added to the stock this year. “Har saal patle material ki topi aati thi, par iss saal humne thode garam kapdhe ki banwayi hai. Iss saal thand zyada hai aur humne tricolour mein thand ke hisaab se cheezein rakhi hain bechne ke liye, jaise ki earmuffs aur jackets, taaki business badhe. Inka dual function hota hai, log Republic Day par pehen sakte hain aur vaise bhi thand mein use kar sakte hain,” says Saurabh Gupta, from Anil Bhai Rakhi Wala in Sadar Bazar.The tricolour hat seems to be a hot selling item this year, alongside the tricolour mufflers, informs Hardik Arora from Muskaan Enterprises in Sadar Bazar. He adds: “Sabse zyada humare yahan caps aur mufflers bik rahe hain. Log topi bhi khareed rahe hain. Humne tricolour brooches bhi rakhe hain, jo diamond stones ke saath kafi stylish lag rahe hain.” To suit people’s needs in the Covid era, tricolour masks are also on offer, says Gaffar Bhai Jhandewale from Bharat Handloom Cloth House, adding, “Iss time pe toh sabse zyada mask bik rahe hain. Par haan, iss baar sardi ke matlab ka saaman bhi rakha hai humne jaise ki woollen muffler aur woollen topi. Yeh sab, decorative items se zyada bik raha hai.” And some sellers say that the overall sale is only marginally better. “Iss saal 10% bhi business nahi hua pichle saalon ke mukable. Odd-even ki wajah se logon ko samajh nai aa raha tha ki kab aayein khareedari karne, toh bahut se log aaye hi nahi. Aur kaafi log jo aye woh shop bandh dekh ke kahin aur chale gaye saaman khareedne,” adds Arora.Besides apparels, tricolour decorations were also sold, but in small quantity only. Vikram Singh from Vikram Enterprises, says, “Some of the varieties are new and came in this year only,” he says. But Delhiites seem to be happy stocking up these for smaller celebrations. Take for instance Yogesh Singh, a property dealer from Shahadra, who shares, “We organise a small programme for children, every Republic Day, and I usually get tricolour items for them from Sadar Bazar. This year too, I’ve bought tricolour masks and caps for the kids. These will keep them warm as well as add to their theme costumes.” Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rday-merch-from-mufflers-to-caps-warm-options-aplenty-101643141438801.html
26-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Cong names 23 nominees in 2nd list, replaces four sitting MLAs||Chandigarh : The Congress released its second list of 23 candidates for the February 20 elections in Punjab on Tuesday, replacing four of its sitting MLAs. The sitting legislators who have been replaced by the party are Amrik Singh Dhillon from Samrala, Nirmal Singh from Shutrana, Surjit Singh Dhiman from Amargarh and Satkar Kaur from Ferozepur Rural. In Amargarh, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s close aide Smit Singh has replaced Dhiman whose son Jaswinder Dhiman has been fielded from Sunam. Sidhu was pushing for Smit who has been working closely with him and coordinating with the media until recently. Ashu Bangar, the AAP candidate who switched to the Congress recently, has been given fielded from Ferozepur Rural. Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had promised to get the Congress ticket for Bangar who jumped the ship after levelling allegations against the AAP leadership. Darbara Singh has replaced Nirmal Singh in Shutrana, whereas Raj Gill has been fielded in place of four-time MLA Amrik Singh Dhillon from Samrala. The Congress had also dropped four sitting MLAs in its first list of 86 candidates released about 10 days ago. With Tuesday’s list, the party has named its nominees for 109 of the total 117 constituencies in the state. Among the seats for which the party is still to name its candidates are Jalalabad, Patiala Urban, Attari, Nawanshahr, Ludhiana South, Bhadaur and Barnala seats. Former CM Capt Amarinder Singh, who has launched his separate party, has announced to contest from Patiala Urban whereas SAD chief Sukhbir Badal is contesting from Jalalabad. Sekhri fielded from Batala Former MLA Ashwani Sekhri, a Hindu face, has been fielded from Batala, despite intense lobbying by cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa for his son. Bajwa initially wanted to shift from Fatehgarh Churian to Batala but then tried for his son, seeking relaxation in the “one family, one ticket” rule. Sitting MLA Joginder Pal has again got the ticket from Bhoa, despite stiff opposition from campaign committee chairman Sunil Jakhar. His candidature was being back by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. Ramanjeet Singh Sikki and Kuldeep Vaid have been repeated from Khadoor Sahib and Gill, respectively. Sitting MLA Davinder Ghubaya was also facing opposition but has again been fielded from Fazilka. Former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal’s son-in-law Vikram Bajwa has been fielded from Sahnewal. The party has fielded AAP defector MLA Jagtar Singh Jagga, who won from Raikot in 2017, from Jagraon. However, Baldev Singh, another first-time MLA, who also defected from the AAP, has been denied ticket from Jaitu. The ticket allocation has been delayed due to differences of opinion among the state leaders. The Congress central election commission headed by party president Sonia Gandhi, which met on Monday, was unable to arrive at consensus and asked a sub-committee comprising general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal, senior leader Ambika Soni and chairman of the secretary committee for Punjab Ajay Maken to hold discussions and finalise the tickets. 
26-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Salaries of computer teachers of govt schools delayed again||After previously having waited for up to six months to receive their salaries, computer instructors of government schools in Chandigarh are upset as they have once again not received payment for December. There are around 150 junior and senior computer instructors in the city’s government schools.The instructors work on contract basis and due to issues with the contractor, their salaries had been delayed for three months in 2020 and six months in 2021. In 2021, they had not received payment between April and November, which they finally got in December.The instructors said, “It is unfair how this problem only happens with us, while the process is smooth for the other teachers on contract and we have to suffer even amid the pandemic. Last time also, our contracts had expired and our salaries were stopped till a new one was drawn. The authorities must sort out these issues in advance.”The instructors also alleged that the files take too long to clear. They said that members of the UT Cadre Educational Employees Union had met officials of the finance department and asked them to clear the files when their salaries had been delayed for six months.UT director of school education Palika Arora said that the department is aware of the problems and will resolve them in the next few days.The teachers also alleged that they are still being called to work daily, even as teachers have been told to come on alternate days as per instructions issued by the UT education department. However, officials said that computer teachers are required to monitor classes being conducted online and provide assistance in case any difficulties arise. The roster for attendance is prepared as per the discretion of the principal of the particular school and they may call teachers as per requirement.Further, the principals and other school heads also have to be physically present in the school daily to ensure smooth conduct of online classes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-salaries-of-computer-teachers-of-govt-schools-delayed-again-101643141192184.html

Prayagraj will go to polls on February 27. Jagannath Yadav, resident of Mansoorpur village under Baharia development block who claims to be 113 years old, is one such voter. “Till date, there has not been a single election in which I have not voted”, he recalled. “Back then, we had the responsibility of choosing our government after independence. In those days, everyone used to be in election mood. People would gather in villages and hold political discussions. Everyone appeared excited,” Jagannath recalled. “At that time people preferred to cast their vote early. Now, our grandchildren help us in reaching polling booths but back then, we used to help elders in reaching polling booths,” he added. Badri Prasad Tiwari, who claims to be 102-year-old, is a resident of Mehdauri Colony, Teliyarganj. He claims he has voted in every election since 1957. “In those days, discussions used to take place houses and outside months before the elections. We used to bring letters of the contesting parties and read them at home. Voting used to take place till evening and then at the time of counting of votes.

26-01-2022||Chandigarh||Covid surge: PU depts, affiliated colleges allowed to evaluate answersheets online||Amid the recent surge in Covid cases, Panjab University (PU) has allowed its teaching departments and affiliated colleges to evaluate answer sheets online for the odd semester exams which started on Monday.However, the departments and colleges can use their discretion regarding the mode of evaluation as per their need. Previously, the answer sheets were only evaluated physically, but the varsity is now encouraging online evaluation as well. Last week, a communication was also issued to the heads of affiliated colleges, in which they were requested to send their preferred mode of evaluation to the varsity.They were told that the submission of answersheets through speed posts leads to long queues outside the post offices, which defeats the idea of discouraging gatherings at public places.“The only viable mode of submission of answersheets is online mode. Online mode of evaluation is encouraged, which is more efficient and environment friendly,” states the communication sent to colleges.Those opting for online evaluation can go for the need-based physical evaluation with prior intimation to the varsity. However, for reappear, private and USOL candidates, only online evaluation will be conducted this time.PU’s controller of examination Jagat Bhushan said, “We are encouraging evaluation through online mode, but it is not mandatory. If a college or department feels that the previous practice of physical evaluation is more efficient for them, they can go for that as well.”“Permitting departments to use their discretion regarding the mode of evaluation is a good step in the present situation,” said president of Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA), Mritunjay Kumar.15,400 students appear for examMeanwhile, around 15,400 undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) students appeared on the second day of the odd semester examination of PU on Tuesday, which is being held in online mode.

Now, the DC will hoist the flag instead of Razia Sultana on Wednesday.The official letter stated that Razia Sultana’s duty was fixed for hoisting the flag in Sangrur, but due to ill health, she will not be able to perform the ceremony. Besides, a reason was also given regarding cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu’s not hoisting the flag in Moga where the DC will hoist the flag. Sangrur BJP chief Randeep Singh Deol said, “We welcome the move because Mustafa tried to disturb the peace.

However, Razia is silent on the issue which shows she supports unjustified threats,” said Deol.On Saturday, the Malerkotla police booked Mohammad Mustafa, who is also principal strategic adviser to state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, for his alleged provocative speech, which went viral on social media.The case was registered under Section 125 of the Representation of the People Act (promoting enmity between classes in connection with election) and 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) of the Indian Penal Code at the City-1 police station, Malerkotla.
26-01-2022||Delhi||Avid birders indulge in virtual walks, series and runs to catch the action!||It might be terribly cold for the humans, but for migratory birds, this time of the year in India is a favourite. Though restricted in their movement, due to the increased Covid cases in the Capital, bird watchers are not letting their spirits get dampened. Recently, there was news of a Black Eagle being spotted in Delhi, after a span of three years. Also, there were reports of two vultures, Anya and Arys, having migrated to India from the breeding grounds in Uzbekistan. In an endeavour to get a glimpse of these birds during this migration season, the birders in Delhi-NCR are busy arranging virtual sessions, online mini series and individual walks for those interested. “We are starting our mini series as people are not comfortable to go out during this time. We are shooting at prime locations and then coming up with a mini series on identifying birds and understanding their surroundings,” says Abhishek Gulshan, founder of NINOX — Owl about Nature. A few birds that will be included in the series are the Bar-headed Goose and Gadwall, in the migratory birds category, as well as Knob-billed Duck and Black Francolin in the resident category. Gulshan adds, “These hour-long sessions will help identify birds and talk about their surroundings. We already have a lot of footage, and are also stepping out individually to shoot for the same. But yes, these will be subscription based sessions. As for the free content, we are presently in the process of upgrading our WordPress and blog, which will be our prime source of dissemination of such information.” Various social media platforms are another are also helping the bird watchers to ensure they receive all the important information. “People are sharing pictures, notes, their thoughts and ideas through our Facebook community groups. We have people posting pictures of birds from all over the country, and now there are close to 300-400 posts every day,” says Kanwar B Singh, founder, Indian Birds. He shares that contrary to the popular belief, though the outdoor movement is restricted due to the Covid situation, there is still much activity being recorded on social media. “People are digging through old notes and pictures and sharing these since they can’t go and really be out in the field. So the traffic has not decreased at all, and there is a lot of activity on various social media channels,” Singh adds. In fact, Vasant Vihar-based bird watcher Anita Mani says she is still going out, but not in a group, to get a glimpse of the birds that are usually visible around this time only. “We went out for birding a few days back, and there was no risk as it was just my son and me. Individuals are heading out as no one is organising walks, due to the Omicron fear. As a hobby, I feel it’s quite safe, as long as you don’t pursue it in a group. But yes, since we cannot go out on weekends due to the curfew, we have to take out time in the middle of the day, on weekdays, to step out for this,” says Mani, whose society WhatsApp group is another place where she is getting to see various species of birds that are being spotted of late. “There is plenty of activity in all the WhatsApp groups I’m on. Many are birding in different parts of the country, and uploading pictures for identification purposes. We also have a Nature group in our colony where people post what they spot,” she adds.Those bird watchers who are venturing out in smaller groups share how they are being careful to follow Covid compliant behaviour. “We generally used to do meet-ups every Sunday, and people would venture out in groups across Delhi-NCR. But we are not bringing people together right now because we need to act responsibly. Many enthusiasts do ask us which are the interesting birds and where they can see them, and actually turn up at those recommended spots. So we are ensuring that they get the right information,” adds Singh.Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/avid-birders-indulge-in-virtual-walks-series-and-runs-to-catch-the-action-101643140530807.html

Usually, the inspection committees visit the colleges in April and May, following which reports are submitted which are later taken up by the affiliation committee. However, reportedly no such committee has been formed during this session so far.

26-01-2022||Chandigarh||Covid: Chandigarh fully vaccinates 100% target adult population||Chandigarh on Tuesday achieved 100% target of vaccinating its adult population against Covid-19 with both doses.The Centre had set a target of 8.43 lakh adult people to be immunised in Chandigarh. As on Tuesday, 10,70,334 (127%) people, including migrants, have taken their first shot in the UT, while 8,43,011 (100%) have been fully vaccinated.In the last one week, on an average around 2,450 adults were inoculated with the first or second daily, and the number went up to 3,051 on Tuesday.The UT health department had achieved the 100% first dose vaccination target on August 15 last year, and planned to cover all adults with both doses by December 31, but the deadline was missed by a few weeks.However, the target achievement does not imply that every adult staying in Chandigarh has been jabbed. “The adults who got vaccinated in Chandigarh hospitals and vaccination centres include migrants as well. There are still some Chandigarh residents who are not fully vaccinated. In fact, it was learnt that some people who contracted the virus recently had not even taken the first dose,” said Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh. Dr Singh said the target could have been achieved much earlier if people had not skipped their second dose despite completing the mandatory gap. “Also, some of the eligible people were isolated while some were hesitant to come forward in rainy and cold weather. We will continue the vaccination drive with the same intensity to cover all,” she said.Meanwhile, UT adviser Dharam Pal congratulated all doctors, nurses and healthcare workers for achieving the target. He said the administration is well-equipped to handle the ongoing infection surge.Dept misses target to vaccinate kidsWhile achieving the target to fully vaccinate the adult population, Chandigarh is set to miss the target to jab the eligible children with the first dose. The health department had set January 26 as the deadline.According to the Centre, about 72,000 children, aged 15 to 18, are eligible to get vaccinated in Chandigarh. Since January 3, the UT health department has vaccinated only 50,748 (70%) of them.“We were expecting to meet the target, but not many children turned up at the vaccination camps set up in schools. We have stopped holding such camps,” said UT health secretary Yashpal Garg, adding that bad weather also slowed the vaccination pace.Also, when it comes to precautionary doses, not many people are coming forward. Since January 10, only 2,765 healthcare workers (10% of the target), 2,685 other frontline workers (12%), and 6,624 (42%) comorbid senior citizens have taken the booster jab.On Wednesday, vaccination centres at all health and wellness centres will remain shut owing to Republic Day holiday. Only GMSH-16, GMCH-32, PGIMER and civil hospitals will remain open for vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covidchandigarh-fully-vaccinates-100-target-adult-population-101643138856210.html
26-01-2022||Chandigarh||Consumer court: Insurer told to pay ₹11 lakh to Mohali man whose car fell into gorge||The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Mohali has directed an insurance company to pay ₹11 lakh compensation to a Mohali resident, whose insured car got damaged after falling into a 200-foot-deep ditch.The complainant, Parmeet Singh, had filed a case against United India Insurance Company Limited, Mohali, wherein he alleged that he was a subscriber of an insurance policy for his car. On September 27, 2016, he had gone to Mata Bhangani Haripurdhar in Sirmour, Himachal Pradesh, where due to the down slope, his parked car fell into the gorge.He stated that the insurance policy was valid till September 30, 2016. In October, a spot surveyor visited the spot, observed that the vehicle is damaged and prepared the report. He stated that even after he accepted the settlement of ₹10.5 lakh, the firm did not pay anything and instead started causing harassment.Before the commission, the insurance company alleged that as per the report of the technical expert, the complainant had himself got the vehicle damaged in totality. The vehicle was such that once it is parked on electronic handbrake mode, it could not fall into the gorge.The commission observed that since the company had agreed to pay the amount to the complainant and had even taken consent along with affidavits, and that too after verification of the facts, “we feel that it was not justified to withhold the amount from the complainant”.Considering it to be an “unfair trade practice”, the commission directed the company to pay ₹10.5 lakh along with an interest of 12% per annum from the date of accident besides ₹50,000 compensation to the complainant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/consumer-court-insurer-told-to-pay-11-lakh-to-mohali-man-whose-car-fell-into-gorge-101643138855005.html

26-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Plan to replace single-storey government houses with apartments||With an aim to expand housing capacity in Chandigarh, the UT administration is considering redensification of the existing government housing. The plan is to demolish old single-storey houses, and construct multi-storey apartments in their place.The proposal for redensification recently came up for discussion in a high-level meeting on the Chandigarh Master Plan-2031, chaired by UT adviser Dharam Pal. The adviser gave the go ahead to examine its different aspects. “The housing capacity is planned to be expanded by three times of the existing capacity,” said CB Ojha, chief engineer-cum-special secretary engineering.Around 600 government houses in Sectors 19, 20, 27, 28 and 30 are being examined for redensification. From plan to implementation, the project is likely to take at least five years for completion. There is a large stock of Government housing designed by the original team of architects in Phase 1 of the city. The architects had prepared standard designs which had been replicated in various pockets and sectors. Most of the government housing is single-storeyed or at the most double-storeyed. Most of these load-bearing brick structures are more than six decades old and in a poor state of neglect, while occupying prime land in the land starved city.“Single storey houses, particularly, which are in a bad shape are to be removed, and in their place, the proposal is to construct four-storey houses. Also, multi-storey houses will come up on vacant plots. This is to meet the increased housing demand. In these single-storey units, the total plot area is generally three times the actual construction. This will allow for proper utilisation of space,” said Ojha.Ojha said the redensification exercise will be conducted so as not to disturb the socio-economic structure of the city, but rather to rectify the imbalances and make the city inclusive. “Also, first a resettlement plan for residents will be made and then only replacement of existing units will be done,” he said.The survey of the houses has started, which will assess the condition of the dwellings. This will take another three months. Thereafter, a project plan will be prepared as to exactly how many houses need to be demolished for construction of new houses, project cost and exact timelines for the project. A plan for resettlement of current residents of these houses will also be prepared. They will be adjusted in the old vacant houses and the new government houses that are to come up on the vacant land that the administration has in different sectors. Suggestion made a decade ago tooNotably, an expert committee headed by the UT administrator, around a decade ago, had also suggested redensification in several sectors, including Sectors 10, 11, 15, 19, 20, 23 and 24. Also, a report submitted by the National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research (NITTTR) had told the administration that the repair cost of old government houses will go up in the coming years. Hence, it should consider reconstruction in a phased manner.“The basic principle of all planning which is inherent in the concept of Chandigarh also is to anticipate change so that designs that are accommodative of such change are developed regularly from time to time. Technological devices, new materials and space requirements are thus subsumed in the process of architectural design,” said a senior UT official, privy to the matter. These aspects will thus be taken care of while carrying out redensification of the proposed pockets.“It would also be essential to augment the infrastructure/services of these sectors prior to taking on the redensification exercise being proposed. The new built environment will be designed to be energy efficient, with zero discharge, adequate parking facilities and of an architectural character in sync with the Chandigarh style of architecture,” said the official cited above.

A person who breaches the sanctity of electoral process, attacks the basic structure of democracy and the sacrosanct constitutional rights of the citizens, Rana said.Offenders, who commit such offences, do not deserve leniency from the court of law. Exemplary punishment is warranted in such cases of attack on the democratic set up so that nobody repeats such an offence in future, the ASJ added.Quoting a recent Supreme Court ruling, the Nuh court judge said the essence of the electoral system should be to ensure freedom of the voters to exercise their free choice. Thus, any attempt of booth-capturing or bogus voting should be dealt with iron hands because it ultimately affects the rule of law and democracy. Nobody can be permitted to dilute the right to free and fair election, the court said.The ASJ, quoting the apex court, said booth capturing wholly negates the election process and subverts the democratic set up which is the basic feature of our Constitution.The court awarded rigorous imprisonment to the 10 accused after 14 witnesses, including 11 presiding and polling officers and cops, proved that the accused entered the polling booth 116, 117 and 118 on January 24, 2016 and criminally intimidated and manhandled government officers.They disrupted the election process, broke three electronic voting machines (EVMs), tore up ballot papers and official documents. They also assaulted a candidate contesting for the post of sarpanch, the court order said.“All the accused were identified by two eyewitnesses, including an injured eyewitness. Also, recovery of weapons used in offences was done along with the vehicle used in the office. The election was cancelled and fresh election was held on Jan 27, 2016,” the court said.“Thus, the prosecution has proved beyond any reasonable doubt, that the accused formed an unlawful assembly and obstructed the work of government officers in the gram panchayat elections of village Indri by use of force and deadly weapons and committed dacoity and caused grievous hurt to a candidate,” the court added.“Also, they destroyed EVMs and damaged public property. Accordingly, the accused Parveen, Monty alias Mobinder, Jaggi alias Jagdish, Gulshan, Billu alias Narender, Satish, Deepak, Sachin, Deepak and Anand are hereby convicted,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/10-persons-get-10-yr-ri-for-booth-capturing-disrupting-poll-process-in-nuh-village-101643138669734.html

26-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram: 10 people get 10-year rigorous imprisonment for poll violence in Nuh||A Nuh trial court awarded 10 years of rigorous imprisonment (RI) to ten people, who were accused of disrupting gram panchayat polls at village Indri in Nuh in 2016. The accused had assaulted election officers and cops, along with indulging in booth-capturing. While giving the sentence, additional sessions judge (ASJ), Nuh, Prashant Rana in his January 21 order said, “Any person who breaches the sanctity of the electoral process, attacks the basic structure of democracy and the sacrosanct constitutional rights of citizens are bound to be punished. Booth-capturing is an attack on the root of democracy and free and fair elections. Offenders who commit such crimes do not deserve leniency from the court of law. Exemplary punishment is warranted in such cases of attack on the democratic set up, so that nobody repeats such offence in the future”. The ASJ said the accused tore official documents and took away ballot papers and official stationery. They also caused grievous injuries to a sarpanch candidate and fractured his skull. People present at the booth could not cast their votes and elections were cancelled. Highlighting the sequence of incident, the court said that the convicts not only created an atmosphere of terror, but they also deprived the citizens of their constitutional right to vote. “The convicts not only damaged valuable public properties, but also obstructed the official work of poll officers, mostly schoolteachers, and manhandled them. They also assaulted cops for simply performing their official duty and were in possession of illegal arms”, the court added. Due to the incident, the election was cancelled, and fresh polls were held on January 27, 2016. The court argued that the convicts attacked the democratic set-up of the country. “The case is not of simple loot and dacoity, but much graver in essence, since the convicts committed booth-capturing. As many as five FIRs were registered against them on the same day for similar offences. They must be granted life imprisonment”, it said. The counsel for the accused had said that they were not repeat offenders and had no cases against them previously. “They were sole bread earners of their families, and a lenient view may be taken while granting the sentence. They may be granted probation or minimum sentence”, it said. The ASJ said the entire working of the state machinery, for gram panchayat was disrupted by the convicts. “Valuable time of many government officials and funds of the public exchequer were wasted on account of the offences committed by the convicts. The election process in a democracy is sacrosanct and nobody can be permitted to disturb the same, in any manner”, the court order said. The order further stated that the convicts created a state of anarchy. It also invoked 5th Century BC Greek playwright Sophocles, who had said, “There is no greater evil than anarchy”. The trial court also asked the convicts to pay appropriate compensation to the severely injured man who had to undergo treatment for many days in accordance with provisions of the Haryana Victim Compensation Scheme, 2013.

26-01-2022||Lucknow||Campaigning in Uttar Pradesh likely to gather speed from Feb 1||LUCKNOW: Campaigning in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh is likely to rev up from February 1 onwards, ahead of the first phase polling in 58 constituencies in 11 UP districts scheduled on February 10. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is likely to announce permission for public meetings with certain restrictions after January 31. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national president Mayawati has become the first to announce her party’s poll campaign launch from Agra through a public meeting on February 2. The campaigning had visibly changed after the election notification on January 8. All parties went off the streets no sooner than the model code of conduct (MCC) and Covid-19 safety protocols by the Election Commission of India (ECI) came into force, banning rallies, public meetings and road-shows, first till January 15 and then till January 31. When it came to resurfacing, the resource-rich, personality-rich Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hit the streets first from January 21 onwards with door-to-door campaigning by several top saffron party leaders. The top leaders of other parties that withdrew are now planning a re-launch of their campaigns. The star campaigners of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)--national and state leaders--have hit the streets in 11 western UP districts with none other than national president JP Nadda launching a door-to-door campaign from Agra and Bareilly on January 21. The next day Union home minister Amit Shah, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, union minister Anurag Thakur, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and a few others followed suit. Almost all the rival parties had raised a red flag to the ECI complaining about the BJP leaders’ campaigns, saying that they were in contravention of the MCC and Covid-19 protocols issued by the ECI. The Samajwadi Party (SP) star campaigners withdrew their campaigns after the January 14 event at the SP state headquarters in which the ex-BJP minister Swami Prasad Maurya and Dharam Singh Saini joined the party. The Lucknow police had filed an FIR and the ECI had issued a notice to the SP over the event. “Our national president Akhilesh Yadav Ji and the heads of all the allies were doing intensive campaigning. Akhilesh Ji’s Vijay Rath Yatra was so successful that it became a talking point all over. But the SP and ally leaders withdrew from the campaign scene following the ECI’s MCC and Covid guidelines. Also, in the meantime, Akhilesh Ji had been busy strategising in the war room. The campaign would resume as and when ECI allows”, said the SP national spokesperson Abdul Hafiz Gandhi. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said at a press conference last week: “I am waiting for the ECI. My rath yatra will resume, once permitted, even if it means me riding the rath alone”. Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) national spokesperson, Anupam Mishra said: “ RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary, tentatively, is launching his election campaign from Muzaffarangar on January 27. The party will release the programme once finalised”. The Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) national spokesperson Piyush Mishra said: “Our president Omprakash Rajbhar ji was intensively busy in campaigning solo and also with the alliance chief Akhilesh ji, but withdrew post-notification. Now, he will be back in action leading the party’s ‘Ghera dalo, dera dalo; gaon chalo abhiyaan’--a village to village campaign programme.” Om Prakash Rajbhar, Mahan Dal chief Keshav Dev Maurya, Apna Dal (Krishna Patel) chief Krishna Patel and ex-BJP minister and now SP leader Swami Prasad Maurya, who had been doing the SP’s virtual rallies, will soon hit the roads again. The Congress, however, is asking the political parties and ECI to exercise caution. Congress spokesperson Anshu Awasthi said: “If actual campaigning is allowed once again, then once again our leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra ji and other star campaigners (the list is already out will hit the roads. Priyanka ji had campaigned statewide as no single leader did. But the Congress would make an appeal to the ECI to exercise caution. Covid is very much there and rising.” UP is going to polls for its 403 assembly seats from February 10 in seven phases with March 10 as the result date.
26-01-2022||Gurugram||Manesar to get its first 2 public libraries by end of this year, says civic body||The municipal corporation of Manesar (MCM) will develop two public libraries in the city on a trial basis “by the end of this year”, said officials of the civic body on Tuesday.At present, Manesar does not have a single public library and the closest such facility is located nearly 20 kilometres away from the city, in the Civil Lines area of Gurugram. Munish Sharma, commissioner of MCM, has directed the engineering wing of the civic body to build two basic public libraries -- on a trial basis -- at community centres in the city. MCM’s superintending engineer Vijay Dhaka, who is also overseeing the project, said that libraries in Manesar will be similar to those in Gurugram, where majority of users are students preparing for competitive examinations. “We will develop two basic public libraries -- one each in the Badshahpur and Pataudi constituencies. The libraries will be constructed at community centres, and a survey at each of the constituencies for the same is underway. We want to build the facilities at a centrally located area in the constituency,” said Dhaka.Dhaka also said that the MCM will simultaneously start the process of hiring an agency, which has prior experience of both constructing and maintaining public libraries in other cities. “The two public libraries will have basic infrastructure, with nearly 8,000 books and as many e-books on competitive exams, CBSE prescribed syllabus, history, civics, geography, general knowledge, besides fiction and non-fiction literature... The MCM commissioner has directed that if the two libraries are going to be in high demand, we will have to build a larger full-fledged library in each of the civic body’s seven zones, in addition to these two basic libraries,” said Dhaka, adding that the civic body is aiming to construct the libraries by the end of this year. The MCM officials privy to the matter said that constructing and adding facilities in each library will cost around ₹30 lakh.Besides the district public library in Gurugram’s Civil Lines, there are three libraries at the community centres of DLF Phases 1, 2 and 3, under the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). It is also developing one more library in Sector 39. “These libraries will provide a venue to a large number of students in the area to study and prepare for exams together. They could discuss and resolve queries jointly. In addition to the prescribed books, it will also provide the people with books, which can help them in learning about different cultures, history, and information among others,” said Lalit Yadav, a resident of Sector 83.

26-01-2022||Delhi||Gang targets people in Delhi buses; one arrested||A 31-year-old man, who robbed people at knifepoint in crowded RTV buses, has been caught in Dwarka. Police said he worked with five accomplices, who are yet to be caught. Police said that around 9.30am on January 21, they received information about an armed robbery that took place on an RTV bus in Dabri by at least five men. The complainant called the police from Dwarka around 3pm. Dabri police registered an FIR and formed a team to crack the case. The police team analysed footage from over 100 CCTV cameras in which 4-5 men were seen deboarding the RTV bus and fleeing the spot in two e-rickshaws. The team questioned the drivers of over 100 e-rickshaws and identified one of the suspects as Mohommad Kasim. The team then surveilled the suspect and conducted several raids.On Monday, the police arrested Kasim (31) from the Jeewan Park area in Dabri. Shankar Choudhary, DCP (Dwarka), said during interrogation, Kasim revealed that he met his associates During Sonu, Honey, Akash, Yeda, and Kake in 2013. By 2016, Kasim had become a history-sheeter at the Bindapur police station.“He and Sonu, Honey, Akash, Yeda, and Kake then started robbing people in RTV buses in Uttam Nagar on the Dabri to Dwarka route,” said the DCP. In 2021, he was caught with a sharp-edged weapon in Janakpuri and was bailed out on December 25 last year. On January 21, the men boarded an RTV bus and noticed one passenger with a laptop bag. They approached him and assaulted him at knifepoint. Kasim snatched his laptop bag, which contained his mobile phone and some cash, after which the men quickly deboarded the bus at Sitapuri red light and fled, police said.Police said that they are searching for the other suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gang-targets-people-in-delhi-buses-one-arrested-101643137349213.html
26-01-2022||Lucknow||Cong team in Unnao for filing nomination of its candidate||Lucknow: A Congress team, including a woman leader, reached Unnao from Madhya Pradesh last week and begun camping there to assist Asha Singh, mother of Unnao rape victim and Congress candidate for Unnao assembly seat. To note, Asha Singh is the mother of the 17-year-old girl who was gang raped in Unnao on June 4, 2017. Former BJP member Kuldeep Singh Sengar was convicted for the rape in 2019 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) has set up a new party organisation structure in Unnao following the Congress’ statewide revamp, but the special team comprising Mahendra Singh (Bhopal) and Sonia Shukla (Indore) is responsible for preparations for filing Asha Singh’s nomination papers and also assist the candidate in strategic campaigning for the 2022 assembly polls. “As of now, work on collection of all the documents, including no objection certificates (NOCs) etc. needed for filing nomination papers is in progress. The filing of nomination papers will begin in Unnao constituency on January 27. So, we propose to file her nomination papers in the next few days. We will soon workout a final date for filing of her nomination papers,” said Sonia Shukla. On whether or not the Congress was facing any problems/hindrances in Unnao, Shukla claimed though things had improved to some extent now, a sense of some fear prevailed earlier when she reached Unnao. “A sense of fear persisted when I came here (Unnao). I faced threats as people called, asking me to go back. About two to three people came at a meeting and said bullet proof jackets will be needed for campaigning (in Unnao constituency). Things are getting better now,” she said. “Unnao is my ‘myka’ (parental place) and so I am known to the people in the area. I have been meeting people and any such threats will not matter,” she added. Asha Singh could not be reached for comments on the issue. Shukla, however, said family members of Asha Singh had urged all the political parties to support the Congress’ Unnao candidate. “Giving threat to candidates, if any, is not good practice and should be reported to the Election Commission of India. Any individual or political party is free to field any candidate. The ECI should take appropriate action to ensure free and fair elections,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department, political science, Lucknow University. Madhya Pradesh leader Mahendra Singh, who has contested elections against MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, said he had heard about the threats. “Whatever has happened is past. I am here (in Unnao) now and there should be no problem. Congress has declared tickets for three out of six assembly seats of Unnao and hope candidates for remaining three seats too will be announced soon. We are getting ready for filing of nomination papers on all the seats, though Unnao is going to be in focus,” said Singh. Unnao District Congress Committee (DCC) acting president Yusuf Faruq Khurram said Congress’ team of Unnao was getting ready for campaigning. He said DCC president Arti Bajpai was also contesting the 2022 assembly polls and so he had been given charge as acting party chief. “Nomination papers of Asha Singh will be filed once all the documents are collected,” said Khurram Asha Singh’s name figured on the Congress’ first list of 125 candidates declared on January 13, 2022. The Congress’ first list having 40 women candidates included Asha worker Poonam Pandey (Shahjahanpur), who was badly beaten up by the police and Lakhimpur Kheri’s Ritu Singh (from Mohammadi) who was disrobed in the recently concluded panchayat elections in Lakhimpur Kheri. Priyanka Gandhia Vadra had called the list “historic initiative” for implementing the party’s announcement of giving 40 percent tickets to women. She had said, “Efforts have been made to field candidates who have been struggling and fighting for a cause and who can work to bring about a new way of politics. We will give them power to fight for their cause.” 
26-01-2022||Gurugram||Forest department fines HSVP officials for cutting trees in Gurugram Sector 29||The forest department has fined a junior engineer and an executive engineer of the enforcement wing of Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) for cutting and uprooting more than 20 trees in Sector 29 last week, without taking permission from the department, said officials on Tuesday.The cutting and uprooting of trees were part of the anti-encroachment drive being conducted in Gurugram for the past one week.According to the officials, they will also issue a notice to the two officials on Thursday, and the penalty amount will be decided based on their reply. Karamvir Malik, forest range officer of Gurugram, said they conducted a survey of the area on Tuesday, and found that more than 20 trees in Sector 29 were cut and uprooted without taking their permission or informing them later. “We visited the area and conducted a survey there after receiving pictures and videos of some HSVP officials using cranes to uproot the trees in the area. Some local shop owners are also responsible as they were present there when the incident took place, and they did not stop the officials from uprooting the trees. No one can uproot old trees, this is illegal. And being officials of a government agency, they cannot indulge in any such illegal activities,” Malik said. He also said that if a person plants a tree in an area in violation of rules, the HSVP cannot uproot the tree if it is 10 years old. The HSVP uprooted more than 20 trees in the last one week in Sector 29, said the officials, adding that they uprooted the trees in a drive against encroachment, as outlet owners in the area had planted those to encroach the area.We will continue to remove encroachments from the area this week too, said the HSVP officials. More than 100 trees were planted in the main complex of Sector 29 and in the backside, which connects to the main road towards Huda Metro station and National Highway 8. The complex and backyard, which was earlier covered in greenery, now is a deserted area. The HSVP also removed planters, generators and transformers kept in open during the drive, said the officials. According to the HSVP officials, they conducted the drive after they received complaints regarding encroachment in the area on a daily basis. “The outlets have placed generators, transformers and planters in open, leading to encroachment of the common area. That is why we had to take the action,” said a senior official of the HSVP, requesting anonymity. He also said that similar anti-encroachment drives are being conducted in different parts of Gurugram. Meanwhile, the pub, bar and restaurant association of Sector 29, alleged that despite their repeated requests, the HSVP officials uprooted the trees, which were more than 10 years old.Rahul Solanki, manager of a restaurant in Sector 29 , said that the trees were planted by the staff of the outlets in the area in 2000 and 2001, and they have been taking care of the trees since then. “The area was not being encroached by the trees; it was just an excuse given by the officials. We are trying hard to maintain the complex, but the place is losing its charm due to the ongoing anti-encroachment drive,” Solanki said. The staff of restaurants in Sector 29 said it took them more than eight years to develop the greenery in the area, but the HSVP officials took minutes to destroy it. We had developed a green corridor here, and placed more than 300 planters and 100 trees to attract customers, according to the staff. Restaurant owners said they have not been encroaching the area or the roads. “We had planted trees and placed planters to beautify the area so that we could attract more customers. We have not violated the rules,” said Arvind Kumar, a manager of a restaurant in Sector 29. Sandeep Lot, the junior engineer in question, said that they did not uproot or cut trees in Sector 29. The HSVP officials only removed encroachments in the area, and asked the shop and restaurant owners to move planters within their premises. “We are aware that cutting trees is an offence... Why would we do that? We have only removed illegal structures in Sector 29,” Lot said.
26-01-2022||Delhi||Work on signal-free stretch between Delhi's GT Road, NH-24 to begin in March||Work will begin this March to make the stretch between Dilshad Garden border on GT Road and Ghazipur roundabout on NH-24 signal free, a senior government official said on Friday. The project involves the construction of a six-lane 2.2km flyover between the existing Anand Vihar railway overbridge and Vivek Vihar intersection on the southern side to ease congestion.The senior official said the 60m wide corridor is located on Road Number 56 in east Delhi, which has the three busy intersections of Vivek Vihar, Raghunath Mandir and Ramprastha. Shahdara MLA and speaker of the Delhi assembly Ram Niwas Goel said the finance department has granted approval for the project and the layout has already been cleared by Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure Centre (UTTIPEC) and Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC).“We are planning to lay the foundation stone and initiate the construction work in March, before the election notification (for municipal polls) is issued,” Goel said. He added that a meeting has been called next week to review the project.Besides easing traffic flow on the busy stretch -- non-destined traffic will be able to bypass the three key intersections -- the project will also benefit residents of Anand Vihar, Ramprastha Colony, Vivek Vihar, Surajmal Vihar, Yojana Vihar and Srestha Vihar, who currently waste a considerable amount of time in traffic jams.A study commissioned by the public works department (PWD) has revealed that 70% of traffic on this 5.5km stretch is ”non-destined” -- vehicles are just passing through the area -- while 30% traffic is local. A green belt runs along the eastern side of the corridor while the Ghazipur drain runs along the western side.“Residents of colonies in the area access their complexes through the three intersections of Ramprastha, Raghunath Mandir and Vivek Vihar and all three points see heavy traffic movement and congestion throughout the day. The PWD study found that further adding to the congestion are heavy commercial vehicles, from an industrial area in the vicinity. Approximately 70% thorough traffic gets stuck at the three intersections and slows down vehicular movement on the whole stretch,” a government official associated with the project said, asking not to be named.The official said the project is estimated to cost ₹360 crore, and will provide a six-lane elevated alternative to motorists by extending the Anand Vihar railway overbridge over the three intersections. Thus, local traffic will be on the surface, or at-grade, level while non-destined traffic will go over the flyover.The PWD also plans to provide two ramps, before Ramprashtha and Vivek Vihar intersections, to facilitate local traffic, the official quoted above said.“The corridor improvement project will also include non-motorised transport (NMT) lanes and wider footpaths on the at-grade level. Other pedestrian facilities such as resting benches, tactile pavers, and modified footpath slopes to make them wheelchair friendly have also been added to the plan. Bollards will be used to block entry of vehicles on to the footpaths and NMT lanes,” the official said.The plan approved by UTTIPEC also has provision of multi-utility zones at regular intervals which will house signboards, light poles, street furniture, cycle bays and other public utilities. “The greening of the area, beautification of the space under the flyover by the creation of parks, drip irrigation for vertical greening of railings and piers of the flyover and the median, are also part of the project,” the plan stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/work-on-making-stretch-between-gt-road-and-nh-24-in-delhi-signal-free-to-begin-in-march-101643137109435.html

A large number of buildings, for which building plans were approved, have also been constructed against the building by laws. It seems like the Commissioner is also protecting the illegal constructions by not acting on the report,” Arora alleged. “The local bodies department has been notifying one time settlement policies in the past to regularise the illegal buildings instead of taking action. This is a nexus and we have demanded that the Governor should direct the chief secretary to get an independent inquiry done in the case and criminal proceedings should be initiated against the concerned officials,” he added. The reportThe additional commissioner Rishipal Singh’s report suggests that a total of 76,770 power connections were issued by the PSPCL in the areas falling under MC’s jurisdiction during the period from 2016-2020, out of which the civic body only approved building plans for 7,467 buildings. The report added that challans were issued against 11,441 buildings, while no action was taken against the remaining 57,862 buildings.A section of the councillors and MC officials alleged instances wherein new power connections issued for pre-existing buildings were added to the list of illegal buildings, questioning the report’s merit. They further said several building owners had a sub-meter installed in the same building and that labour quarters with separate power connections in a single building.Notably, in June 2021, Bharatiya Janata Party leaders led by state vice-president Parveen Bansal had also objected to thousands of “absurd” notices issued by the civic body for illegal constructions, following which the MC later stopped issuing notices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/illegal-constructions-in-ludhiana-council-of-engineers-writes-to-punjab-governor-seeking-independent-inquiry-101643136815638.html
26-01-2022||Other||Maharashtra allows physical classes in colleges and universities from February 1||Mumbai: Fully vaccinated students will be allowed to attend offline classes as the Maharashtra government on Tuesday allowed colleges and universities to resume physical classes starting February 1 as surge in Covid-19 cases seems to be limited to only a handful of cities and districts across the state. The higher and technical education department issued an order to reopen degree colleges and universities across the state, however local administrations will take the final call based on the Covid-19 situation in their respective city or districts and in consultation with university or college administrations.“All the universities including deemed, self-financed and private universities, affiliated colleges and other educational institutions have been allowed to resume offline classes from February 1. The local administration i.e. municipal commissioner, district collector and others have been allowed to take appropriate decisions considering Covid-19 situation in their jurisdictions and issue standard operating procedure (SOP) accordingly,” the order read.On January 7, the government decided to stop physical classes in colleges and universities and return to the online study mode till February 15 in the wake of a massive spike in Covid-19 cases driven largely by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. On January 3, the state began to inoculate 15 to 18 year olds as part of the national vaccination programme. Already 50.93% of teenagers in this category have received the jab in the state.“Students who are yet to take both the doses won’t be allowed to attend physical classes. They will have to continue with online studies,” the order added.All examinations scheduled till February 15 will also be online except in three universities — Gondwana, Jalgaon and Nanded — where power supply is an issue. “The colleges and universities should also decide about physical attendance by teaching and non-teaching staff. They should also hold special campaigns with the help of local administration for students who are not fully vaccinated and ensure their teaching and non-teaching are also fully vaccinated,” the order read.Last week, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray gave his nod to the resumption of physical classes for all standards starting Monday, after the school education department stopped physical attendance in the first week of January owing to the third wave. “Parents as well as students seem more open to the idea of physical classes now, compared to last year. We will not force any student to attend physical classes, neither will we stop anyone from attending classes,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal, KC College Churchgate.Last year, colleges were allowed to reopen for physical classes for undergraduate and postgraduate students starting October 20. Most colleges had decided to reopen post Diwali vacation in mid-November and while attendance was scarce in the beginning, slowly student numbers started increasing.“It is becoming difficult to keep the unvaccinated students from attending lectures now, and while the government has insisted on it, we are not. Students are allowed to attend lectures and social distancing as well as mask and sanitiser rules will remain the same,” said the principal of a south Mumbai college who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-allows-physical-classes-in-colleges-and-universities-from-february-1-101643136814336.html

The authority said that action was taken after a survey conducted in the last fortnight revealed several violations. HSVP officials said that sealing and anti-encroachment drives will continue in the next few weeks in Sector 29. It also stated that in several instances it was observed that rooftops and basements were converted into bars and restaurants by trespassing laws. HSVP junior engineer Sandeep Lot said that a survey was conducted in Sector 29 and a detailed report was prepared that highlighted the violations. “On the basis of the report, action was initiated against the violators. On Monday, three premises were sealed, and the drive will continue till all the buildings are restored,” he said. According to the survey, there was large-scale encroachment of public pavements and corridors, which were being used to create spaces for servicing customers. “Basements and rooftops were being used for commercial operations against set guidelines rules. Some of the sites allotted to owners for running ethnic food sites were converted into departmental stores, cloth showrooms and even a car showroom was being operated in the market”, the survey revealed. “We also observed that plants were being grown to occupy common areas. Also, generators were placed without permission from the authority. We have asked the owners to make the necessary changes, or we will be forced to take further action,” said Lot. HSVP officials further said that notices were issued to 18 proprietors for violations and encroachment. “The property owners who stick to rules will not face any action but those violating norms will not be spared. We have to understand that large crowds gather at these bars and pubs and open spaces are important for safety in case of an emergency,” said another HSVP official, seeking anonymity. Following complaints of violations on the CM Window, the HSVP had disconnected water and sewage connections of five buildings last week. It may be recalled that the last anti-encroachment drive in Sector 29 was carried out in August 2019, on the complaint of a Sainikhera resident on the CM Window. The complainant had alleged that due to widespread encroachment in the market, residents faced trouble while commuting to the adjacent Leisure Valley market. Following the complaint, HSVP had demolished 35 illegal vends. 
26-01-2022||Delhi||Consider giving ex-gratia to all doctors who died in line of duty: Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Tuesday asked the Delhi government to consider compensating the kin of all doctors, including private ones, who lost their lives in the line of duty during the second wave of Covid-19, saying that any distinction is “not justified”.Remarking that a “doctor is a doctor”, a bench comprising justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, said the Delhi government needs to re-look its present policy where only the kin of those doctors who worked at government hospitals and government-requisitioned hospitals are given a compensation of ₹1 crore.The government counsel assured the court that the authorities would look into the scheme and file an affidavit in this regard.The court was hearing a plea by a doctor’s widow, whose house is about to be taken away by the bank because she is unable to repay the home loan. Her husband Harish Kumar died in June 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic. He was working at the New Life Hospital in GTB Nagar and was on Covid duty, the plea filed by his widow said.During the proceedings, when the court sought to know if the petitioner applied for and received the ex-gratia amount promised by the Delhi government to all frontline workers/doctors who died of Covid while in service, the woman said though she did apply, she did not receive the money.The counsel for the government told the court that she was not given the money because the government’s policy only extended to the kin of those doctors who worked at government hospitals or hospitals requisitioned by the government.“The late husband of the petitioner was running a nursing home with less than 50 beds and such nursing homes were not requisitioned by the GNCTD. Though the petitioner’s husband died in the line of duty while serving Covid patients during the first wave, this case is presently not covered by the Cabinet decision,” Gautam Narayan, the additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, told the court.Taking note of this, the bench said that prima facie, the distinction of the Delhi government in awarding the ex-gratia is “not justified” because doctors and paramedic staff working in private hospitals requisitioned by the Delhi government are also covered by the Cabinet decision.“It is not that the hospital of the petitioner’s husband was not rendering services to the patients. It was the smaller hospitals…the amount of load that they were taking would together far exceed the load that the government hospitals were handling…So, therefore, is it justified for you to draw this distinction?” the court questioned the government counsel, adding that the decision needs a “re-look”.“A doctor is a doctor. There should be a rationale…Whether he is working in a private or government hospital...” the court added.The court said that just because some nursing homes may not have been requisitioned on account of their capacity, does not take away from the fact that the doctors and paramedic staff working at such nursing homes were also exposing themselves to the risk of contracting Covid and suffering death on that account.“It is a well-known fact that at the peak of pandemic during first and second waves, the small nursing homes were also providing treatment against Covid-19 to thousands of residents of Delhi; and if their numbers are put together, they may well exceed the number of beds available in government hospitals and hospitals which were requisitioned by the government for treatment of Covid-19,” the court noted in its order.The Delhi government counsel said that the decision was taken in July 2021, considering the then financial position, and the authorities would surely revisit the scheme.He also said that he will file an affidavit, not only placing on record the Cabinet decision, but also the reconsideration of the petitioner’s husband’s case for grant of ex-gratia.The court said the affidavit should be filed within four weeks and listed the matter for hearing next on March 11.
26-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC officials accused of illegal gratification, vigilance department seeks action||Acting on a complaint received against four municipal corporation (MC) officials for allegedly accepting illegal gratification from contractors in lieu of allowing sub standard road construction works in the city, state vigilance department has asked the principal secretary of local bodies department to take required action on the complaint.The complaint has been submitted against two superintending engineers (SE) Rahul Gagneja (Zone D) and Parveen Singla (Zone B) and two executive engineers Ramal Kaushal (Zone D) and Surinder Singh (Zone A) deputed in bridges and roads (B and R) department of MC. The officials have also been accused of making huge ‘Benami’ properties on the name of their family members and relatives and have also failed to submit their annual property returns with the concerned authorities for the year 2016 to 2019.Recently, the MC has received number of complaints regarding the poor-quality works being taken up ahead of assembly elections. The residents alleged that the hot mix material started wearing off within days or weeks after recarpeting of roads. The complaints have been received from Kitchlu Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Old GT road, Model Town-Jawaddi road, Dugri, Pakhowal road, among other areas. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said the department can conduct inquiry into the allegations and even he had earlier written to the local bodies department to get the newly constructed roads checked by deputing a third party. “We are already monitoring the development work and if any anomalies are found, the contractor is directed to reconstruct the road portion or the payment to the contractor is stopped. I also conducted a meeting with the officials on Tuesday and they have been directed to keep regular check on quality of work,” said Sabharwal. The complaint was submitted with chief secretary (CS) and vigilance department by an RTI activist in August last year. After the authorities failed to act against the officials, a third reminder was sent to CS office and vigilance department on December 31. Now, the vigilance department has written to principal secretary of local bodies department to take required action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-officials-accused-of-illegal-gratification-vigilance-department-seeks-action-101643136749007.html
26-01-2022||Delhi||23 Delhi cops to get medals on Republic Day||Twenty-three Delhi Police personnel are among the 939 officers from across the country who will be awarded medals on the occasion of Republic Day this year. Among them is IPS officer Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, currently serving as deputy commissioner of police in the anti-terror squad of Delhi Police’s special cell, who is receiving his 11th award and second back-to-back police medal for gallantry -- a rare feat by an officer.On Tuesday, DCP Yadav expressed his gratitude for the award on Twitter: “With the blessings of Balaji, I am happy to share that I have been awarded my 11th President’s Gallantry Medal on the occasion of Republic Day 2022...”Apart from Yadav, two other officers of his team, namely assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Jasbir Singh, a 2011 DANIPS (Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands Police Service) officer, and Inspector Ravi Tushir, have also been conferred the same Police Medal for Gallantry (PMG) for displaying bravery during a shootout in Delhi that led to the arrest of two suspected members of Babbar Khalsa International, a banned terrorist organisation, in September last year. The arrested BKI members, Bhupender alias Dilawar Singh, and Kulwant Singh, had allegedly come to Delhi to collect arms and ammunition needed to carry out assassination of some politicians in Punjab. ACP Singh joined Chandigarh Police two months ago.On the occasion of Republic Day 2021, Yadav had received the Police Medal for Gallantry in connection with a shootout between special cell sleuths and members of the infamous “Kranti gang” in Mehrauli in 2018. Four members of the gang including its kingpin, Rajesh Bharti, were killed while six police personnel were also injured.Of the remaining Delhi Police personnel selected for the awards, three will receive the President’s Police Medal (PPM) for distinguished service, and the remaining 17 personnel will get Police Medal (PM) for meritorious service.Yadav, who has mostly been posted with the anti-terror unit of the special cell, has carried out several anti-terror operations in Delhi and even in Jammu and Kashmir during his tenure as ACP and DCP since 2005. He was also part of the team that probed Delhi serial blasts of 2005 and 2008, apart from other terror strikes that the city witnessed till 2011.Yadav also headed the investigating team that solved the 2008 Delhi serial blasts after arresting Indian Mujahideen (IM) terrorists following an encounter at a flat in Batla House near Jamia Nagar on September 19, six days after the series of blasts rocked the city, claimed at least 25 lives and leaving 135 injured.

26-01-2022||Noida||Indirapuram: Voters point to lack of Metro connectivity, Ganga water supply||Having paid through their noses for a luxurious lifestyle in the opulent hub of high-rises, residents of Indirapuram now find themselves running pillar to post for basic amenities -- a government health-care facility, public transport options, Metro connectivity, and Ganga water supply, to name a few. Little wonder then that these assembly elections, they are pinning their hopes, and votes, on the candidate that will prioritise their needs.With over 65 high-rise residential societies, Indirapuram has 1.70 lakh (170,000) registered voters under the Sahibabad assembly constituency -- one of five assembly segments in Ghaziabad district and the largest one in the state of Uttar Pradesh. According to residents, some of their key demands are traffic management, public transport, government healthcare, and proper water supply and sewage system.The Sahibabad constituency is currently represented by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Sunil Kumar Sharma, who defeated Congress’s Amarpal Sharma by a margin of 150,685 votes in the 2017 elections. This year,too, the BJP is banking on Sunil Kumar for a win from the assembly segment, while Amarpal Sharma is contesting against him on the Samajwadi Party (SP)-Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) alliance ticket. The other candidates in the fray include Congress’s Sangeeta Tyagi, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)’s Ajit Kumar Pal, and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)’s Dr Chhavi Yadav.Residents said while their neighbourhood could boast of some of the best malls in Delhi-NCR, what they needed was a proper drainage system. While there are numerous private hospitals there, what they do not have is a decent government hospital. Alok Kumar, founder of the Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association (FedAOA), Ghaziabad, said the need for a government hospital was acutely felt, especially after the Covid pandemic hit.“During the second wave last year, there was a dire need for a government hospital as there were no beds to be found anywhere, and private hospitals charged a hefty amount. In fact, the demand for a government hospital is long pending and predates even the pandemic,” he said.He said a number of infrastructure projects in Indirapuram were stalled due to the handover logjam between the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA), which developed the township, and Ghaziabad municipal corporation since 2017. After several protests by local councillors, talks between the authority and the corporation commenced in 2018. While the GDA claims that it is ready to hand over the township, the corporation says the GDA first needs to fix several infrastructure deficiencies before it can take over the township.Another demand of the residents is public transport.“Indirapuram does not have any local bus service and residents rely on three-wheelers (auto-rickshaws) to commute. Residents have also demanded connectivity from Noida’s Electronic City Metro station to Indirapuram’s CISF Road. We hope that these issues are part of the candidates’ agenda,” said Anil Sharma, general secretary of FedAOA.Traffic management, or the lack of it, is also an issue, say residents, adding that driving around the swanky township is a hassle, owing to jams.“Even though the roads are wide enough, rampant encroachment has reduced the space available for traffic. Authorities have conducted several anti-encroachment drives, but the menace returns,” said Awadesh Jha, a resident of Shakti Khand-4.Residents also said the Ganga water supply to high-rise societies is erratic at best. “We are scheduled to get Ganga water for one hour each in the morning and evening. However, even that is irregular. Moreover, just two hours of water supply a day for high-rise societies is highly insufficient,” said Lalit Mohan, member of Arihant Paradiso AOA in Ahinsa Khand-2, Indirapuram.The sewage system has failed to keep up with the increasing population, said residents.“Often during monsoon, sewage starts overflowing into localities. The sewage treatment plant in Indirapuram also overflows and needs redevelopment,” said Abhishek Singh, member of ATS Advantage AOA in Ahinsa Khand-1, Indirapuram.MLA and BJP candidate Sunil Kumar Sharma said the issue of Indirapuram handover is his top agenda. “My priority is to resolve the issue of handover and it is my promise to residents that it will be resolved as soon as I am voted back to power,” he said.He said during his tenure, new sewage lines were constructed in Indirapuram.Amarpal Sharma from the SP-RLD combine said that one of his main objectives is to bring Metro connectivity to Indirapuram. “It is my agenda to bring the Noida Metro from Sector 62 to Sahibabad via Indirapuram. I will also work towards regularising Ganga water supply and construction of a government hospital and schools in the area,” he said.Congress candidate Sangeeta Tyagi added, “Residents of Indirapuram are at the mercy of private players for hospitals as well as schools. Our main objective in this area is the construction of government facilities for residents.”AAP’s Dr Chhavi Yadav said, “We will ensure that the area gets regular and sufficient Ganga water supply. Redevelopment of existing government schools is also on the agenda.”According to psephologist Sanjay Kumar from the Centre for Society and Development Studies, Delhi, people’s affiliation to a party could play a key role in deciding how Sahibabad votes.“Looking at the last elections, BJP has a large voter base in this constituency as Sunil Kumar Sharma won by the biggest margin. Civic issues also play an important role in the area. Unlike the rest of UP, caste-based politics is neutralised in Sahibabad as the main opponents from BJP and SP are both from the same caste,” he said.
26-01-2022||Chandigarh||Transporters in Ludhiana decry public representatives’ indifference toward deplorable state of transport nagar||Transporters have blamed the lackadaisical attitude of public representatives and politicians, who are busy with campaigning for the upcoming state assembly elections, for the issues plaguing Transport Nagar.Highlighting the potholed roads, water logging due to choked sewers, lack of parking space, and security in the area, the near-1200-strong community of transporters said they have been demanding resolution for decades. The transporters lambasted authorities for not undertaking any structural improvement since the 114-acres area was first set up back in 1984. They complained of congestion and uncleanliness, adding that truck drivers are forced to park their trucks by the roadside. Potholes on road and unhygienic conditions due to water accumulation add to the woes and instances of carts and rickshaws turning turtle have become an everyday affair.Ludhiana Goods Transport Association (LGTA) press secretary Jagdish Singh Jassowal highlighted the delay in getting the issues resolved, saying public representatives often ignore the area due to its commercial nature and a lack of city-based voters living in the area. Jassowal said, “In the past, a governing-party MLA told the transporters that they had no power to change anything as they did not have votes in the area. Even the councillors do not visit transport nagar, the biggest in the state. It has been in a deplorable state for years.” Further highlighting the issues, he said, “Deep potholes and choked sewer lines are the major issues and a large number of vehicles are damaged on a daily basis due to the potholes. Trucks get stuck in the parking sites due to water accumulation and deep potholes and they have to hire cranes for pulling them out,”“Filth, garbage and water accumulation can be witnessed at every nook and corner of the area despite tall claims of the Swachh Bharat mission,” he added, before suggesting that the transport nagar be moved to a different suitable location. The transporters stated that the sitting MLA Surinder Dawar laid foundation stone for cemented roads in the area in July last year, claiming that ₹7 crores had been earmarked, but only a few roads had been constructed before the project was put on hold.Ludhiana Transporters Welfare Association president Janak Raj Goyal said, “The public representatives do not pay any heed to the problems being faced by the transporters as we are all tax-paying citizens. We have submitted memorandums with a large number of public representatives and authorities in the past, but to no avail.”“The parking spots are in a deplorable state, there are no green belts in the area that have been maintained properly. The sewer lines often choke, resulting in water accumulation and we are forced to work in unhygienic conditions,” he added.Transporters raise security concernsThe transporters also raised concerns about the over lack of security in the area, saying that incidents of theft and snatching are commonplace.“We fear coming here at night as a large number of snatching and theft incidents have been reported. We have been demanding that a police post be set up in the area, but our requests are hardly ever heard,” said Sarabjit Singh, a transporter.  ₹7-cr project approved: Congress councillorCongress councillor Navneet Ghayal said a projects worth ₹7 crores has been approved for constructing cemented roads, adding that work had to stop the work due to heavy rainfall, but would restart in a few days. He said the issue of choked sewers will also be resolved soon.Despite multiple attempts, Dawar remained unavailable for comments||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/transporters-in-ludhiana-decry-public-representatives-indifference-toward-deplorable-state-of-transport-nagar-101643136449136.html

26-01-2022||Delhi||PWD booked for damaging trees on south Delhi stretch||The forest and wildlife department has booked the public works department (PWD) for resuming trenching work on a stretch of road in CR Park without due permission and for damaging 10 more trees in the process, officials said on Tuesday.A hearing on the matter will be held next week to determine the penalty to be imposed on the road agency, while a fresh restraining order has also been issued to prevent any further trenching work, for laying underground cables, from taking place at the site, the officials said.Mandeep Mittal, deputy conservator of forest (south) said during an inspection last Thursday, the forest department found fresh damage to around 10 trees on Bipin Chandra Pal Marg in CR Park, south Delhi. The trenching work, officials said, was restarted by the PWD despite the forest department issuing a ‘stop work’ order against the road agency in last October, after it was found digging too close to the trees and damaging them in the process.“A stay order was in place against the PWD after they dug within a metre of the trees in October. We received a complaint that work had resumed without permission and more trees have been damaged in the process. An on-ground inspection revealed that around 10 trees have been damaged in the latest trenching work,” said Mittal, stating a case had been registered against the PWD under the Preservation of Trees Act, with a hearing scheduled next week to determine the quantum of fine to be imposed.Verhaen Khanna, an environmental activist who runs the NGO New Delhi Nature Society (NDNS), filed the initial complaint in October, as well as the recent complaint last week, stating that the trenching work was in violation of the forest department’s October order, as well those of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which in 2015 directed agencies to not dig within a one-metre radius of trees.“Several trees have been damaged once again, despite a clear order by the forest department last year informing the police and the PWD to stop any further work. It is unfortunate that both agencies failed to protect trees on the stretch,” said Khanna, stating that strict penal action was required against the road agency.The PWD did not respond to calls and text messages from HT seeking comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pwd-booked-for-damaging-trees-on-south-delhi-stretch-101643136148996.html
26-01-2022||Mumbai||Fire brigade prepares notice to Tardeo building for flouting safety rules||Mumbai The Mumbai Fire Brigade was on Tuesday in the process of issuing a notice to Kamla Building in Tardeo for flouting fire safety rules. Seven people were killed and 23 were injured after a fire broke out in the 20-storey building on Saturday. Meanwhile, the cause and location of the fire remained unascertained. The fire brigade began its preliminary investigation, but officials said many eyewitnesses are in the hospital and some of them are in a critical condition. So, they are not able to record statements to determine what happened that led to the blaze.Hemant Parab, Chief Fire Officer, said, “We are in the process of drafting the notice and it will be sent by Tuesday itself. The notice will inform the housing society that its firefighting system was not working, and about the other fire safety rules it has flouted. It will direct the society to undertake measures to ensure an operational firefighting system. The society will be penalised as per due process of law.”The fire erupted on the 19th floor and gutted one flat, the common corridor of this floor, and the electric cables in the entire duct. The fire brigade received a call at 7.26 am, and after firefighters arrived at 7.29 am, they noticed the building’s firefighting system was not operational. Residents later recounted that the fire alarm did not go off and they came to know only after smoke had filled corridors on every floor. Most residents were asleep.The fire brigade confirmed that the building had not submitted its biannual fire safety audit report, which is called form B. The notice will be issued under Section 6 of the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act 2006, which makes it the responsibility of the owners or occupiers of a building to ensure fire safety on the premises, and for its residents. They are also supposed to conduct regular audits of the fire safety mechanism to ensure it is in working condition by third party auditors empaneled with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, and submit the form B along with the audit report.Parab said the fire brigade has still not been able to determine if the fire started in the duct and spread to flat 1904 which was completely gutted, or it broke out in 1904 and spread to the duct. However, the duct should have been sealed with fire retardant material, but it was not done. There were doors to the duct on each floor, but these were open, which catalysed the spread of heat and flames to all 20 floors of the building.Among the seven who died, one person was rescued from the 16th floor. He had sustained burn and suffocation injuries, which baffled the fire brigade as the blaze was restricted to the 19th floor and the duct on all floors. Parab said, “It is possible that the person tried to escape through thick smoke and his visibility was hampered. The person must have entered through the first door he found open, which happened to be the duct, that led to his burn injuries. He must have rushed to his own flat in panic, and died of suffocation. This is where we recovered the body. This is the most likely explanation we can think of but investigation is on to determine the events precisely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fire-brigade-prepares-notice-to-tardeo-building-for-flouting-safety-rules-101643136094832.html
26-01-2022||Lucknow||Lucknow: UP Bar Council urges political parties to include lawyers’ demands in manifestos||Lucknow: The Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday put forward a set of lawyers’ demands before the major political parties and urged them to incorporate these in their poll manifestos ahead of the state assembly polls. Their demands include cashless medical facility, compensation to kin of the lawyers who died due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a housing scheme for them on ‘no- profit, no- loss basis’ and others. “Cashless medical facility of ₹10 lakh must be provided to each lawyer in case of accident or any serious illness. ₹10 lakh compensation should also be given to the kin of those lawyers who died due to the Covid-19 pandemic in last two years,” said Shirish Kumar Mehrotra, chairman of the Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh, while talking to media. The council chairman also demanded a housing scheme for lawyers on ‘no- profit, no- loss basis’. “Rajasthan government is running a housing scheme for lawyers. Similar scheme must be launched in Uttar Pradesh also,” he said.The Bar Council has also demanded a pension scheme for those lawyers who have completed 40 years in legal profession. “A pension scheme of ₹25,000 per month should be launched for those lawyers who have completed 40 years in this profession,” Mehrotra said. “The practice of appointing retired judges on various posts in tribunals, commissions and regulatory authorities should be stopped. The government appoints retired judges as chairman of tribunals and other bodies. This practice must be stopped and lawyers must be appointed on these posts,” said Mehrotra. Prashant Singh ‘Atal’ and Jay Narayan Pandey, both co-chairman of the Bar Council, stressed upon the need to impellent Lawyers’ Protection Act. While Abdul Razzaque Khan, member of the Bar Council, stated that applications of 1200 family members of the deceased lawyers were still pending with the state government for compensation. “Next government must dispose of these applications on priority basis,” said Khan. Vice chairman of the Bar Council, Pradeep Kumar Singh and member of the council, Anurag Pandey, also demanded adequate security in all district courts across the state and constitution of special security force for this purpose. According to the Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh, there are around four lakh registered lawyers all across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-up-bar-council-urges-political-parties-to-include-lawyers-demands-in-manifestos-101643136088998.html
26-01-2022||Delhi||DU teachers say new UG curriculum will lead to course dilution, loss of jobs||A section of teachers of Delhi University, some of whom are also members of the academic council (AC) and executive council (EC), have written to vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh on Tuesday, raising concerns over the draft undergraduate curriculum framework, released by the varsity last week, and said the proposed framework has significantly diluted coursework and contains reduced credits. Aligned with the National Education Policy (NEP), the Undergraduate Curriculum Framework 2022 (UGCF) outlines 176 credits for a four-year honours degree and offers students multiple entry/exit options throughout the course. The new draft reduced the credits to 176 from 196 outlined in the first draft of the framework, which was approved by the academic council last year. In their letter, the signatories said the framework seemed to have been drafted in a haphazard manner by the NEP cell, after bypassing the AC and EC. While outlining the perceived shortcomings of the draft, teachers said the reduction in overall credits meant that there would be a loss of teaching hours and subsequent displacement of teachers. They said the reduction in workload would lead to a dilution of the syllabus content. EC members Seema Das, one of the signatories, said besides the reduction in credits, there were apprehensions about the diversion of credits to MOOCs (massive open online courses) and SWAYAMs (the Union government’s free e-learning portal). “How is it possible to earn a maximum of 26 credits per semester, as per the draft, when a semester can only allow a maximum of 22 credits (again, as per the draft). Does this imply the introduction of MOOCs and SWAYAMs through the back door? That will lead to a reduction in workload as students will be able to secure credits from other universities,” said Das. The signatories pointed out that the draft framework did not specify the details of the practical components for science courses, while the compulsory aspect of courses such as environmental studies has been diluted. “The EVS has been made a compulsory paper, with a six-month module syllabus, as per the UGC (University Grants Commission) and the Supreme Court directives. This is not reflected in the proposed framework. Similarly, language and commerce courses have also been restructured to their disadvantage, resulting in a loss of workload,” another teacher said. While objecting to the multiple entry/exit option in courses and the credit transfer system -- a student may transfer credits from another university to the DU -- teachers said both will result in fluctuating workload while increasing the drop-out rate among students, particularly from the marginalised sections of society. They requested the V-C to defer the implementation of the proposed framework. Apart from the signatories, teacher groups have also raised concerns about the new framework. The DU teachers’ association (DUTA) will also be sending detailed feedback on the framework and has constituted a committee for the same. The university has given time till January 30 for feedback on the proposed framework, which was released on its website last week. DU registrar Vikas Gupta said the university will place the draft before the AC and EC after feedback has been collected from all stakeholders. He said the university shared two frameworks in December with colleges and other stakeholders such as DUTA and the latest one was framed on the basis of feedback thus received. “We have refined the framework to focus on holistic multi-disciplinarity. We will go through the comments and try to incorporate more feedback after which the proposal will be placed before the AC and EC,” he said. While addressing concerns regarding the reduced role of teachers, he said the V-C has repeatedly assured teachers that there will be no reduction in workload and the number of teachers will not decrease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-teachers-say-new-ug-curriculum-will-lead-to-course-dilution-loss-of-jobs-101643135911300.html

26-01-2022||Pune||Sutradhara’s tales: Shaniwarwada as it really was!||When Bollywood film ”Bajirao Mastani” was released, many history lovers and tourists flocked Shaniwarwada, the heritage site and Peshwa residence at Pune, to experience grandeur that was depicted in the film. However, present-day remains of Shaniwarwada could not fulfil their unrealistic expectations and visitors were royally disappointed! In spite of the big production, film could not authentically recreate the glory of Shaniwarwada, but that is a discussion for another day! If one wants to visualise Shaniwarwada of the 18th century, history books and paintings come to our rescue. Like many monuments in Maharashtra, Shaniwarwada was not built in a day. Since 1730, when foundation was laid by Bajirao I, the site of castle has been built upon and renovated by subsequent Peshwas and its magnificence reached the zenith around last decades of 18th century. The original wada of Peshwa Bajirao I consisted of two private chambers of Bajirao accompanied by fountain, main Diwankhana in the front, various gateways, a drum house room on front gateway, a water tank with upper storey (bangali) and Persian wheel, wall enclosure around the wada, well, etc. The wada was two storeyed and two courtyards. The water for fountain was fetched from a well in the river through channels (paat), pumped to the tank in upper tower using Persian wheel and circulated through gravity to reach fountain spouts. The water requirement of the household was limited in early days and wells in wada and by the river were sufficient Original plan included fortification around the wada for safety, but it was met with strong disapproval from Shahu Maharaj. Shahu Maharaj thought that if such a fortified base is captured by enemies it would prove difficult to win it back and can be used against the Marathas themselves. The new buildings planned however continued to be built. Around 1745, most of the works, including the construction of an overhead tank, top storeys, Diwankhana for Mahadji Purandare and for leisurely activities were completed. The space requirements for growing household, servants and visitors were huge and allotted space for various construction activities was not enough. So, the adjoining areas were acquired time- to-time from its owners against land compensation. After the death of Shahu Maharaj, Nanasaheb Peshwa took the bold decision of building the fortification wall around the Shaniwarwada mansion which was completed by 1759. The fortification had stone masonry at the base and upper part was built using fired rectangular bricks. The handsome Delhi Darwaja facing the north was built with towering Dakhani arch flanked by octagonal bastions. The merlons of bastions effectively hid the soldiers while opening was mounted with cannons and guns. Main facade was decorated and painted in delicate floral patterns and the wooden door reinforced with iron bars and piercing spikes were installed. The sharp spikes were installed to deter any attempts of opening of doors by employing elephant power. The fortification was reinforced with nine formidable bastions in every direction. Nanasaheb constructed a beautiful garden called Chimanbaug in memory of his uncle, Chimaji Appa, to the eastern side of main wada. It had various floral beds and water pools built in ornate shaped patterns with seating platforms provided on the side. The flower garden, water pools, central fountain of 26 ft by 26 ft size, painted Diwankhana pavilion constituted a beautiful ambience. Chimanbaug is one of the better surviving structures in Shaniwarwada, today. Shaniwarwada was also known for its hazari karanje (1,000 spout fountain) which occupied a central space. This fountain of 80 feet circumference is built using petals carved in stone in two rows. It has 197 nozzles which were further fitted into four petaled lotuses bringing the count to almost thousands. One can only imagine the astounding beauty of this outstanding piece of art in operation in its hey days! There exists a misconception that Shaniwarwada was seven storeys high based on some later records which describe it as “saat majali kalsi bangla”. From the descriptions of the building in arches and references from contemporary Maratha architecture on can surmise that there existed one building called Kothi next to the main mansion with was saat-khani wada (khan is the measurable unit of space between two wooden pillars of wada). It was five storeyed high (including the ground storey) with two storey of tower crowned by domical structure. These towers were in vogue during medieval times and were used as watch towers, for skygazing or leisure. Some anecdotes claimed that shikharas/towers of temple at Alandi were visible from the seventh storey of the tower. The tower at Shaniwarwada was burned to the ground in an unfortunate fire in 1794. Most of the buildings in Shaniwarwada were either two storeyed or three storeyed. This can be easily confirmed from the British era painting of 1820 showing these comparative heights of individual building within Shaniwarwada with that of main Dilli Darwaja. During Nanasaheb’s times, this mansion Peshwas housed quarters of Peshwa family members such as Nanasaheb, Chimaji Appa, Vishwasrao, Sadashivrao Bhau, Madhavrao Peshwa, Narayanrao, women’s chambers, including chamber of Gopikabai. Darbars such as Ganesh Rangamahal, Arase Mahal (hall of mirrors), Gokak Diwankhana, Nachya Diwankhana (dance performances), Kachericha Diwankhana (office), Hastidanti diwankhana (decorate with ivory), Ganpati Rangmahal (where Ganesha idol was installed and Ganesha festival celebrated), Narayanrao Mahal, Gopikabai Rangamahal were used for hosting royal court, national and foreign dignitaries, guests, esteemed visitors, diplomats and so on. Various festivals were celebrated in these spaces with fan and fair and yet very typical to brahminised Marathi culture of medieval times. Various courtyards were referred to Fadacha chowk (office), Tak chowk (book keeping), Mudpak chowk (kitchen), Pakwanacha chowk (feasts), Savitribaicha chowk (of Savitraibai), Yamunabaicha chowk (of Yamunabai) and so on depending on function of spaces or the associations. In addition, servant quarters, Hamamkhana, Nagarkhana, horse stables, barracks for soldiers along fortification, personal Devghar (pooja house), Pothishala (manuscripts), Ratna-shala, Javahirkhana, Jamdarkhana, dining rooms, armory, Sadar (offices), Daftarkhana (archives), Janana (women’s chambers), Khalbat-khana and such spaces occupied the five acres of Shaniwarwada mansion. During Nanasaheb’s times, including around 20 odd main personalities (khashe), other relatives, guests, associates, students, teachers, helpers, servants, personal assistants, guards counting to 1,000 individuals would be present in Shaniwarwada on any given day. Alas, glory of virtual capital of India, powerful seat of Maratha Empire at its pinnacle today can only be fathomed through writing of the mundane past records! We shall witness Shaniwarwada of later Peshwas through eyes of visitors in next column. Saili Palande-Datar is an indologist, environmentalist, history researcher and farmer.

26-01-2022||Chandigarh||Celebrated lyricist Dev Tharike Wala passes away at 83||Lyricist Hardev Singh Gill, better known by pseudonym Dev Tharike Wala, died on Tuesday of age-related illness at the age of 83. Tharike Wala had penned several famous Punjab kalian over the course of his long-standing association with singer Kuldeep Manak, most notable of which was the 1976 record Tere Tille To Na. Reacting to the news, noted Punjabi writer Gurbhajan Singh Gill said the lyricist’s passing away has left a void that could never be filled.Noted writer and critic Jagwinder Jodha, associate professor at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), also expressed his sadness at Tharike Wala’s passing, saying the 83-year-old was among the few lyricists of the post-independence era who celebrated the economic rise of Punjab following his green revolution and brought the feelings of the common man on centre stage. “Socially, he made a significant contribution to celebrate womanhood. ‘Maa hundi ae maa o duniya waleyo. Maa ae thand di chhan o duniya waleyo’, song is a classic example of it,” Jodha said.Tharike Wala’s last rites were performed on Tuesday afternoon at Thrike village. People, including celebrated names from the field of Punjab literature, attended his funeral in large numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/celebrated-lyricist-dev-tharike-wala-passes-away-at-83-101643135669760.html
26-01-2022||Delhi||Marital rape hearing: Forced sex in marriage ‘abuse’ at best, NGO tells HC||Opposing a clutch of pleas that sought to criminalise marital rape in India, the counsel for NGO Hridey, an intervenor, told the Delhi high court on Tuesday that offences concerning marriage stand on a different footing and the wisdom of Parliament in retaining the marital rape exception should not be doubted.There are other sufficient provisions in the IPC (Indian Penal Code) and other statutes to redress the grievances of a woman, advocate RK Kapoor told the court.Kapoor also contended that forced sexual intercourse between husband and wife cannot be labelled rape and at worse, such an act of wrongdoing can be called “sexual abuse”, and a wife cannot compel the prescription of a particular punishment against her husband “to satisfy her ego”.Referring to the court’s earlier observation that if a sex worker who was forced to have sexual intercourse could file rape charges, why should a “wife be less empowered”, Kapoor said that to compare the two would be an “insult to the institution of marriage”.Kapoor told a bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar, which is hearing the pleas, “A perpetrator cannot claim restitution of conjugal rights against sex worker and correspondingly sex worker cannot claim regular maintenance from a perpetrator. There is no emotional relationship between sex worker and the stranger. The relationship between husband and wife is a package of a large number of mutual rights and obligations which are social, physiological, religious, economic etc. It cannot be limited to just one event of consent for sexual relationship alone.”Exception 2 of Section 375 IPC decriminalizes marital rape and mandates that sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape.“The legislature has classified several types of sexual offences under the IPC on the basis of a “number of incidental and collateral circumstances, the relationship between the parties and the age of the woman”, and the retention of the marital rape exception which is based on a “reasonable classification” cannot be found fault with,” Kapoor said.The bench is currently hearing PILs filed in 2015 by NGO RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association and two individuals who have sought to strike down the exception in the Indian rape laws on the grounds that it discriminated against married women who were sexually assaulted by their husbands.In 2017, the central government in an affidavit said that marital rape cannot be made a criminal offence as it could become a phenomenon that may destabilise the institution of marriage and an easy tool for harassing the husbands.On Monday, the Union government told the court that it was considering a “constructive approach” on the issue of criminalising marital rape and has sought suggestions from several stakeholders and authorities. Following this, the court granted it 10 days to respond on the matter.The hearing in the case will continue on January 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/marital-rape-hearing-forced-sex-in-marriage-abuse-at-best-ngo-tells-hc-101643135609032.html
26-01-2022||Gurugram||Haryana deputy CM urges labour department to reach out to industry and youth||Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Tuesday said that he asked the labour department to ensure quicker registration of private companies on the job reservation portal, in accordance with the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act that was implemented on January 15. The Act mandates 75% reservation to job seekers from Haryana in the private sector.Firms are supposed to register themselves on the portal, and upload data and share detailed data pertaining to employees who earn upto ₹30,000 per month, including their qualifications, domicile and other background information. Industries and private firms have three months to register with the labour department portal. Chautala also urged officials of the labour department to ensure that 1,000 companies register on the portal by the end of January. He said 11 companies had registered themselves on the portal until now.Chautala, who was in Hisar to review an airport project, said that he has also directed the department to make changes in the reservation portal so that smaller firms, limited liability partnerships, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other organisations are also able to register smoothly.On Monday, the deputy chief minister held a review meeting with the labour department and asked officials to reach out to job-seekers and industry insiders to ensure greater participation of stakeholders. “I have asked the labour department to ensure that changes are made in the portal so that firms such as limited liability partnerships, NGOs and others can upload their data. Also, the department has been asked to reach out to industries and ensure faster registration and sharing of data,” said Chautala. He said that all efforts are being made for the smooth implementation of the job reservation policy. During Monday’s meeting the deputy chief minister also discussed the implementation of the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020. The Act was passed by the state assembly on March 2, 2021 and was approved by the governor. On November 6, it was notified by the state labour department and came into force from January 15, 2022.Chautala asked officials to set up yearly targets to provide jobs to locals. He also asked the labour department to carry out awareness campaigns regarding local job reservations and to hold seminars in each district next month. “Such moves will help remove apprehensions about the Act,” he said. Raja Sekhar Vundru, additional chief secretary of the Haryana labour department, said that proposed changes are already being made in order to ensure faster registration of companies. “We will also be carrying out a skill gap analysis of the youth and hold seminars with the industry and youth in different districts to ensure that the Act is implemented smoothly,” he said. Vundru also said that 25,000 persons registered on the portal till Tuesday evening since it was launched on January 15. Industry associations, however, have been opposing the job reservation in a court of law.JN Mangla, president, Gurgaon Industrial Association said that most of the firms in the city are waiting for the court hearing on February 2 and thereafter will adopt a future course of action. 
26-01-2022||Delhi||Notorious gang’s hitman arrested in southwest Delhi||An alleged sharpshooter from fugitive gangster Kapil Sangwan alias Nandu’s gang, two members of an interstate gunrunning racket with links to dissident modules abroad, and a man with a criminal history wanted in connection with three dacoities committed in Delhi were arrested by three teams of the special cell in separate operations between January 15 and 22, the city police said Tuesday. A total of 29 pistols and 28 cartridges were recovered from the four arrested persons, they said.In the first operation on January 15, the special cell team of the northern range (NR) arrested a gunrunner named Ravi Khan from outer Delhi’s Bawana with 15 semi-automatic pistols that he had smuggled into the city to deliver to his associates. Police said Khan is from Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh and has confessed to being a member of a firearms supply syndicate. He said he procured the weapons from his associate Rahul Singh in Madhya Pradesh’s Dhar district. The next day, the team reached Dhar and arrested Singh with 10 more weapons, said deputy commissioner of police (special cell, NR) Rajiv Ranjan Singh.“Singh supplied weapons to criminals in Delhi and other states through Khan and other gunrunners. Singh’s interrogation revealed that he has links to some modules involved in subversive and hawala activities abroad. He has received a large amount of money from such modules illegally,” added DCP Singh.The second operation was carried out on January 20 by the southwestern range (SWR) team that arrested Shekhar alias Sonu of Haryana’s Rohtak, an alleged sharpshooter of Nandu’s gang, for allegedly opening fire at the office of a property dealer in Uttam Nagar on January 11. He did so to extort the property dealer for money on the behest of Nandu, who is operating his gang from Europe, said deputy commissioner of police (special cell, SWR) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav.“Shekhar disclosed that he was tasked with the job by Nandu’s key aide, Anil Podi, who is currently in jail. He was paid ₹20,000 as the token amount and promised a handsome share in the extortion money that the gang members expected to receive from the property dealer after the firing. We seized two pistols with eight bullets from Shekhar,” Yadav said.In the third operation on January 22, the special cell’s New Delhi range (NDR) team caught 33-year-old Praveen alias Parvez, who was wanted in connection with three dacoity cases registered in Delhi, with two pistols and 20 cartridges. A proclaimed offender in at least 10 cases of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Praveen was also carrying a reward of ₹50,000 by the Delhi Police in connection with an armed dacoity of ₹15 lakh from Shahdara in April 2020, said DCP (special cell, NDR) Pramod Singh Kushwah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/notorious-gang-s-hitman-arrested-in-southwestdelhi-101643135489252.html
26-01-2022||Delhi||Election commission marks reserved wards for Delhi civic polls||The state election commission on Tuesday issued the list of municipal wards that will be reserved for women and Scheduled Caste category for the municipal corporation elections due to be held in April. The wards are revised before each municipal election, an election commission official said. The official who asked not to be named said that of the total 272 municipal wards in the city the North and South Delhi corporations have 104 seats each and the East MCD has 64 wards. Based on the distribution of the people belonging to the Scheduled Caste and the provisions of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, a total of 46 wards have been put under the reserved category. Of the total 46 SC reserved seats, 24 are further reserved for the women from the community. Of these 46 wards, 20 are under the North civic body, 15 under South corporation and 11 come under the East MCD, the official said. The announcement of reserved wards is expected to pave the way for viable candidates staking their claim for tickets based on the status of the wards.The change in the status of several wards would also force several key municipal leaders to change their seats. EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal, who represents ward 27 (Raghubarpura), which was a general seat, will now be reserved for women. Aggarwal said that the seat used to a reserved for women before the 2017 elections, and it has now gone back to the same category. “Our party cadre is strong at the grassroots level and the rotation of seats should not affect our prospects.

26-01-2022||Delhi||Sharjeel Imam lambasted ideas of democracy, secularism in speeches: Court||JNU student Sharjeel Imam “lambasted” the Constitution, and the ideas of democracy and secularism, a Delhi court said while framing charges of sedition and under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against him for giving alleged inflammatory speeches at Aligarh Muslim University and Delhi’s Jamia Nagar area while addressing the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protesters. The order came on Monday, but a detailed copy was uploaded on the court’s website on Tuesday evening. The court said that prima facie the speeches were aimed at the Muslim audience, and seem to be “indicative of showing the worthlessness of the community and their existential crisis”.Imam has been in judicial custody since January 28, 2020. On Monday, while framing charges, the court also rejected his bail plea. Additional Sessions judge Amitabh Rawat said according to the speeches and other material produced by the prosecution, on a prima facie level, there appears to be a tendency to create public disorder and incitement to violence. He said violence indeed took place due to Imam’s alleged provocative speeches.The judge said the speech also appears to challenge the territorial integrity and sovereignty of India. It also appears to create hatred/contempt for the lawful institutions of the state and to challenge them by unlawful means.“It appears that he (Imam) is trying to convince the people that Muslims as a community have been deprived because of the Constitution and people who made the Constitution or who are required to protect it,” the judge said in the order.“The speeches appear to be completely pessimistic…The accused has made utterances not just once but many times over. It is not as if the words are spelt out in a moment of haste or anger or antagonism without intending it,” the court said.“The accused by referring to the blockage/cutoff of ‘chicken neck’ which joins mainland India to the NorthEast by seems to remind everyone that the said land belongs to Muslims and the call to do it, by certain means, is indicative of his intention,” the judge said.The Delhi Police filed a charge sheet against Imam in July 2020.Imam, through his counsel Tanveer Ahmed Mir, had contended that his client’s prosecution for alleged inflammatory speeches is the “whip of a monarch rather than a government established by law”. He had said that Imam’s criticism of the government cannot be the cause of sedition.Mir had also said that his client is not a terrorist or associated with some terrorist outfit, adding that he has criminal antecedents or any political agenda. The lawyer said that there were many prosecutions against Imam just because he had criticized the government’s policies.Besides this case, Imam is also accused of being the “mastermind” of the February 2020 riots, which left 53 people dead and over 700 injured. He has been booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, or UAPA.Earlier in December, the court had granted bail to Imam in a case of alleged violence at Jamia Millia Islamia in December 2019, during protests against the amended citizenship law. The FIR under which he is an accused involves offences such as rioting, conspiracy, attempt to commit culpable homicide, voluntarily obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions, and assault.
26-01-2022||Delhi||10k public buses in Delhi by 2023, 75% new vehicles electric: Kailash Gahlot||Delhi will have a fleet of nearly 10,000 buses for public transport, with 75% electric buses among the newly inducted vehicles, by mid next year, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Tuesday.Talking to HT, the minister said a total of 2,830 new buses are scheduled to arrive in different phases between March and mid-2023, which will take the total number of buses in the Capital to 9,724. “Of the 2,830 new buses, 2,130, or 75%, will be electric buses -- a feat which no other state probably has been able to achieve so far. It is also noteworthy that it will be the first time that Delhi will have a fleet as big as 9,730 buses...,” said Gahlot.The city currently has 6,894 buses, of which 3,761, including one electric bus, are with the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and 3,133 are operating under the cluster scheme.Transport commissioner Ashish Kundra said even the current bus fleet in the national Capital is the highest ever in Delhi. Records with the state transport department showed that the previous high was in 2010 when Delhi increased its fleet size to 6,342 as it procured new buses on a war footing ahead of the Commonwealth Games.Of the 2,830 new buses to be added until mid-2023, 700 will run on CNG, officials said, adding that 250 of these buses will start arriving from March this year, and the delivery of the remaining 450 will begin from October.The DTC will get 300 electric buses, which will also start arriving from March.On January 17 this year, the first electric bus under this lot was flagged off by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in the city. It was also the first time that DTC has managed to procure a bus since 2011, after at least five failed tenders.As per various court orders in the past, Delhi should have 10,000-11,000 buses for public transport. However, senior transport officials said even a fleet of 9,000 buses will do for now since the Delhi Metro also caters to a significant number of passengers.According to data from before Covid when there were no curbs, DTC and cluster buses together catered to about 4.2 million passengers every day, and the Delhi Metro saw about 2.4 million commuters daily.“At the time of the previous court orders regarding fleet size, Delhi’s Metro was either not there at all or the network was negligible and therefore, having 11,000 buses was estimated based on the assumption that buses will be the only and primary mode of public transport. But, over the years, the passenger ridership has split between the state-run buses and the Metro,” said a senior transport official on condition of anonymity.Apart from the 300 e-buses for the DTC, the tender for another 330 e-buses, for the cluster scheme, is being drafted and the vehicles will be rolled out by end of this year, said officials.A big set of 1,500 e-buses under the Central government’s “Grand Challenge” (initiated in June last year by the ministry of power and NITI Aayog) will start arriving from July this year and the final lot is expected to arrive by June-July next year, Kundra said.On October 28 last year, HT first reported that the Delhi government has planned to only procure electric buses in the future, with an aim to increase the share of zero-emission vehicles in public transport to over 50%. For this, all existing bus depots are being upgraded with EV charging infrastructure by roping in all the three major private power distribution companies in the city.Amit Bhatt, executive director (transport), WRI India, said e-buses have low operating costs, and a capital cost higher than CNG buses. “What we need to remember is that fuel, even if it’s CNG, accounts for 40% of the operational cost of buses in our cities. With electric buses, the operational cost becomes cheaper and it also helps in the overall business planning of bus operations. The environmental benefits of e-buses are phenomenal as they have zero emissions and zero carbon footprint.”

26-01-2022||World||China criticises US move to let diplomats leave over Covid-19 rules||China has expressed concern and dissatisfaction at the reported US bid to allow its diplomats to exit the country because of existing Covid pandemic-related restrictions.The Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday said the pandemic control measures in China were in line with global conventions of diplomatic protocol and leaving the country would increase the risk of infection for US personnel and family.The foreign ministry was reacting to a Reuters report from Washington, which said the US state department was considering whether to authorise departures for American diplomats and their families in China wishing to leave because of intrusive pandemic control measures.“Two sources familiar with the issue said the US Embassy on Monday had sent the request to Washington for formal sign off, as China ramps up Covid-19 containment protocols ahead of the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics in less than two weeks,” the Reuters report said.The foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the decision was puzzling. “China is undoubtedly the safest country in the world at the moment, and withdrawing from the safest place will only greatly increase the risk of infection for US personnel. The logic of the US side’s decision is incomprehensible and difficult to justify,” he added.Zhao said China’s pandemic control measures were in line with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.He added that China’s Covid-19 prevention and control measures were rigorous, scientific and effective, and have well protected foreign nationals in China.China had expressed “concern and dissatisfaction” to the US and hoped the embassy would reconsider the action, Zhao added.An unnamed person told Reuters that the US embassy conducted an internal survey showing that as many as 25% of staff and family members would choose to leave China as soon as possible.The tabloid Global Times, carried a story on the development, headlined: “Dirty trick again! US plots to authorise departure of staff from embassies in China over epidemic ahead of Beijing Olympics”.“Such tricks ahead of the Chinese New Year and the Games showed its true intention, which is beyond the anti-epidemic consideration but only serves to create panic, slander China’s anti-epidemic work and disrupt China’s successful hosting of the Winter Olympics,” the report said.Washington is leading several allied and partner countries in a diplomatic boycott of the upcoming Winter Olympic Games, scheduled to begin on February 4, due to what it says is Beijing’s ongoing genocide towards Uighurs and other Muslim groups in its western region of Xinjiang.China has brought the Covid-19 pandemic under control since it emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late, 2019 despite sporadic outbreaks including an ongoing one, a mix of Omicron and Delta variants.As of Tuesday, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, both local and imported (ones detected among those flying in from abroad, mostly Chinese nationals), reported on the Chinese mainland had reached 105,749; the deaths stood at 4,636.The US has recorded more than 72 million coronavirus cases and a death toll of 891,595.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-criticises-us-move-to-let-diplomats-leave-over-covid-19-rules-101643197245243.html

26-01-2022||World||The ‘Partygate’ scandal: What Boris Johnson has said so far||Boris Johnson’s future as UK prime minister hangs in the balance as he grapples with two investigations — including one by the police — into alleged rule-breaking parties in government buildings while the country was in lockdown.The so-called ‘partygate’ controversy has gripped the country for weeks, escalating on Tuesday after police began a formal probe. That followed news of — among others — a “bring your own booze” party in Downing Street at the height of coronavirus restrictions in 2020, as well as a birthday party for Johnson.The scandal was already being investigated by senior civil servant Sue Gray, and her report is seen as central to whether members of Johnson’s Conservatives would continue to back him as a leader.  That review could come within days after police raised no objection to its publication, according to reports in local media.Meanwhile, the police probe is another damaging development for the prime minister, who is already facing calls to resign, even from within his own party, and slumping poll numbers.Among the key issues are whether any of the events breached coronavirus rules, when Johnson learned of the May 2020 BYOB party, and whether he ignored concerns from some within his office about it. Johnson has also been accused of misleading Parliament, which would customarily be a resigning matter.Here’s what Johnson has said so far in various interviews and Parliament addresses. December 1:At the weekly Prime Minister’s Questions in Parliament, Johnson says Covid rules were followed completely by his staff. Asked directly by opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer whether a Christmas party was thrown in Downing Street on Dec. 18, 2020, he replied:“What I can tell the right honorable and learned gentleman is that all guidance was followed completely in No. 10.”December 7:Asked in a broadcast interview about Dec. 18, 2020, Johnson said:“What I can tell you is that all the guidelines were observed, continue to be observed.”December 8:After days of stonewalling, Johnson finally tackles head-on allegations of a 2020 Christmas party and announces an investigation. He’s responding to a leaked video showing his aides joking about the party at a mock press conference, which prompted the resignation of his former press secretary Allegra Stratton. But he still insists no rules were broken.“I can understand how infuriating it must be to think that the people who have been setting the rules have not been following the rules because I was also furious to see that clip. I apologize unreservedly for the offense that it has caused up and down the country, and I apologize for the impression that it gives… I have been repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged that there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken… It goes without saying that if those rules were broken, then there will be disciplinary action for all those involved.”December 13:Asked about his involvement in a Christmas party quiz in 2020, Johnson replied:“I can tell you once again that I certainly broke no rules.”When Parliament went into recess for Christmas 2021, it offered Johnson an opportunity to reset his premiership, put the controversy behind him, and refocus on topics such as the rapid rollout of Covid-19 vaccine booster shots.But it wasn’t to be.On Jan. 10, 2022, broadcaster ITV reported that a top aide, Martin Reynolds, had invited about 100 people to a drinks party in the garden of No. 10 Downing Street in May 2020. Such gatherings were banned at the time under lockdown rules.January 12:Johnson makes his second apology in the space of a month to Parliament. He also admits he attended the gathering, though says he thought it was a work event.“I have learned enough to know that there were things that we simply did not get right. I must take responsibility.”“When I went into that garden just after 6 o’clock on 20 May 2020, to thank groups of staff before going back into my office 25 minutes later to continue working, I believed implicitly that this was a work event, but with hindsight, I should have sent everyone back inside... I should have recognized that even if it could be said technically to fall within the guidelines, there would be millions and millions of people who simply would not see it that way… To them and to this House, I offer my heartfelt apologies.”January 18:Johnson apologizes when asked in a broadcast interview about a party held in April 2021 on the eve of the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II’s husband Prince Philip. “I deeply and bitterly regret that that happened and I can only renew my apologies both to her majesty and to the country for misjudgments that were made and for which I take full responsibility.”Johnson is also asked to respond to a claim by Dominic Cummings, his former adviser, that Johnson not only knew about the May 20 party but ignored concerns raised. Cummings has been a thorn in the premier’s side since he was forced out of Downing Street in late 2020. Read more about his mudslinging here.“I can tell you categorically that nobody told me, and nobody said that this was something that was against the rules, a breach of the Covid rules...I do humbly apologize to people for misjudgments that were made.”He adds that people shouldn’t judge before all the facts are known.“What people need to do is wait and see what the report says.”January 25:In Parliament, the prime minister responds to news of the police’s involvement.“I welcome the Met’s decision to conduct its own investigation because I believe that will help to give the public the clarity they need and help to draw a line under matters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-partygate-scandal-what-boris-johnson-has-said-so-far-101643189080494.html
26-01-2022||World||Omicron survives over 21 hours on skin, more than 8 days on plastic: Study||A study conducted by the researchers from the Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine in Japan has now claimed that the Omiron variant of coronavirus can remain alive on skin and plastic more than the earlier variants of the virus like Alpha, Beta, Delta and Gamma. The study is yet to be peer-reviewed and has been posted recently on BioRxiv. According to the findings, Omicron can remain alive on the skin for over 21 hours and more than eight days on any plastic surface. This might be the reason why Omicron is spreading faster compared to other strains, the study said.For the study, the researchers compared the survival time of the other variants and concluded that the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants could remain alive on plastic surfaces for 56 hours, 191.3 hours, 156.6 hours, 59.3 hours, and 114 hours, respectively.Why some people avoid Covid-19 when those around them have it? Study explainsOmicron, on the other hand, can survive on a plastic surface for 193.5 hours, more than 8 days.On skin samples, the average virus survival times were 8.6 hours for the original version, 19.6 hours for Alpha, 19.1 hours for Beta, 11 hours for Gamma, 16.8 hours for Delta and 21.1 hours for Omicron, the study claimed.The findings also include the effectiveness of ethanol on all variants. Although Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants showed a slight increase in ethanol resistance in response to increased environmental stability, all VOCs on the skin surface were completely inactivated by 15-second exposure to 35 per cent ethanol, it said, asserting that santisiting hands frequently is highly recommended.Omicron is the latest variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified in South Africa on November 24, 2021. Since then, the variant has been spreading at an unprecedented spread replacing Delta, and led to a fresh surge of the pandemic across the world. (With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-survives-over-21-hours-on-skin-more-than-8-days-on-plastic-study-101643185076600.html

Nothing less is at stake than our democracy,” she added.By announcing she would seek a 19th term, Pelosi avoids becoming a lame duck in a year when Democrats are clinging to a fragile majority in the House and the party is under pressure to raise vast sums of money to defend control of Congress.Her decision to remain in the chamber follows announcements by 29 House Democrats that they won't seek reelection this year, compared to 13 Republicans as the GOP looks toward taking back the House.The party that controls the White House typically loses seats in Congress in midterm elections, and Democrats are defending both chambers at a time when President Joe Biden's approval rating has been slipping.“Our democracy is at risk because the assault on the truth, assault on the U.S. Capitol and the state-by-state assault on voting rights,” she added.In the video, Pelosi never addresses if she intends to seek another term as the House's Democratic leader, if reelected.The San Francisco Democrat made history 15 years ago when she became the first female speaker of the House. She has served in Congress since 1987.Earlier this month in an interview with The Associated Press, Pelosi only hinted at another run, saying she “may” seek reelection.In a Twitter post, California Republican Kevin Kiley, a congressional candidate and state assemblyman, said Pelosi's announcement was “all the more reason we need Republicans in Congress who will fight.”Pelosi will be a overwhelming favourite in her heavily Democratic district — she won with 78% of the vote in 2020. But she's also running at a time when her hometown has been criticized for squalor and crime, including daytime shootings in tourist areas, widespread homelessness and smash-and-grab thefts at high-end stores.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-to-seek-reelection-amid-retirement-buzz-101643167807231.html

The heavily-mutated strain is believed to bypass the existing vaccines and give stronger infection to the host.Yet, there are some people who don’t catch the virus despite living with a person who has Covid-19. How is it possible?A new study has explored thig angle, claiming that such people may be exposed to other coronaviruses in the past that enabled them to make memory immune cells - called T cells. They offer a higher protection against Covid-19.“Cross-reactive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 have been observed in pre-pandemic cohorts and proposed to contribute to host protection,” said the study published in Nature, which studied 52 Covid-19 household contacts to capture their immune responses. The idea was to capture immune responses at the earliest timepoints after exposure to Sars-CoV-2 virus.The researchers noted that viruses from the coronavirus family, though causes different illnesses, have some shared characteristics.Their shared structural similarities enable immune cells that recognise one type of coronavirus to recognise another type, said the study.The blood of all the 52 household contacts was tested between day one and day six. The researchers found higher levels of memory T cells in the samples of those who tested negative on a PCR test for Covid-19 than those who tested positive.The T cells that they measured not only targeted the spike protein part of the virus but also the nucleocapsid, the core part of the virus that stores its genetic material, the researchers said.Meanwhile, an infectious disease expert had said earlier this week that vaccinated people and those who haven’t taken a jab, experience different Omicron symptoms.“There is little systematic data so far, but I expect that many vaccinated and especially boosted folks are experiencing very mild symptoms and there is a higher proportion of vaccinated folks who have no symptoms,” Dr Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, told KSN.com.Dr Maya N Clark-Cutaia, professor at the New York University Meyers College of Nursing, said vaccinated people are reporting headaches, body aches and fever when infected with Omicron. Unvaccinated patients are more frequently reporting cough, shortness of breath and flu-like symptoms, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-some-people-avoid-covid-19-when-those-around-them-have-it-study-explains-101643167305375.html
26-01-2022||World||Canada investigating cyberattack amid escalating tensions with Russia||An attack on the computer systems of Canada’s Global Affairs Department last week has kept at least some diplomats without access to some online functions, the government's Treasury Board said.The board said Tuesday that “access to a very limited number of internet-based services remain restricted as part of the mitigation measures.” It didn’t say who was behind the Jan. 19 attack or give details of what occurred.The incident came a day before the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security urged companies to bolster protections against the potential for Russian-backed attacks amid escalating tensions over a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine.“The Government of Canada deals with ongoing and persistent cyber risks and threats every day,” the board said. “Cyberthreats can result from system or application vulnerabilities, or from deliberate, persistent, targeted attacks by outside actors to gain access to information.”Moscow is currently in a military standoff with NATO — including Canada — over Russia’s military buildup on the border with Ukraine, which reported Jan. 16 that Russia appeared to be behind an attack on its websites — something Russia denied.Earlier, Microsoft said dozens of computer systems at an unspecified number of Ukrainian government agencies had been infected with destructive malware disguised as ransomware.Families of Canadian diplomatic staff in Ukraine have been told to return to Canada due to the Russian military buildup and “destabilizing activities in and around Ukraine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-investigating-cyberattack-amid-escalating-tensions-with-russia-101643166411756.html
26-01-2022||World||Covid-19: Endemic doesn't mean life can return to normal, says virologist||A top virologist has warned against treating the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as harmless “just because it will become endemic”, as is predicted by health experts around the world. The virologist, Aris Katzourakis, said in an article published in Nature that endemic has become one of the most misused of the pandemic.Watch: Belgium protests Covid rules“It doesn’t mean that Covid-19 will come to a natural end,” said Katzourakis, a professor at University of Oxford who studies viral evolution and genomics.Also Read | Netherlands eases Covid-19 lockdown despite spike in casesHe then explained what endemic means in epidemiological terms. Katzourakis said that a disease reaches an endemic stage when the number of people it is infecting balances out the basic reproduction number - those individuals who an infected person would pass on the infection too.“Common colds are endemic. So are Lassa fever, malaria and polio. So was smallpox, until vaccines stamped it out,” he said.But a disease can be both endemic and still widespread and deadly, noted Katzourakis, highlighting that malaria killed 600,000 people in 2020, and tuberculosis took the lives of 1.5 million in the same year.“Endemic certainly does not mean that evolution has somehow tamed a pathogen so that life simply returns to ‘normal’,” said Katzourakis.The latest surge in Covid-19 infection is led by the new and heavily mutated Omicron variant of the coronavirus, which was first found in South Africa in November last year. The worst affected regions are the United States and Europe, where fresh peaks of infection have been appearing nearly every day. However, the research on Omicron has noted that hospitalisations are low, which denotes reduced severity.Also Read | Health officials offer hope that Omicron wave will increase global immunitySince it first struck the world, the healthcare experts have been studying the evolution of the Sars-CoV-2 virus and have predicted that the disease is here to stay, and the world will have to learn to live with it. Katzourakis has lashed out at this.“As an evolutionary virologist, it frustrates me when policymakers invoke the word endemic as an excuse to do little or nothing. There’s more to global health policy than learning to live with endemic rotavirus, hepatitis C or measles,” he added.Katzourakis warned that a virus like the Sars-CoV-2 has the capacity to mutate and it can bring strains which are more dangerous than Omicron. He also rubbished the “rosy misconception” that virus evolve and become benign over time, noting that there is no predestined evolutionary outcome for the same.The virologist then went on to list steps, which he said are “immediately needed”. The first such step is setting aside lazy optimism. Then, he said that authorities must be realistic about the likely levels of death, disability and sickness taking into account the new and emerging variants. And the third step listed by Katzourakis talks about using vaccines, diagnostic tests and following Covid protocols like wearing masks, social distancing etc.“The more a virus replicates, the greater the chance that problematic variants will arise, most probably where spread is highest,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-endemic-doesn-t-mean-life-can-return-to-normal-says-virologist-101643162518852.html
26-01-2022||World||Netherlands eases Covid-19 lockdown despite spike in cases||Prime Minister Mark Rutte further eased the Netherlands' coronavirus lockdown, allowing bars, restaurants, museums, theaters and other venues to reopen from Wednesday for the first time this year.But Rutte warned that the move wasn't without risks.“We are taking a big step today to unlock the Netherlands while the infections numbers are really going through the roof,” Rutte said Tuesday.The announcement wasn't all good news for the beleaguered hospitality and cultural sectors, with the opening hours limited to 10 p.m., while professional sports teams will only be allowed to fill stadiums to a third of their normal capacities.Soccer clubs and administrators protested the move even before it was officially announced, calling it in a joint statement “a proposal without perspective.”The relaxation of restrictions follows widespread protests in recent weeks by business owners ranging from the Van Gogh Museum to local cafes at being excluded from am earlier easing of pandemic restrictions.Infections have spiked in recent weeks because of the omicron variant, despite the lockdown that was tougher than in most of Europe, but admissions to the country's intensive care units have been declining. The national public health institute reported a 51% rise in new Covid-19 cases over the last week to more than 366,000, while ICU admissions dropped by 34%.“We are taking another risk," Health Minister Ernst Kuipers said. "We are doing that for good reason. Living longer with many restrictive measures damages our health and our society.”Omicron is less likely to cause severe illness than the previous delta variant, according to studies. Omicron spreads even more easily than other coronavirus strains, and has already become dominant in many countries. It also more easily infects those who have been vaccinated or had previously been infected by prior versions of the virus.The Dutch government sought to mitigate the risk by imposing restrictions on venues where people gather, including the use of coronavirus passports and social distancing and capping the number of people allowed indoors and in stadiums.The new measures apply for six weeks, but Rutte said the government would review them and their effect on infection numbers after three weeks.He urged the public to stick to the rules, saying: “It is now up to us all to ensure that we don't have to hit the brakes again then."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netherlands-eases-covid-19-lockdown-despite-spike-in-cases-101643161719764.html
26-01-2022||World||Ukraine Russia tension: Biden threatens Putin with personal sanctions||The United States warned Moscow on Tuesday of damaging sanctions, including measures personally targeting Vladimir Putin, as Russian combat troops massing around Ukraine launched new exercises.Tension appeared to be increasing, with the White House saying the risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine "remains imminent."Warning that would prompt "enormous consequences" and even "change the world," President Joe Biden said he would consider adding direct sanctions on Putin to a raft of measures being drawn up."Yes. I would see that," Biden said when asked by reporters in Washington about targeting Putin, whom opponents have long accused of holding gigantic, secret wealth.A senior US official laid out economic sanctions "with massive consequences" that go far beyond previous measures implemented in 2014 after Russia invaded Ukraine's Crimea region.New measures would include restrictions on exports of high-tech US equipment in the artificial intelligence, quantum computing and aerospace sectors, the official told reporters on condition of anonymity."What we're talking about are sophisticated technologies that we design and produce," and cutting them off would hit Putin's "strategic ambitions to industrialize his economy quite hard," the official said.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson echoed the threat, saying sanctions would be "heavier than anything we've ever done."French President Emmanuel Macron said he would talk by telephone with Putin on Friday, seeking "clarification" on Moscow's intentions.New Russian military exercisesA day after Washington said it was putting 8,500 US troops on alert for possible deployment to bolster NATO forces in Europe, the Russian military announced it was conducting new drills involving 6,000 troops near Ukraine and within the Crimea region.The drills included firing exercises with fighter jets, bombers, anti-aircraft systems and ships from the Black Sea and Caspian fleets, the defense ministry said.According to Western officials, the Kremlin has already deployed more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders, with reinforcements arriving from all over Russia."We continue to watch the accumulation of significant combat power," Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.Washington also warned Russia ally Belarus that its authoritarian government would "face a swift and decisive response" if it helps Moscow invade Ukraine."If an invasion were to proceed from Belarus, if Russian troops were to permanently station on their territory, NATO could well have to reassess our own force posture in the countries that border Belarus," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.The United States and its EU allies accuse Russia of seeking to upend European stability by threatening invasion of Ukraine, a former Soviet republic striving to join NATO and other Western institutions.Moscow denies plans to invade the country, where in addition to seizing Crimea, it backs separatist forces in the east.Russia instead blames the West for the tension and has put forward a list of demands, including a guarantee that Ukraine never join NATO and that NATO forces already in the former Soviet bloc pull back.Energy threatsThe senior US official said "contingency" plans were being drawn up to get Europe through the winter in case of Russia squeezing energy supplies.Washington and its European allies are scouring global markets for alternative energy sources, even as Europe already struggles with soaring mid-winter energy prices."If Russia decides to weaponize its supply of natural gas or crude oil, it wouldn't be without consequences to the Russian economy," the US official told reporters.Although the European Union sources about 40 percent of its supply from Russia, Moscow also relies heavily on sales of energy, meaning "it's an interdependency," the official said.Negotiating attemptsNegotiations this month have failed to ease tensions, though Washington and Moscow have agreed to keep talking.In addition to the Macron-Putin talks later, the French government said Russian and Ukrainian officials would meet, along with French and German counterparts, in Paris on Wednesday.Washington has promised written answers to Moscow's demands this week, while already making clear that it rejects giving Russia a veto on Ukraine joining NATO.But the crisis has laid bare divisions in the West.The new government in Germany has faced criticism from Kyiv over its refusal to send defensive weapons to Ukraine, as well as hesitating over one of the harshest economic sanctions under discussion -- cutting Moscow from the global SWIFT payments system.Ukraine's military is heavily outgunned by Russia and Biden repeated that he has "no intention of putting American forces or NATO forces in Ukraine."However, the United States has stepped up deliveries of weapons. A shipment arrived on Saturday and another batch was due Tuesday.At a ceremony for the latest shipment arriving in Kyiv, US charge d'affaires Kristina Kvien said "our preference is diplomacy."But in case of attack by Russia, "the Kremlin will face fierce resistance, the losses to Russia will be heavy.""If President Putin decides to make this reckless choice, we will provide additional defensive material to the Ukrainians above and beyond what we've already sent," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-russia-tension-biden-threatens-putin-with-personal-sanctions-101643151894242.html
26-01-2022||World||Group preparing attacks dismantled, says Ukraine||Ukraine said on Tuesday it had dismantled saboteurs controlled by Moscow who were preparing a series of attacks in Ukraine’s border regions to “destabilise” the situation in the ex-Soviet country.The men were planning a “series of armed attacks” on city infrastructure, Ukraine’s security service SBU said in a statement, adding that the group was “coordinated by Russian special services”.The SBU said it arrested two residents of Ukraine, one of them a Russian citizen, and seized “an explosive device, small arms and ammunition”.The two acted in Kharkiv, a city with one million people located near the Russian border in the east, and in the town of Zhytomyr in central Ukraine.Under the pretext of recruiting personnel for a private security firm they got people to join them, the SBU added.A source in law enforcement told AFP that both men were former commandos with combat experience and were recruiting “mainly” Russians who had already committed violent crimes. Kiev and the West accuse Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border in preparation for a possible invasion as well as of seeking to destabilise the situation inside Ukraine.Ukrainian defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov played down the prospect of a full-scale invasion by the Russian military and reinforced the view from officials in Kiev that the nation’s security challenge hasn’t changed significantly since 2014.“The aggression continues since 2014 - the facts are the same, but the assessment of these facts is different,” Reznikov told reporters on Tuesday, citing international media coverage. Still, the shift is giving Ukraine the chance to benefit from greater military assistance, he said.US puts troops on alertWestern allies are pushing ahead with diplomatic efforts to avert war between Russia and Ukraine, though the Kremlin warned on Tuesday that a US decision to put as many as 8,500 troops on alert for deployment in Eastern Europe “exacerbates tensions”.The US troop move “exacerbates tensions” and Russia is monitoring the situation “with great concern”, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.Russia still expects to receive written US responses to its security demands this week, after which it will decide on prospects for future diplomacy, Peskov told reporters.Among other things, Russia is demanding that Nato pull back military infrastructure from its periphery, something the alliance has so far refused to do.The US is coordinating with the EU and Nato on its written response to Russia’s demands about Nato and Ukraine, according to an EU official who asked not to be identified.The reply is unlikely to be a detailed discussion of those requirements, the official said, but will set out areas where western allies believe they can address Russian concerns, as well as Russian actions that are alarming to Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/group-preparing-attacks-dismantled-says-ukraine-101643151351224.html
26-01-2022||World||Unicef laments education losses||School closures due to the Covid pandemic have caused “nearly insurmountable” losses in education among children around the world, Unicef said on Monday.More than 616 million students are still being affected by full or partial school closures, the UN children’s agency said.School closures due to the Covid pandemic have caused “nearly insurmountable” losses in education among children around the world, Unicef said on Monday.More than 616 million students are still being affected by full or partial school closures, the UN children’s agency said.|#+|In many countries, in addition to depriving millions of children of the chance to acquire basic skills, these disruptions have affected students’ mental health, put them at greater risk of abuse and prevented many from having access to “a regular source of nutrition”, Unicef added.“Quite simply, we are looking at a nearly insurmountable scale of loss to children’s schooling,” said Unicef chief of education Robert Jenkins in a statement.And “just reopening schools is not enough”, he added, calling for “intensive support to recover lost education”.Unicef reported that “learning losses to school closures have left up to 70% of 10-year-olds unable to read or understand a simple text, up from 53% pre-pandemic” in countries with low and middle income.In Ethiopia, for example, children learned only “between 30 to 40% of the math they would have learned if it had been a normal school year” in primary school, the UN agency estimated.Rich countries are far from being spared. In the US, learning losses have been observed in several states, including Texas, California and Maryland, said Unicef. School drop-outs are also a problem: in South Africa, between 400,000 and 500,000 students “reportedly dropped out of school altogether between March 2020 and July 2021”.Finally, in addition to rising levels of anxiety and depression among children and young people linked to the pandemic, school closures also meant more than 370 million children globally did not get school meals, “losing what is for some children the only reliable source of food and daily nutrition”.Israeli panel advises 4th vaccine dose for adultsAn expert panel on Tuesday advised the Israeli government to begin offering a fourth vaccine dose to everyone over the age of 18, citing research showing it helps prevent Covid-19 infection and severe illness.The advisory committee said research shows a fourth dose provides three to five times the level of protection against serious disease and double the protection against infection compared to three doses.Hong Kong expanded a partial lockdown and tightened pandemic restrictions on Tuesday after more than 200 cases of Covid-19 were discovered at a public housing estate.Nearly two dozen sailors on an Australian military ship going to deliver aid to Tonga have tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said on Tuesday, raising fears they could bring Covid-19 to a Pacific nation that has so far managed to avoid any outbreaks.The Australian government was working with Tongan authorities to keep the ship at sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unicef-laments-education-losses-101643151023419.html
26-01-2022||World||IMF trims global growth forecast; expects India’s financial sector to do better||Global economic growth will dip from 5.9% in 2021 to 4.4% in 2022, half a percentage point less than it estimated just three months ago, and 3.8% in 2023, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) noted in its World Economic Outlook released on Tuesday.The Fund estimates that India will grow at 9% in 2021-2022 – it estimated India’s growth prospects at 9.5% for the year in its October 2021 assessment; projects 9% growth for the Indian economy in 2022-23 – in its October assessment, this was pegged at 8.5%; and 7.1% in 2023-24.“India’s prospects for 2023 are marked up on expected improvements to credit growth – and subsequently investment and consumption – building on better-than-anticipated performance of the financial sector,” the report noted.But the Fund’s prognosis for the global economy is grim. “As the new Omicron Covid-19 variant spreads, countries have reimposed mobility restrictions. Rising energy prices and supply disruptions have resulted in a higher and more broad-based inflation than anticipated, notably in the United States and many emerging market and developing economies. The ongoing retrenchment of China’s real estate sector and slower-than-expected recovery of private consumption have also have limited growth prospects,” the report notes. Earlier this month, the World Bank too had predicted a slowdown in a global growth, pegging it at 4.1% in 2022.The dip in its projections for global growth are largely driven by the Fund’s assessment of economic prospects in the US and China. The report noted that removing the Build Back Better policy (a Joe Biden initiative that is stuck in Congress) from the baseline, earlier withdrawal of monetary accommodation, and continued supply shortages produced a downward revision of 1.2 percentage points for growth in US in 2022 – now pegged at 4%. “In China, pandemic-induced disruptions related to zero-tolerance Covid policy and protracted financial stress among property developers have induced a 0.8 percentage point downgrade.”IMF believes that elevated inflation will stay longer than assumed, and will wane off only in 2022 as “supply side imbalances wane and monetary policy in major economies responds”.The outlook, however, is clear on the risks to the global economy – pointing to the possibility of the emergence of new Covid-19 variants, renewed economic disruptions, supply chain disruptions, energy price volatility, and localised wage pressures.“As advanced economies lift policy rates, risks to financial stability and emerging markets and developing economies’ capital rates, currencies and fiscal positions – especially with debt levels having increased significantly in the last two years – may emerge.”The Fund also alluded to the possibility of geopolitical tensions (the US and Russia are locked in a bitter dispute over Ukraine) and the ongoing climate emergency as other risks.In a blog on the IMF’s assessment, Gita Gopinath, the Fund’s first deputy managing director, also flagged the dangers of uneven recovery. “The troubling divergence in prospects across countries persists. While advanced economies are projected to return to pre-pandemic trend this year, several emerging markets and developing economies are projected to have sizeable output losses in the medium-term. The number of people living in extreme poverty is estimated to have been around 70 million higher than pre-pandemic trends in 2021, setting back the progress in poverty reduction by several years.”The report bats for worldwide access to vaccine, tests and treatments, which entails “increased production of supplies, better in-country delivery systems and fairer international distribution”.Monetary policy, IMF recommends, will need to tighten in many economies to curb inflationary pressures; fiscal policy, it says, will need to prioritise health and social spending and the worst-affected. “In this context, international cooperation will be essential to preserve access to liquidity and expedite orderly debt restructurings when needed.”
26-01-2022||World||Thich Nhat Hanh (1926-2022): The mindful monk had said, ‘Walk as if you are kissing the Earth with your feet’||After dedicating a lifetime to promote peace and compassion in the world, author, activist and Zen Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh left the planet for his heavenly abode, on Friday.The news that was shared on his Twitter account, on Saturday morning, read: “The International Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism announces that our beloved teacher Thich Nhat Hanh passed away peacefully at Từ Hiếu Temple in Huế, Vietnam, at 00:00hrs on 22nd January, 2022, at the age of 95.” The community also posted a link to the live streaming of the transition ceremony held by Deer Park Monastery, which is a mindfulness practice and monastic training centre founded by Hanh in California, USA.Known as the Father of Mindfulness, he was born as Nguyen Xuan Bao in 1926. Ordained as a monk at the age of 16, he is now remembered fondly as one who introduced the concept of mindfulness to the West. Hanh also authored more than hundred books, including The Miracle of Mindfulness and Peace Is Every Step. He was fluent in speaking seven languages, and caught the attention of many, the world over, after he delivered lectures at the Princeton and Columbia universities, in the early 1960s. “I met him in 1987, and he transformed my life,” says Shantum Seth, an ordained Dharmacharya (dharma teacher), in the Buddhist mindfulness lineage of the Zen Master. Seth shares, “For me, he was a living Buddha. He was an awakened man, trying to bring the age old teachings in a way that they are relevant to us now. He empowered us to continue on this path of awakening, and taught us throughout his life, how to overcome the concept of birth and death. Like he used to say in his words, ‘The cloud never dies... it might transform into rain or snow’; we too have to look at him from a different eye now.” During the Vietnam War in the 1960s, Hanh had met civil rights leader Martin Luther King in the US, and also persuaded him to speak against the conflict. Subsequently, King nominated the monk for Nobel Peace Prize, describing him as, “an apostle of peace and non violence.” After opposing the war, Hanh was exiled from Vietnam, and he spread his teachings on peace and Buddhism outside his country, and soon became only second to the Dalai Lama. On receiving the news of his death, Seth says, “It’s like our spiritual father has passed away. With him there’s associated an energy of recommitment and practise of Buddhism, but not as a religion... He was never a guru, and told us ‘You have to be your own teacher’. In such moment of poignancy in our lives, one can light a candle in the heart to pay respect to him.” Authors tweet @HennaRakheja and @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thich-nhat-hanh-1926-2022-the-mindful-monk-had-said-walk-as-if-you-are-kissing-the-earth-with-your-feet-101642849424865.html
26-01-2022||India||Iran foreign minister Abdollahian to visit India next week||NEW DELHI: Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian is set to visit India next week for discussions that are expected to focus on the situation in West Asia and Afghanistan and regional connectivity, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. A planned trip to India by Abdollahian last November was put off for various reasons and this will be his first visit to India since he assumed office last year. He is expected to hold talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar on January 31 before travelling to Sri Lanka. Ahead of the visit, Abdollahian greeted Jaishankar and the people of India on India’s Republic Day and said in a tweet that Iran will “continue to work towards further expansion of all-out relations, bilaterally, regionally and at international fora”. Jaishankar responded by tweeting that he was looking forward to his Iranian counterpart’s visit. Two key issues that are expected to figure in Abdollahian’s interactions in New Delhi are the situation in Afghanistan, especially the urgent need for humanitarian assistance, and measures to boost the development and use of Iran’s Chabahar port, the people cited above said. The Indian side has been considering the option of using Chabahar to ship wheat and other essential items to Afghanistan in light of Pakistan’s reluctance to allow the use of land routes passing through its territory for transporting humanitarian aid. Though India proposed using the Wagah land border crossing to send 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan in October last year, shipments via this route are yet to start. During a phone conversation with Jaishankar on January 8, Abdollahian said Iran will cooperate with India in shipping humanitarian aid, including wheat and medicines, to Afghanistan, and also stressed the need for an inclusive government in Kabul. Jaishankar also said in a tweet that he and Abdollahian had discussed the difficulties the challenges in Afghanistan and “prospects of Chabahar”. Iran’s top national security official participated in the Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan hosted by India last November, reflecting the growing convergence between the two countries on the situation in Afghanistan. Abdollahian is also expected to discuss the Iranian nuclear issue while in New Delhi. Iran and the US have held indirect talks on the issue for almost two months amid hopes of a breakthrough despite persisting differences. The US and European allies said last week there were just weeks to salvage the 2015 Iran nuclear deal or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Iran is also engaged in direct talks on the nuclear issue with the “P4+1”, or Germany and permanent UN Security Council members France, China, the UK and Russia. India has consistently backed a negotiated settlement of the issue. India has been pressed to strike a balance between Iran and other key players in West Asia such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, especially in the wake of drone and missile attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on Abu Dhabi. Two Indians were killed in a recent attack, which Jaishankar condemned as a terrorist incident. Seven Indian crew members of a merchant vessel seized by the rebels are currently in the custody of the Houthis. Several reports have suggested that the drones and missiles used by the Houthis were supplied by Iran. 
26-01-2022||India||HT This Day: January 27, 2001 -- Independent India’s worst quake kills at least 1,500||RESCUERS, many of them with bare hands, cleared rubble under floodlights this evening in a desperate race to reach buried survivors of a massive earthquake that killed at least 1,500 people. It was the most intense quake in the history of Independent India, dwarfing Latur (6 on the Richter in 1993) and Uttarkashi (6.6 on the Richter in 1999). The tremor, measuring between 6.9 and 7.9 on the Richter scale, hit many parts of Gujarat at 8.46 am and was felt across India as well as neighbouring Pakistan and Nepal. The devastation in Ahmedabad was widespread, with hundreds of buildings that had simply folded in on themselves when the quake struck. The Army and the Air Force joined the civil administration in relief work. Some 4,000 CISF personnel too were drafted for rescue operations.Ahmedabad was the worst hit. More than 12 hours after the first rumblings were heard, thousands of people were camping in the open, fearing aftershocks.In the concrete jungle of western Ahmedabad, multi-storeyed buildings that have come up in the last few years were clearly hit the hardest. In Ahmedabad city alone, nearly 80 buildings are reported to have collapsed, including about a dozen multi-storey buildings and also some buildings still under construction. Seismologists recorded more than 80 aftershocks, one of which measured 5.6 on the Richter scale. The epicentre of the quake was 20 km north-east of Bhuj in Kutch district. Around 150 people were killed in a single building collapse in Bhuj. Tremors were felt across a vast swathe of central and northern India, in New Delhi and Mumbai, as well as Chennai and Pondicherry and in Calcutta. In Pakistan at least four people were killed as the quake rocked four major cities - Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Hyderabad. Describing the earthquake as “a calamity of national magnitude”, Prime Minister Vajpayee, appealed to voluntary organisations to help the government in rescue, relief and rehabilitation operations. Oil production in ONGC wells in Gujarat was disrupted for four hours and some ONGC buildings developed cracks, but major installations and equipment were intact, officials said. While some buildings in the Essar steel complex at Hazira were damaged due to the tremors, a spokesman said the quake did not cause any disruption in operations and production at the steel manufacturing facility. The Reliance petrochemical complex at Hazira and the 27 million tonne refinery in Jamnagar did not suffer due to the quake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthis-day-january-27-2001-independent-india-s-worst-quake-kills-at-least-1500-101643216087095.html

It was also the capital of the Vajji mahajanapada that was later occupied by King Bimbisara’s son Ajatashatru.“True sense of democracy used to be depicted in the then people’s life and philosophy during India’s ancient Ganarajyas. Today’s Indian democracy must be glorified with the sense of democratic system of India’s ancient Ganarajyas like, Baishali, Lichhabi etc. The sangh is committed to set up democracy in true sense through dignified behaviour and by applying the practiced philosophy of ancient Ganarajyas, like Baishali and Lichhabi, “ Bhagwat said during his address at Seva Dham, an RSS ashrama at Khayerpur, a few kilometres away from Agartala, where he hoisted the national tricolour.Bhagwat has been staying at the ashrama since Monday to review organizational activities.While explaining importance of the tricolour, Bhagwat said that the saffron colour symbolises courage, zeal and sacrifice which could be visible in the life of ancient Indian Kings and freedom fighters.The green colour symbolises progress while the dharmachakra in the middle of the flag symbolises socio-cultural philosophy practiced by people of the country, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-democracy-must-be-glorified-like-ancient-ganarajyas-rss-chief-101643211646846.html

26-01-2022||India||World leaders greet India on Republic Day, pledge to strengthen ties||NEW DELHI: Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina were among the world leaders who greeted the Indian government on Republic Day and pledged to strengthen bilateral ties and cooperation in diverse areas. In a brief video message, Morrison noted that India’s Republic Day celebrations coincided with Australia Day and said that the journeys of the two nations have been very different but “we do share much in common, in particular, a common road ahead”. He said the two sides have a shared vision for “an open and resilient and free Indo-Pacific region”, and are partners on many fronts, working together to “secure peace and freedom for our world and our region”. Morrison added: “We share a wonderful friendship between the Australian and Indian peoples. We join with you in celebrating democracy today, India’s and ours too, in celebrating the fantastic contribution of people with Indian heritage right here in Australia and all around the world.” Johnson said in a special message that the UK and India are “tied by deep bonds that span through the generations and across some of the greatest modern day challenges we have faced”. While sending his best wishes to the people of India and to all British Indians in the UK, Johnson spoke of the UK’s plans to forge stronger ties in future. He said: “As two diverse democracies, I am proud of our strong friendship, demonstrated by the launch of free trade negotiations this month and our partnership manufacturing the Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccine. I look forward to fortifying those bonds as we bring our ambitions, people and economies together to prosper for the next 75 years and beyond.” In a message sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Hasina referred to the special relationship between India and Bangladesh and said: “The unique ties of close friendship, cooperation and trust between our two countries have flourished and grown from strength to strength in recent years. Many new frontiers of cooperation alongside all traditional areas have been identified, particularly during the Covid-l9 pandemic.” Extending her warmest wishes and heartiest felicitations to the people of India, Hasina said 2021 was a historic year for bilateral relations as it was marked by celebrations of “epochal events” and engagements at the highest levels. She recalled Modi’s visit to Dhaka in March 2021 to join celebrations marking the golden jubilee of Bangladesh’s independence, the birth centenary of the father of the nation, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and 50 years of diplomatic ties. “I take the opportunity to recall with gratitude the support rendered by the Government and the People of India during our Liberation War in 1971 that set the foundation of our unique relationship. The joint celebration of ‘Moitri Dibosh’ across the globe, held on 6th December, the day when India recognised Bangladesh as a sovereign and independent state in 1971, projected this special relationship,” she added. Bangladesh looks forward to working with India “in the next fifty years and beyond towards realising the shared vision of building a peaceful and prosperous region”, Hasina said. Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid also sent a message of greetings to his Indian counterpart Ram Nath Kovind, saying his country’s “unique relationship with India is rooted in our shared history, culture and tradition”. In a brief video message, Maldivian foreign minister Abdulla Shahid sent his greetings to the Indian people and said: “For 73 years, the Constitution of India has provided a framework of governance and guaranteed rights to over a billion people comprising the world’s largest democracy. This monumental achievement provides inspiration and hope to countries all over the world undertaking their own democratic journeys.” The strong partnership between India and the Maldives is rooted in long-standing historical ties and has been strengthened through bilateral cooperation, and the many gestures of goodwill, humanitarian aid and friendship provided by India is a “true testament to the special partnership between the Maldives and India”, he said. Shahid added: “The government of the Maldives appreciates India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy and we will continue to uphold an ‘India First’ policy, which has worked to the mutual benefit of both our countries.”

Baghel, while addressing people after unfurling the national flag at Lalbagh Parade grounds in Bastar’s Jagdalpur on the occasion of 73rd Republic Day celebration, said that the aim of the scheme is to empower women. “Mukhyamantri Noni Sashaktikaran Sahayata Yojna’ (Chief Minister Girl Empowerment Assistance Scheme) will be launched in the state to support the daughters of labourer families in education, employment, self-employment and marriage,” a press release issued by Chhattisgarh’s public relation department said.

26-01-2022||India||Cops thwart right-wing workers’ attempt to unfurl national flag on Jinnah Tower||HYDERABAD: The police in Andhra Pradesh’s Guntur thwarted the attempt of some right-wing activists to unfurl the national flag on Jinnah Tower, a landmark in the city, on Wednesday. Tension prevailed at Jinnah Circle, located on the busy Mahatma Gandhi Road, when about 10 activists of Hindu Vahini, raising Jai Bharat Mata slogans, came there and made an attempt to enter the premises of Jinnah Tower to unfurl the national flag on the occasion of Republic Day. However, the police, deployed at the centre in large numbers, immediately took them into custody and shifted them to the local police station. They were released later in the evening. According to a local resident Shyam Sunder, the Guntur Municipal Corporation has already erected barbed wire fencing around Jinnah Tower, after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president Somu Veerraju announced on December 30 that Jinnah Tower would be razed to the ground and the area would be renamed after former President of India A P J Abdul Kalam or noted Dalit poet Gurram Joshua. The Jinnah Tower is a tall monument built in 1945 in the heart of Guntur town. It was constructed as a tower with six pillars with a dome-shaped structure atop and is being considered a symbol of harmony and peace. The location is also referred to as Jinnah Centre. Now, the BJP leaders started demanding that the state government remove the name “Jinnah” from the monument and the location, as it symbolised the name of a person who was responsible for the partition of India. 
26-01-2022||India||Railways' exams suspended amid violent protests: All you need to know||The railways ministry on Wednesday suspended non-technical popular categories (RRB-NTPC) and level 2 exams amid violent protests by aspirants, including setting a bogie of the Bhabua-Patna Intercity Express on fire earlier in the day, over alleged irregularities in examinations of the Railway Recruitment Board (RRB).The candidates are opposing the ministry's decision to hold the exam in two stages, claiming the second stage for final selection is tantamount to “cheating” those who appeared and cleared the first stage of the RRB-NTPC exam for a computer-based test which was released on January 15.Around 1.25 crore candidates had appeared for the exams for 35,000 posts from level 2 to level 6.Why are the aspirants protesting?According to reports, many of the protesters claimed the recruitment process is “unfair”, allowing candidates with higher qualifications to compete for jobs meant for those with relatively lower qualifications.The aspirants have also alleged discrepancies in the examination results, which reportedly showed that one candidate had been declared qualified from multiple regions when according to the official rules, one candidate is allowed to qualify from only one region.Of the total vacancies, 24,281 posts are open to graduates, 11,000 are for under-graduates. These posts are segregated into five groups based on the 7th CPC pay-scale levels (levels 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).These include posts of train assistant, guard, junior clerk, timekeeper, and station master across various verticals in its zones.While to get a level-2 job, where the starting pay is about ₹19,000, one requires to be a Class 12 pass, for a level-6 post like that of the station master, who gets a starting pay of about ₹35,000, being a graduate is mandatory.Aspirants have alleged that during the computer-based test -1 which was held last year, candidates with higher qualifications have sat for exams meant for level-2 jobs.Extent of protestsA crowd stormed the Gaya Junction on Wednesday, raising slogans, and set fire to the Bhabhua-Patna InterCity Express, though nobody was injured.Officials said in Sitamarhi, police fired in the air to disperse demonstrators at the railway station. Protests were also reported from Patna, Nawada, Muzaffarpur, Buxar, and Bhojpur districts.On Tuesday, students who appeared for the RRB non-technical popular categories exam, 2021, held a protest at the Bihar Sharif railway station alleging discrepancies in the results. Hundreds of students had blocked the Kolkata-New Delhi main railway line at Rajendra Nagar Terminal in Patna during the agitation.The central government has said such protests on tracks and disruption of train operations will now be categorised under “unlawful activities” that may get one banned for life from obtaining railway jobs.What is the government's response?The railways ministry has said no candidate can be recruited for multiple posts, thereby ensuring that every deserving candidate gets selected."We cannot legally bar graduates from applying to posts which require 10+2 qualifications," said railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.He said shortlisting of candidates has been done separately for each level based on options exercised and the educational qualifications of the candidates.“For the second stage computer-based test of each level, candidates have been called 20 times for the community-wise vacancies notified against each RRB,” the minister said.What next?Based on merit obtained in second stage CBT, the candidates will be shortlisted for the third stage exam in which eight times the number of vacancies will be called.The final result will contain a unique list of 35,281 notified vacancies and no candidate will be appointed against more than one post.Earlier, the shortlisting was done 10 times the vacancy. However, this time, it is 20 times the vacancy for the second stage, officials said.According to the RRB NTPC exam dates, the CBT 2 exam for which seven lakh candidates have been shortlisted, was scheduled to be conducted on February 14 and 18. They now stand suspended. (With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-exams-suspended-amid-violent-protests-all-you-need-to-know-101643202957235.html
26-01-2022||India||MP police recover two time bomb-like devices from National Highway-30||BHOPAL/PRAYAGRAJ: The Madhya Pradesh police on Wednesday recovered two time bomb-like devices on the walls of two under-passes at a distance of 15 kms on National Highway-30 in Rewa district, causing panic among the locals. The spots where the devices were found are close to Prayagraj border. A letter addressed to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath was found with the devices in which Prayagraj police is challenged to stop him. Police officials believe that the fake bomb attached with a clock has been placed by the same man who has been placing such devices in trans-Yamuna areas of Prayagraj earlier. SP Rewa Navneet Bhaseen said the force reached the over bridge at Mangawa in Rewa district after receiving information about the bomb-like device from locals. The traffic was diverted and Bomb Disposal Squad was called. The BDS team dismantled the device but no explosive was found in it. “The locals informed the police about the suspicious device. The bomb disposal squad (BDS) recovered the first device having circuits like a time bomb in Manganwa area on Wednesday morning. The second device was found 15 km in Gangave area of the district. A lady police inspector threw it into an agricultural land and poured water to defuse it. Both the devices have circuits but no explosive was found near it,” the SP said. He added both the devices had a letter addressed to UP CM Yogi Adityanath but the message was not very clear. In the letters, the miscreant wrote, “CM of UP (Yogiji) Ruk Sakta Hai, Baki Jankar, 8/1/2022 bottle bomb se Prayagraj police, car bus jalega (sic).” Investigations revealed that wires were wrapped in some bottles and a clock was fitted into them to make it appear like an IED (Improvised Explosive Device). A case has been registered in this connection and help of CCTV footages and mobile surveillance is being taken to identify the person who placed the device, the SP said. “It will be premature to say anything about purpose because we are still investigating the matter,” he added. A similar device was found in Sohagi area in Rewa four days back. SSP Prayagraj Ajay Kumar said the place where the fake bomb is found is under jurisdiction of Rewa police. However, SSP said that it may be the handiwork of the same man who has been placing such devices in trans-Yamuna areas earlier, SSP added. Since 2016, the person has placed over a dozen fake bombs which he has made using bottles, plastic box, wires, red tapes, clocks and has even used wooden stick and even a corn. The culprit attaches the bottles or plastic box with wires and fastens it with red tape to make it appear like an IED. In some old incidents, he has also attached clock in the fake device. Each time the culprit places the fake bomb, he attaches a letter written in poor English. In most of the letters, he has issued threats to railway officials and has demanded hefty amount of cash from them. However, in two of the letters found earlier in Naini and Minto Park, he has also issued threats to authorities of ALSTOM company in Naini area and has demanded large amount of money from them||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/time-bomb-like-devices-found-in-mp-with-letter-to-up-cm-yogi-adityanath-101643204386197.html
26-01-2022||India||Goa: Pratapsingh Rane keeps everyone guessing as poll date looms||PANAJI: Senior Congress leader and former Goa chief minister Pratapsingh Rane continues to keep his cards close to his chest as he weighs up whether to contest in the upcoming assembly elections. The six-time chief minister, who has famously never lost an election, will be up against his daughter-in-law Divya Rane, who has been announced as the BJP candidate for Poriem, a constituency that the senior Rane has represented since 1972 back when Goa was still a Union Territory and the constituency was called Satari. “We will see. There are still two days to file nominations,” Rane told HT when asked whether he has made up his mind on whether he is contesting elections or not. Pratapsingh Rane, a 10-term legislator, is Goa’s longest serving MLA. He also holds a record for having served as chief minister of the state for a little less than 16 years across six terms between 1980 and 2007. He was the assembly speaker between 2007 and 2012. He has been continuously elected since 1972 to the then legislative assembly of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu. The 82-year-old Rane has made a series of flip flops on whether he will be contesting the elections. After he initially announced that he would be contesting the upcoming elections, following the ‘requests’ of his workers and supporters, the Congress promptly announced that Rane would be the party’s candidate from the Poriem constituency. His decision was met with derision by his son Vishwajit Rane, a minister in the BJP government and legislator representing the neighbouring Valpoi constituency. Vishwajit, who is nurturing dreams of his wife getting elected from the seat represented by his father, quite unkindly, suggested that his father should “retire gracefully”, and even threatened that the situation can get quite “messy”. “At 83, why does he have to continue in politics? One should gracefully retire after becoming a CM for more than six terms. A person who is my idol and someone I have so much respect for, that person should gracefully retire, not retire in the battlefield. It will be a very messy thing,” Vishwajit Rane said. Following his son’s outburst, Rane seemed to back down. “I have completed 50 years in politics. I feel I should take it easy now. I feel that way, it is a sincere feeling that I should take it easy and young people should be put forward,” the senior Rane said at the Congress foundation day function. Rane has also been quick to counter BJP leaders every time they have suggested that he was quitting the Congress or that he was retiring from politics or that he has given his ‘consent’ to the BJP to field his daughter-in-law from his seat. Reacting to comments made by BJP Goa election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis, who said that Rane was “approached” and asked to “give the seat to the BJP”, he said: “It is not right. My name is being used; it should not be done. Poriem is not my backyard. This is fake news,” Rane said. Earlier this week, Rane took everyone by surprise after he, along with his wife Vijayadevi, visited a temple in his constituency and began meeting the people there suggesting he had begun campaigning. “I meet people all the time during my visits to the constituency,” Rane said when asked whether his recent moves meant he had begun campaigning. “We have left it to his decision whether he would want to contest himself or nominate someone to contest in his stead,” senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said when asked what the Congress party’s stand is in the ongoing impasse. With two days left for nominations to close, a decision one way or the other will have to be made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-pratapsingh-rane-keeps-everyone-guessing-as-poll-date-looms-101643199345492.html

26-01-2022||India||CVC revises rules for appointing independent external monitors in organizations||NEW DELHI: The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has revised the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for adopting and implementing the Integrity Pact, the first step in ensuring transparency in public procurements. The change in rules say that the Independent External Monitors (IEMs), who are appointed by the apex vigilance body to look into issues relating to execution of contract (s) and any irregularities, can only be considered from a panel of eminent persons/officers who have held the post of additional secretary or equivalent or higher pay scale in the government of India at the time of retirement. Existing rules, last issued in June 2021, only considered officials at the rank of secretary to Government of India, chief secretaries in the states or officials at equivalent pay scale at the time of retirement. The latest SOPs have removed the retired director generals of police from the list of eminent persons who could be considered for empanelment as IEMs. In the new rules, the CVC has removed the provision sub-section (vi) of 5.2, which earlier allowed officers who were in the apex pay scale at the time of the retirement in the central government, state government or forest service to be IEMs. For retired officers of armed officers too, now the officers equivalent to additional secretaries or higher ranks in government of India will be eligible to become IEMs. Earlier, this was allowed only for officers in apex pay scale. Persons who have held the post of CMD/MD or CEO of public sector banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions at the time of retirement will continue to be included in the list of IEMs, an advisory role considered important to examine the process of integrity in award of government contracts. The Integrity Pact (IP), mandatory for all government organisations, public sector enterprises, public sector banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions and autonomous bodies etc, essentially envisages an agreement between the prospective vendors/bidders and the buyer, committing the persons/officials of both sides not to resort to any corrupt practices in any aspect/stage of the contract. After a contract is given in a government organisation, the CVC rules say, the IEMs will have access to all the documents/records pertaining to the contract for which a complaint or issue is raised before them, except the documents having national security implications. The IEMs will examine all complaints received by them and give their recommendations to the chief executive of the organisation. In case of suspicion of serious irregularities requiring legal or administrative action, they are supposed to send a report to the Chief Vigilance Officers (CVOs), the rules state. The CVC has also stated in its SOPs, shared with all departments and ministries on Tuesday, that the proposal for nomination of IEMs in respective organisations should be sent by the concerned department responsible for ensuring implementation of Integrity Pact in the organisation, after taking approval of the competent authority. It said the proposal should be sent within 3 months of completion of tenure of existing IEMs, failing which the CVC itself will nominate IEM (s) on its own from its panel. A senior official said – “the SOPs have been changed after receiving feedback and suggestions from the CVOs of organisations and various other individuals, regarding the eligibility criteria”. Former Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Chairman R S Sharma said adding additional secretary rank officers must have been done to have a larger pool of officers as IEMs. “IEMs play a key role in resolving issues raised by any party regarding any aspect of the tender. They are one step before anyone wants to take legal route.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cvc-revises-rules-for-appointing-independent-external-monitors-in-organizations-101643197065596.html

His name is on the list for the February-March Uttar Pradesh assembly polls.Former Union minister Anand Sharma also congratulated Azad for what he described “well-deserved recognition of his lifelong enriching contribution to public service and Parliamentary democracy”.Shashi Tharoor, another signatory to the letter leader, said it is good to be recognised for one’s public service even by a government of the other side.Another Congress leader Jairam Ramesh took a jibe at Azad while referring to former West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee’s refusal to accept Padma Bhushan. He said it is the right thing to do as “the communist leader (Bhattacharjee) wants to be ‘Azad not Ghulam’”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sibal-takes-swipe-at-congress-as-azad-gets-padma-bhushan-101643194785091.html

Explain why||A recent study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said that antibodies generated by the Omicron of coronavirus can neutralise other strains, including most prevalent Delta variant. This is why, the study further said, there is a need for Omicron specific vaccine strategy."The individuals infected with Omicron have significant immune response which could neutralise not only the Omicron but also the other VOCs including most prevalent Delta variant," a study by ICMR has revealed."This suggests that the immune response induced by the Omicron could effectively neutralise the Delta variant making the re-infection with Delta less likely, thereby displacing the Delta as dominant strain. This emphasizes the need for the Omicron specific vaccine strategy," it further said.The ICMR studied adults from foreign countries and adolescents from India. The research has not yet been reviewed by peers.The researchers studied the response of antibodies in in people who have received two doses of Covid-19 vaccine and compared the results with those who were unvaccinated. All the individuals were infected with the Omicron variant.The new strain was discovered in samples from South Africa in November last year. The scientists were surprised to find more than 30 mutations in Omicron, more than any other strain. They claimed this made Omicron resistant to existing vaccines.Since being detected in South Africa, Omicron has spread across the globe, leading to resurgence in Covid-19 infections. The situation turned particularly bad in the United States and Europe where millions contracted the disease in a matter of few weeks.The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared Omicron has ‘variant of concern’ and called for investing more resources in studying the variant and finding vaccines for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-scientists-say-omicron-specific-vaccine-strategy-needed-explain-why-101643190126385.html

26-01-2022||India||Republic Day: Aviation ministry tableau highlights UDAN amid push to expand it||NEW DELHI: The civil aviation ministry’s tableau at the Republic Day parade highlighted the ‘Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN)’ scheme amid a push for starting international flights this year under the regional connectivity programme. As many as 403 flights connect 65 underserved airports under the scheme and over eight million people have benefitted from UDAN.The government invited bids for international flights in late 2018 under the scheme but it was forced to halt the process due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which hit the aviation industry globally. The pandemic also led to the suspension of scheduled commercial international passenger flights.The process to take the UDAN scheme beyond the country’s borders has now resumed. The government has received a favourable response as well, said a civil aviation ministry official. “Earlier the tender process was halted due to Covid-19 and uncertainty of international operations. The last date for submitting bids in the current bidding process is January 28. We expect the process to be completed soon,” he said, requesting anonymity.Officials from the Airports Authority of India (AAI), the implementing agency for the scheme, said initial queries from the interested airlines have been addressed and the process was completed this week.“Airlines and states have expressed interest to connect a few international airports which have facilities but are not connected to destinations abroad,” an AAI official said, requesting anonymity.Civil aviation ministry officials said budget carriers IndiGo and SpiceJet have submitted expressions of interest and they are seeking to connect Guwahati with Bangkok, Kathmandu, Yangon, Hanoi; Imphal with Mandalay, Bangkok, Kunming; Bhubaneswar with Bangkok, Abu Dhabi, Singapore, and Agartala with Dhaka and Chittagong.The Centre in October 2018 invited proposals from operators for the international version of the scheme as it sought to enhance air connectivity from India. It finalised bids for the Guwahati-Dhaka and Guwahati-Bangkok routes before the pandemic.Assam has proposed subsidised international connectivity under the UDAN scheme from Guwahati to Singapore, Dhaka, Yangon, Kathmandu, Kuala Lumpur, and Bangkok.Mark Martin, chief executive of aviation consulting firm Martin Consulting, said the concept is like old wine in a new bottle. “We have bilateral (agreements) which allow us to fly anytime. I do not get the concept of international UDAN.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/republic-day-aviation-ministry-tableau-focusses-on-udan-amid-push-to-expand-it-101643182663789.html

26-01-2022||India||Republic Day: No ‘At Home’ ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan||NEW DELHI: There will be no “At Home” ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan possibly for the first time since the Republic Day celebrations started. Officials said they could not say for certain that this was unprecedented but it was “likely”.“I cannot say about history but yes this is the first of its kind due to the pandemic,” said Ajay Singh, the press secretary to the President. A second official added they have not checked Rashtrapati Bhavan records but they could not recall any other such instance.President Ram Nath Kovind held the “At Home” reception for the Prime Minister, his council of ministers, and top officials after the Independence Day and Republic Day celebrations last year. But only 100 guests were invited while traditionally the guest list has gone up to 2,000 people.The ceremony has been a key feature of both Republic Day and Independence Day celebrations. This year, even a limited guest list was deemed unfeasible in view of the Omicron-driven Covid-19 wave although cases have been declining. “It has been an integral part of Republic and Independence Day celebrations,’’ said SM Khan, who was President APJ Abdul Kalam’s press secretary. “It is an opportunity for people from various walks to meet the PM (Prime Minister) and the President and to interact with each other. They all get a sense of participation in the function which the parade does not give.’’Venu Rajamony, who was the press secretary to President Pranab Mukherjee, said it is sad that “At Home” has been cancelled this year due to Covid. “I cannot recall any other year in which such cancellation has happened before though on one occasion due to winter rain, the event was shifted indoor. The reception on Republic Day has been a lovely tradition. It could be described as the largest public reception that Delhi witnesses every year and that too in the most beautiful surroundings possible,” he said. Rajamony said the Republic Day coincides with the season when the roses of the Mughal Gardens are in full bloom. “It has been an occasion for a large number of people from various walks of life coming together and meeting each other as well as the President, the foreign dignitary invited for the Republic Day...the Prime Minister, ministers, etc. I hope the event will be reinstated next year.”Similar events governors host in states have also been cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/republic-day-no-at-home-ceremony-at-rashtrapati-bhavan-101643179183350.html

The issue has become pertinent at the time of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, when more and more people are forced to spend time in the online world.Privacy is a means of ensuring online safety for all individuals and Data Privacy Day, which is celebrated on January 28, seeks to spread the awareness about the same.A failure to safeguard one’s privacy could not only result in exploitation, but also criminal offences against internet users.With the proliferation of instant messaging mobile applications, such as WhatsApp and Telegram etc, people are more concerned about protecting their data.To allay their fears, these companies have rolled out many security features like end-to-end encryption to ensure that exchange of information is not visible to anyone other than the two people involved in the particular conversation. Both WhatsApp and Telegram have this feature.However, governments across the world have been putting pressure on internet companies to allow them access to these conversations. They want tech companies to build "back doors" for law enforcement to access encrypted platforms.This, they say, will create a safer space for citizens as the government clamps down on bad actors and mischief-makers, preventing the spread of viral misinformation and also putting a stop to organised crime.Here's how you can ensure data privacy and check the spread of misinformation, using security measures made available by tech companies and mobile phone manufacturers:Two-Step verification: This helps users add an extra layer of security to their end-to-end encrypted messaging account. The process requires setting up of a PIN (a numerical code) when resetting and verifying the chat account, in the event of SIM card being stolen or phone being compromised.Touch ID or Face ID lock: Additional features available in a wide variety of phone manufactured by leading companies, like Apple, Samsung, Google etc. Some of the phones even offer under screen fingerprint sensors, which use ultrasound to build image of people’s fingers.Forward limits: Some messaging apps like WhatsApp have set a limit on forwarding messages to just five chats at once, restricting the sharing of information and taking an important step in checking the spread misinformation. Data from these companies shows that the move has reduced the number of forwarded messages in India by over 25 per cent.Additional limits for viral messages: WhatsApp has set additional limits on messages which have been sent many times. Such messages are marked with double arrows and labeled as “Forwarded many times” to indicate they did not originate from a close contact and can only be forwarded to one other chat at a time. The messaging services also allow users to block accounts and report about messages to the company.Disappearing messages: Messaging service WhatsApp launched this feature let users send messages that disappear. Once enabled, new messages sent in the individual or group chat will disappear after seven days. WhatsApp has also launched the ‘view once’ feature that makes photos and videos disappear after they’ve been opened, giving users even more control over their privacy. Telegram, meanwhile, allows self-destructing messages that leave no trace even on its servers.Admin controls: Users are empowered with controls on some end-to-end encrypted messaging services. A new setting on WhatsApp enables administrators to decide who can send messages within groups. In Telegram, secret chats are not part of its cloud and can only be accessed on the devices of origin.End-to-end encrypted backup: On WhatsApp, users can now add the same layer of end-to-end encryption to protect their chat backups on iCloud or Google Drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/data-privacy-day-how-users-can-protect-their-privacy-check-details-101643177841361.html
26-01-2022||India||TN girl’s suicide death: Man behind controversial video clip belongs to VHP||CHENNAI: A video clip made two days before the death of a 17-year-old tribal girl in Tamil Nadu’s Ariyalur district, sparking claims by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that she died due to forced conversion, was filmed by P Muthuvel, a member of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), HT has found.Muthuvel, who was arrested in 2019 for attacking two Christian preachers in the district, did not report the alleged conversion to the police before the girl’s death, and shared the video clip on social media only after she died by suicide.In her dying declaration before a judicial magistrate, the girl blamed her hostel warden, who is in custody, of constantly hitting her and scolding her and did not mention conversion as the reason behind her decision to kill herself.On January 17, an FIR was lodged against the hostel warden over the girl’s suicide. Police probed the matter and learnt that the girl was facing pressure at home from her step-mother and never mentioned the issue of conversion.But the case took the conversion angle once the video clip of the girl was circulated on social media. The BJP cited the footage as what it claimed was evidence of alleged forced conversion and held protests across Tamil Nadu.In a dying declaration before judicial magistrate 1 Thanjavur three days before her death on January 16, the girl, who studied at a Christian residential school in Thanjavur district, accused her hostel warden of corporal punishment.The girl said in her declaration that the warden told her in Tamil “to go die”. She also claimed that the warden allegedly hit her and scolded her. The girl was allegedly refused leave including when she was sick and during the Christmas holidays, and made to stay back to work. “She tortured me… She is the cause behind this,” the girl told the magistrate in her declaration, a copy of which HT has accessed.An assistant physician on duty recorded that the “patient was conscious, oriented and in a fit state of mind throughout the recording of the dying declaration”.A day after the declaration was recorded, Muthuvel recorded a 45-second video clip, which purportedly shows the girl saying that the warden urged her parents to convert her to Christianity two years ago and promised to sponsor her education.“Could be,” the girl purportedly responds in the video when the person recording it asks her if the alleged harassment happened because she didn’t convert.Muthuvel, who handed over the phone that was used to record the video to the police on Tuesday for forensic analysis as per the Madras high court’s directions, was among three people arrested in February 2019 for assaulting two Christian preachers.On January 24, the high court, which is hearing a plea for a CB-CID probe into the matter, observed that the girl’s parents confirmed there was a conversion attempt.Muthuvel claimed the girl’s parents asked him to record the video when he went to meet them on January 17.The girl told the magistrate that she consumed pesticide on January 9 at the hostel, but didn’t tell anyone about it and she was being treated for vomiting. She was taken home on January 10 and then rushed to a hospital on January 15, where she died four days later.A police officer said Muthuvel waited for two days and released the video after the girl, who topped her Class 10 exams, died. “The child’s uncle has friends in the VHP, though he is not a member, and that is how Muthuvel got involved,” the officer said, requesting anonymity.The warden, 74, was arrested on January 18 on charges of harassing the girl. A preliminary police probe suggested the girl, whose mother is no more, did not have a supportive home environment. Her father, a dairy farmer, lives with her stepmother.“Several people including school students told us that she wanted to stay back in the hostel and not go home [even during holidays],” said the officer. “Since she was in the hostel most of the time, the warden would ask her to do some work. She was a bright student, so she was made to handle the accounts.”Inspector general of police S Balakrishnan said the girl may have faced pressures. “The suicide seems to have been triggered by several angles. We are investigating all of them,” he said.”

26-01-2022||India||After Padma award, Gen Rawat’s theatre commands mission need completion||The Narendra Modi government has taken the right step by bestowing Padma Vibhushan on late Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, who died in a helicopter crash last month while still in harness. The award is well deserved for a CDS who put respect for military shoulders above all material gains and fought to restore its rightful glory.While General Rawat has passed into history, the Modi government and its national security planners must take the former CDS mission to fruition by announcing the military theatre commands in the 75th year of Indian Independence. Before Gen Rawat lost his life in Nilgiris, he had sent the final draft military theatre command structure and raising to the Army, Navy and Air Force Chiefs and had directed them to return the report by April 2022 with comments, if any, for incorporation into the final structure.It is not that the Modi government has put the much-required theatre commands on a back-burner after Gen Rawat’s unfortunate demise. The national security planners have had series of informal and formal meetings with the three chiefs to sort out structural or operational issues and the movement is positive. The government is tight-lipped about the military theatre commands but it is quite evident that in the final announcement each of the three services will spearhead India’s riposte in case of war with other two supporting it. While the Indian Army will spearhead guarding 15106.7 km of Indian land frontiers, the Navy will guard 7516.6 km of coastline and the Air Force will guard the skies and defend the country from any intrusion from either the north or the west. In the military theatre commands, all the three services will have a pin-pointed role, and no one will be reduced to a supporting arm as the Indian Air Force had feared in the past.Although the basic purpose of military theatres is integration and jointmanship of the three services, it is easier said than done as is evident from the India’s first and only tri-service theatre command at Andamans and Nicobar Islands. Despite the unified command being made operational in 2001, the three services tend to operate in silos and are lacking in much required synergy. Fact is synergy and integration only comes out in times of crisis and not naturally otherwise the colour of uniform decides the operational conduct.The national security planners and Gen Rawat had plans for integration of ANI command into the Maritime Theatre Command with huge military upgradation of India’s island territories, which sit on the mouth of Malacca Straits, the main route to South China Sea, and have considerable leverage over other ingress routes to Southeast and North Asia.While the Modi government will appoint the new CDS on merit plus seniority basis, it is quite evident that northern theatre command will be a separate unit headed by a commander from the Indian Army as the area faces threat from Pakistan on its western periphery and a belligerent China on its eastern periphery. The remaining land border will be handled by western command with Pakistan and eastern theatre command with China all the way up to Arunachal Pradesh. The air defence command, logistics command and cyber commands will be key elements of military theatre process. With Chinese Army already on the path of Sinicization of Tibet and Sinkiang, and planning joint moves with client state Pakistan, the Indian military does not have time for debates and discussion over integration of commands. It should be done as of yesterday.

Here’s a list||NEW DELHI: On Tuesday, former West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee refused to accept the Padma Bhushan, saying he was not informed about his nomination for the country’s third-highest civilian award. Here is a list of people who have earlier refused to accept such awards over various reasons:- Author Gita Mehta refused to accept the Padma Shri conferred on her in 2019 for contributions to literature and education, citing the general election later that year. She said the timing of the award might be misconstrued, causing embarrassment both to the government and herself. Meha, who is Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik’s sister, said she believed the award was “a way to lure in Biju Janata Dal’s support by the Bharatiya Janata Party.”- Journalist Virendra Kapoor, who was jailed during the Emergency in the 1970s, refused to accept the Padma award in 2016, saying he has not accepted anything from any government and did not believe in taking anything from it.- Tamil writer and director Bahuleyan Jeyamohan also declined the Padma Shri in 2016 as he did not want to be labelled “a Hindutva sympathiser”.- Playback singer Sistla Janaki refused to accept the Padma Bhushan in 2013, saying the recognition was late and her family believed only a Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award, would do justice to her reputation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhattacharjee-is-latest-in-series-of-those-who-have-refused-padma-awards-101643170722513.html

Posting a quatrain from his official Twitter handle, Tharoor suggested that the BJP now looks familiar as many members have switched over from Congress.“Everyone is leaving home, Maybe they have some other dreams, Now the other side seems familiar, Now that they are our own (Congress-Yukt BJP!)” Tharoor tweeted in Hindi, taking a jibe at BJP's ‘Congress-mukta Bharat’ campaign.छोड़कर जा रहे हैं घर अपनाशायद उनके कुछ और सपने हैंअब उधर भी सब अपना सा हैअब उधर भी तो सभी अपने हैं(काँग्रेस युक्त भाजपा!)RPN Singh joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday hours after resigning from the primary membership of the Congress party. He shared his resignation letter on Twitter stating that he will be starting a new chapter in his political journey."I hereby tender my resignation from the primary membership of the Indian National Congress with immediate effect," the letter stated. "I thank you for providing me an opportunity to serve the nation, its people and the party."Singh, who was the Congress party in-charge in Jharkhand, was named as a star campaigner by the party for the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections starting next month.

26-01-2022||India||Lt Cdr Aanchal Sharma: Saluting the President at Rajpath will be a lifetime achievement||New DelhiAs the Indian Naval contingent marches to the gallant tune of Jai Bharati, for the Republic Day parade at Delhi’s Rajpath this year, it’ll be a splendidly inspiring sight to watch Lieutenant Commander Aanchal Sharma — an observer officer posted at the Indian Naval Air Squadron (INAS) 314 — lead the contingent of 96 young sailors and four officers, including herself. “Attired in ceremonials, marching briskly, and saluting the President at Rajpath will be a lifetime achievement for me; I will cherish it throughout my life,” she says with a josh in her voice that’s infectious. More women are leading from the front in the armed forces now, and Lt Cdr Sharma opines: “As a woman officer, I feel no difference from any of my male counterparts. As a matter of fact, we are given equal opportunities and taskings. I have never felt second to anyone and the kind of atmosphere which is there in the Indian Navy is very inspiring. I will always be grateful to Indian Navy for making me a better officer everyday, and for giving every individual fair chance in every field.” And to those who watch her leading the contingent, this officer says: “Not only in the Armed Forces, but everywhere women have proved their mettle time and again. To all the young girls out there, I would like to say ‘Keep chasing your dreams!’ Perseverance, hard work and your dedication will always lead you to success.” Honoured to lead the Indian Naval Contingent, she shares how its members are “full of passion and pride and each individual has the sense of honour to be a fauji”. As people, the world over, watched them practise every day of January, with pride and honour, this naval officer informs about the “gruelling” and “rigorous” efforts that went behind the preparations for the parade that began much before the practise sessions kick started. “In December end our contingent started practising at Rajpath, which was the second phase of our training. We used to assemble at sharp 5am, and after warming up and pre-rehearsal drills, commence with the parade practice that would continue for 5-6 hours. Our practice was conducted under the strict supervision of the Gunnery Officer and the drill instructors, who constantly monitored and guided the team for improvements in drill standards. They focussed on the minutest of details and intricacies of our drill providing the necessary course correction.... We have been practising for two months now. We started our journey at INS India wherein the officers were selected, followed by our training phase at INS Chilka, wherein we underwent our first phase of training. Our practice, which covered a distance of almost 16 kilometres daily was primarily focused on building our physical as well as mental strength, endurance and stamina. The initial days did cause a lot of fatigue, however, we all had one goal in mind and that was to make it to the Republic Day 2022 celebrations! With time we improved... see the contingent today, it is full of passion and pride. The josh and courage of the contingent is unmatchable. It’s indeed an honour to be leading the Indian Naval Contingent,” she adds.Crediting the force for developing her personality as an individual, she shares how she felt a special inclination towards the defence forces since her childhood. “Though I worked in corporate for two years, I was not prepared to settle for less. I had always wanted to join in Combat Role, and at the time of my preparations Indian Navy provided the opportunity to join as an Observer - A Naval Air Tacticians, which obviously was my first choice. Since then the Indian Navy has given me ample opportunities to prove my mettle. Not only did the Navy help me build my physical strength, but also developed my skills intellectually as a Naval Air Operations Officer.”In the last five and half years of her service, she has indeed achieved many milestones. “I was awarded the Most Promising Naval Orientation Cadet trophy in Naval Academy, Best in Overall Merit in Ground Subjects, during my Observer Phase, FOC-in-C (West) commendation during my Staff Appointment at INAS 314, and I am now leading the Naval Contingent at Rajpath,” she recalls, and shares about the time when she was undergoing intensive training at the Naval Academy, which provided her with an exercise to expose herself to her fear of height and water. Feeling proud to have overcome it, she says, “Now as an Observer, I am operating in the blue skies high above the oceans.” Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lt-cdr-aanchal-sharma-saluting-the-president-on-rajpath-will-be-a-lifetime-achievement-101643163951172.html

The ongoing Omicron wave may have a prolonged effect in India, the immunologist expressed concerns as not much is known about the second version of Omicron (BA.2) that has started spreading in the country. "In India, there is a variant of Omicron BA.2 that's also spreading, it is different from Omicron. In fact, Omicron BA.1 is the original, but it's slightly different," Dr Pillai Professor of Medicine and Health Sciences and Technology, director, Harvard Immunology Graduate Programme at the Harvard Medical School, said to ANI.BA.1, the first version of the Omicron, is slightly milder than the original virus and its variants like Alpha, Beta, Delta and did not affect the lungs badly. But with BA.2, it can't be confirmed as it is just being reported."Immunity from BA.1 first Omicron might give us some immunity against the second one BA.2. But will that second one be as mild? Not proven yet. We'll see the data will probably come from South Africa and India first. Because in India, BA.2 has taken over it is the most common version in India right now. It's rising the second version of Omicron," Dr Pillai said.South Africa and the United States too have many BA.2 cases, Dr Pillai said, adding that it is not clear whether BA.2 will replace BA.1 and create another surge.Agreeing with scientists who are of the opinion that Covid will become endemic, Dr Pillai said the virus will live on at some level, maybe in a less virulent form. Vaccinations and drugs will change a lot of things, the immunologist said.The government's expert committee on genome sequencing (INSACOG) has said that Omicron is now in community transmission and has become dominant in multiple metros. "BA.2 lineage is a substantial fraction in India and S-gene dropout based screening is thus likely to give high false negatives," INSACOG said.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-may-have-prolonged-effect-in-india-covid-can-t-be-eradicated-harvard-immunologist-101643161500652.html

His brother Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal, one of India’s best known military heroes, was posthumously awarded the hallowed PVC by President VV Giri at the 1972 Republic Day parade, the honour received by their mother Maheshwari Khetarpal.Mukesh was just 20 and seated in one of the stands along with his father when he watched his mother accept Arun’s PVC from the President.“Over the years, we have seen brave men and their kin accept the highest military honours from the President at the parade. We connect with them in those solemn moments. The parade’s format keeps changing but it still makes us numb and proud. It takes us back to 1972,” said 70-year-old Khetarpal.His brother, Arun, is among the only 21 Indian soldiers decorated with PVC for their heroism in independent India’s history. He was only 21, and commissioned into Poona Horse only six months before the 1971 India-Pakistan war, in which he destroyed seven Pakistani Patton tanks in the Battle of Basantar fought on December 16, 1971, a glorious and unforgettable chapter in India’s military history.At the first Republic Day parade held at Irwin Stadium, now Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, President Rajendra Prasad awarded PVC to four Indian Army heroes for their uncommon courage in the 1947-48 Kashmir operations --- Major Somnath Sharma (posthumous), Lance Naik Karam Singh, Second Lieutenant Rama Raghoba Rane and Naik Jadunath Singh (posthumous).Karam Singh and Rane were India’s first living recipients of the military honour. PVC was instituted as a military honour in January 1950 with retrospective effect from August 15, 1947. Only the highest honours, PVC and its peace-time equivalent Ashoka Chakra, are awarded at the Republic Day parade.Like Mukesh, the parade holds a special place in the heart of Brigadier Chitaranjan Sawant (retd) who has been associated with the ceremonial event for almost five decades as its leading commentator. The 88-year-old Sawant’s first commentary at the parade was on January 26, 1973.“I still remember reading out Ashoka Chakra citations in the 1970s. Back in the day, the parade was not as grand but it evoked the same emotions. The President took the salute from a small dais near Rajpath. There were fewer security restrictions in the 1970s. However, things changed after PM Indira Gandhi’s assassination in 1984,” he added.Security concerns have increased even more in recent decades.The 1990s witnessed the creation of a separate security enclosure for the President, visiting chief guest, Vice President, Prime Minister, defence minister and the three service chiefs, said defence analyst Chandrashekhar Bhattacharyya.“The Republic Day parade, however, has over the years been a reflection of India; as it was, is, and also a glimpse of our future,” he said.Among the most notable parades in the past was the one in 1987, the event held in the midst of Operation Brasstacks when the Indian army moved tens of thousands of troops to the western border with Pakistan, along with armoured columns, artillery and rocket systems, he added.“That year, the parade witnessed the largest ever participation of tanks and other mechanised elements,” he said.This year’s parade is being conducted in the shadow of the third Covid-19 wave and will be witnessed by fewer spectators at Rajpath --- only 5,000 to 8,000 people to be allowed entry to the venue.The parade was attended by around 25,000 spectators amid the ebbing first wave last year, compared to around 125,000 people who would usually show up at Rajpath to watch the event in the pre-pandemic era.The parade was held at Rajpath for the first time in 1955 (in the early years it was held at Irwin Stadium, Red Fort and Ramlila grounds), with Pakistan’s Governor General Malik Ghulam Muhammad attending the event as chief guest.It was the first of the only two times that a Pakistani leader was given the honour --- Pakistan’s agriculture minister Rana Abdul Hamid was the chief guest in 1965. Chinese PLA Marshal Ye Jianying was the chief guest at the 1958 parade.This year’s parade will have no chief guest, like last year’s. India had invited the leaders of the five Central Asian states --- Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan --- to be chief guests at the celebrations, though no formal announcement was made in this regard by any of the countries.The spread of the Omicron variant of the Coronavirus in the past few weeks and recent violent protests in Kazakhstan, which resulted in the death of more than 220 people, were factors that went against the participation of the Central Asian leaders.Last year, India went ahead with truncated Republic Day celebrations without a chief guest after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called off his visit at the last minute because of the rapid spread of a strain of the Coronavirus in Britain. It is extremely rare for the Republic Day celebrations, seen as a high point in the country’s diplomatic calendar, not to have a chief guest.Prior to 2021, the last time the celebrations didn’t have a chief guest was in 1966, when Indira Gandhi was sworn in as prime minister on January 24 after the death of Lal Bahadur Shastri on January 11. There were also no chief guests at the celebrations in 1952 and 1953.The parade involves a massive logistics exercise and preparations begin almost five to six months ahead of the event, said Lieutenant General Asit Mistry (retd), who was the parade commander in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The preparations involve the selection of marching contingents, weapons and equipment to be showcased and various tableaux that take part in the parade as well as readying camps where the participants are to be accommodated.Timing is the most critical aspect of the parade. “If it’s 90 minutes, it has to be 90 minutes. The parade is planned with clockwork precision. The pace of the parade --- it may sometimes move a bit fast or a bit slow --- is constantly monitored and corrections made in real-time. All contingencies are catered for. If a tank breaks down on Rajpath, recovery mechanisms are in place so that the parade is not obstructed,” said Mistri.The parade will begin at 10.30 am this year, instead of the traditional timing of 10 am, for better visibility to the parade and the fly past. The parade formation will consist of 16 marching contingents, including those from the army, air force, navy and para-military forces, and 25 tableaux of various states, government departments and the armed forces.Tableaux have been a part of the parade since its inaugural edition in 1950.The flypast, consisting of 75 aircraft in India’s 75th year of Independence, will feature flying formations to commemorate glorious moments of India’s decisive victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war.The Tangail formation will feature a vintage Dakota aircraft along with two Dornier 228 aircraft. The Tangail airdrop north of Dhaka --- the biggest airborne operation mounted by Indian paratroopers --- set the stage for surrender by the rival army.The aim of the operation was to capture the Poongli bridge on Jamalpur-Tangail-Dhaka road and the ferry site on Louhajang river to intercept Pakistani army’s 93 Brigade that was retreating from the north to defend Dhaka. Around 750 men of the 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment were involved in the mission.The paratroopers defeated a force that was three times numerically superior and shattered the will of the Pakistani army.The Meghna formation to commemorate a critical heli-borne operation during the 1971 war will involve a CH-47F Chinook helicopter and four Mi-171V choppers. IAF helicopters played a critical role in moving troops across the Meghna river in erstwhile East Pakistan.This year’s parade also comes on the back of a political row over the eternal flame at the Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate being extinguished after 50 years and merged with the flame at the adjacent NWM last week.The India Gate, a British-era monument, was built in the memory of around 90,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who fell in World War I and the Afghan war.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated NWM, a monument dedicated to soldiers who fell in post-Independence wars and operations, almost three years ago, on February 25 2019. As on date, the names of 26,466 brave warriors are inscribed on the memorial, including the ones who fell in the 1971 war.

Kalita is currently serving as a deputy chief in the Army Headquarters.Another position falling vacant on January 31 is that of the Northern Army commander as Lieutenant General YK Joshi is retiring that day. Joshi is expected to be replaced by Lieutenant General Upendra Dwivedi, said a second official. Dwivedi is also serving as a deputy chief in the army headquarters.Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, seen by many as the frontrunner for the CDS’s post, is due to retire on April 30. Pande will be the top contender for the army chief’s post.Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari and navy chief Admiral R Hari Kumar are both around two years junior to him. There is a strong possibility of Naravane being named as the next CDS if the government follows the seniority principle, as previously reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-appointments-in-army-soon-officials-101643149904205.html

According to Prayagraj police, the woman had been missing from her hostel for two days, after which her family lodged a complaint of abduction against a youth. When detained and questioned, the youth, who claimed to be the woman’s boyfriend, told the police that he and the woman were attacked by some miscreants while they were at a deserted spot near IERT on January 22. “He is the prime suspect in the case. He has given contradictory statements,” said SSP Ajay Kumar.The woman was a student at a degree college in the city and lived in a girls’ hostel. Her roommate informed the family that she left the hostel on January 22 evening, saying she was going to hand over some notes to a friend, police said.Subsequently, her family approached the police. The suspect told the police that when they were attacked by miscreants, he fled the spot and had no knowledge of her whereabouts. The police traced the last location of the woman’s cell phone to the spot near IERT.Late on Monday night, her body was found in an old well.A post-mortem examination on Tuesday suggested she was gang-raped before being strangulated. Police said they are rounding up suspects and collecting evidences, added the SSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/18yearold-student-s-body-found-in-well-in-prayagraj-rape-suspected-101643139811427.html
26-01-2022||India||939 president police medals this Republic Day; J&K police bags most||New Delhi: Nine hundred and thirty-nine police personnel were honoured with the President’s police medals on the occasion of Republic Day, with officials from the Jammu & Kashmir Police bagging 115 of the 189 gallantry medals, followed by 30 to the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), and 10 to the Chhattisgarh Police. In all, 134 of the gallantry medals were awarded for action in counter-insurgency operations in the Jammu & Kashmir region alone. Government officials said that 662 of the medals were given for meritorious service, and 88 medals for distinguished service. Apart from operations in Jammu & Kashmir, security personnel were awarded for their role in combating counter-insurgency in Naxal-affected states, the northeast, and on India’s international borders, and for displaying extraordinary policing and investigation skills. Among the officers from J&K, additional director general of police, Jammu, Mukesh Singh, received a medal for distinguished service. The citation of the awardees shared by the home ministry said that J&K Police was instrumental in eliminating terrorists belonging to the Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and Hizbul-Mujahideen, including neutralising or capturing some top terrorists such as Kalimullah, alias Saifullah, Shahid Ahmad Bhat, and Hilal Ahmad Bhat, among others. A total of 182 terrorists, including 44 top commanders of various outfits, were killed in J&K last year. Senior Delhi Police officer, deputy commissioner of police Sanjeev Kumar Yadav of the 2008 Batla House encounter fame, received his 11th President’s police medal for gallantry, a rare feat by any officer. Of the 662 police medals for meritorious service, personnel from the Uttar Pradesh Police received 73 medals, followed by CRPF (57), Border Security Force (46), and Maharashtra Police (40). At least 29 officers of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) also received medals for distinguished and meritorious services, including the agency’s joint director in Bhopal, Ramnish Geer, deputy inspector general, Kolkata, Akhilesh Kumar Singh (who supervised investigations in the post-poll violence in West Bengal), and additional superintendent of police, Delhi, Anil Kumar Yadav (who is investigating actor the Sushant Singh Rajput death case).Eighteen Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) personnel were awarded police medals for meritorious and distinguished service. On Independence Day 2021, 20 troopers of the border guarding force deployed in eastern Ladakh, who fought shoulder-to-shoulder with the Indian Army in keeping Chinese troops at bay in the Galwan Valley and the Gogra Hot Springs clashes in 2020, were awarded gallantry medals. The Galwan Valley clash of June 15, 2020, was the first deadly skirmish between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control in more than five decades, which pushed the relationship between the two countries to breaking point. It left 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops dead. Apart from 939 medals for police personnel, 42 personnel from fire services were also awarded President’s Fire Service medals. In addition, 25 personnel or volunteers were awarded Home Guard and Civil Defence medals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/939-president-police-medals-this-republic-day-j-k-police-bags-most-gallantry-medals-101643139333777.html
26-01-2022||India||Republic Day: President approves 384 gallantry awards, PVSM for Neeraj Chopra||President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday approved 384 gallantry awards and other military decorations for security forces personnel, including 12 Shaurya Chakras for soldiers who demonstrated exceptional courage during operations, the government said in a statement.Tokyo 2020 gold medallist Subedar Neeraj Chopra -- the first Indian to win a gold in a track & field event at the Olympics -- of 4 Rajputana Rifles will be awarded the Param Vishisht Seva Medal (PVSM), a decoration usually given to three-star officers for distinguished service.The President will posthumously award Ashok Chakra to Assistant Sub Inspector Babu Ram of the Jammu and Kashmir Police at the Republic Day parade on Wednesday, said officials familiar with the matter. Ashok Chakra is the country’s highest peace-time gallantry award.Babu Ram killed three terrorists during an operation in Srinagar on August 29, 2020.The President approved the top gallantry award for Babu Ram, who was from the Special Operations Group of JKP, on the eve of Independence Day 2021.Three terrorists fired at a CRPF/police checkpoint in Srinagar and took shelter in the nearby Pantha-Chokh area. The security forces cordoned off the area and asked the terrorists to surrender. The terrorists, however, opened fire on the police party. In the ensuing encounter, the ASI not only shielded his colleague but killed all three terrorists in retaliatory fire before he succumbed to bullet injuries.Shaurya Chakra is India’s third highest peacetime gallantry award. The award will be posthumously conferred on nine personnel.The Shaurya Chakra awardees are Naib Subedar Sreejith M (posthumous), Havildar Anil Kumar Tomar (posthumous), Havildar Kashiray Bammanalli (posthumous), Havildar Pinku Kumar (posthumous), Sepoy Maruprolu Jaswanth Kumar Reddy (posthumous), Rifleman Rakesh Sharma, CRPF Deputy Commandant Dilip Malik, CRPF Assistant Commandant Anirudh Pratap Singh, CRPF Head Constable Ajeet Singh (posthumous), CRPF Constable Vikas Kumar (posthumous), CRPF Constable Purnanand (posthumous) and CRPF Head Constable Kuldeep Kumar Urawan (posthumous).The 384 awards approved by the President on the eve of 73rd Republic Day include 29 Param Vishisht Seva Medals, four Uttam Yudh Seva Medals, 53 Ati Vishisht Seva Medals, 13 Yudh Seva Medals, three Bar to Vishisht Seva Medals, 122 Vishisht Seva Medals, three Bar to Sena Medals (Gallantry), 81 Sena Medals (Gallantry), two Vayu Sena Medals (Gallantry), 40 Sena Medals (Devotion to Duty), eight Nao Sena Medals (Devotion to Duty), and 14 Vayu Sena Medals (Devotion to Duty).On August 7 last year in Tokyo, Chopra became the first Indian to win an Olympic gold medal in track and field.

Bindra’s gold came in 2008 in Beijing.In Tokyo, Chopra qualified for the finals with his first attempt of 86.65m. The Haryana athlete was irrepressible on the final day. In only his second attempt (87.58m), he broke away from the field that included the event favourite Johannes Vetter of Germany, the 2017 world champion who held the season’s best of 97.76m. Jakub Vadlejch of Czech Republic won the silver medal with a throw of 86.67m.Chopra, the 2016 world junior champion, was also awarded country’s highest sporting honor Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award after his golden feat last year.Chopra, who is training in the United States, said he was delighted to be named for the awards. “I am very happy to know about PVSM and Padma Shri.

26-01-2022||India||17 states respond to proposed amendments to IAS cadre rules, 11 not in favour||New Delhi:Changes proposed in the All India Service (AIS) rules have been opposed by 11 of the 17 states that have so far responded, with most arguing that these would kill the federal compact, officials familiar with the matter said.The government will likely issue another reminder by next week to allow the remaining states to weigh in, the officials added, asking not to be named. The states that have opposed the changes are mainly those not ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party.“So far, the government has received representations from 17 states, and 11 of these have challenged the rule amendments,” one of the officials said. “Reminders will be sent by next week to ensure the rest of the states can be heard as well.”The 11 states opposing the changes are Rajasthan, Telangana, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Bihar and Karnataka.Among these, only Karnataka has a BJP government, and is expected to send a revised note backing the changes. Bihar is governed by an alliance of the BJP and the Janata Dal (United).The states backing the changes are Manipur, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Tripura, the official cited above added.Karnataka will likely send a new statement once the reminder is sent, the official said.The changes have to do with the deputation of civil servants from state cadres to the Centre. The Union government has claimed there is a shortfall in this deputation, which has meant vacancies in key positions in the Indian Administrative Service as well as the Indian Police Service. Most states are not meeting their Central Deputation Reserve, or CDR, the Union government has said.Among the amendments proposed is one that says the Centre will arrive at the number of officers on CDR in consultation with states, another that in case of any difference of opinion between the Centre and the state, the latter will have to go with the decision of the former, and within a specified time, and a third that the Centre could pick a specific officer from a state in public interest.The Union government has sought state government responses to the proposed amendments to the cadre rules by January 25, after the last reminder on this was sent on January 6, and some chief ministers have written to the Prime Minister, terming this a blow to the federal structure of governance, as they will be forced under the new rules to relieve officers for central deputation.The government has flagged a trend of decreasing representation of IAS officers up to joint secretary level in at the Centre as most of the states are not meeting their CDR obligations, and the number of officers sponsored by the states to serve at the Centre are fewer than the CDR, according to an official note seen by HT and reported on January 25.“The number of IAS officers on CDR has gone down from 309 in 2011 to 223 as on date,” said the note. “The percentage of CDR utilization has gone down from 25% in 2011 to 18% as on date. This is despite an increase of IAS officers at deputy secretary/director level in IAS from 621 in 2014 to 1130 in 2021; the number of such officers on central deputation has gone down from 117 to 114 during the period.”The reason quoted by most states for not sponsoring officers as per prescribed CDR is a shortage of officers in the cadre, the note said.“Considering the same and the fact that shortage of AIS officers in the cadres, if any, has to be shared mutually between the Centre and the States, it has been proposed that the state cadre may now provide such number of offices as part of CDR only after adjusting the same proportionately with the number of officers available in the cadre,” added the note.“It may be mentioned that the requirement from the states is only to sponsor adequate number of officers for posting in the Centre. The actual number of officers to be deputed to the Central Government shall be decided only in consultation with the State Government,” the note said.It further noted that for dealing with specific situations, such as major disasters or national security issues, services of an AIS officer may be warranted in the Centre.“Similarly, services of an AIS officer with a specific domain expertise may be required for any important time bound flagship programme/project of GoI. The extant Cadre Rules do not have specific provisions to cater to such situations, which have now been proposed through these amendments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17-states-respond-to-proposed-amendments-to-ias-cadre-rules-11-not-in-favour-101643138489894.html

26-01-2022||India||India showed unmatched resolve during Covid pandemic: President Ram Nath Kovind||The Covid-19 pandemic is still widespread and people should not let their guards down, President Ram Nath Kovind said in his 73rd Republic Day eve address to the nation, as India continues to battle the third wave of infections.President Kovind lauded the country for showing “unmatched resolve” against the coronavirus and said all precautions against Covid-19 should continue.“Wearing masks and maintaining social distancing have been essential parts of Covid-appropriate behaviour. In the fight against the Covid pandemic, it has now become a sacred national duty of every citizen to follow the precautions suggested by our scientists and experts. We have to discharge this duty till the crisis is behind us,” he said.The President said the pandemic management was bound to be more difficult in India due to its high population and other factors. “But it is only in such difficult times that the resilience of a nation shines forth. I am proud to say that we have shown an unmatched resolve against the coronavirus… During the pandemic, we have reached out to several other countries with vaccines and other medical help. This contribution by India has been appreciated by international organizations,” he said.Asking people to celebrate “Indian-ness” this Republic Day, the President said that “diversity and vibrancy” of our democracy is appreciated worldwide.“It is an occasion to celebrate what is common to us all, our Indian-ness. It was on this day in 1950 that this sacred essence of us all assumed a formal shape…The diversity and vibrancy of our democracy is appreciated world-wide. It is this spirit of unity and of being one nation which is celebrated every year as Republic Day. This year’s celebrations may be muted due to the pandemic, but the spirit is as strong as ever,” he said.While hailing doctors, nurses and paramedics for their contribution in India’s fight against the pandemic, the President appreciated the “timely interventions” by the leadership, policymakers, administrators and others at the central and state levels to tackle the economic condition of the country.“Due to such interventions, the economy is on the move again. It is a testimony to India’s spirit in the face of adversity that the economy is projected to grow at an impressive rate in this fiscal, after going through contraction last year,” the President said. “This shows the success of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan launched in the previous year. The government has shown relentless focus on reforming every economic sector and providing a helping hand wherever necessary. The impressive economic performance is made possible due to improvement in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors.”The president also mentioned former chief of defence staff Bipin Rawat and said: “When a brave soldier dies on duty, the entire country feels sad. Last month, in an unfortunate accident, we lost one of the bravest commanders of the country - General Bipin Rawat - his wife and many brave soldiers. The entire country was deeply saddened by the tragic loss.”As the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, the President said that it was a “watershed year” for women’s empowerment in the armed forces in India. “Our daughters have broken a glass ceiling, and permanent commission has now been allowed for women officers in new areas. Also, the talent pipeline for the forces will be strengthened with women coming through Sainik Schools and the prestigious National Defence Academy. Consequently, our Armed Forces will benefit from better gender balance,” he said.Quoting Mahatma Gandhi’s advice on how to celebrate the “purna swaraj day”, the President said he would have liked us to celebrate Republic Day by striving to become better human beings and contributing towards the making of a better India and a better world.While mentioning Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, the President said, “His quest for independence and his ambition to make India proud inspire all of us.”The President said patriotism strengthens the sense of duty among citizens. “Whether you are a doctor or a lawyer, a shopkeeper or office worker, a sanitation employee or a labourer, doing one’s duty well and efficiently is the first and foremost contribution you make to the nation,” he said.The President also hailed Indian Navy and Cochin Shipyard Limited for building indigenous state-of-the-art aircraft carrier IAC Vikrant, which will soon be inducted into the Indian Navy. “Due to such modern military capabilities, India is now counted among the world’s leading naval powers. This is an impressive example of moving towards self-reliance in the field of defence,” he said.He further mentioned Sui village in Bhiwani district of Haryana for its extraordinary achievements under the government’s Swa-Prerit Adarsh Gram Yojana, and asked people to work for the welfare of their villages, towns or cities.“All of you must serve your place of birth and your country in whatever way you can. If all the successful people of India work sincerely for the development of their birthplaces, then the whole country will benefit from the outcome of such local development,” the president said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-showed-unmatched-resolve-during-covid-pandemic-president-ram-nath-kovind-in-republic-day-eve-address-101643137829479.html

Akhtar, 68, was appointed as the first ever woman VC of Jamia in April 2019. She is known for establishing the first state-level management institute in Allahabad and worked as the controller of examination and director of academic programs at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). On being selected for the prestigious award, Akhtar said, “I am grateful to those who recognised my work and deemed me for this award. I would extend special thanks to our honourable Prime Minister and President who entrusted me as the first women vice-chancellor of Jamia. With this award, my responsibilities towards Jamia and the country have increased. It will motivate me and Jamia to work harder in future.” Akhtar has been working for the upliftment of women at Jamia ever since she took charge as the VC. In December 2019, when Jamia witnessed violence during anti-CAA protests and police entered the campus, Akhtar backed her students.

26-01-2022||India||Pratibha Ray, the prolific Odia woman writer, gets Padmabhushan||BHUBANESWAR: Pratibha Ray, whose name was announced for Padma Bhushan award on Tuesday evening, is among the most prolific women writers in India whose novels and short stories depict the tension of modern life, corruption and degeneration of values in every sphere while questioning the caste and religious discriminations. The 78-year-old writer, who has earlier won prestigious awards like Jnanpith, Moortidevi and Saptarshi for her literary exploits is among the boldest writers in India whose writings in Odia language bring out her desire for a social order based on equality, love, peace, non-violence and emotional integration. Daughter of a school principal, Ray caught the attention with her first novel Barsha Basanta Baishakha (Rain, spring and summer) in 1974, that was set in a rural ambience. By mid-eighties she was already established as a leading writer in Odia with novels like Parichaya (An identity – 1978), Punyatoya (The Hallowed River – 1978), Asabari (The rhythm asabari, 1980), Nilatrushna (The Blue Thirst, 1981), Sila Padma (The Stone Lotus, 1983), Uttarmarga (The Salvation Way-1988) and Adibhumi (The Primal Land / The Primitive Land – 1993). She worked first as a headmistress of a tribal school and then as a professor in a college. She churned out 21 novels, 24 short story collections, 10 travelogues, 2 books of thought-provoking essays and an autobiography titled “Amrit Anwesha” (In search of Nectar). Ray’s novel Shilapadma in 1983 won her the Orissa Sahitya Academy Award, 1985, while Yajnaseni (1984) got her the Moorti Devi Award in 1991 and Sarala Award in 1990. In 1985, she wrote the book “Adibhoomi” on the primitive Bonda tribes living in Bonda hills of Malkangiri district visiting all the 32 villages where even male researchers did not dare to go. In 1984, her novel Yajnaseni analysed the character of Draupadi in the epic Mahabharat where she showed her to be a modern-day woman with an identity of her own. Yajnaseni was later adapted for stage ballet by noted danseuse and film star Hemamalini. Her movie “Shilapadma”, is a moving work on the legends associated with the world-famous Sun temple at Konark, while “Uttarmarg”, a novel, was based on suffering of neglected heroes of freedom struggle in her native village. Although her literary focus is on psycho-social analysis of people, tribes and characters, Pratibha Ray grapples with issues of contemporary relevance, oppressive surroundings, over powering tension of modern life, corruption and degeneration of values in every sphere, a growing hedonism and the alienation of the individual in a complex modern society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pratibha-ray-the-prolific-odia-woman-writer-gets-padmabhushan-101643135848955.html
26-01-2022||India||Academicians write to K’taka CM, voice concerns over ‘growing intolerance’ in state||Eminent personalities across the state on Tuesday wrote to chief minister(CM) Basavaraj Bommai voicing concerns “over deteriorating governance and frequent violence against religious minorities.”“We are a group of senior scientists, writers, academics, artists, and lawyers, and we write with concern about Karnataka’s deteriorating governance and the frequent violence against religious minorities. Over the past few months, the state has witnessed brutal killing of youths in several districts, rampant ‘hate speeches’, public threats and disruptions of worship by religious minorities, ‘honour killings’, ‘moral policing’, misogynistic statements by legislators, and incidents of hostile and violent encounters between various religious groups,” states the letter signed by at least 34 well-known personalities.“These trends have been encouraged by the callous and un-constitutional statements made by legislators and the inability of the state machinery to rein-in fringe anti-social groups,” read the letter.The list includes professor Vinod Gaur (former secretary, department of science and technology, geo-physicist), Flavia Agnes (lawyer and author), professor Janaki Nair (historian), professor Vidyanand Nanjundiah (scientist), Dr Ramachandra Guha (historian and commentator), KP Suresha (poet, essayist, and translator), Dr Yellappa Reddy (forester and environmentalist), Bezwada Wilson (human rights’ specialist) and professor AR Vasavi (social anthropologist) among others.The letter comes amid a series of incidents being reported from across Karnataka.“Such trends go against the long history of Karnataka as a progressive state that facilitated social harmony of a plural society and initiated model welfare programs for all sections of the population,” the letter states.“We note with both sadness and alarm that these traditions of tolerance and shared well-being are being torn asunder. Instead, the state is losing its identity on multiple fronts. On the fiscal, administrative, and political fronts Karnataka is losing its federal strength. Recent legislations such as the ‘cow protection’ and ‘anti-conversion’ Acts are pogroms against the economic and cultural rights of religious minorities. No longer are harmony, peace, and tolerance the hallmarks of the state. It also needs to be stressed that if the above issues are not addressed, even Karnataka’s reputation as a business destination is bound to be impacted negatively as all types of economic activity depends upon an atmosphere of social peace and harmony,” it adds.Meanwhile, another letter is being circulated online to get more people to endorse itThe letter titled; “I am a proud alumnus of a Christian institution and stand by my alma mater- An Open Letter of Solidarity”, states that there have only been good experiences studying in Christian schools.“As elected representatives, it is the responsibility of the chief minister and all legislators to deliberate on all legislations, programs, and policies in a democratic and open manner. Implementing received ideas and suggestions that seek to assert only narrow, sectarian agendas will only be antithetical to the interests of the state and its people. We call upon you all to seriously review these negative trends in the state and to ensure that the rule of law, the principles of the Constitution, the rights of all citizens, and the basic norms of humaneness prevail. It will be your abilities to address these challenges that will be the yardstick with which posterity will assess you,” the letter reads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/academicians-write-to-k-taka-cm-voice-concerns-over-growing-intolerance-in-state-101643135668231.html
26-01-2022||India||MB Patil to lead K’taka Cong campaign committee||The All India Congress Committee (AICC) on Tuesday named MB Patil as the chairman of the campaign committee for the Karnataka unit of the national party in a possible move to assuage growing dissent and infighting within the outfit in the southern state.AICC general secretary (organisation), KC Venugopal, in a statement on Tuesday, said that the appointment was approved by Congress president Sonia Gandhi and would come into ‘immediate effect’.“I offer my sincere gratitude & heartfelt thanks to the @INCIndia President Smt SoniaGandhi, Sh @RahulGandhi ,Smt @priyankagandhi, Sh @rssurjewala, Sh@kharge ,Sh @kcvenugopalmp ,Sh @siddaramaiah,Sh @KPCCPresident ravaru for appointing me as the Chairman of the KPCC CampaignCommittee (sic),” Patil posted on Twitter.The appointment comes at a time when the state Congress appears more divided with at least two factions , one led by Siddaramaiah and the other by state president, DK Shivakumar. Patil is among those leaders of the Congress who have long aimed for bigger roles within the party. He was also in the running for the state unit president two years ago.The naming of the campaign committee chief almost a year-and-a-half before elections is also considered unusual unless the party is attempting to quell discontentment, if any.Both Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah have made no secret of their aspirations for the chief minister’s post, should the party come to power in the 2023 assembly elections. There are, however, several other smaller factions within the Congress who continue to align with either of the two leaders or are maintaining a neutral stance at least till the elections.The infighting in the Congress has not allowed the party to take full advantage of the crisis within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government by Basavaraj Bommai in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mb-patil-to-lead-k-taka-cong-campaign-committee-101643135550429.html

26-01-2022||India||Hijab row: Karnataka considering code on college uniforms, says minister||Karnataka minister for home affair Araga Jananendra on Tuesday said that the government is planning to bring a uniform code for all colleges in the coming days. The statement comes after a controversy erupted over students being denied entry to classroom, in a Udupi government pre-university college, for wearing hijab. Talking to the media, Jananendra said, “If students start behaving like religion is more important, then what sort of future are we building? There must be a universal feeling in our schools and colleges that we all are Indians. So, they should all follow the uniform code set by colleges. We have a plan to bring in uniforms in all colleges.” Education minister BC Nagesh hinted at possible changes in the uniform code in the state. “Following the controversy, we had sought information from the college in Udupi and found that the school development and monitoring committee (SDMC) had introduced a uniform code in the school in 1985. So far, there has been no problem,” he said. “We will look into the decisions of other states in such matters (allowing hijab) and court verdicts, following which we will take further steps. Till then, all colleges /schools will continue with the current norms they have set, including the one in Udupi,” he said. Department of pre-university education director Snehal R said that the department is yet to formulate any recommendation for the proposal. “We will see if we can propose a uniform, probably from the upcoming academic year,” she said. Talking about the government’s proposal, former Rajya Sabha MP and chairman of KK Educational Institutions K Rahman Khan said that in a culturally diverse country like India such a rule would be against the constituency. “In a diverse society, it is impossible to bring uniformity, especially in cultural aspects. For example, Sikh community members are allowed to wear a beard and turban. That is because Article 29 and 26 is very clear on these factors. The education minister could say anything but our constitution protects our diversity,” he said. Lawyer-cum-activist Kasturi Shankar questioned the sudden implementation of ban on hijab in the college. “Legally speaking when there is no consistent law in place, and there has been a precedence of people wearing hijab in the past, you can’t precipitously introduce enforcement when it has been not done previously especially in government institutions,” she said. Meanwhile, Campaign Against Hate Speech, a social initiative, has initiated a signature drive condemning discrimination against hijab-wearing Muslim students. They are calling it a blatant violation of Article 25 of the Constitution. The campaign has garnered over 1,000 signatures so far. “In the last few years, especially in coastal Karnataka region, there has seen an increase in Hindutva violence against minority communities. The denial of entry for hijab-wearing Muslim students is an instance of institutional discrimination,” read a statement from the Bengaluru based organisation. The ll-India Lawyers Association For Justice too has written to the state government, demanding an investigation against the college administration. “The actions of the college administration and staff against the students is per se violative of the fundamental rights of the students. It is important to remember that the Constitution recognizes that every person has the right to be treated equally (Article 14), to live with dignity (Article 21), a right to education (Article 21) and profess a religion of their choice (Article 25). The constitutional value of being able to profess one’s religion freely and live with dignity has time and again been emphasised by the courts in various judgments,” read a statement from the association.
26-01-2022||India||The republic is at an economic crossroads||India will complete 75 years of its freedom on August 15 this year. This important milestone deserves a critical appraisal of the progress we have made as a nation. However, the larger framework that guided our nation-building project in the political, economic and social realms only came into being when we adopted our constitution on January 26, 1950. As India celebrates its 73rd Republic Day today, it is useful to take stock of the economic journey of the country.What should be the guiding principle for such an exercise? The original preamble of the constitution – the 42nd amendment in 1976 inserted the word socialist in it – provides for an interesting tension in the economic trajectory of the republic. The constitution seeks to make India a sovereign republic, but also calls for ensuring social, economic and political justice. Sovereignty, when seen purely from an economic perspective, can be roughly described as growth in economic power of a country. This is best captured by GDP levels in the modern world.But is growth a harbinger of equality?Economists often argue that the two might actually be more congruent in the long-term. Simon Kuznets, the Nobel Prize winning American economist, is the most famous and influential proponent of this view. He theorized that inequality first increased and then decreased with increase in per capita incomes.The experience of China seems to support Kuznets’ larger message. The Chinese state, although a communist dictatorship, has done well to achieve high economic growth and also achieved a sharp reduction in poverty in the past few decades.Did too much democracy actually act as an impediment to economic growth in India? Does it continue to do so? The government being forced to repeal the farm laws due to persistent political protests (read democracy) last year can be held out as one such example by those who believe that those laws would have boosted farm incomes. After all, given India’s democratic framework, no government would like to sacrifice itself by pushing policies that have widespread political opposition.The growth-equality tension is not the only one within the constitutional framework. The constitution envisions India as a union of states. Fiscal federalism is among the founding principles of the republic. Has the federal framework helped our economic journey in the past seven decades? Or, did it create more hurdles in the march to economic prosperity? What should be the way forward?While the word socialism made a de-jure entry into the constitution during the infamous emergency, it is no secret that India’s economic policies, at least in the first few decades after independence were heavily influenced by the economics of the socialist countries.From India’s Soviet Union inspired Five Year Plans – the constitution did not provide for a Planning Commission – to the commanding heights of the economy being an exclusive preserve of the state, India’s so-called mixed economy framework had a strong socialist flavour. Was this pro-state tilt in economic policy a costly mistake? Is it time to wind up the already reduced state presence in economic activities even more?These are all questions that evoke strong and extremely polarized reactions in India’s public debates. The truth, as is often the case, lies not in a black and white approach to any of these questions. In fact, the experience of the past seven decades shows that when it comes to the economic well-being of the republic, the best foot forward must be decided by deliberating on the situation at hand, rather than blindly accepting or rejecting the policies of the past. This argument is best made by a set of examples.Shunning the private sector, and shunning a part of the private sector, both have hurt growthWere our founding fathers wrong in adopting a state-led, plan-based model of economic growth at the time of independence? That such a model was chosen may have to do with no other option being available. Private capital in India did not have the economic prowess to undertake large-scale economic activity after independence and in fact wanted to state to take up this job. The 1944 Bombay Plan document (it was a private proposal for economic development in post-independence India by some of the biggest industrialists of the time) is testimony to this fact.However, what started as a state-led model of last resort ended up mutating into an economic system which created absurd controls on private sector activity that were counterproductive. Most of these fetters were dismantled when India unleashed large-scale economic reforms in 1991. Have reforms been unambiguously good for the cause of economic growth?The answer would have been a big yes if we were asking this question a decade ago. However, a fall in compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of GDP in the past 10 years – this holds even if we exclude the pandemic year – shows that economic growth needs more than just reforms.There is a widespread belief among independent economists today that the slowdown in economic growth in the second half of the last decade is the result of a policy induced squeeze on the informal sector in India. The larger message to be drawn from this trend is that while the pre-reform economic regime fell behind time in realizing the importance of private capital in India, the current regime may have faltered in trying to get ahead of time in wishing away the informal sector in the country.State is not just about welfare, its economic footprint also brings a lot of positive externalitiesThe pandemic has taught even the most ardent free marketers the importance of welfare spending. In India, it brought to the fore the gross deficiencies in our public health system, as people struggled to access lifesaving medical care. Criticism of India’s poor track record in providing basic social services such as health and education to its people is not something new. For example, economist Amartya Sen has had a longstanding critique of India’s post-independence economic strategy being obsessed with physical production rather than human development.Should the state then focus on just basic social services such as health and education? Has the time come for the state to finally withdraw from purely economic sectors such as banking? It has already withdrawn from the manufacturing economy to a large extent. The answer to this question must keep in mind among the most important and often under-appreciated concept in economics, that of externalities.The state, when it enters an economic activity, does not just operate on a profit motive, and while not doing so, does a lot of work which strictly profit-driven firms would not do. The social capital which India’s public sector based industrial towns gave to the newly emerging middle class is one such positive externality.Even today, the state’s presence is critical to realizing many of the ambitious inclusion programmes governments wants to pursue. For example, private sector banks – which are generally more profitable and efficient compared to their public sector counterparts – accounted for only 13 million out of the total 444 million beneficiaries of the government’s Jan Dhan Yojna, a no frills banking scheme. Would the scheme have been as successful had the public sector banks not taken this task on themselves, disregarding the profitability of the exercise? It will be naïve to think that state withdrawal from any critical sector will not unleash effects in the realm of externalities.Political competition and the short-termism in the state’s economic approachWith political calculations driving economic decisions, long-term problems which involve taking on politically important communities have mostly been kicked down the road.India’s half-hearted approach to land reforms immediately after independence was an outcome of the Congress’s dependence on local landowners for its political needs. A radical redistribution of land – even the US-led capitalist block promoted land reforms in some south-east Asian countries after the second world war – would have reduced economic inequality and given a boost to domestic demand. This is a reform that has lost its relevance today as landholdings have become extremely fragmented with time.Similarly, a large number of problems – environmentally unsustainable farm practices, pending dues of electricity distribution companies and skewed procurement from just a few states are some – associated with the existing agricultural subsidy regime in India are rooted in the fact that almost all political parties promote such behaviour during local elections.While the agriculture example is more relatable, political short-termism driving economic policy is a much larger problem for the Indian economy. The tendency to dilute environmental safeguards to expedite private investment, governments (especially at the state level) announcing a large number of cash-transfer schemes even as resource requirements on critical fronts are ignored, and the political temptation to use reservations as a silver bullet for all economic problems, are more such examples.However, at a time when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as the new national political hegemon is seeking to squeeze regional political formations in state through the twin strategies of politically leveraging welfare schemes like never before and gaining an unprecedented lead in political funding (largely from big capital), such desperate attempts are only likely to increase. Given the increasing importance of spending by the states, this means a growing short-termism in resource allocation by the state.It is in handling these three pitfalls – the state’s urge to dictate terms to the market, treating its own economic activities on par with the private sector and prioritizing short-term political gain over long-term interests, especially of sustainability – that the economic future of the Indian republic will depend.
26-01-2022||India||Recommitting to India’s core values||A republic is not a monarchy. If the head of State is elected, rather than elevated by virtue of birth, the technical definition of a Republic is met. But what distinguishes the Republic of India from other republics, including the one to its north (People’s Republic of China) and to its west (Islamic Republic of Pakistan), is the fact that it is a democratic republic.A democratic republic has an abiding political commitment to a fundamental principle: Sovereignty rests with citizens and only with citizens, not with the Crown, not with a foreign empire, not with a political party, not with a despot, not with the army, and not even with a democratically elected, supremely popular leader. A democratic republic translates this principle through a Constitution that creates both popular and independent institutions: Popularly elected institutions ensure that people’s sovereign will is reflected in the exercise of power through representatives; independent institutions ensure that this power is not exercised arbitrarily by the same representatives, and is subject to checks and balances, laws and rules.A democratic republic is invested in nurturing republican values: Of equality, so that all citizens, irrespective of their ethnic, religious, caste, class, and gender identities, have the same rights, and are not subject to discrimination, even as there is a conscious effort to create opportunities for those who have been historically disadvantaged. Of liberty, so that all citizens can exercise the freedom of speech, of thought, of assembly, of association, of religion, of practicing their vocation, and lead lives the way they want to, subject to limited reasonable restrictions. Of fraternity, where citizens find ways to relate to each other, develop empathy, and see themselves, voluntarily, as a collective. And of justice, in its broadest sense, where citizens have protection, through the rule of law, against both the excesses of the State and that of fellow citizens, and where there is the State’s helping hand to enable them to battle socioeconomic hurdles and live a life of dignity. On this day, 73 years ago, India embraced this vision of a democratic republic, based on work done by members of the Constituent Assembly. By any parameter, this was a remarkably ambitious enterprise. But it was even more ambitious given the context.India had just emerged from two centuries of oppressive colonial rule where people were seen as subjects, not citizens, and they had neither exercised freedom nor self-rule. Yet, the Constitution granted universal adult franchise on Day 1, and ensured all citizens could vote; all citizens were also free, equally free, and their fundamental rights were legally protected. India had never had a unified, modern political and administrative State governing over the entire territory that constituted the country’s post-Independence borders. Yet, the Constitution envisaged a State apparatus that would secure citizens, ensure order, protect rights and enable socioeconomic justice across the incredibly diverse landscape.India had just undergone a violent Partition with tremendous human suffering, there was a political fracture based on religion, and anger and bitterness permeated the mood. Yet, the drafters of the Constitution ensured that equal rights for all citizens and a non-discriminatory and non-denominational State were integral ideas to the constitutional compact. Indian society had never known equality, given its deeply hierarchical and stratified nature due to caste. Yet, the Constitution banned untouchability and ensured that each citizen enjoyed the same rights with those who had suffered one of the worst forms of indignity known to human civilisation being given extra room to create a level-playing field.When judged against its own republican ideals, how has India fared?The democratic republic gets its highest score when it comes to protecting the idea of popular sovereignty. As post-colonial republics, from Asia to Africa, fell under the sway of military regimes or authoritarian despots, turned into ethnocracies or fragmented, not only did India stay united, it stayed democratic. Every five years, since 1951, except for the brief interregnum of the Emergency, India’s citizens got to choose their representatives for Parliament; at regular intervals, they also elected their representatives for state legislatures and local bodies.There can be a debate on the distortions in the electoral system, or whether the first-past-the-post system accurately reflects the will of the people. There can also be a debate on the urgent reforms India’s electoral system needs. But it is undeniable that elections have largely been free and fair; the electoral system has popular sanction and legitimacy; and there has always been peaceful transfer of power, indicating that all warring sides in the battlefield of Indian democracy abide by the rules of the game, which cannot be said about advanced democracies, including the United States, anymore. If you do not like a government, Indian democracy offers you enough political space to set up or join a party, make a political argument, electorally mobilise a constituency, and defeat the incumbent. And this is true of this particular moment in India’s democratic evolution too.Where India gets a mixed score is in quality and performance of its republican institutions.India’s legislature, executive and judiciary have broadly stayed true to their functions, and independent institutions have made the Indian system resilient over the decades.But, in terms of separation of powers, there is a design flaw. In a parliamentary democracy, citizens elect representatives. These representatives then chose their leaders in the House. The political force which commands a majority of representatives in the legislature then gets to constitute the executive branch of the government. So the executive springs from the legislature, but is also accountable to it. There is a delicate balance here. Members of the legislature are meant to make laws, and keep an eye on the political executive, even if they are political colleagues from the same side of the aisle. Members of the political executive, who constitute the council of ministers, are meant to help frame laws, but their primary task is in executing the law and providing day-to-day governance, while carefully abiding by the diktats of the House. And the judiciary is meant to stay completely, fiercely independent, keeping an eye on both legislative and executive actions to see if it conforms to constitutional test.In India, ever since 1950, the executive has been the most powerful of the three branches. When political power is somewhat diffuse, then the legislature can perform its role of holding the executive accountable, or the judiciary can stay immune to the larger political ecosystem. When political power is concentrated, then the legislature pales in relation to the executive. This, in turn, is due to the nature of Indian political parties (none of which are truly democratic; members of parliament are beholden to party bosses) and draconian laws (which prohibit a parliamentarian from exercising independent judgment). The judiciary, too, with all due respect, gets a tad too influenced in the face of an excessively powerful executive. And this is true of all other institutions, from the armed forces to the Election Commission, from the Reserve Bank to the Finance Commission. Their professionalism and autonomy is often inversely proportional to the might of the political executive of the day. This institutional dynamic is not unique to the current moment in Indian politics, but it is amplified because of the fact that India has the most powerful political executive in close to five decades. India needs a more healthy balance between its institutions.Where India has made progress, but still has a long way to go, is in the realm of deepening republican values. The big picture, of course, is that compared to 1950, primordial identities matter less and Indians across castes, religions, and gender are less bound by structural barriers. Affirmative action has helped, constitutional protections have helped, and the public sector, market forces, education and urbanisation have all played a role in enhancing incomes, reducing poverty and creating opportunities. Indians today are also more free to exercise their individual freedom and make choices. There is also greater interaction between individuals from diverse regions, communities, castes and religions than there ever was in Indian history, aided by media and connectivity. Yet, behind this story of progress is a moment of pessimism. The most underrated of republican values is the idea of fraternity. State-encouraged and media-amplified religious majoritarianism has caused a rupture in Hindu-Muslim ties; new media have deepened polarisation and made civil conversation between contending points of view hard; the us versus them political binary is now extended to every social sphere. Back in 2018, political scientist Devesh Kapur, writing in Seminar Magazine, warned about the “fragility of fraternity”; it has grown even more fragile since. Indians today are also, arguably, less free than they have been in recent decades, especially if they are opposed to the regime of the day. And the test of liberty is whether a dissenter is truly free. Draconian laws and the clampdown on civil liberties has hurt India’s liberal democratic record and triggered uncomfortable questions at home and abroad. India today also faces an acute challenge of growing economic inequality, a trend exacerbated by the pandemic. And whether you get justice is often a function of your identity, income bracket, political standing and views. But given what a leap India has made in these seven decades, it is entirely possible that India will be able to overcome its current challenges – and recommit to the republican idea of popular sovereignty, the republican architecture of popular and accountable institutions, and republican values of equality, liberty, fraternity and justice. That would be the finest tribute to those who created a modern constitutional compact for a free India and its free citizens.

No traveller will need to self-isolate on arrival, and will only need to do so if they test positive.“All testing measures for eligible fully vaccinated travellers arriving in the UK will be removed from 4 am on 11 February, as the government goes one step further to reopen the travel sector,” the statement said. The changes, announced on January 24, mean that the UK “has one of the most free-flowing borders across Europe in addition to having the most open economy and society.”The changes in travel rules will be in place ahead of the February half term for educational institutions and follow the success of Britain’s booster programme, the statement added. The UK government is able to reduce the number of travel restrictions due to the success of the Covid-19 vaccine and booster rollout in the country.Before the end of February, eligible fully vaccinated travellers will only need to fill a simplified passenger locator form that will confirm their vaccination status, travel history and contact details.For inward travel, all under-18s, regardless of their individual vaccination status, will continue to be considered as fully vaccinated.The new framework aims to provide stability for travellers and the travel industry throughout 2022, and will result in savings of around £100 for an average family with the removal of testing.“We made the right calls at the right time, and thanks to our vaccine and booster rollout, it’s paying off, allowing us to safely remove nearly all Covid-19 travel restrictions for vaccinated travellers,” UK transport secretary Grant Shapps said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indians-to-benefit-from-new-changes-in-uk-covid-19-travel-rules-101643134408880.html

26-01-2022||India||Top Padma honours for Gen Rawat, Kalyan Singh||India’s first chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh, Gita Press chairman Radheyshyam Khemka, and renowned vocalist Prabha Atre were on Tuesday awarded the Padma Vibhushan, the country’s second-highest civilian honour.The government announced 128 Padma awards on the eve of Republic Day, including 17 Padma Bhushans and 107 Padma Shri honours. Thirty-four of the awardees were women.Some of India’s top vaccine manufacturers featured in the list, including Serum Institute of India chairman Cyrus Poonawalla and Bharat Biotech founders Krishna Ella and Suchitra Ella. They were awarded the Padma Bhushan, India’s third-highest civilian honour.Alphabet Inc chief Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Tata Sons chairman Natarajan Chandrasekharan were conferred with the Padma Bhushan.“No nation can excel without the contribution of selfless individuals working tirelessly to serve society. Congratulations to all those who have been conferred with the Padma Awards. PM (Narendra) Modi ji is committed to honouring our real heroes,” Union home minister Amit Shah said.“It makes you very happy when the audience notices your thought process behind the songs and compositions. I am thankful for receiving such support and acceptance,” Atre said.“It is a great privilege for me to be amongst a prestigious list of illustrious people who have contributed to the growth of our country,” said Poonawalla.Actor Victor Banerjee, artist Rashid Khan, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and former West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee were also named for the honour, though the Left leader later said he declined the award.“I do not know anything about the Padma Bhushan award. Nobody said anything to me about this. If I have been given the award then I refuse it,” Bhattacharjee said in a short statement.Rawat was India’s longest serving four-star general who was killed in helicopter crash last month. He was headed to the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington when his chopper crashed in Tamil Nadu on December 8. His wife Madhulika Rawat and 12 other personnel also died in the crash.Former union home secretary Rajiv Mehrishi, who later became the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), was among 17 Padma Bhushan awardees. Others in the list were Punjabi folk singer Gurmeet Bawa, chef and food journalist Madhur Jaffrey, two-time Paralympics gold-medalist Devendra Jhajharia, India-born Mexican scientist Sanjaya Rajaram and Swami Sachidanand, known for his work in disaster relief.Tokyo Olympics gold medallist Neeraj Chopra led the Padma Shri honours, which also included paralympic gold medallists Sumit Antil, Pramod Bhagat and Avani Lekhara.Singer Sonu Nigam, author Najma Akhtar, Kathak duo Kamalini Asthana and Nalini Asthana; Garhwali folk singer Madhuri Barthwal, author Harmohinder Singh Bedi and Gandhian social worker Shakuntala Choudhary were among other awardees.Others in the list included Chandraprakash Dwivedi, a national award winning director and actor best known for playing Chanakya, distinguished economist Shaibal Gupta, hockey player Vandana Kataria, senior bureaucrat Guruprasad Mohapatra, who carried out his assigned charge of ensuring oxygen availability during Covid even from his hospital bed before finally succumbing to the virus,Narendra Prasad Mishra, a senior doctor known for treating victims of the 1984 Bhopal Gas tragedy, Sheesh Ram, a 1971 war veteran, former Indian football team captain Brahmanand Sankhwalkar, Russian scholar Tatiana Lvovna Shaumyan and Punjab spiritual leader Baba Iqbal Singh were among the other names.The Union home ministry said these awards were given in various disciplines or fields of activities such as art, social work, public affairs, science and engineering, trade and industry, medicine, literature and education, sports, and civil service. Padma Vibhushan was awarded for exceptional and distinguished service; Padma Bhushan for distinguished service of high order and Padma Shri for distinguished service in any field.The awards also stirred controversy late on Tuesday evening after Bhattacharjee declined the honour.A senior home ministry official said a call was made to the residence of Bhattacharjee on Tuesday morning, which was picked by his wife, and she was informed about his Padma award. There is no provision of taking consent for giving Padma awards to anyone; the awardees are only informed after the decision has been made.Bhattacharjee, who was the chief minister of Bengal from 2000 to 2011, is not well and largely confined to his home in Kolkata. His predecessor, Jyoti Basu, had also refused the Bharat Ratna in 2008.“Right thing to do. He wants to be Azad not Ghulam,” said Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, in an apparent reference to Ghulam Nabi Azad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-padma-honours-for-gen-rawat-kalyan-singh-101643134231602.html
26-01-2022||India||Ex-Union minister RPN Singh junks Congress for BJP||Congress leader and former Union minister RPN Singh, 57, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday, explaining his decision to switch sides as being prompted by the work Prime Minister Narendra Modi was doing for the country, and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath for the state, and as “better late than never”.He resigned from the primary membership of the Congress on Tuesday and sent a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. “This is a new beginning for me and I look forward to my contribution to nation building under the visionary leadership and guidance of PM Narendra Modi, BJP President JP Nadda, and home minister Amit Shah,” he said soon after on TwitterSingh, the former MP from Padrauna, in Uttar Pradesh, is from the Sainthwar royal family that ruled the region once, although he lost the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections. He is from the Kurmi community, and considered a strong other backward classes (OBC) leader, and it is believed the BJP may use him to counter some of its OBC leaders who recently shifted to the Samajwadi Party. His induction into the BJP comes weeks ahead of the elections in Uttar Pradesh. In the 2009 Lok Sabha election, he defeated Swami Prasad Maurya, then of the BSP; Maurya subsequently moved to the BJP and is one of the OBC leaders who recently quit the party.Interestingly, Singh’s move comes a day after he was named as a star campaigner by the party for the assembly elections beginning next month. He is among several other Congress leaders who have shifted loyalties to the BJP in recent months. Between 2004 and 2014, he was considered part of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s inner circle, and widely seen as a next-generation leader of the party along with Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin Pilot, Milind Deora, and Jitin Prasada. Scindia joined the BJP in 2020, and Prasada, last year.On Tuesday, along with Singh, Shashi Walia and Rajendra Awana also joined the BJP.Addressing the media, Singh said that the party that he worked for with dedication and honesty for 32 years is not the same anymore.“It is not the same party where I began and it is not the same ideology...,” he said, without naming the Congress, and added that he is ready to work as an ordinary party worker with PM Narendra Modi.“The whole country appreciates the work that has been done by our PM, bringing the (glory of India’s) old civilisation together with the 21st century...”He also commented that for years people had been asking him to join the BJP. “I can say der aaye durust aaye (better late than never).”Singh, also praised the Modi and Yogi governments for bringing a change in the state’s law and order.Earlier, while welcoming Singh into the party fold, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who is also the BJP’s person in charge of the UP election said he was keen the former Congressman join the BJP. Scindia, now the Union minister of aviation was also present at the event.The Congress reacted sharply to Singh’s defection.“This battle (against the central government) can only be fought with courage and bravery. Because, this battle is against a repressive government, its arrogance, its agencies, capitalism and all types of allegations…,” said Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate. Taking a dig at Singh, she said, “Only a coward can jump to a party with a completely opposite ideology.”Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra also slammed Singh over his resignation on Twitter. Without naming him, she tweeted: “ Heavyweight or Deadweight? Those who have not won a seat in over a decade moving to BJP on election eve.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exunion-minister-junks-cong-for-bjp-101643134112872.html
26-01-2022||India||Chill is on for Delhi: Jan days coldest in 19 years||The bitter cold that has gripped Delhi through January, leading to several weeks where the maximum temperature has been unrelenting, has caused the second coldest spell of winter recorded in the city in more than seven decades, and the coldest start to a year in 19 years, data analysed by HT showed.Delhi is also currently also in the middle of the sixth longest spell of consecutive days since 1951 where the day temperature has been significantly below levels considered normal, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) gridded data set. And if forecasts are any indication, this spell is only likely to become longer.The average maximum temperature in Delhi from the start of the year up to January 24 is 16.9 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD data. Since 1951, only the January 1 to January 24 period in 2003, when the average was 15.8 degrees Celsius, was colder, it shows.To be sure, the calculation for average temperature excludes the maximum temperature reading from Tuesday, which was 12.1 degrees Celsius at Delhi’s base weather station Safdarjung, according to IMD. Once the numbers from Tuesday is taken into account, it is likely to further bring down the average day temperature.This average figure, however, masks what has been experienced by Delhiites in the past 11 days. The maximum temperature from January 14 has been less than normal by 25% or more on every day except the three-day period from January 19 to January 21. Four of these 11 days – January 14, January 15, January 18, and January 24 – had never been as cold in any year since 1951.These series of records highlight what Delhi residents have been experiencing over the past several weeks – an unrelenting and continuous cold, which sees no relief particularly during the day as sunlight is sparse, if any, leading to gloomy and moisture-laden days which feel a lot colder than what even the thermostat indicates.HT looked through the IMD data for all spells in history where the maximum temperature in the winter was 9% below than normal. There are only eight such spells including the current one. The longest ever cold day spell is 40 days long (November 23, 1997, to January 1, 1998). Others spells where the maximum temperature has dropped significantly were between 17 to 23 days long. The current one is definitely among the colder ones. The average maximum temperature of 15.8 degrees in the current spell is higher only than the average of 15.4 degrees in the 23-day long spell that started on December 31, 2002 and ended on January 22, 2003.The only marginal relief from cold weather Delhi has right now is that average minimum temperature of 8.92 degrees this month has been 2.42 degrees higher than normal. From January 14, when maximum temperatures dropped significantly below normal, minimum temperature has been at least 0.7 degrees or 10% above normal. Since January 20, minimum temperature has been at least 2 degrees or 30% above normal.Daytime temperatures are, however, not expected to improve this week either.The reason for such a cold start to the year, experts say is a rare natural phenomenon – three intense western disturbances just this month have added a heavy amount of moisture in the air, leading to a dense layer of lower-level clouds which has stretched across the entire north India. This has led to heavy snowfall in the Himalayas over the weekend, causing an intense chill through most of the country with the mercury seen dropping in cities as far as away Mumbai and Hyderabad.“We generally see this trend once every four to five years. This time around, we had three active western disturbances between January 3 and 5, January 6 to 9 and more recently, from January 21 till 23, each of which added plenty of moisture and have kept a thick layer of low-clouds hanging over the city,” said RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD.Delhi has already recorded 12 days this month where the maximum temperature was below the 17-degree mark, highlighting the intensity of this cold spell, Jenamani pointed out. Delhi had more such days last in 2003 only, when the capital recorded 19 days in the month of January. “In recent years, this number was higher only in 2003, when Delhi recorded dense fog for the first three weeks,” said Jenamani. He added that Delhi’s maximum is expected to be around 14 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, it will hover around the 16-degree mark on Thursday and Friday.To be sure, IMD’s gridded dataset covers an area bigger than the administrative boundaries of Delhi as it is based on boxes of latitude and longitude a degree apart. Data for Delhi published by IMD in its bulletins gives a more precise measurement of the temperature within Delhi, but is not publicly available for analysis as a historical time series.“Normally, such a low [day temperature] towards the end of January is rare. December was warmer than usual this year though, and we have suddenly seen a flurry of western disturbances in January, with the last one fairly active and leading to instant impact,” said a met official.Owing to these western disturbances, Delhi has already recorded its wettest January ever, with 88.2mm of rainfall received during the month so far.IMD’s forecast for Republic Day at India Gate shows the maximum is expected to hover between 13 and 15 degrees Celsius, while the minimum will hover between 5 and 7 degrees Celsius.Delhi’s air quality meanwhile remained in the ‘poor’ category on Tuesday, with an overall air quality index (AQI) of 234 recorded as per Central Pollution Control Board’s daily 4pm bulletin. It was 241 (poor) on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chill-is-on-for-delhi-jan-days-coldest-in-19-years-101643134047994.html
26-01-2022||India||Better to wind up tribunals if members can’t follow propriety: SC||It is better to wind up tribunals if their members cannot honour the principle of propriety, the Supreme Court said on Tuesday, taking strong exception to a technical member of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) hearing a case involving GAIL (India) Ltd despite having headed GAIL as its chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) in the past.“How can he (member) hear the matter? Whatever it is, how can he hear that matter? It is better to wind up tribunals if things are going to be like this. What about the propriety?” a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, told additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain. The bench, which included justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli,said that since Ashutosh Karnatak, who is presently a technical member at APTEL, worked with GAIL for several decades , it was improper for him to hear and decide cases relating to the natural gas company.“He (Karnatak) worked as an officer with GAIL for so many years. Now, he wants to sit on the bench and decide their cases. This is not proper,” the bench told Jain.Senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the petitioner, Sravanthi Energy Private Limited, told the bench that Karnatak served 38 years with GAIL and was also in-charge of the project as an officer, but was now examining it as an APTEL member. “This bench has decided 17 matters of this nature. I am here because it (the matter) has also been decided against us. Such things cannot be allowed to go on. How can someone like him hear these cases?” Singhvi said. Jain on his part harped upon the “principle of necessity” to state that there are not enough members available in APTEL to hear and decide cases. “Not many benches are available and thus, they had to hear the case.” To this, the bench retorted: “Mr Jain, it is a simple question of propriety. If you think there is no other bench available, you appoint other members and chairman so that they can hear it. It cannot mean that he (Karnatak) can start hearing and deciding such cases.” The bench further told Jain: “We have already made recommendation for appointment of APTEL chairperson and other members. Why don’t you ask your government to appoint them?”At this, Jain submitted that a reply may be sought from the Government of India of appointment of chairperson and members of APTEL since he is not in a position to answer on this aspect. “Alright, if that is so, we will seek an answer from the Government of India why they are not appointing APTEL members. So, we are issuing notice to the government to tell us when they are going to appoint chairman and other members of APTEL,” retorted the bench.It then issued a personal notice to attorney general KK Venugopal to appear on behalf of the Union government on February 15 to apprise the court of the status of appointment. Venugopal represents the government in a separate batch of cases where issues relating to vacancies across various tribunals in the country are being examined by the top court. The top court has been repeatedly pulling up the Central government over the shortage of manpower and lack of infrastructure in consumers courts across the country.The CJI-led bench had in August and September 2021 put the Union government in the dock over “making tribunals virtually defunct” by not filling up vacancies. The government is “emasculating tribunals” by not filling up vacancies in them, it said.While hearing a matter over vacancies in consumer courts, another bench in the top court had in October 2021 reproached the Union government for creating an “imbroglio” over functioning of the tribunals and making “citizens suffer in the bargain”, observing the Centre should abolish all tribunals if the judiciary is compelled to make appointments in these bodies to keep them alive.APTEL is working without a full-time chairperson since August 2021. The appellate tribunal is currently working with three members – one judicial member and two technical members, including Karnatak. Apart from chairperson, the tribunal is also short of a technical member. Sravanthi Energy Private Limited filed a petition against an order of the APTEL in October 2021 relating to enforceability of a capacity tranche agreement between the private firm and GAIL, and payment of ‘ship or pay’ charges by Sravanthi. APTEL ruled in favour of GAIL, prompting the private firm to approach the apex court in appeal.
26-01-2022||India||SC refuses relief to NGOs that missed the FCRA registration cutoff||The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to grant any protection to NGOs that failed to renew their registration with the Foreign Contribution Regulation Authority (FCRA) by the deadline of December 31.Representing the cause of about 6,000 NGOs that failed to renew their FCRA registration, a petition filed by US-based organisation Global Peace Initiative and its founder KA Paul challenged a December 31 notification issued by the home ministry that extended the registration of only those NGOs that had applied within the cutoff date.Most of the NGOs were aggrieved by a new set of regulations introduced by the Centre through amendments in the FCRA Act in September 2020. These amendments required NGOs to disclose the purpose for receiving funds and to open bank accounts with the State Bank of India, which alone could receive foreign funds. Transfer of funds from a registered NGO to an unregistered NGO was barred, as was diverting funds for purposes other than those specified during registration. The new rules also put a cap on administrative expenses.These amendments are under challenge before the Supreme Court, which reserved judgment on a bunch of petitions in November last year. Citing the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the current petition sought an extension of existing FCRA registrations, citing the good work being done by NGOs during the pandemic.A three-judge bench headed by justice AM Khanwilkar refused to grant any interim relief and ordered the petition to be heard after pronouncement of judgment on the FCRA amendments. The bench said, “If these NGOs have not applied for registration, they have chosen not to continue under the current regime.”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Centre, opposed the petition and questioned the locus of the petitioner being an organization registered in Texas, US. He informed the court that the Centre had extended the provisional registration of about 11,594 NGOs which applied within the deadline, till March 2022 pending the judgment by the court.The bench, also comprising justices Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar, recorded the submission of Mehta and said, “We have heard the counsel on the matter of granting interim relief….In the light of the stand taken by the authorities, we do not intend to pass any interim order.”Senior advocate Sanjay Hedge, appearing for the petitioner, told the court that since the extension has been granted to those NGOs which applied within cut-off, the government could provide a window of two weeks to enable the 6,000 NGOs to seek an extension. The bench said, “We will say the matter can wait till judgment. “ However, the Court observed that it will be open to the petitioner to submit a representation in this regard to the government.The petition cited Section 50 of the FCRA Act, which empowers the government to extend the validity of registration of organizations. Such orders were passed by the Centre in favour of certain organizations during the peak of the second wave of Covid-19. The petition argued that similar exigency still exists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-relief-to-ngos-that-missed-the-fcra-registration-cutoff-101643133749533.html
26-01-2022||India||Don’t lower standards any further: SC to Bar Council of India||There are antisocial elements graduating with a degree in law without attending a single class, lamented the Supreme Court on Tuesday, as it implored the Bar Council of India (BCI) to refrain from lowering the standards of entrance exams for law schools. “Look at your entrance exams. You keep lowering your standards. You have to control quality. Don’t keep lowering the quality of entrance exams. Look at how ICAI (Institute of Chartered Accountants of India) does it for Chartered Accountants. They control intake and also the quality. This is high time you should do an introspection,” a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh told BCI’s lawyer.The bench was emphatic that the standards of legal education would not improve until BCI, the apex regulatory body for the legal profession in India, does two things. “You need to adopt a two-pronged approach – tightening of yardsticks in exams and stricter control at entry level. You must do these two things if you want a better standard,” it told advocate SN Bhat, who represented BCI. The court rued that there were certain states where the problem was one of plenty with the mushrooming of law colleges. “We think your problem starts at the law schools. In one state, the number runs into hundred. Where are so many law teachers available? If we may say so, most of these (schools) are fictitious,” remarked the bench.According to the latest statistics available with the BCI, there are around 1,500 law colleges across the country. Private colleges account for almost 75% of the total number of law colleges. In August 2019, the BCI imposed a three-year moratorium on opening new law colleges, resolving it will stress on improving standards of the existing law colleges. The moratorium was however not applicable to establishing a new National Law University if a state proposed it. As per the BCI data, there are 1.7 million registered lawyers in the country and 80,000 to one lakh new advocates get enrolled annually. It added that there were instances of some law colleges in Andhra Pradesh running from “cowsheds and under thatches”. “There is a lot to say about the quality of law colleges...the kind of admissions they provide. There are antisocial elements taking admission in these colleges and they pass out with a degree without attending even a single day in class. This is completely diluting the quality…Person without attending classes gets a law degree…More stringent checks on law schools and more serious criteria of entry are important,” said the court. The bench emphasised that although BCI is authorised under the law to prescribe criteria for admission to law schools and enrolment of lawyers in the country, the current situation requires an intervention by the top court.“Prima facie, we are inclined to make comments on how to improve the system at the entry level. We can always make some recommendations to BCI on their responsibility to hold proper exams and on how to improve the system at entry level...The rigour of your bar exam must test knowledge,” underscored the bench.It also asked BCI to consider suggestions given by senior counsel and amicus curiae KV Viswanathan on enrolment of those who are already gainfully employed in some other profession. Currently, BCI rules prohibit anybody employed in some other profession to be enrolled as a lawyer.The court is hearing an appeal by BCI against an order of the Gujarat high court, which allowed a woman to enroll as an advocate without quitting her job through an order in November 2020. BCI argued that the decision would open floodgates for such requests although the rules specifically state that nobody can enrol as an advocate while being gainfully employed in some other job.
26-01-2022||India||Courts can’t direct states to give reservation: Supreme Court||A court cannot issue directions to a state government to provide for reservation for any class of citizens, the Supreme Court said on Tuesday, quashing a judicial order for reserving 3% seats under the sports quota in government medical and dental colleges in Punjab.“No mandamus (judicial writ) can be issued by the court directing the state government to provide for reservation... Power lies with the State to make a provision but, at the same time, courts cannot issue any mandamus to the State to necessarily make such a provision,” said a bench of justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna while referring to a series of Supreme Court judgments.The bench took a cue from a batch of four judgments between 2010 and 2020 in which the Supreme Court ruled that it is for the state to take a call on providing for reservation for different classes based on various factors and that there cannot be any direction by a court for earmarking quota benefits for any particular class of citizens.Setting aside the 2019 order of the Punjab and Haryana high court, the bench further relied on a recent judgment in 2020 where the top court underscored that apart from not passing a directive to provide for reservation,a court also cannot ask a state to collect quantifiable data to justify reasons for not providing for reservation. “It was observed that even if the under-representation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in public services is brought to the notice of the Court, no mandamus can be issued by the Court to the State Government to provide for reservation. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions to the facts of the case on hand, we are of the opinion that the high court has committed a grave error in issuing a writ of mandamus and directing the state government to provide for 3% reservation for sports persons,” said the bench. It noted that a policy decision was already taken by the Punjab government in July 2019 to provide for 1% reservation for sportsmen. “Therefore, the high court has exceeded its jurisdiction while issuing a writ of mandamus directing the state to provide a particular percentage of reservation for sports persons, namely, in the present case, 3% reservation instead of 1%, while exercising powers under Article 226 (writ jurisdiction) of the Constitution of India,” said the court in its judgment.While allowing a bunch of writ petitions, the high court in August 2019 directed the Punjab government to provide for a sports quota of 3% in government medical and dental colleges instead of 1%.It had also directed the state to extend the benefit of 1% reservation to children and grandchildren of those affected by terrorism and during the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 in private medical colleges as well as for management quota seats. The top court set aside the high court order on the sports quota but refrained from interfering with the other part of the order since the state government had itself come out with a fresh rule providing for 1% reservation for children and grandchildren of those affected by terrorism and during the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 in private medical colleges as well as for management quota seats from the 2021-22 session. “However, the question of law, whether such a direction/writ of mandamus could have been issued is kept open,” added the bench.
26-01-2022||India||Ensure voter turnout touches 75% in upcoming elections: Modi||Citizens and political parties must ensure that voter turnout in the country increases for elections at all levels, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday. He exhorted workers of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to ensure the overall voter turnout in every election is at least 75%. “In the 75th year of India’s independence, we should resolve that we will ensure a 75% turnout for elections,” he said, addressing party workers on the occasion of the National Voters’ Day.Since the first general election, voting percentage has gone up over the years, but is still low and needs attention from all political parties, Modi said. Voting turnout was just 45% in the first election but rose to 67% in 2019, he said. “The percentage of women voters in all the years has gone up. In some places women outnumbered men. But the voting percentage is still low and this needs everyone’s attention,” the Prime Minister said. “All political parties and citizens need to think about this.”He urged BJP workers who are entrusted with the job to make sure voter turnout in the 75th year of India’s independen ce reaches 75%.The theme of this National Voters’ Day is: “Making elections inclusive, accessible, and participative”.There are more than 953 million voters in India, out of which 490 million are male and 460 million are female, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sushil Chandra said. “Among these registered voters, there are 19.2 million senior citizens,” Chandra said, addressing an event in the national capital. The right to vote was bestowed upon every adult citizen of India at the same time as India won her freedom. “For a newly independent country with a literacy rate of 18%, this was a truly radical move,” the CEC said.Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu urged the Election Commission and citizens to ensure a voter turnout of 75% in the next general elections to make electoral democracy more inclusive. He also sought consensus on simultaneous national and state polls to sustain the tempo of development.As Naidu is in home isolation in Hyderabad after testing corona positive, his address was read out at the event in New Delhi. “In the 75th year of our Independence, let us resolve to leave no voter behind and aim to increase the voter turnout to at least 75% in the next general elections. Let each one realise that vote is not only a right but a responsibility. We, as a nation, must think and arrive at a consensus to have simultaneous polls to all the three tiers of federal set up and move towards better governance by focusing our attention on all-around development of our people,” he said.The Congress party congratulated the people on the occasion. “On the National Voters Day today, we congratulate the people of India for keeping the spirit of democracy alive,” the party said on its official Twitter handle.Meanwhile, in his address to the BJP workers, Modi expressed concern that in the urban areas where people have better education and more resources, voter apathy continues and voting percentage is low. “This needs to change in a vibrant democracy like India,” he said. He also commended the election commission for various initiatives to increase voter participation. He said the commission has made it possible for people to register as voters four times a year and has made provisions for postal ballots for those above 80 and for people with disabilities.On the issue of one nation, one election, an idea that he supports, Modi said discussions on doing away with elections at frequent intervals should continue. He said in a democracy, discussion lead to churning and the issue of how frequent elections affect development needs to be debated. “Because of frequent elections, every move is seen through the political prism. For instance, today I wanted to reach out to the Panna Pramukhs and speak to party workers, but I noticed on social media some people commented that Modi is already thinking of elections,” he said. The Prime Minister urged the BJP workers to connect with every family on their voter lists, encourage people to participate in the BJP’s micro-donation drive and search them to ensure they participate in the government’s programme to weed out malnutrition.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-voter-turnout-touches-75-in-upcoming-elections-modi-to-citizens-parties-101643132914671.html
26-01-2022||India||Supreme Court notice to Centre, EC on plea over pre-poll freebies||Terming unrealistic poll promises and hand outs a “serious issue” that “disturbs the level-playing field”, the Supreme Court on Tuesday asked for explanations from the Union government and the Election Commission of India (ECI) on steps taken by them since the court’s 2013 judgment to regulate electoral promises and distribution of freebies by political parties using public funds. A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, issued notices to the Centre and ECI on a public interest litigation filed by advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, who sought a direction for issuance of stringent guidelines to deregister errant political parties and seize their election symbols over offering “irrational freebies” ahead of polls.“This is no doubt a serious issue. Budget for freebies is going above the regular budget. As the Supreme Court said before, this disturbs the level playing field,” observed the bench, which included justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli. Admitting Upadhyay’s petition, the court sought replies from the Centre and ECI within four weeks. During the proceedings, senior counsel Vikas Singh, representing Upadhyay, contended that parties, even in debt-ridden states, were promising or distributing freebies to garner votes, creating an uneven playing field before the elections. Singh added that ECI had framed certain guidelines as per the court’s direction in 2013 judgment but that these were “toothless” .“There are states such as Punjab where every individual has an average debt of more than ₹3 lakh with state owing more than ₹ 2.8 lakh crore in debt. Even there the political parties are promising freebies. Ultimately, who is suffering? Citizens are suffering. And every party is doing this,” argued Singh. At this, the bench asked Singh to read out from the Supreme Court’s judgment in S Subramaniam Balaji vs Government of Tamil Nadu & Ors in July, 2013, in which the issue of election manifesto and freebies were dealt with.After Singh read out a couple of relevant paragraphs from the 2013 judgment, the bench intervened to state that the court had then underscored the need to have a separate legislation “for governing the political parties in our democratic society” but it appeared that this has not been passed to date. Striking a cautious note, the bench asked Singh: “Now, when there is no legislation, how do we manage it? Assuming we issue a notice and the EC will reply, but explain how we are going to control all this? You answer this as a question of law.”“Within the limited scope, we directed the Election Commission to frame guidelines. But subsequently, they conducted only one meeting after our directions. They sought views from political parties and thereafter we do not know what happened,” added the bench.Singh responded that Upadhyay’s petition is seeking curbs on freebies for future and therefore, the central government and ECI should be called upon to furnish explanations on the steps taken by them in the spirit of the 2013 judgment.Accepting Singh’s submissions, the bench proceeded to issue notices to the Centre and ECI: “We want to have a legal debate on how to control this...for the time being, we will see what the Union government and the Election Commission have to say.”In the 2013 judgment, the top court had said that distribution of freebies of any kind, undoubtedly, influences all people. “It shakes the root of free and fair elections to a large degree. The Election Commission through its counsel also conveyed the same feeling both in the affidavit and in the argument that the promise of such freebies at government cost disturbs the level playing field and vitiates the electoral process and thereby expressed willingness to implement any directions or decision of this Court in this regard,” that judgement said. The court held in the 2013 judgement that promises in the election manifesto cannot be construed as “corrupt practice“ under the Representation of People Act or under any other prevailing law and hence, distribution of freebies can’t be stopped when the ruling party uses public funds for this purpose through passage of Appropriation Acts in state assembly. At the same time, the court noted that there is no enactment that directly governs the contents of the election manifesto, and directed ECI to frame guidelines for the same in consultation with all the recognised political parties. Upadhyay relied upon the 2013 judgment to complain that the promise or distribution of freebies from public funds before election unduly influences the voters, shakes the roots of free and fair elections, disturbs level playing field and vitiates the purity of election process.The plea pointed out that ECI’s guidelines said that while there could be no objection to the promise of welfare measures in election manifestos, political parties should avoid making promises which are likely to vitiate the purity of the election process or exert undue influence on the voters in exercising their franchise.“Arbitrary promises of irrational freebies violated the ECI’s mandate for free and fair elections, and distributing private goods-services, which were not for public purposes, from public funds clearly violated the Constitution,” added Upadhyay’s petition.The fulcrum of democracy is the electoral process, said the petition, adding that if the integrity of electoral process is compromised then the notion of representation becomes vacuous. 
26-01-2022||India||Maharashtra: MLA’s son among 7 medical students killed in Wardha accident||Seven medical students were killed in Maharashtra’s Wardha district when the car they were travelling in fell off a bridge near Selsura village early on Tuesday, police said, adding that the deceased included the son of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator. Superintendent of police, Wardha, Prashant Holkar, said the students were returning after a late-night party to their hostel rooms of the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College at Sawangi (Meghe) in Wardha, when the driver of the car lost control and rammed into a bridge. The car, an SUV, fell into the Bhadari river and all seven died on the spot, the SP added.According to the police, the incident took place around 1.30am near Selsura village in Wardha, 120km from Nagpur One of the deceased students, Avishkar Rahangdale (22), was the son of BJP MLA from Tirora, Vijay Rahangdale. He was a first-year MBBS student of the college in Wardha. Police said the SUV was being driven by one of the students, and that they were  returning from neighbouring Yavatmal district after celebrating the birthday of a student. The other six deceased have been identified as Niteesh Kumar Singh from Belapur in Odisha, Vivek Nandan and Pawan Shakti (both from Gaya in Bihar), Niraj Chauhan, from Daudpur in Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh),  and Pratyush Singh and Shubham Jaiswal from Chandauli (Uttar Pradesh). Police said all the dead were in their 20s. Wardha sub-divisional police officer Piyus Jagtap said priliminary probe suggested that the vehicle was “running at a speed of more than 120 mph”. “That must have been the reason behind the accident,” he said.“We also feel that the vehicle driver was under the influence of liquor. However, we are awaiting the post mortem report,” he added. All the bodies were sent to the Wardha civil hospital for postmortem. Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended condolences and announced an ex-gratia of ₹2 lakh each for the kin of the deceased. “PM Narendar Modi announced that ₹2 lakh each from PMNRF would be given to the next of kin of those who have lost their lives in the accident near Selsura. Those who are injured would be given ₹50,000,” the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtramlas-son-among-7-medical-students-killed-in-wardha-accident-101643132849083.html
26-01-2022||India||9 states told to boost Covid testing, vaccination||Amid a spike in daily Covid-19 cases, health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday directed nine states and Union territories to ramp up testing and ensure full vaccination in districts that have shown a lower coverage.“Cannot help but re-emphasise the need for ramping up testing in the states and UTs. Those states/UTs that are showing a lower share of RT-PCR are requested to ramp up tests,” the health minister said after a review meeting with health ministers, bureaucrats and administrators of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Chandigarh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Delhi, Ladakh and Uttar Pradesh.“Also, keep a close watch on the emerging clusters and hot spots and monitor the trend of hospitalised cases along with the deaths in the state,” he said. The minister stressed that vaccination continued to remain a potent tool to fight the virus.“Vaccinated people are less prone to severity and hospitalisation as seen in India and globally. Higher hospitalisation is being seen in unvaccinated people and hence, it becomes crucial to vaccinate the unvaccinated,” he said.“Promote vaccination among the 15-18 age group and ensure full coverage in the districts that have shown a lower coverage of the first and second doses,” he added. Reiterating that the Centre is dedicated to supporting states and UTs in containment and management of Covid-19, the minister advised them to review and expedite the implementation of activities under the emergency covid relief package-II for strengthening the health infrastructure. “With strengthened health infrastructure, we can meet any health emergency and public health crisis with better preparedness. Ensure regular updation of availability, occupancy and use of infrastructure like hospital beds, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants, oxygen equipment on the Covid-19 portal- https://covid19.nhp.gov.in/. This updation would help in obtaining a bigger picture and taking data-driven decisions at several levels for efficient public health response,” he said.Mandaviya asked states to focus on expanding the reach of teleconsultation services to ensure timely healthcare as a substantial number of Covid-19 patients were found recuperating in home isolation. As per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s latest guidelines, asymptomatic contacts of a laboratory confirmed Covid-19 case do not require testing unless they are at risk due to their age (if they are older than 60) or if they suffer from certain underlying medical conditions such as diabetes. “(The government’s) eSanjeevani has been able to provide services to more than 2.6 crore beneficiaries where people can seek medical advice from the confines of their homes. This will be of immense value and importance for the hard-to-reach and far flung areas, and especially in the northern regions in the current winter season. Such expert advice can be provided at the block levels, secondary or primary health centre levels too,” he said. 
26-01-2022||India||UP elections: In Mathura, murmurs of dissent over local issues, farm laws||Just outside Gate No. 1 of the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi temple in Mathura, 45-year-old Sarvesh Dubey has pulled out his phone to prove a point.Dubey and a group of six men, as they do everyday, have collected at the Krishna Mishthan Bhandar, asweets shopwith a name understandably ubiquitous in a town considered the birthplace of the Hindu god, and are discussing politics.This group of seven Brahmins, and Dubey, a self-avowed Bharatiya Janata Party supporter, is dismayed with murmurs of dissent about a glorious revival of Krishna’s birthplace.So, he plays his trump card and pulls out his phone — the argument to beat all arguments. From a saved recording on his phone emanates the voice of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath addressing a rally in Mathura on December 29, 2021. He talks of the temple construction in Ayodhya, and the inauguration of the Kashi Vishwanath corridor. He speaks the words that make Dubey look around triumphantly at those around him. “Can Vrindavan Mathura be left behind?” says Adityanath.“Is there one other party, or one other chief minister who would say this?” Dubey asks. The men around him nod, but there is still a note of doubt, even a rebuttal from 36-year-old Ashish Mishra.“Bas election mein hi yaad aata hai (Do they only remember during the elections?)”Mathura, raised by both the chief minister and his deputy in recent months, may be the next vehicle in the BJP’s Hindutva project, a symbol that there is much left unfinished. The Ram temple in Ayodhya is well on its way to being built, Varanasi has been beautified, and Mathura is next.A month before Adityanath’s speech, on December 1, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had tweeted, “Ayodhya Kashi bhavya mandir nirman jaari hai, ab Mathura ki baari hai.”While a massive temple already exists at Mathura, the conflict is with the Shahi Eidgah that abuts the Katra Keshav Dev temple complex, ostensibly built by a Mughal ruler, in this case Aurangzeb. Much like in the Ram Janmabhoomi case, here too there is a civil suit in a Mathura court that asks for the removal of the mosque.So when the seven men listen to Adityanath’s words, there is some resonance. Just not quite as much as in 2014, 2017, or 2019.Mishra owns a shop that sells religious paraphernalia just outside the temple complex. Beneath his feet, where his red plastic stool is usually stationed in the January sun, is an open drain.“In the past few elections, I voted for the BJP. They are after all the party of Hindus. But they are saying the same things. There is nothing new they have to offer. I knew they would bring up Mathura just before the elections. But here, the temple and the Eidgah are right next to each other. Would I like the mosque not to be there? Sure. But am I prepared for the inevitable violence and conflict for years to come? Covid has wrecked our businesses. We cannot afford more disruptions or a break in peace,” Mishra said.If anything, the argument for “developing” the Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura has greater recall as a promise of infrastructure development, and beautification, as opposed to an emotional, religious call.The one road that cuts through the heart of Mathura’s spiritual centre, from the imposing Holi Gate to the gates of the Janmabhoomi, are lined with open drains. There is only room for two vehicles to pass, and no room for pedestrians. At the beginning of most small bylanes are open garbage dumps, everyday waste from the street market being a constant problem.Vinod Agarwal, who owns a medicine shop right next to Holi Gate, looks at the unmasked chaos in front of him and says, “The one good thing that might happen if they focus on the Janmabhoomi is perhaps this road can get widened and cleaned up. “In the absence of a broader wave unlike 2017 or 2019, there is much more conversation in the five seats of Mathura—Mathura city, Govardhan, Chhatha, Manth, and Baldev (reserved for a scheduled caste candidate) around local factors. All five seats go to the polls in the first phase on February 10.While the BJP is campaigning on improved law and order, the Bahujan Samaj Party seems to be holding on to the Jatav vote, and the alliance of Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Lok Dal have been promising development and change under Akhilesh Yadav.If Adityanath not contesting from Mathura (one rumour said he would, just as another said he would from Ayodhya) has meant that sitting MLA and minister Shrikant Sharma will fight the elections for the BJP, there is worry among the ranks on the role of an angry and influential Brahmin leader SC Sharma, denied a ticket from Manth, who is now contesting from the city.The primary contender in Mathura is four-time MLA and old Congress hand Pradeep Mathur, also a Brahmin. Manth itself has a fascinating melange of factors; it is the only seat of the five the BJP doesn’t currently hold.The sitting BSP MLA is Shyam Sunder Sharma, serial party hopper, but a seven-time legislator so influential that in 2012, he won on a Trinamool Congress ticket.And Manth is also a seat where cracks are visible in the SP-RLD partnership, where both parties have put up candidates. Sure, the RLD has asked its candidate to withdraw, but Yogesh Nauhwar has refused to do so.Outside the city, in its villages, Mathura is also a marker for a factor that may well define the fate of western Uttar Pradesh, for the district has a sizeable number of Jats, accounting for around 20% of the population.In March 2021, one of the first appearances of Akhilesh Yadav and RLD President Jayant Chaudhary together, a presaging of what was to become a formal alliance, was at a mahapanchayat at the grounds of the Morki Inter College, 57 km from the Krishna Janmabhoomi complex.As evening sets, and 55-year-old Mahavir Chaudhary looks out onto his farms around him, he dismisses talk of the temple with a wave of his hand. Chaudhary spent five months at the Tikri border on Delhi’s outskirts in protest against the three farm laws, and then another month at another protest spot in Palwal.He felt relief when the three laws were repealed, and while there is some softening for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, even a conflict within, but he says he will not forgive.“I am a farmer, and I am a Hindu. I have voted for the BJP over the past seven years. But they called us so many names, attacked us. Modi eventually listened, and he is a viraat Hindu leader. But they have to be taught a lesson. This time, most Jats will not vote for the BJP. We will vote for Jayant, even if the seat selection has not been good,” Chaudhary said.But for the RLD, Chaudhary still has a word of warning. He does not trust the Samajwadi Party yet, and while Akhilesh is a “good man”, his party has “too many goons.”He sees a discernible shift away from the BJP, but the scale of this shift he cannot fathom yet. The BJP won all four of its seats in Mathura, with margins of over 13,000 votes, with Chatha and Mathura being won by over 60,000 and 100,000 votes, respectively.“The BJP has big leads, and those may not stay the same, but nobody can say who will win. The one big change though is that this time, there is a fight for every single seat.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-elections-in-mathura-murmurs-of-dissent-over-local-issues-farm-laws-101643132668899.html
26-01-2022||India||Air India flight held up for an hour after aircraft engineer’s tiff with pilot||NEW DELHI: An altercation between a senior Air India pilot and an aircraft maintenance engineer (AME) on Tuesday at the Srinagar airport led to an hour’s delay on the Srinagar- Delhi flight, the pilot has complained to the airline management.Air India flight AI 826 was scheduled to take off at 1.10pm but was delayed as the aircraft engineer refused to abide by the rules, the pilot alleged, according to a copy of the complaint. HT has reviewed the complaint.The argument picked up when the commandant, flying the Airbus fleet in the airline, brought to the notice of the ground staff that there was an imbalance of 1400kg of fuel (an imbalance of fuel means that the fuel in both the wings was not equally filled, due to which, according to the rules, take off is not allowed). The AME allegedly forced the pilot to accept the aircraft in fuel imbalance condition. The pilot refused and insisted on balancing the fuel for its departure.Airline officials said that instead of balancing the fuel, the AME allegedly asked the pilot to report the aircraft to have ‘snag’ after which he would declare it to be grounded. “It was after around 35-40 minutes that another AME attended the aircraft and balanced the fuel after which the aircraft took off at around 2.05pm,” said an official.Air India spokesperson did not comment on the matter.The pilot reported the incident to the Air India management and alleged that the AME has behavioural issues. The complaint said, “Due to high security airport and that too next day (being) Republic Day (I) fail to understand why they want to ground the aircraft. Please look into it through a security angle and intentionally for grounding.”The complaint further said, “I request for urgent appropriate restitution against outrageous mortification sufficed by the undersigned... This will address the prevalent issues of onerous and worrisome duty of some and insincerity of others keeping in view the high headed behaviour.”A former airline official, who did not wish to be named, said, “This (is) a classic example of how the new trend in aviation is to fly compromising with the safety of passengers. The trend is seen more with the low-cost carriers coming into the market, which needs to be addressed on an urgent basis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-flight-held-up-for-an-hour-after-aircraft-engineer-s-tiff-with-pilot-101643130513822.html
26-01-2022||Today's||Budget will need to tackle Covid hurdles||Global economies have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, and India is no exception. Post-pandemic economic recovery is a big challenge for all of us. Governments and central banks across the world resorted to fiscal and monetary measures to ward off the negative impact of the crisis. These measures included liquidity infusion, credit enhancement, deficit financing, direct benefit transfers, even the printing of currency and distribution of helicopter money.
