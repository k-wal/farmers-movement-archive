These are the first reported cases of the infection after five months, the officers said, adding that the first Covid-19 case inside Tihar was reported in the second week of July 2020. The variant of the virus that has infected the eight inside Tihar jail now is unclear. Jail officers said no infection has been reported in Rohini and Mandoli jails. The three jail complexes collectively hold around 18,000 prisoners. “No person is critical. Their health is being monitored round-the-clock. They have been quarantined,” a prison spokesperson said.Jail officers said that the two inmates were not imprisoned recently. Officials suspect the virus may have entered the prison through an infected prison officer, who may have been asymptomatic.About 70-100 people arrested for different crimes across the city are brought to the three jails every day. About the same number of prisoners are also released on bail or acquitted.“Because of the threat of the Omicron variant, we are currently detaining new prisoners in a separate space within the prison complex where they are quarantined for at least a week. This is the same drill we followed during the first three waves of the infection in Delhi,” the spokesperson said.Prison officers said that if the infection spreads rapidly in the next few days, they will inform the government and a high court-appointed committee to evaluate if prisoners could again be released for the time being to ensure social distancing inside the jail.In the last two years, about 5,000 prisoners have been released twice on bail or emergency parole and directed to surrender later. Ensuring social distancing, which is the key to arresting the spread of Covid-19, is a major problem in Delhi jails because the jails hold nearly twice the number of prisoners against their sanctioned capacity. There are nearly 18,000 prisoners against a sanctioned capacity of 10,024 in the three prisons.Since the pandemic broke out in March 2020, the three jails have collectively reported over 600 infections among prisoners and jail staff. Six prisoners also died of the infection. One of the prisoners who died of Covid-19 was former Bihar gangster turned politician Mohammed Shahabuddin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-5-months-eight-in-tihar-jail-test-positive-for-covid19-101641234333686.html

The DMER gave its nod to appointing non-academic doctors to reduce the workload on resident doctors but stopped short of commenting on the delays in the NEET PG counseling process. The resident doctors however said that they will call off the strike only after a written assurance is given.DMER head Dr Dilip Mhaisekar said, “I do not want to comment on their demand for prerequisites since the matter of NEET PG counseling is still in the Supreme Court and it is sub-judice. The appointment of non-academic JRs is not an issue and we will provide them with that.” Dr Mhaisekar appealed to the resident doctors to call off the strike. “I have appealed to them that by law, they should withdraw the strike. The rest is up to them,” he said. Dr Mhaisekar communicated with the deans to issue orders of recruiting non-academic doctors as soon as possible.Three civic-run hospitals including the BYL Nair Hospital, LTMG Hospital, and KEM Hospital have already issued a notification stating recruitment of non-academic JRs.Dr Avinash Dahiphale, president of the Central Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors, said, “The DMER has given us an assurance regarding the recruitment of non-academic JRs equal to the number of residents in that particular college, but we are still waiting for an official order from their end.”The resident doctors have also demanded that the prerequisites of state counseling like form filling, document verification be completed as soon as possible and the schedule regarding the same be released so as to avoid further delay in the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/resident-doctors-strike-dmer-gives-nod-to-recruiting-non-academic-doctors-101641233494027.html

03-01-2022||Lucknow||In Basti, Lucknow, Nadda accuses SP of seeking withdrawal of cases against terrorists||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda accused the previous Samajwadi Party (SP) government of seeking withdrawal of cases of such terrorists, some of whom, he claimed, were later sentenced to death. He also pitched the ruling BJP as a party that never compromised with national security and urged people to vote for it in the coming assembly elections. “Akhilesh ji correct me if I am wrong or pull me to court in case if I am not correct. But isn’t it a fact that your government had sought withdrawal of cases of 15 terrorists? The court disallowed withdrawal of cases, and in fact, sentenced a few of them to death and gave life imprisonment to others,” Nadda said while addressing public meetings in Basti and Lucknow on Monday. “Do you (people) want a government that protects terrorists?” he asked the crowd which cheered him on. These public meetings were called to mark the culmination of ‘Jan Vishwas Yatras’ that had set out across the state on December 19. Focusing his attack mainly on the SP, he said, “The level of corruption in the previous SP government was such that one of their ministers is still in jail.” “Today as we face another election, it is important to look back at what the situation was when BJP came to power in UP in 2017. Back then, Akhilesh ji’s government failed to give utilisation certificate of ₹1 lakh crore, its rule was marked by ₹1600 crore Gomti river front scam. Back then the mafia called the shots. Today, the mafia are either in wheelchairs, in hospital, in jail or outside of UP,” Nadda said, praising the BJP government in UP for ushering in good governance. “Back then there was zero governance and corruption. Now, there is good governance and an honest government,” he added. The BJP chief also arrived in Lucknow and held meetings with the party’s top leaders over poll preparedness in the state. Nadda was the party’s UP in-charge in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when the BJP won 64 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats. In the 2017 UP polls the BJP had won 312 out of the 403 assembly seats, with SP bagging 47, BSP 19 and Congress 7 seats, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/in-basti-lucknow-nadda-accuses-sp-of-seeking-withdrawal-of-cases-against-terrorists-101641233373860.html

The cattle thieves tried to collide their vehicles with the police car and pelted stones at the police team but the latter succeeded in nabbing Shabbir Ahmed Shagir Ahmed Sheikh, 50; Sharif Hanif Qureishi, 35; and Tabrez Farooq Shaikh, 22 – all residents of Bhiwandi in Thane district.The trio was arrested under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 379 (theft), 353 (assaulting a public servant on duty), 279(rash driving), 337 and 338(hurt) and 429 (maiming cattle) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC); the State Animal Preservation Act, 1965; and the State Animal Protection Act, 1995. When produced before the Palghar court on Monday, the trio was remanded to police custody, said senior police inspector Pradeep Kasbe of Manor police station.Meanwhile over a span of six months, nearly 800 cows, bulls and other cattle belonging to about 200 owners were stolen from Dahanu, Palghar, Vikramgadh and other areas of Palghar district. The cattle were to be smuggled to illegal slaughterhouses in Bhiwandi while the nearly 1 tonne of beef that was seized was meant to be sold to roadside dhabas and other illegal eateries.To address the concerns of the 200-odd owners whose cattle were stolen and who were deprived of their means of livelihood (selling milk), Rajendra Gavit, MP from Palghar; on Monday held a meeting with Prakash Gaikwad, additional superintendent of police (ADSP), Palghar; and the said owners wherein he revealed that a whopping 800 cattle had been stolen over a span of just six months in Palghar district.Gavit blamed the Palghar police for failing to curb the growing cattle thefts and alleged that the police are taking the matter very lightly. The farmers whose cattle have been stolen have been deprived of their means of livelihood even as the stolen cattle have been sent to and slaughtered in illegal abbatoirs in Bhiwandi, Gavit said.However, Gaikwad maintained that the Palghar police were helpless as recruitment had stopped during the pandemic and there was less manpower and a heavy workload to tackle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/one-tonne-beef-seized-three-held-in-palghar-101641233311855.html

Of the 7,527 doses, 7,050 doses were administered at government vaccination sites and 477 doses at private hospitals, officials from the district health department said on Monday, adding that around 200,000 teenagers in this age bracket are eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine in the district.The vaccination was conducted at 38 government health centres, 39 government and private schools, and 10 private hospitals from 10am to 5pm. At the 77 government vaccination sites, 100 slots each were available with a target of 7,700 doses for the first day. Earlier, the vaccination drive was inaugurated by deputy commissioner Yash Garg at DAV School in Sector 49. After the inauguration, Garg also interacted with children who came to get vaccinated. “Vaccination is very important to prevent spread of Covid-19 infection. Teenagers must visit a vaccination centre with their parents and get the vaccine at the earliest, and motivate their peers to get vaccinated. I appeal to the public that they must follow all safety protocols, wear masks and not go out unless necessary,” said Garg. Students said that they were happy to receive the vaccine as Covid-19 cases are increasing continuously. Tamanna Dhingra, 17-year-old student of DAV School, who was the first girl in the district to get the vaccine, said, “I had been waiting for the vaccine for a long time, and I am happy that I got vaccinated on the first day itself. Getting the dose at my own school made the process all the more comfortable.” Aryan Lohchab, 17-year-old student from DAV School who was the first boy to get vaccinated, said, “I was a little worried before taking the vaccine, but I did not feel any side effect. It is important that we come forward and take the vaccine as that is the only way to develop immunity and fight the spread of the virus. Now, we will feel less scared to come to the school.” The health officials said that the vaccination process at most schools was completed by 1pm, with many students willing to get vaccinated even after the slots for the day were completed.Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “At most of the government vaccination centres, there were long queues with parents waiting to get their children vaccinated. But we decided to vaccinate 100 children as it was decided for the first day. On Tuesday, vaccination for the 15-18 age group will be carried out at 39 government health facilities and 38 government and private schools.” The officials said that no adverse effect of immunisation was reported from the district, but some students said that they felt slight pain in the arm. Snehil Gupta, a class 12 student of CCA School in Sector 4, said, “It was a relief to get the vaccine and I did not feel any side effects but just a little pain in the area where I got the vaccine.” According to the health department, on Monday, , 24,508 people (including 15-18 age group) received Covid-19 jabs, of which 13,475 took their first dose and 11,033 the second dose.

As part of the project, which is being developed in Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mode, the civic body will lease out the commercial portion of the Gandhi Maidan parking lot to the builder, along with 25% car parking space abutting the commercial section after the project is completed.A report municipal commissioner Sanjay Goel filed in the House last month, a copy of which was seen by HT, said that under the agreement the builder was to deposit a total of ₹445 crore in four instalments for this project.The first instalment of ₹111.25 crore was to be paid at the time of the agreement, with subsequent instalments at fixed intervals. The delay in payment led to show-cause notices and additional recovery by the civic body.“There is a provision of issuing a show-cause notice under Article 10.2 of the agreement and this regards a show-cause notice that was issued to the builder. Rupees 41.27 crore have been recovered in the form of interest from the builder on account of delayed deposit in instalments,” the report by Goel said.The report was filed based on questions asked by municipal councillor Poonam from Ward 21-N Jahangirpuri.The municipal councillor had also asked if the parking and shopping complex had been built according to the plans and rules of the corporation, to which the commissioner responded stating that they would inspect the construction after the completion of the work. In the meantime, he said, the ongoing construction work was in accordance with the plans passed by the civic body.A senior municipal official from the engineering department said that the entire principal amount, as well as the interest, have been recovered from the builder and, so far, a total amount of ₹486.27 crore has been deposited by the builder. “The project is likely to be completed by July 2022 and the large-scale addition of parking space will help in decongestion of the Chandni Chowk commercial area while acting as a major revenue source for the corporation,” a senior municipal official overseeing the project said.In a bid to meet the parking demands in one of the largest wholesale and retail hubs in Chandni Chowk, the north MCd has allotted around 4.5 acres of land to the private builder. As part of the project, the builder will develop a 10 lakh sq ft area with five levels of parking and three levels of retail space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/chandni-chowk-parking-project-delhi-north-civic-body-recovers-additional-41-27-crore-101641233132080.html

The couple claimed that they had caught the victim molesting their daughter, 13.According to the police, the accused have been identified as Salim Jafar, 38, and his wife Firoza Salim, 36. The couple, both fish vendors who stay in Mulund, told the police that they had twice caught the victim Abdul Khalil Shaikh, 69, molesting their teenage daughter.Police inspector Adinath Gawde of Mankhurd police station said that on Saturday, they found the body of a senior citizen near a drain in Mankhurd. The police registered a case of accidental death as no external injury marks were visible on the body. After the autopsy report of the elderly man confirmed that he was murdered, the police circulated the man’s photo across police stations to ascertain if any individual matching his description had been reported missing. On Sunday, a woman approached the police and informed them that the deceased was her father and had been employed as a caretaker by a couple in Mulund. The woman informed the police that she saw the photo of her father’s body being circulated on WhatsApp and tried calling him but in vain.“I assumed I was mistaken and the man only looked like my father, but later when I approached the police, they asked me to identify the body after which I was convinced that my father was dead,” said Naine Sabir Shaikh, 38, who runs a zari workshop. She informed the police that a couple hailing from their village had employed her father and given him shelter. Naine told the police that the couple would go out for work during which time her father took care of their two children (13 and 11).Gawde said that based on the information, they called Jafar and his wife for questioning. During interrogation, the couple revealed that on Friday when they returned home, their daughter, 13, informed them that Shaikh had molested her. The couple said that even before this incident, they had caught Shaikh touching their daughter inappropriately.Gawde said after the earlier incident, they assaulted Shaikh and warned him with dire consequences if he repeated such behaviour. On Friday at about 8pm when their daughter informed them that Shaikh had again molested her, they beat him to death. The couple said that they did not intend to kill Shaikh but when they realised that he had died, they decided to destroy the evidence by dumping his body.“The couple said that they left the house with Shaikh’s body in the trunk of their car at 11pm, intending to throw it into the sea, but when they saw that there was heavy police bandobast at several places, they dumped his body in the drain at Mankhurd and fled the spot,” said Gawde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mulund-couple-catch-caretaker-molesting-daughter-kill-him-dump-him-in-drain-101641232773062.html

At present the layout is on display at the office of the Ayodhya Development Authority (ADA). Traders of Ayodhya have registered their opposition with the ADA against the master plan alleging that the proposed layout will result in large scale demolition of shops and other commercial establishments. In the master plan, several stretches of the city have been earmarked for the road widening project. Ramesh Jaiswal, president of Vyapar Adhikar Manch, said large number of shops and other commercial establishments would be demolished if the master plan was implemented in its present form. Jaiswal further said the traders had registered their protest with vice chairman, ADA, Vishal Singh. The development authority has asked traders to submit their objections in writing so that they could be discussed and addressed. In the proposed separate development plan, two stretches of the road in Ayodhya Dham (old Ayodhya town), including the one leading to the Hanuman Garhi temple, are to be widened. Another major expansion of the road is proposed from Naya Ghat to Udaya crossing. This stretch is around 4.6 km. The entire road is proposed to be 24 feet and 12 feet on both sides of the divider. Large number of commercial establishments fall on this stretch of the road. Traders are demanding to curtail the proposed expansion to 20 feet from 24 feet. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had renamed Faizabad district as Ayodhya during Deepotsav celebrations in Ayodhya on November 6, 2018.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in a post on social media questioned the PM on the issues concerning farmers and reiterated her party’s demand for Teni’s dismissal.“Even steps taken keeping elections in mind like false apology and withdrawal of three farm laws cannot cover Modiji’s anti-farmer thinking. He is holding the position of a protector but is siding with perpetrator of crime. The son of union minister of state for home is the main accused in the incident of crushing of farmers in the chargesheet filed in Lakhimpur Kheri case…..,” said Priyanka in a tweet in Hindi. “But due to @narendramodi ji’s patronage, Minister Ajay Mishra Teni did not even come under the scrutiny of the investigation and he remains in his post. #Dismiss Teni,” read second part of her tweet.Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu in a press statement also demanded dismissal of Teni and said the SIT had submitted 5000-page chargesheet making the minister’s son Ashish Mishra alias Monu the main accused.

03-01-2022||Lucknow||SP’s free power promise gave BJP the ‘severest shock’: Akhilesh||Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Monday claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) got the “severest of shocks” ever since he promised to give free electricity to the people of the state. Marking the start of the New Year, Akhilesh had on Saturday promised to provide 300 units of free electricity to households and free power to farmers for irrigation if voted to power in the upcoming UP assembly polls.“Sabse zyada current BJP ko laga,” said Akhilesh as he reiterated his promise. “To all domestic users... 300 units free...not just poor,” he clarified while addressing a press conference at the SP state headquarters here.“And now they (BJP people) are asking from where the energy would come for free electricity?. I say if the ‘Nasamajh’ (ignorant) and ‘Unupyogi’ (useless) CM had worked well, the state would have had a surplus energy and the people would not have been giving so much power bills as they have to do now,” he alleged.Akhilesh claimed that it was the SP governments that gave Rosa, Parichha power plant, Lanco, Anpara D, Meja power projects by either executing or founding them. “And the other ‘SP power projects’ that are coming up in Etah, Hardua, Panki, Naveli Lignite were not completed by the BJP government,” he further claimed.“SP governments worked on thermal, solar and sugar factories’ power plants and once the SP returns to power, it will complete all the power plants and give 300 units of free power,” he said. “So, when we made 300 units free power promise there was a logic behind it,” he said and added: “And this government could not fulfil its promise of doubling farmers’ income”.On the repeal of three farm laws, he said: “The BJP government withdrew the ‘dark’ farm laws because it eyes votes.” “Stunned by the ‘Samajwadi Vijay Yatra’ from Jaunpur to Lucknow all through the night ending in the morning, the BJP government withdrew the farm laws,” the SP chief claimed.Attacking the Centre over the power issue, Akhilesh said: “Twice the people of UP helped the BJP form the government at the Centre but the government did not increase UP’s quote in power and coal quota.”He also alleged that the BJP lied on power issues and that the people had made up their minds to show “liars” the door in the upcoming UP assembly polls. “Imagine the height of liars’ lies...when they had to show a flyover, they showed Kolkata’s flyover. When they had to show factories, they displayed the US factories and when wanted to showcase an airport, they put up a picture of China’s airport”, he alleged.

My case too won’t be any different. As leaders who have been getting directly elected, we would surely like to contest direct elections than take the legislative council route,” Maurya said in Lucknow on Monday. In November, Yogi too had said something similar. “I have always contested elections and will contest from wherever the party wants me to,” he had said then, a line he has consistently taken since. BJP leaders and experts say top leaders contesting elections helps not just the seat they contest but also influences party prospects in adjoining seats. Both Yogi and Maurya had recently described Mathura as the party’s unfinished agenda, stating that like Ayodhya and Kashi, a grand temple would also come up in Mathura too. Mathura—the western UP town believed to be the birthplace of Lord Krishna—has a prominent mosque—the Shahi Idgah— located next to the Krishna Janmabhoomi (the site believed to be the Lord Krishna’s birthplace). The mosque has been at the centre of a legal battle for years with Hindu groups claiming that the Idgah was built on land where Lord Krishna was born. “Yogi ji has already declared that he would contest from wherever the party wants him to. Though I am sure that voters in each assembly segment would want Yogi ji to contest from their place but very humbly I would like to offer that people in Braj region specially want Yogi ji to contest from Lord Krishna’s Mathura,” the BJP MP stated in his missive to the party chief who would hold meetings with party leaders and Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow over the party’s preparedness for the assembly elections soon. The development coincides with the BJP setting in motion the process of screening candidates for ticket selection in the poll bound state. Nadda is also scheduled to visit Lucknow on Monday evening for meetings with party leaders over poll preparedness and party leaders admit that the issue of top leaders getting to contest the state elections might come up for discussion. Yogi Adityanath, who won his first Lok Sabha election in 1998 at the age of 26, represented Gorakhpur for five terms in a row before resigning as an MP after being named the chief minister in 2017, as did Maurya who had to quit his Phulpur Lok Sabha seat on being named deputy chief minister. Maurya was the first BJP leader to win Phulpur Lok Sabha seat in 2014 Lok Sabha elections. He had earlier won the 2012 UP polls from Sirathu, an assembly segment, from where some BJP leaders feel that the deputy chief minister could again get to contest from. “Maurya is hugely popular and will win from anywhere the party wants him to,” said a BJP lawmaker from Prayagraj region. As for the chief minister, it is raining offers for him. Party’s Ayodhya lawmaker Ved Prakash Gupta said he would be happy if the CM contests from the temple town where a Ram temple is coming up and both BJP governments at the centre and in UP have announced massive schemes to make Ayodhya a global pilgrimage town.BJP leaders in Gorakhpur as well as in Lucknow too want the chief minister to contest from their regions. “I think Maharajji (Yogi Adityanath) will contest from Gorakhpur (rural) seat,” a BJP leader from Gorakhpur said. “Gorakhpur (rural) seat is one where the Gorakhnath Mutt of which Yogi is the head priest has considerable influence,” the party leader said. Yet another party leader has written to Yogi and BJP leadership to field the chief minister from an assembly segment of Lucknow.

While Magadh University vice-chancellor (V-C) Rajendra Prasad, who has been on medical leave ever since the state vigilance unit (SVU) carried out raids at the residence and office with another one-month extension last week, the newly appointed V-C in Patna-based Pataliputra University RK Singh has been delaying his joining for the last 40 days for reasons best known to him. He has reportedly sought more time from the Raj Bhawan for joining.Prasad was to appear before the SVU on Monday, but with his medical leave sanctioned by the Governor-cum-Chancellor, that could not happen, even though MU’s registrar, proctor and the library in charge were earlier arrested in the corruption case and sent to jail. The university is yet to get any replacement, while the acting V-C Bibhuti Nayan Singh has his powers curtailed to just routine work “till the return of the regular V-C”.“We have not got any official communication from the V-C as to why he did not turn up, though the committee did sit as per schedule to hear him. All that we know is through media that he is on leave,” said NH Khan, additional director general (ADG), SVU.The problem in MU is that the acting V-C has been recently given nod by the Chancellor’s office to hold meetings of syndicate, academic council and exam board, but his hands are tied in filling up vacancies of various department heads, principals and deans. The university has also apprised the Chancellor’s office about the absence of key functionaries due to their arrest.“Even the most routine work of clearing pension of widows or retrial dues are getting hampered, while the entire university is passing through a phase of uncertainty. How can a V-C function if there are no key functionaries? Even the financial advisor is in dual charge,” said a senior MU professor.In Patliputra University, the senate, syndicate and academic council meetings are scheduled from January 10-12 and if the new V-C does not take charge by then, it will be held under the acting V-C SP Singh who is also the V-C of Lalit Narayan Mithila University (Darbhanga) and holds additional charge of Aryabhatt Knowledge University (AKU). AKU has been without a regular V-C since September 2020 despite the advertisement of vacancy thrice, while Pataliputra University is without a V-C since January 2021. AKU is also without pro-V-C and registrar.SP Singh was in the eye of the storm after former VC of Maulana Mazharul Haq Arabic and Persian University Md Qudus levelled serious allegations of financial irregularities against him in a letter to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Kumar later forwarded the letter to the Governor, terming the allegations serious. However, later Qudus himself quit.In MU, however, the date of the syndicate meeting is yet to be announced amid confusion, as usually the registrar notifies it. “The affiliation process in MU also remains stalled, even as the deadline of January 15 for submission of fresh proposals, as per court order, is drawing closer,” said another official..

During the pandemic, family members were allowed to speak to inmates through video calls, termed e-Mulaquat, introduced last year by the Bihar government. Prisoners are allowed “e-mulaqat” with family members thrice a month for 15 minutes each.“In view of the rising trend of Covid-19 cases once again, it has been decided to suspend physical ‘mulaqat’ of all inmates of central jail, district jail, and sub-jail with family and friends with effect from Tuesday till January 31. The situation will be reviewed again on February 1”, read a letter issued by IG prison Manesh Kumar Meena.Earlier in March 2020, the Bihar prisons department suspended such physical meetings and resumed on October 28 after hundreds of inmates of Beur central jail went on a hunger strike.The total capacity of prisons in Bihar is 46,669, while the number of inmates had gone past 66,307 till December 31, as per official data.
03-01-2022||Patna||CM asks IGIMS to have additional genome sequencing setup||PATNA: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday asked the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) to have an additional setup of genome sequencing for timely detection of the strain SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, as the state reported 344 new Covid-19 infections, taking the number of active cases to 1,385. He said this after inaugurating the Covid-19 vaccination for children in the 15-18 years age category at the IGIMS on Monday morning, said officials familiar with the development. A total of 1.56 lakh children were vaccinated on the first day across 3,000 vaccination session sites installed for the purpose in the state. The CM, who inspected the state’s first genome sequencing facility at the newly established molecular genetic laboratory of the IGIMS, said the additional set up of genome sequencing would help in the timely detection of the Omicron variant among the Covid-19 patients. He advised the authorities to have another genome sequencing setup after doctors at the IGIMS told him that it would take 7-10 days to get the test result. The genome sequencing setup, which could cost over ₹2 crore, would include a sequencer, a computer having a large capacity server up to 13 terabytes, and different smaller equipment and testing kits, besides additional manpower to run the equipment. Bihar’s health minister Mangal Pandey also told the CM that his department was in an advanced stage of discussion with a private firm for giving test results specifically on Omicron within 24 hours. The IGIMS, which is the only institute in Bihar to be a part of the Insacog (Indian SARS-CoV-2 consortium on genomics), a network of laboratories working on genomic surveillance of Covid-19, has initiated the process of genome sequencing on January 1. “We initiated on January 1 the process to conduct genome sequencing test for Covid-19 with 24 samples we had collected. It will take a week from the extraction of the RNA to get the test result,” said Dr NR Biswas, director of the IGIMS. Meanwhile, Ritika Kumari, 16, a resident of Bariarpur village in Lakhisarai district, was the first adolescent to be vaccinated against Covid-19 in Bihar, said Dr Manish Mandal, medical superintendent of the IGIMS. “Ritika was delighted to be the first among adolescents to be vaccinated in Bihar. She was absolutely cheerful to get the vaccine shot and showed no signs of nervousness,” said Dr Mandal. In all, 180 adolescents in the 15 to 18 years age group were vaccinated at the IGIMS on Monday. Many among them were NCC cadets. “We will like to complete the first dose vaccination of the projected 83.46 lakh target group children in the 15-18 years age group this month itself, and finish off with their second dose of Covaxin by February,” said Sanjay Kumar Singh, executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, who was present on the occasion. Patna accounts for as many as 4.95 lakh of the 83.46 lakh adolescents eligible for vaccination in Bihar. “We set up around 3,000 vaccination session sites for children in schools across the state, where not only schoolchildren but even those from adjoining clusters were vaccinated,” he added.

According to officials, out of the 11, six had come for redressal of their grievances at chief ministers’ weekly Janata Darbar programme, while five were from the catering team.Raising concern over the issue, the chief minister, while speaking to the media said, “During the initial check-up before the start of the programme, one out of the total 186 complainants, who poured in at Janata Darbar, was diagnosed with Covid-19 infection. Later, it was found that six people had tested positive. One of the staff from the catering team also tested positive for Covid19. It’s becoming a matter of concern.”An official later informed that four more staff of the catering department were diagnosed with Covid-19 after they underwent a rapid antigen test. “Those who tested Covid positive will now undergo confirmatory RT-PCR test,” he said.Stung by the exponential rise in cases of Covid-19 infections, the chief minister on Monday said that the government would make a comprehensive study about the sudden surge in Covid cases on Tuesday and take all necessary steps to curb it.Partial lockdown, strict adherence to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, and night curfew for a limited period are a few measures that the state might resort in a bid to bring the situation under control after the high-level meeting convened by the chief minister on Tuesday, said a senior officer, who is keeping a close watch on the situation.The CM said that the state health machinery was in alert mode and the pace of pathological tests to confirm the virus has also been enhanced. “Genome sequencing to isolate Omicron variant of Covid-19 has also been launched in the state. The isolation centres that were set up to treat people suffering from Covid-19 are being readied. There is no dearth of medicines and oxygen. People need to be made aware of how to deal with the renewed challenge,” Kumar said.Answering a query if the elections to five states needs to be postponed to curb the spread of the pandemic, Kumar said that the situation is not too alarming. “Assembly elections in Kerala were held during the pandemic phase. Even Bihar went for the polls amid rise in Covid-19 cases with precautions. People are there to take care of the poll preparedness in view of the pandemic,” the CM said.Till January 2, Bihar had 1,074 active cases. On January 1, it reported 352 positive cases, the reports of which were uploaded on January 2.Meanwhile, former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, his wife Shanti Devi, and 13 other family members also tested positive for Covid-19. Manjhi’s personal assistant Ganesh Pandit and two security staff have also been diagnosed with the infection, people aware of the development said.
03-01-2022||Ranchi||J’khand: Edu institutions, high footfall places closed till Jan 15||Bringing back restrictions on various economic activities in wake of the recent surge in Covid-19 cases, the Jharkhand government on Monday decided to close all educational institutions, high footfall places like gyms, parks, swimming pools and tourist spots, besides directing markets to remain shut after 8pm barring medical shops, bars and restaurants.To begin with, the new restrictions will remain in force till January 15, state health and disaster management minister Banna Gupta said after attending the meeting of the disaster management committee chaired by chief minister Hemant Soren.“The recent surge in the cases are very worrying. We don’t know what form this new wave would take. Certain decisions have been taken today in the meeting chaired by the CM to contain the spread of the virus. Any further decision would be taken as per the new developments,” said Gupta.The minister said while all educational institutions would remain shut, they’ll be allowed to do administrative work with 50% attendance. Offices in the government and private sectors will also function with 50% capacity with a ban on biometric attendance.The government has also decided to restrict participation in marriage and last rites functions, with a cap of 100 persons.

From 60 cases on December 26, the state has reached 1000 plus cases since January 1, with almost 50% of the cases being reported from the state capital Ranchi.What is closed# All parks, swimming pool, zoo, tourist spots, stadium to remain closed till Jan 15. # School, colleges, educational institutions closed till Jan 15; administrative work allowed with 50% attendance. # All shops to operate till 8 pm; medical shops, bars, restaurants exempted# Maximum 100 persons allowed in any outdoor event # Indoor events allowed with 50% capacity or 100 persons, whichever is less. # Govt and private offices to operate with 50% attendance, no biometric attendance allowed||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jkhand-edu-institutions-high-footfall-places-closed-till-jan-15-101641230071978.html
03-01-2022||Pune||80% Covid cases among those fully vaccinated, says Pune mayor||PUNE At least 80% of Covid positive cases reported in the past six days in Pune are from among those who fully vaccinated. However, symptoms are mild and need for hospitalisation is minimal, said Pune city mayor Murlidhar Mohol on Monday. The Mayor also said that starting from January 10, the civic body will start administering a third precautionary dose, as approved by the government of India, for all those who have comorbidities and also frontline and healthcare workers. Mohol, speaking to the media, said that while the rate of infection is high the civic body is prepared with oxygen and drug stocks. Mohol said, “Almost 80-75% out of the total new Covid-19 cases are those who have taken both shots of the vaccine. On January 1 when the city reported 309 new Covid-19 cases, of those 255 were fully vaccinated. This trend can be seen in the past one week since the time the city has seen a drastic rise in the number of new cases. The number of active cases has also gone up above 2,500, however, it is also important to point out that of these most are isolated as per protocol and are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Only 80 persons need oxygen therapy while 25 need a ventilator. As of now the symptoms among those infected after two doses appear to be mild and so we urge everyone to get vaccinated.” Mohol further added, “Starting from January 10, Pune Municipal Corporation will also start vaccinating those with comorbidities, frontline workers and healthcare workers with the third, or precautionary dose, as the number of cases are rising. There must be a gap of at least nine months between the second and third dose. Also if someone has been infected after taking the second dose then they must wait at least three months before going for the third dose.” Mohol added that while Pune tops in the country in terms of vaccinating first doses, it is also true that more than 300000 are yet to take their second dose despite completing the mandatory 84 days gap. He said, “We will now reach out to each of them and ensure that they get vaccinated. As preparations for any upcoming waves, the PMC has stocked 4,000 vials of remdesivir and has 1,800 beds in PMC hospitals. If needed we can begin operations in the Jumbo hospitals in just one week. Also in terms of oxygen requirement, we have a production capacity of 9500 litres per minute and a stock capacity of 130 kilolitres at nine of our hospitals.” In view of more children being infected in the upcoming wave, the PMC is also in talks with the paediatric task force to ensure that all necessary specialised drugs and ventilators are in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/80-covid-cases-among-those-fully-vaccinated-says-pune-mayor-101641229956691.html
03-01-2022||Pune||Beginning of end of the pandemic? Answer lies in how fast everyone gets vaccinated: Dr Gangakhedkar||PUNE Hoping that this may be the start of ebbing of the pandemic, eminent health expert Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, who is part of the team put together by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to examine origins of pathogens such as Sars-CoV-2, said the virus from here on will chase unvaccinated and vulnerable population. He also said that the answer for whether this is the end of the pandemic lies in how fast everyone is willing to get vaccinated against the virus.He also said that although symptoms of those infected with the Omicron variant are mild, the sheer numbers based on how fast it is spreading could put a strain on the medical infrastructure.Earlier in a round table meeting along with the Pune Platform for Covid-19 Response Forum on Sunday, Dr Gangakhedkar stated that people are speculating the impact of the third wave in India in different ways according to the information available with them. However, there is a need to be cautious. He concurred with the view that the symptoms of the patients suffering from the Omicron variant are mild.“Even though the rate of hospitalisation among the infected patients would be lower, the sheer numbers are likely to put a strain on the medical infrastructure. We are likely to see an increase in the number of children suffering from Covid-19 in the third wave. The demand for diagnostic services will go up substantially and so there is a need to develop an alternative diagnostic testing mechanism to detect the infections rather than relying solely on genome sequencing. Also, the newly approved drug, “Molnupiravir” would be an effective medicine only in cases where the patients have mild infections due to lack of sufficient data,” he said.According to Dr Gangakhedkar, the natural immunity among citizens was possible due to the delayed start of our vaccination drive. “However, we now need to accelerate the vaccination drive to ensure all those eligible to get the vaccine are given the doses. I hope that we are almost at the end of the pandemic unless there is an unpleasant surprise from the ongoing wave in India and China. For the next one month the healthcare infrastructure would certainly be stretched,” said the former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research during the round table meeting.Later in an interview to Hindustan Times, Gangakhedkar stressed expediting vaccination among those who have not taken any jabs, saying that developing herd immunity against infectious disease will take time.“In that process, a lot of people will suffer. Instead of waiting for the natural immunity (by infection) if we go for induced immunity through the vaccine, it will be good and the damage will be minimal,” he said.According to Dr Gangakhedkar, the virus will try and infect most in the community and the process it will continue to mutate. “While doing so, the virus will then share a symbiotic relationship with humans though we cannot wait till that moment and should get vaccinated,” he said.When asked about any possibility of a virus getting weak at some point he explained that viruses come, they go naturally. Once everybody in the community is infected, the virus, unlike in its original form’ becomes stable and it will then try to lead a symbiotic relationship.To a question on whether the current phase can be described as the start of an end of a pandemic, Dr Gangakhedkar said the answer lies in how fast everyone gets the vaccine shield.“There is a significant proportion that has still not taken a second dose even if they were eligible. Unless your coverage of vaccination improves dramatically, the scare always is there. After this, one thing will happen, the virus will start hunting for those who are unvaccinated, those who are older, and those who have immunodeficiency,” he said.When asked about why cases are soaring in the UK and US despite the high vaccination rate in those countries, Dr Gangakhedkar said infection is spreading due to Omicron though the severity is less.He said that as per the research so far, the Omicron virus has the ability to spread rapidly. The virus even evades vaccine-induced immunity.“In such conditions, if the maximum number of people get infections, the virus will make further mutations. The more chance we give to the virus, it will generate more mutations. Thinking that any such mutations will favour humans as virulence level of the virus will go down and it will go naturally, it is better than everyone should get vaccinated and protect themselves,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/beginning-of-end-of-the-pandemic-answer-lies-in-how-fast-everyone-gets-vaccinated-dr-gangakhedkar-101641229713162.html

The police also told a court in Pune that they had found a list of 56 candidates who are believed to have made the payment to appear in the qualification list. Each of the 56 candidates are suspected to have paid ₹40,000 for gaining a spot on the TET 2018 qualification list. The list was found in possession of a government employee called Nikhil Kadam, 36, who was arrested on December 25 and initially remanded to police custody till January 1. His custody was extended till Tuesday by Judicial magistrate first class MA Shaikh on January 1. The same court granted judicial custody to two other accused in the case, Ashwin Kumar and Saurabh Tripathi.“Only two points are different in the remand report. Nothing else has changed. The police had asked for an extension for two of them as well but the court agreed that sufficient police custody was granted to them so far and sent them to judicial custody.

Moreover, the students will get a two-day holiday from school after getting their first dose.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, during a high-level Covid review meeting on Monday, said, “Students will be provided holiday on the vaccination day and the next day. I have personally met children at the vaccination centre. Parents should be congratulated as over 1.5 lakh children got their vaccine dose during the day.” Vaccination for children between 15 and 18 years started on Monday.“We will hold Covid vaccination camps at 12 schools on Tuesday, and more schools are contacting us for the camp. We shall hold more camps in the following days, but it would be better if at least 100 students are available for vaccination at one camp,” said Dr MK Singh, in charge of vaccination in Lucknow.Twelve schools where the vaccination camp will be held are five branches of CMS in Gomti Nagar-I, Gomti Nagar-II, Aliganj, Mahanagar, Kanpur Road, St Joseph Montessori School, C Block, Rajajipuram, St Joseph College, Sitapur Road, and a few branches of LPS (SP Singh).The Unaided Private School Association president Anil Agarwal said it was on their initiative that the state government decided that the children of 15 to 18 years of age get vaccinated in their respective schools.“This initiative was taken by the Private School Association that children should be vaccinated in schools only because they will not get exposed to Covid infection at the vaccination centres, which otherwise remain crowded. There will be less risk of infection in schools than hospitals,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid-vaccination-camps-in-schools-from-today-101641228691851.html

Badal Dal disassociated itself from the Panth during the 1996 Moga Akali conference. Later, it did the same in its Constitution submitted to the Election Commission of India. The so-called Panthic Badals have been issued warrants by a Hoshiarpur court many times in this matter. You should ask them to first resolve the dispute of being ‘Panthic’ or ‘Non-panthic” in this court,” the letter, written in Gurmukhi, says. “The event hurt me a lot as the day was observed in the presence of the head of the Akal Takht Sahib, the institution that was founded by Guru Hargobind Sahib, and it was great Sikh warriors who upheld its dignity,” the letter adds. The event was organised by the SAD at Manji Sahib Diwan Hall in the shrine complex to mark ‘Panthic Ros Diwas’ (Panthic protest day) in protest against state government’s alleged failure in identifying the accused of the sacrilege attempt at Golden Temple and uncovering conspiracy behind the recent sacrilege incidents. In addition to the jathedar, who termed the SAD as the sole political body of the Sikhs on the occasion, SGPC president Harjinder Singh Dhami also addressed the gathering.The deputy CM’s letter adds, “In speeches delivered in Manji Sahib Diwan Hall in your presence, the Panth was asked to be conscious of taking over the gurdwaras or the SGPC by Masands. The persons who delivered these speeches, should be asked as to which Masands, who are ruling over the SGPC, kept relationship with a dera head, who imitated Guru Gobind Singh. They should be asked which Masands submitted a report to cancel the case against the dera head in 2012, and sought votes of the dera... Was any Masand bigger than the Badals at that time?”“Our government took these sacrilege incidents very seriously and relied on the same SIT to continue the probe. In 2018, Bargari sacrilege accused were arrested and jailed. You are requested to expel this father-son duo from the community according to the Panthic tradition, in view of these facts,” the letter demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/akal-takht-jathedar-s-call-to-strengthen-sad-hurt-sikh-sangat-punjab-deputy-cm-101641227011484.html

03-01-2022||Other||SBS Nagar constituency watch: All parties stand nearly equal in Bhagat Singh country||SBS NAGAR Formerly known as Nawanshahr, the district was renamed Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar in 2008, with the revolutionary’s ancestral village, Khatkar Kalan, located here. SBS Nagar district has only three assembly constituencies. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Congress, both, have a strong support base. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) also has a respectable presence here, which cannot be dismissed easily.NAWANSHAHR: RULE OF SINGLE FAMILY A TRADITION, SAINI VOTE KEY Traditionally, the seat has remained with a single family, that of sitting MLA Angad Singh Saini. Saini’s father, Parkash Singh, and mother, Guriqbal Singh, have also served as MLAs; Parkash Singh’s uncle, Dilbagh Singh, has been a five-time MLA from here. This time, the SAD has given the seat to its new ally, the BSP, which has fielded its state general secretary, Nachhtar Pal. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has fielded sitting councillor and former Nawanshahr municipal council president, Lalit Mohan Pathak, who has a good hold on the city, having played a vital role in ensuring its top performance in the Swachh Bharat Survekshan. The Sainis form a sizeable proportion of the voters on the seat. For the electorate, illegal mining in the Rahon area, drugs, poor sewage system and unemployment are key issues. There are 1.76 lakh voters in this general category seat. BANGA: NO CLEAR FAVOURITES IN SEMI-URBAN SEAT A semi-urban constituency, sitting MLA Dr Sukhwinder Sukhi is from the SAD; the AAP had finished second in the 2017 polls. This time, too, the SAD has trusted Dr Sukhwinder. The AAP has given its ticket to Kuljit Singh Sarhaal, son of former MLA Balwant Singh Sarhaal. Local volunteers of the AAP, which won five seats in municipal council polls, have been opposing the decision to give the ticket to Sarhaal. The Congress is yet to announce its candidate, but there is a strong buzz that Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s principal secretary, Hussan Lal, who hails from SBS Nagar, may be fielded from here. Former Congress leader, Satvir Singh Palli Jhikki, who looked after the constituency has joined the Punjab Lok Congress, former CM Capt Amarinder Singh’s party. Lack of development, poor infrastructure, drugs and unemployment are the major issues. The reserved seat has 1.64 lakh voters. BALACHAUR: CONG BREACHED SAD FORTRESS IN 2017, TOUGH CONTEST ON THE CARDSIn 2017, the Congress breached the SAD fortress with Darshan Lal Mangupur defeating four-time sitting MLA, Chaudhary Nand Lal, who had been winning from here since 1997. A rural segment seat, which also includes part of the Kandi area, is set to witness a tough contest again as the SAD has fielded Nand Lal’s daughter-in-law Sunita Chaudhary against Congress’ probable candidate, sitting MLA Mangupur. The AAP has given its ticket to Santosh Kataria, daughter-in-law of former MLA, Ram Krishan Kataria. The splinter groups of the Congress party may spoil its chances of retaining the seat, whereas the SAD has managed to quell factionalism. For voters of Balachaur, illicit liquor, illegal mining, lack of development and unemployment are issues that continue to make life difficult. The seat is reserved and has 1.54 lakh voters.

With the looming threat of Omicron and the probable beginning of the third wave, parents are still sceptical.However, schools, teachers and students are hopeful that in the coming day the turnout will increase.On Monday, Mumbai ordered to shut classes from standard 1 to 9 till January 31.Speaking about the turnout, Arti Sharma, principal, Army Public School Khadki, which is affiliated with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) said that on the first day, the turnout is usually not very good.“We have just started the classes and the attendance was around 30 per cent to 40 per cent for Classes 8 to 12. We have not started off-line classes for students below Class 8 as of yet. For the first few days, parents try to gauge if they should send their ward to school and so the turnout is likely to improve. This has been the trend in the last few months,” said Sharma.She added that since other places like tourist spots and malls are reopened, schools should stay open as well.“The teaching and non-teaching staff are vaccinated and the classrooms are sanitised. We take care of all Covid protocols and so permission should be given to continue offline classes for at least class 8 and above as many students are promptly getting vaccinated too,” said Sharma.Harishchandra Gaikwad, president of the Pune district principals’ association, said that in rural parts, the attendance on day one was 60 per cent and in many parts above that.“Students are enthusiastic to attend school. Many parents want to send their wards to school. Vaccination for children has given a positive light to parents as it will ensure the safety of every child,” said Gaikwad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/schools-in-pune-resume-offline-classes-low-turnout-of-students-amid-rise-in-covid-cases-101641224013476.html

03-01-2022||Chandigarh||Uncle’s almirah: A treasure trove of miniature antiques||Having lived a little less than a century, uncle Rattan Singh Lather passed away two years ago. My father and he had met soon after Partition, in the refugee camps at Karnal, as service volunteers, where they became friends for life. They bonded so well that we, the children on either side, thought of us all a family. My father trusted his friend, Rattan, and my aunt Durga Chachi, still alive and kicking at 92, to the extent that he left me in their care for a few years, for studies. Besides being an interesting man, uncle Rattan pursued his passions in life like constitutionals. He had a knack for preserving things, something I learnt from him in particular. He had an almirah of 5x3 feet, which was the most loved spot for me in their house. Generally, none in the house had access to it except with a rider that anything taken out would have to be deposited back in the same condition. I was fond of many articles preserved by uncle and each one had a special history and appreciable antiquity to it. I remember a view-master, which looked like a camera, in which disc-shaped celluloid films were fixed to be viewed against a translucent screen. The film frames, when seen through the view-finder, gave a three-dimensional view. One could mark the characters in a frame with their standing position and distance from one another. I would take out the view-finder, enjoy the still images-viewing, and put the thing back at its fixed place in the almirah. Uncle had a Three-D set of printed sheets as well, which did not make any sense to the eye, unless seen with special dark glasses that he kept in a separate box. A small pack of cardboard had some collar bones, which uncle invariably used; also, some transparent coloured buttons, which probably were just for safe-keeping. He had a pack of playing cards with which he tricked us. These cards had some unnoticeable signs and hints on their back, which only uncle knew. My favourite item was a German harmonica, which uncle purchased during his college days in Lahore. He had special love for it and played it well. I also picked up playing the harmonica tutored by him. There were two albums: One for photos, and the other for negatives. The photos were professionally processed. They were fixed with shiny corners to hold photos typical to albums. These showed scenes from Bombay, especially Victoria Terminus (VT), Hanging Gardens and the Boot-House; Delhi monuments such as Qutub Minar, Red Fort; Kashmir’s Dal Lake and snow peaks; sunset and sunrise at sea and tribal men and women. I liked the Lutyen’s Delhi illuminated pictures of North Block, South Block and Vijay Chowk. Some tools were also part of uncle’s treasure trove, which included a soldering-iron kit, tablet-breaker, a hold-back-dropper and a metalled spirit lamp. There was his boys scout days whistle. There was a pocket-watch with a long silver chain. I marvelled at not only uncle’s collection and possessions but his narration of the details in his quintessential raconteur like manner. I wish uncle had left me all those articles in his almirah, since having learnt from him only, I too am given to preserving things and being emotionally attached with them. There was yet another secret box that always had a small numbered-lock, of which uncle only knew the code. Yes, I did try to open it, but in vain. rajbirdeswal@hotmail.com The writer, a retired IPS officer, is a Panchkula-based advocate-author||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/uncles-almirah-a-treasure-trove-of-miniature-antiques-101641221790961.html

However, the governor was not able to visit the city, leading to the cancellation of the eventAround 25 to 30 students from various student organisations and groups gathered near the statue which was covered up in the university premises on Monday morning. There were SPPU security guards and also policemen around to handle the situation. Students shouted slogans against the university administration and the state governor for not inaugurating the statue.“Seven years ago, this university was given name of Savitribai Phule and till now there was not even a single statue of her. After many years, a statue was constructed but is waiting to be inaugurated. Earlier it was declared that the statue will be inaugurated on her birth anniversary, January 3, but as the governor could not come it was cancelled. So, we decided to inaugurate the statue on our own on behalf of the students, but the security guards stopped us,” said Kuldeep Ambekar, a student and president of the Students Helping Hand organisation.The statue was in the making for the past two-and-a-half-months. It is 12.5 feet and is made out of 1,500 kg bronze. The work was completed on December 27, however, the authorities still citied ‘work incomplete’ as a reason to not inaugurate the statue. However, student organisations allege that the event was postponed by a week as the governor was not present.Meanwhile, in the afternoon minister Chagan Bhujbal visited the SPPU and took review of the statue work, he said, “Today I took the review of the statue work of Savitribai Phule on her birth anniversary and the statue will be inaugurated by the state governor next week.

Both the governing bodies – the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Pune railway division are playing a blame game, with no action forthcoming. Nilesh Mahajan, a Pune resident, complained about the leak to the PMC and the Pune railway division a month ago and has been continuously following up the issue. “I travel through this underpass daily for my work and there is not a single day when I have not seen water leaking at this spot under the railway bridge near the Sangamwadi RTO. Daily there is a continuous flow of water and waterlogging happens. Water is wasted and moreover, several accidents have happened. As a responsible citizen, I decided to complain and get the repairs done. First I complained to the PMC water supply department, met their engineers and a spot survey was done. Then they said is the work of the railway officials,” said Mahajan. “The Pune railway division maintenance and repair department also surveyed the spot. The frustrating part is that both these governing agencies and their senior officials sent letters to each other instructing that the water leakage be repaired. As citizens we just want the water leakage to stop,” he added. Mahajan has copies of letters were sent by the governing bodies to each another. The latest letter dated on December 21, 2021, was sent by OP Patel, assistant divisional engineer from the Pune railway division maintenance department to PMC’s executive engineer, Water supply department. The letter states: “Leakage in the water pipeline has been seen at RTO chowk near Height guage, due to which water is spreading on the main road resulting heavy traffic jam in the said location. We have received complaint in this regard. Also there is no Railway water connection at this location. Therefore you are requested to depute your staff to attend to the said complaint in the above location at the earliest, to avoid traffic jams”. Whereas an earlier letter from the PMC water supply department to the Pune railway division on November 16, 2021, read: “There is a leakage near coaching complex, in front of your gate near Pune RTO. As this area is under your jurisdiction, please carry out the water leakage repairing work as early as possible. There are chances of mishap on turning road due to heavy traffic. So please stop this leakage at the earliest, otherwise you will be responsible for any loss to life and property”. The spot where water leakage is going on continuously is the road connecting Junna Bazaar towards RTO. “For the last several months I am seeing this water leakage and once I saw a two-wheeler rider fall down as her bike slipped. PMC or Railways should repair it immediately,” said Bipin Dharmadhikari, a daily commuter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/waterleak-at-sangamwadi-rto-puts-citizens-lives-at-risk-civic-authorities-play-blame-game-101641219395620.html
03-01-2022||Pune||Pune to experience cool days, warmer nights: IMD||PUNE The chill factor of winter will not be experienced for the next few days as Pune city will have cooler days and slightly warmer nights across January, said officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday. The weather pattern will be consistent as December last year. On Monday, Pune reported a night temperature of 14.5 degrees Celsius. At 11 degrees Celsius, Washim was the coolest place on Monday. Speaking about the probability forecast for January, DS Pai, who heads the climate research and services at IMD, Pune said that as per the weather forecast given by IMD, the days will report cooler than normal day temperature. “The chill during the day is likely to continue in January as cloudy weather will be seen over Maharashtra and Pune city. And as a result, the overall day temperature will be cooler than normal. Our probability forecast for January also shows the same data,” said Pai. He added that while days are cooler the night temperature may be slightly warmer than normal. “This means that night temperature will be higher than normal which may keep the winter chills at bay. A similar trend was observed in December as well,” he said. As per the forecast issued by IMD officials, in some parts of the city, night temperature is likely to touch 20 degrees Celsius in the next few days. Also, the day temperature will be 30 degrees Celsius or less in the next few days. In December last year, the lowest minimum temperature for the month was reported on December 20 and December 21 at 11.3 degrees Celsius. This minimum temperature was warmer than normal resulting in the night temperature to remain on the higher side. However, the city experienced cooler days in December. The warmest day temperature reported last month was 32.1 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-to-experience-cool-days-warmer-nights-imd-101641218431354.html
03-01-2022||Mumbai||Districts in Maharashtra to submit revised list of wetlands by Jan 15||Mumbai: The State Wetland Authority, (SWLA) chaired by cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray, has directed all district collectors to submit a fresh assessment of wetlands in their jurisdiction by January 15, officials privy to the development confirmed. The directions were given at a meeting of the SWLA on December 9, according to the minutes. Environmentalists agree that the development is a positive step, but caution that the move may be too little too late, given the extent of wetlands in Maharashtra, particularly the coastal wetlands, that has shrunk in the last five years due to anthropogenic activities.The fresh assessment was announced during a webinar on World Mangroves Day in July 2021 by the forest and environment departments, and the revised brief documents were to be submitted by the districts in September last year. “But there has been a delay on account of Covid-19, therefore the timelines were extended for all districts,” said an official familiar with the matter, seeking anonymity. The official also added that the wetlands will be inventorised based on the union environment ministry’s 2017 Wetland Rules, a move that has drawn opposition from environmentalists.In February last year, the environment department had submitted to the Bombay High Court (HC) that the number of wetlands in Maharashtra has shrunk from 44,714 in 2010, to 15,865 in 2020, on account of a change in the definition of wetlands in the Central legislation.“Other than this definitional exclusion, there has been a lot of physical wetland reduction between 2015 and 2018, just as the new wetland rules were coming into play. Wetlands in Palghar, Vasai-Virar and in Uran are prime examples. The state government should have drawn up a wetland atlas of its own back in 2013 when it was asked to do so by the HC. If you are going to stick with the 2017 definition of wetlands in the fresh assessment, there will be many others that are at risk of becoming declassified, like Panje or TSC-NRI wetlands in Navi Mumbai,” said Stalin D, director of environment NGO Vanashakti, who is a petitioner in two cases relating to wetland protection, in the Bombay High Court and Supreme Court (SC).Stalin also pointed to the relevance of two orders from 2015, one by the Supreme Court and another by the Bombay High Court, which upheld the validity of the National Wetland Atlas of 2010, drawn up by the Space Application Centre in Ahmedabad. “Even the National Green Tribunal in an unrelated matter has come forward and said that the National Wetland Atlas needs to be followed while identifying wetlands. Between 2018 and 2019, the Maharashtra government did carry out its assessment, but the HC found it to be incorrect. While this process has been delayed, whole wetlands have been reclaimed and buried, like in Uran for example,” Stalin added.The government official cited above confirmed that this was the case. “There was a lot of ambiguity in the older reports, which is why the state government is now carrying out this fresh assessment. However, as the Central government has gone ahead and notified the 2017 wetland rules, that is the document we have to follow in our assessment,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/districts-in-maharashtra-to-submit-revised-list-of-wetlands-by-jan-15-101641217530834.html

Residents will need to submit the proposals in the next three months. Later municipal administration will start the scrutiny of the proposals and approve them.Maharashtra government had given a nod to regularise such homes last year, but PMC was avoiding the process despite political pressure on the administration.Mohol said, “The process would be online and as per the guidelines issued by the state government. Homes located in the green belt, water bodies, bio-diversity park area and others would not be regularised.”“Citizens would need to submit the proposals online. The civic body has also fixed the rates for architects and engineers fees as residents would not need to pay more,” he said.Maharashtra government issued a letter on October 21 to PMC and other municipal corporations to regularise gunthewari and framed the guidelines for the same.Mayor held a meeting with the municipal commissioner, additional municipal commissioner and city engineer Prashant Waghmare on Monday and it is decided to start the process immediately.As municipal elections are ahead all the political parties were aggressive to start the process.All political parties welcomed the decision. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state unit president Chandrakant Patil said, “I followed up the issue with state government and later instructed the office bearers in PMC to decide on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-start-gunthewari-regularisation-process-from-january-10-101641215432235.html
03-01-2022||Mumbai||Mithibai College to hold PG exams offline, students unhappy||Mumbai: Despite repeated appeals by the postgraduate (PG) students of Mithibai College in Vile Parle to conduct their examination in the online mode, the management of the institute is going ahead with the offline examination for semester 1 and 3 PG students, starting January 4. This, amid spiralling Covid-19 cases in Mumbai and the fear of a third wave. Unhappy and sad with the management’s decision, students share their concerns. “The exam schedule was announced in October last year and no one complained then because Covid cases were low. By December, cases started rising and we brought out concerns to the attention of the college management, but to no avail. At present, most of us are scared for our own health and that of our family members,” said a student seeking anonymity. He added that repeated emails and queries to the college principal and vice-principal are receiving no response of late.Nearly 300 PG students are scheduled to appear for physical exams between January 4 and 13. The college student council also raised objections to the management, hoping for respite in this matter. “Undergraduate exams are held online but we PG students have to appear for exams offline. To our queries, the only response we have received so far is that this schedule was announced in advance and that as yet, the University of Mumbai or state government have not announced anything against physical/hybrid classes, so exams will go on as per schedule,” said another student.In October last year, state education minister Uday Samant announced the reopening of colleges in hybrid mode and to bring back students for physical classes in a phased manner starting October 20. All MU affiliated colleges have been conducting hybrid classes since then and a handful of institutes are now pushing for offline exams for smaller batches.While the principal of the institute Krutika Desai refused to share comments on this issue, a senior official said the college is abiding by all social distancing rules in order to conduct exams. “Just like hybrid classes, these exams will be held following all Covid safety protocols. Students need to understand that online exams cannot be conducted forever,” said the official.

03-01-2022||Bangalore||On stage, Cong MP DK Suresh, Karnataka minister Ashwathnarayan have a heated exchange | Watch||A clash erupted between Karnataka Congress MP DK Suresh and state minister CN Ashwathnarayan in the presence of chief minister Basavaraj Bommai during an event in Ramanagara on Monday.Suresh, brother of Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar, could be seen walking towards Ashwathnarayan, who was addressing the event, following which the minister made a move towards the Congress MP.ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿ ಎಂದರೆ ಗೂಂಡಾ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿ ಎಂಬುದಕ್ಕೆ ಇದಕ್ಕಿಂತ ಬೇರೆ ಉದಾಹರಣೆ ಬೇರೆ ಬೇಕಿಲ್ಲ.ಒಬ್ಬ ಸಂಸದರಿಗೆ ರಾಜ್ಯದ ಮುಖ್ಯಮಂತ್ರಿ ಇರುವ ವೇದಿಕೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹೇಗೆ ವರ್ತಿಸಬೇಕೆಂಬ ಪರಿಜ್ಞಾನವಿಲ್ಲದಿರುವುದು ವಿಪರ್ಯಾಸ.ಯಥಾ ರಾಜ ತಥಾ ಪ್ರಜಾ ಎಂಬಂತೆ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ನಾಯಕರು, ಕಾರ್ಯಕರ್ತರು ವರ್ತಿಸುತ್ತಿರುವುದು ಖಂಡನೀಯ. pic.twitter.com/pp9GhdUIzlAs the exchange of words turned into a heated one, police and other people present on the podium intervened and separated the two men.The ruling BJP camp said the Congress’ culture was synonymous to “goon culture”. “ It is ironic that an MP does not know how to act on the platform of the Chief Minister of the State,” the party said in a tweet, sharing a video of the incident.Also read | Row erupts over move to free temples from Karnataka govt’s controlThe issue started with some Congress workers and supporters who walked on to the stage where CM Bommai was sitting and raised slogans supporting Shivakumar. They waved black flags as a sign of opposition to the CM before the event started.Ashwathnarayan said, “Is this how you behave when a chief minister comes? Should you shout like this to ruin the district’s reputation? If you are a man, show it in your work. You create problems by bringing some people to the function. Show what you have done with your work. We did not come here to cheat people, we came here to work.”Bommai also signaled Ashwathnarayan to stop the remarks, but it seemed too late by then as Suresh had already started walking up to the minister asking him to stop his speech.Later, Ashwathnarayan continued his address as Suresh sat in protest on the stage against the minister.The incident came days ahead of a planned march by the Congress in support of the Mekedatu project in Cauvery river, which the party claims that the BJP is trying to stall.The event in Ramanagara was organised to unveil two statues of BR Ambedkar and Kempegowda by the CM. Health minister K Sudhakar was also present during the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/on-stage-cong-mp-dk-suresh-karnataka-minister-ashwathnarayan-have-a-heated-exchange-watch-101641211166449.html
03-01-2022||Delhi||Omicron: Delhi sees 28% spike in new Covid cases, DDMA to meet on Tuesday||Delhi recorded 4,099 confirmed fresh cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and one related death in the last 24 hours, according to the daily health bulletin. The national capital reported a spike of around 28 per cent in new Covid cases after it witnessed 3,194 infections on Sunday. The active cases of the virus in Delhi current stand at around 11,000, with 6,288 patients currently in home isolation.As per the latest Delhi government data, 307 Covid patients are admitted in hospitals, of which 94 are on oxygen support and four patients are on ventilator support. As many as 195 Covid patients are being treated in dedicated Covid care centres.Delhi stares at more curbs as minister warns of positivity rate reaching 6.5%Delhi's health minister Satyendra Jain earlier said that 84 per cent of Covid-19 cases recorded in the last two days in the national capital were of the highly contagious Omicron variant of coronavirus. “84% of the Covis-19 cases reported in Delhi in the past two days were of the Omicron variant. Delhi's expected to report around 4,000 cases today with the positivity rate rising to 6.5 per cent,” Jain told reporters on Monday.The worrying spike in new Omicron cases and the positivity rate hovering around 6.5% can prompt the government to announce further curbs under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) will meet on Tuesday morning under the chairmanship of Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal to review the prevailing Covid situation in Delhi. It is likely to discuss the need for more curbs in the national capital to contain the virus. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will also take part in the meeting, which will be held through virtual mode.The ongoing restrictions were implemented after a yellow alert was issued last week as Delhi reported over 1.5% Covid positivity rate for two consecutive days. Under the yellow alert, cinema halls, theatres, and other places of gathering are closed. The night curfew from 10pm to 5am is also in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/omicron-delhi-sees-28-spike-in-new-covid-cases-positivity-rate-at-646-101641209023568.html
03-01-2022||Delhi||Unmasked, unfazed: How Delhi welcomed 2022!||New Delhi Between December 31 and January 1, Delhi reported 2,716 new Covid cases, which is being reported as the highest single-day spike since May 2021. And it’s around the same time that Delhiites decided to throng some of the historical monuments and public parks in the city, throwing caution to the wind! Of course, the occasion of ringing in the New Year and celebrating the moment to the hilt, seemed to be more overpowering. As if the visuals of crazy crowds at popular city markets and malls, in December, weren’t enough that you get to picture this — queues at places such as Humayun’s Tomb, Sunder Nursery and Lodhi Garden. With the New Year, the footfall at Delhi’s historical monuments and public parks almost doubled up. For many, picnicking at these spots on January 1, it seemed to be a revenge for not being able to throng cinemas, multiplexes and malls, due to the restrictions as per the yellow alert in Delhi. Spotted with food baskets placed on bedsheets spread over the green lawns, many a Delhiites welcomed 2022, while being unmasked, paying little thought to social distancing, and certainly collecting in large numbers! One would want to believe that the spike in Covid cases would have discouraged people from visiting public places, but the situation was the opposite. Ranajit Roy, a tourist guide at Humayun’s Tomb, informs us that the footfall nearly doubled, of what he saw in last December end, and claims that the weekend made New Year revellers hurdle at the 16th century monument. “Many temples are closed, the malls are allowing limited entry, and cinemas are completely shut. So people are turning up at monuments like these. I can surely say that the number of visitors are definitely double than what I saw in November last year. Some people are following Covid rules, but many are visibly not interested.” Manpreet Singh, another guide at Humayun’s Tomb, adds, “If this is how it’s going to get crowded, then there should be more ticketing windows so that those coming in don’t have to wait for too long, and are able to get a ticket within five minutes. When there is a delay in getting the tickets, then it starts getting crowded right from the entry point itself. Many visitors have been tell us that they had to struggle in procuring online tickets, and then we see them come here and not even follow social distancing.” According to an official statement, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), recently said: “This time of the year usually sees an increase in footfall, since people like to spend year-end festive time and holidays at heritage monuments. Our data shows an increase in footfall. This time, we are requesting all visitors to follow all Covid norms. Our staff has placed sanitisers in the monuments premises, and regularly urges people to mask up and socially distance.”That is, however, not really how the visitors at historical monuments are behaving. Nikhil Gupta, who we met while he was on his way to buy tickets for his wife and himself, for an entry to Humayun’s Tomb, tells us, “It sure is difficult to control a huge crowd. Iska toh koi kuchh nahi kar sakta. Bahar red light par Covid violations ke challan kat rahe hain, and inside the monuments people can be spotted with their masks casually pulled down. Me and my wife aren’t taking off our masks, even for a second! We do want to enjoy the rest of the year in a healthy way, and not fall prey to the virus.” And Bittu Pandey, a Delhi-based college student, who was visiting the Bada Gumbad in Lodhi Garden, says, “I’ve come here with my friends. We’re all from different colleges, and are meeting to celebrate the New Year. We’re not very fearful because we are following all Covid protocols. We are only taking our masks off to click photographs.” Many like Pandey were spotted picnicking at this popular spot, and Manish Sharma, a guard on duty at Lodhi Garden, says: “Ek toh New Year ho gaya, phir Saturday-Sunday ho gaya. Sabko relax karna hai, enjoy karna hai, isiliye yahan aa rahe hain. Par Covid se pehle wale time se tulna karo toh jitne log aye hain iss saal New Year par, woh kam hain, par kaafi log ho gaye hain, bheed badane ke liye.” Devika Sakhuja, a city-based wedding planner says, “I came to Sunder Nursery with my friend Disha, in the morning, to have a relaxed. But as soon as the clock struck 2, we saw the crowd getting swell inside the nursery, and in quite a haste we walked out. Thank God we left before an encounter with such a crowd, and exposing ourselves to so many people at the same time. It’s purely by chance that we timed our visit well!”One good thing is that the crowd is helping small businesses stay afloat. Dev Singh, an autorickshaw driver who usually plies around the area of Humayun’s Tomb, informs, “Abhi tak toh business kaafi down tha hum logon ka. Par December ke last week se logon ka yahan aana badha hai. Abhi utne log nahi aate jaise corona se pehle aate the, par uss time bheed hoti bhi thi toh safe tha bahar nikalna. Saal ke pehle din toh sawari achchi mil gayi, bas sabki sehat bhi achchi hi bani rahe. Sab bhagwan bharose hai.” Footfall doubles at Delhi’s monuments As per the ticketing data from Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Humayun’s Tomb saw a footfall of more than 2,300 adults, on one of the days between 20 to 27 December 2021. At Qutub Minar, the highest footfall has doubled and gone up from 2,600 during the same week in November to 4,900 in December. Even at the Red Fort, most of the last week of November saw a footfall under 1,500 adults. But come December end, and most days witnessed a footfall well above that point, touching 2,000 and even reaching 3,655 and 3,803 on two days in December’s last week.Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/unmasked-unfazed-how-delhi-welcomed-2022-101641209739103.html

A cousin of the girl, who was playing with her outside their house, had a miraculous escape.Residents said they informed the police immediately after the accident but they reached the spot half an hour late. The delay angered the mob that set the vehicle on fire. Later, an additional police force was rushed to the stop to pacify the mob as the traffic in the area was disrupted for two hours.Gaya’s senior police superintendent Aditya Kumar said that they sent a team to the spot immediately after the accident and a First Information Report had been registered against the bus driver. He said that the police team sent the girl’s body for post-mortem immediately. Kumar said that the driver and cleaner of the bus have been absconding since leaving their vehicle behind after the accident.
03-01-2022||Pune||Monday Musings: Politics, drama and power co-op bank polls has it all||PUNE The elections for District Central Cooperative (DCC) banks would otherwise go unnoticed given the limited financial clouts these institutions hold. It wasn’t really the case this time.If the defeat of Shashikant Shinde and some other local leaders made headlines during these polls in Satara in November, last week saw elections for Sindhudurg DCC bank polls dominating the news cycle with Union minister Narayan Rane and his younger son Nitesh under focus from media.The media went overboard, some may say, in covering the elections. But there was politics, drama, and conflict - some of the basic determinants to make a good story.But beyond that, there was a stiff tussle from both sides to take these DCC banks under control. The same was at display in Satara where Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Member of Legislative Council (MLC) Shashikant Shinde suffered defeat for the post of board of directors at DCC bank by one vote from nearest rival and NCP rebel Dyandev Ranjane. As the news of poll loss reached, a group of Shinde supporters reached the NCP office in Satara city and pelted stones.At Sindhudurg, just before the polls, Nitesh, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Kankavali, was booked in an attempt to murder case after the assault on Santosh Parab, who was among those leading the charge of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in the district bank polls. A local court had rejected his anticipatory bail plea even as Nitesh was still missing. Rane senior took things in his control and ensured his panel surges ahead. Finally, the BJP led panel having loyalists of Rane won 11 out of 19 seats, regaining the control of the bank that lends money to farmers, fishermen, mills and other industries.The violence for an election witnessing heated contests followed by police action and underlying politics offered everything that journalists would have looked up to. So why in such polls do we see battles that the upcoming state elections may also witness?The polls for cooperative banks are crucial as these institutions play an important role in funding various businesses including cooperative sugar mills and other industries controlled by political leaders.So, if a particular politician controls the bank, lending finance to other institutions or businesses under him becomes easier. This is what has happened in Maharashtra over the decades. In a way, control of the cooperative framework meant a consolidation of political, economic and social power. The stronger the grip over cooperative banks, sugar mills, credit societies, the more are chances to sway voters, who are also the shareholders in these institutions.The Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) action against Jarandeshwar Sahkari Sugar Karkhana, a sugar mill located in Satara district, is a classic case in point. The ED in June 2021 had attached a sugar mill, linked to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and over ₹65 crores were attached under the anti-money laundering law after it was alleged that the mill was fraudulently sold by the then officials and directors of Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank at throw-away prices to their relatives. The bank was then controlled by directors who were mostly politicians with Pawar being one.The bank lent money without following due procedure to several sugar mills including Jarandeshwar Sahkari Sugar Karkhana and then sold them to their kith and kin at throw-away prices when they were unable to repay the loans, thus causing loss to the bank. Pawar has denied all the charges saying there were illegalities and the mill was sold as per High Court’s directions.This is not a one-off case in Maharashtra where a politician controlling bank, which has financed sugar mills or other businesses without following due procedure. The Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank- the apex bank of 31 district co-operative banks - has seen a series of investigations in the past eight years—a National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development report, state government inquiries, and a private complaint.The political nexus is unmissable. This has been on for decades as cooperative barons perfected the model of wielding political power through farm co-operatives and district co-operative banks. Yashwantrao Chavan, Vasantdada Patil and, to a lesser extent, Shankarrao Chavan were stalwarts of the cooperative political economy. The Marathas dominated the sector. In the past three decades, Pawar became its symbol. Before the 2019 state assembly polls, an ambitious BJP keen to deepen its footprint in rural Maharashtra tried to ensure several defections among NCP and Congress whose leaders switched loyalties overnight.In most instances during the past three decades, co-operatives had chairmen who had contested or won parliamentary or assembly elections. Having a stronger grip over sugar co-operatives help politicians rise in the party and governmental hierarchy, which in turn get them nominated to the boards of other co-operatives, especially banks. Thus, a “two-way” relationship guarantees money and political power.The members of cooperative banks or sugar mills are however mostly poor to middle-income farmers. They are often a captive vote bank for the politician-co-operative chiefs.

The vaccination will be carried out from 10am to 5pm at 38 government health centres, and 39 government and private schools, officials said, adding that 10 private hospitals in the city will also administer Covid-19 vaccine to the teens. The officials said that children can register both online and at the vaccination centre for taking the jab. At all vaccination centres, 50% slots can be booked online and the rest are for walk-in registrations, they said. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram, appealed to the residents of the district to get their children vaccinated and strengthen the fight against the pandemic. “The way the residents made the vaccination campaign above 18 years of age a success, they must also help in making the vaccination campaign for 15-18 years a success by getting their children vaccinated at the earliest. This will help us in the fight against the current surge of Covid-19 cases,” said Yadav. The schools where vaccination camps will be set up include DAV School Khandsa Road, Sanskriti School, DAV School Sector 49, Government School Basai Enclave, CD International School, Lions Public School, Bal Bharti Public School IMT Manesar, Government School C Block Palam Vihar, GSSS Daultabad, Government School Ghata, and Johri School (GSSS Wazirabad). At all sites, Covaxin doses will be administered to the children, the officials said. Dr MP Singh, district surveillance officer, said, “For the vaccination camps being set up in private schools, only those who are students of a particular school will be given the vaccine at that centre after showing their identity cards. If there are schools which have a smaller number of beneficiaries, then the two centres can be clubbed.” Paediatric experts said that children should come forward and take the vaccine, but if any child has a comorbidity, then parents must consult with a physician first. Dr Manish Mannan, head of department for paediatrics and neonatology at Paras Hospital in the city, said, “Vaccination for the 15-18 age group is starting from Monday and this is the only way to avoid Covid-19 while following all safety protocols. Some things that parents have to keep in mind is that if a child has a comorbidity, an infection or a fever, then before vaccination, they should contact a doctor before going for vaccination.” “If a person has recently taken another vaccine, such as the flu vaccine, then there should be a gap of at least four weeks so that both the vaccines are effective. The beneficiaries must also wait at the centre for half an hour after vaccination, so that immediate action can be taken if any side effect is observed,” he added. Meanwhile, on Sunday, 9,376 people received Covid-19 jabs, of which 3,185 took their first dose and 6,191 the second dose, according to data from the health department. With this, over 4.28 million doses have been administered in the district so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-aims-to-vaccinate-7-7k-children-aged-15-18-years-today-101641199469570.html

03-01-2022||Gurugram||Haryana: Death toll in Bhiwani mining incident rises to 5||One more body was pulled out from under the debris at a mining site in Dadam here, taking the death toll to five in an accident triggered by a landslide.Four bodies were recovered on Saturday after the incident. Two people were injured.A BJP MP from the area alleged violation of mining parameters at the site.Meanwhile, officials said the rescue operations will continue for the time being to clear the debris and to rule out the possibility of any other person being trapped there."The body of a worker was pulled out from under the debris late Sunday evening," SHO of Tosham police station Sukhbir said over the phone.The victim was about 50 years of age and belonged to a village near Rohtak.Speaking to reporters in Bhiwani after visiting the accident site, ruling BJP MP from Bhiwani-Mahendergarh Dharambir Singh alleged violation of several laid down norms for mining at four sites in the Dadam mining zone.He said he will urge Chief Minister Manohal Lal Khattar to order a thorough probe into the landslide and its reasons so that such incidents are not repeated.Speaking to reporters in Panchkula on the sidelines of an event, Khattar, however, said he has directed the mining department to find out whether there was any violation of laid down parameters for mining at the site."If any violation is found, action will be taken," he said.Bhiwani Deputy Commissioner Rippudaman Singh, who visited the site and had been regularly taking stock of the rescue operation, had earlier in the day said the rescue operation at the site was still going on and it was being led by the NDRF.Before the body of the fifth man was pulled out from under the debris, SDM Manish Phogat had said, "At least one more person continues to be trapped under the debris."The SDM had not ruled out the possibility of one more person such as a helper being trapped as their records may not have been maintained."The rescue operation is likely to continue until Monday afternoon," Phogat said. Shifting big boulders was consuming time, he said.After the incident around 9 am on Saturday, police had said around half a dozen dumper trucks and some machines were buried under the debris.Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij had said several rescue teams, including those from the National Disaster Response Force, State Disaster Response Force and the Army, were pressed into service.Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja Sunday demanded a judicial probe, monitored by a sitting Supreme Court judge.In a statement, Selja, a former Union minister, alleged that illegal mining was going on in Dadam and deep digging was going on at the site without permission.She said the Congress demands a financial assistance of ₹25 lakh for the next of kin of each of those killed in the incident and ₹10 lakh to those injured.Holding the BJP-JJP government responsible for the incident, former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Hooda had on Saturday alleged that there had been a "scam of thousands of crores" in the Dadam mining zone."Even the Supreme Court has made a serious remark on this matter and illegal mining is being done in this area by flouting all rules but the government is not conducting a fair investigation. The opposition demands that there should be a judicial inquiry into the entire scam," Hooda had said.Senior Congress leader and MLA from Tosham, Kiran Choudhary, has demanded an independent probe, alleging that the mining in the area has been going on in an illegal manner.Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala too had alleged that the illegal mining was going on under the Khattar regime and asked the BJP government who was responsible for these deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/haryana-death-toll-in-bhiwani-mining-incident-rises-to-5-101641171983621.html

We have called a meeting of SKM leaders on January 15 to discuss the future course of action,” he said.Meanwhile, Dadri independent MLA Sombir Sangwan, who organised the khap mahapanchayat, said adults should concern their parents before getting married to a partner of their choice. Meghalaya governor Satya Pal Malik, who was the chief guest, was not able to attend the mahapanchayat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-will-carry-out-tractor-march-on-rdaytikait-101641169467083.html
03-01-2022||Chandigarh||Bhiwani landslide: At least one person still trapped, say officials||A day after four persons were killed, and two others were injured after a landslide struck the Dadam mining site in Bhiwani district, officials on Sunday said that it is feared that at least one person is still trapped under the debris, and efforts are on to unearth his body. “As per rescue teams, the person still trapped under the debris used to drive a machine at the mining site,” said Bhiwani superintendent of police Ajit Singh Shekhawat, adding that one of the two persons injured in the landslide had been discharged.Tosham sub-divisional magistrate Manish Phogat did not rule out the possibility of more people, such as helpers, being trapped as their records may not have been maintained in the daily register. “ The entire area near the site has been cordoned off,” the SDM said.Hurdles in rescue opsNational Disaster Response Force deputy director BR Meena said the teams had a tough time carrying out the rescue operations on Saturday night and Sunday morning due to the fog.“We also faced difficulty removing a big boulder. So far, we have pulled out two excavators and four dumpers from the rubble. However, another dumper is still trapped in the debris. We have started drilling and have to break the ceiling of a seven-tonne rock which is 40 feet long and 30 feet wide. The rescue operation will continue till Monday. We have called in mining experts, and explosions are being carried out in small areas to avert another landslide,” Meena said.Team formed to probe matterThe SP said, “The deputy commissioner has constituted a team to investigate the matter, and check whether any norms were violated while mining. So far, there is no evidence that illegal mining was carried out at the Dadam mining site.”A senior official, requesting anonymity, said the mining contract had been given to Yamunanagar-based Govardhan Mines, which pays ₹9 crore to the state each month. “The company has to utilise 10% of the mining profit on developing Dadam village. However, it is yet to launch any developmental project in the region, and owes nine instalments, amounting to nearly ₹81 crore,” he said.On the second day of the rescue operation, teams of the NDRF from Ghaziabad, and State Disaster Response Force team from Madhuban, and an army unit of Hisar joined the rescue operation.Large-scale mining operations are carried out in the Khanak and Dadam hills in Bhiwani’s Tosham assembly constituency.BJP MP blames illegal miningBJP MP from Bhiwani-Mahendergarh parliamentary Dharambir Singh alleged that illegal mining was being carried out at the Dadam mining site. “The contractors never allowed the common man to enter the site. They have been extracting the stone being used in building material by violating all norms. They have been extracting stone below the permissible limit. The contractors had extracted stone from a depth of around 400 feet, which is not permitted he said.Two months ago, mining work had been banned on site due to rising pollution levels. Work had restarted on December 31, a day after the National Green Tribunal allowed resumption of work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bhiwani-landslide-at-least-one-person-still-trapped-say-officials-101641169226984.html

03-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiwale: A working life||The man in the black hat is walking silently along the roadside, and yet he is attracting a great amount of notice. Heads are turning towards him almost instinctively. May be it is the peculiarity of his walking style. His arms, legs, and neck are moving jerkily in short mechanical movements. While the cane in his hand appears to have a life of its own—at one moment whirring into a blur, then slowing down, and picking up velocity yet again. The man’s painted face is frozen into a wide smile.Sikander Nath is a joker—that is the word he uses to describe himself. “My business is to make public laugh… today I’m being Charlie Chaplin.” In his spare time outside of assignments, Mr Nath walks through parts of the city, performing comic acts on the way, and accepting whatever cash people give him for the entertainment. In fact, this is exactly what he is doing today in Gurugram’s New Railway Road. This afternoon, a long traffic jam has clogged up the dusty road, and the “public”—stuck up inside stationary cars and buses—is looking fascinated as Mr Nath carries on with his act.“It is my khandani pesha (hereditary profession),” he says. “My father worked as a joker, my grandfather worked as a joker.” Like Mr Nath, they too have been Chaplin mimics. The family’s repertoire, however, is varied. “We have been Laila Majnu… my dada used to be Jaani Dushman, and also Kroor Singh… I’ve played Motu Patlu in children’s birthday parties.”Expressing satisfaction with his profession, Mr Nath does not expect his children, two sons and one daughter, to continue with the family legacy. “They are in school, they are studying, they will not work as a joker… they will do something else.”Like what?He thinks for a few moments and says, “They will educate themselves, they will find other work, they will earn good salaries… may be they will work in wedding bands, may be they will play the dhol.”Mr Nath now goes back to his work. He starts performing a Chaplin-style mime without uttering a single word. It is like watching a silent movie. Wading into the stranded traffic, he crosses the road, a frozen smile plastered on his painted face.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-working-life-101641167410087.html

Knitwear and Apparels Manufacturers Association of Ludhiana (KAMAL) president Sudarshan Jain said, “If the weddings will not take place, the sales of garments/textile will ultimately go down. We have already seen about a 50% drop in sales. Once restrictions are imposed by the government, the public also stops spending on garments etc and starts to save money for emergencies.” “We are not against the restrictions as the health of the public should be in priority, but the government should not immediately act strict at once as it inculcates fear in the minds of the public, which is not good for business and economy. The restrictions can be imposed in phases after looking at the number of cases,” he added.Industrialists said a large proportion of manufactured products are sold in wholesale markets in New Delhi, adding that the low demand, non-payment of dues, suspected sales return have all become major concerns. Low sales this year due to relatively high temperatures being witnessed during the winter season and pandemic-related restrictions have added to the woes, the representatives added. Ludhiana Woollen Manufacturers Association and Knitwear Club president Darshan Dawar said, “Around 30-35 percent of the business has already been impacted as different restrictions have been imposed in Delhi. Fear has grown in the minds of traders due to which they are not stocking the products. Already 25% of the products manufactured by industry have not been sold due to low demand in the market, as comparatively high temperatures are being witnessed. The sector is going through a tough time.”With lockdown-like restrictions being imposed in other states including Haryana and West Bengal as well, the industrialists said the condition will further deteriorate and owners of many units will be forced to shut down operations.Knitwear and Apparel Exporters Association president Harish Dua said, “It is a very critical situation for the sector and the situation might further deteriorate as the payments might get stuck and the manufacturers also suspect sales return. The government should consider the economic impact of imposing the restrictions as many of the units are already on the verge of collapse. The market is already moving through a slump and this has added to the misery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lockdownlike-situation-in-new-delhi-leaves-ludhiana-s-hosiery-and-textile-sector-staring-at-losses-101641162508622.html

The move comes following reports of rising number of accidents involving pedestrians.Besides, proposal for Ladhowal- Phillaur bypass including construction of new eight-lane bridge on Satluj River are also under consideration.Overpass was the need of hour“Yes, the projects are under pipeline to ease traffic chaos as Ladhowal area is emerging as a bottle neck. Further, there was a dire need to put in place an overpass to help migrant labourers and residents residing on both sides of the village and help them cross the road cross the highway without putting their life at risk,” said Virendra Singh, project director, NHAI.He further said besides pedestrian overpasses, other projects of public convenience were being carried out to ease the problem being faced by commuters.  ₹300 crore expenditure already doneVirendra Singh added approximately ₹300 crore expenditure has been done in the last one year on road repair, gantries, signages and other maintenance works. The target is to spend around ₹500-600 crore more in the next two years on this highway. 3rd rainwater harvesting system underway“While the rainwater harvesting system installed at Dhandari, Giaspura has started functioning from the second week of December, the construction for a third rainwater harvesting system was underway near Sherpur Chowk. Moreover, the damaged wall of Khanna Flyover has been repaired using the latest techniques minimising the trouble to road users,” said Singh.At both the spots there was a serious problem of water logging which was resulting in damage to the road.He said that six laning of GT Road NH-1 (new NH-44) Panipat-Jalandhar was allotted to a private company in 2009 but due to the poor maintenance of the highway, the NHAI has terminated the contract and since last one year, it is maintaining it directly through its agencies.He added that the road users have suffered a lot of inconvenience during the last eight-nine years due to abnormal delays in construction and poor maintenance.“However, after taking over the project, a lot of work has been done to improve the condition of the highway,” said Virendra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-nhai-kicks-off-work-for-pedestrian-overpass-at-sahnewal-more-projects-in-line-101641162506145.html

Goel, who is also the chairperson of The Indian Institute of Architects (Punjab Chapter), has written a letter to CM Channi, urging him to convene a meeting with architects and officials of special purpose vehicle (SPV) formed under the smart city mission to resolve the problems. He stated that the cities of the state, including the upcoming smart cities like Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Amritsar, are struggling due to traffic congestion and lack of parking space is further taking toll on the public. Different proposals have been made in the past to build multi-storey parking lots at Feroze Gandhi market, Books Market, near Aarti Chowk and other areas, but nothing has been done at the ground level, he added. “No doubt development projects are being taken up, but the chronic problems are being ignored. There is a dire need of establishing at least 10 multi-storey parking in the city. Apart from the old city areas, shortage of parking space is also a major issues in Ghumar Mandi, Model Town and Gol Market,” Goel said. “Encroachments on road sides are also a major issue. A lot of time and fuel is being wasted in traffic jams and public is facing harassment. Also, it adds to pollution. These issues need to the redressed on priority and special committee should be formed to tackle the problems related to traffic congestion and parking. The CM should call a meeting at the earliest,” he added. “Covering of parking space in building due to illegal construction is also a major concern and the government is working to regularise such unauthorised buildings by proposing one-time settlement policy, which is not good. The government and administration need to act strictly as similar issues are being faced in other cities of the state too. There are many other issues, including solid waste management and no proper rainwater harvesting,” said Goel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chronic-issues-being-ignored-ludhiana-smart-city-ltd-director-wants-punjab-cm-to-intervene-101641162386238.html
03-01-2022||Chandigarh||LIP will form an alliance with a pro-Punjab party, Bains says at Ludhiana rally||Amid political developments being witnessed in Punjab ahead of the assembly elections and speculations about the Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) joining hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), LIP president Simarjeet Singh Bains said they will enter in an alliance with a pro-Punjab party that would work for the betterment of the state. But no final decision has yet been taken, he added. There are two MLAs of the LIP — Simarjeet Bains from Atam Nagar constituency and his elder brother Balvinder Bains from South constituency. The statement was issued during the ‘Lok Jagao, Punjab Bachao’ rally organised by the LIP near Flower Enclave Chowk on 200ft road (Gill constituency) on Sunday. Addressing the gathering, Bains slammed the traditional parties and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for trying to “befool” the public and making tall promises by announcing freebies even when the state was under a huge debt. He also criticised the AAP for not paying the water bills to the state even as the same was promised by its convener Arvind Kejriwal during 2017 elections. “All parties are announcing freebies for the voters ahead of the elections, but no one has put forward the action plan about how they will do so as the state is already under a debt of ₹3 lakh crore. Even if the government stops illegal mining in Punjab, the state can earn around ₹1 lakh crore revenue annually and the debt can be repaid. But the traditional parties are looting the public exchequer, while the people have been suffering,” Bains said. “We are two MLAs in the LIP and the number will increase with the support of the public. It will not be possible for any party to form its government in the state without the support of the LIP in 2022,” claimed Bains while adding that the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Congress were trying to “tarnish” his image through fake rape complaints. But the public knows the truth and will support the LIP in the upcoming elections, he said. ‘Rape victim’ stages protest near rally siteThe rape victim, who had been sitting on a protest outside the office of police commissioner since February last year to seek the arrest of Bains, reached near rally site and staged an agitation in the presence of cops. The complainant alleged that the Congress had been protecting Bains, even as an FIR has been lodged against him and he has been issued non-bailable warrants.Bains, however, said that issuance of warrants was a judicial process and the case was subjudice. “We have full faith in the judicial system and I believe that justice will be served,” he added. ‘ PM Modi should write off debt of state and farmers’Speaking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the state on January 5, Bains said the BJP was in alliance with the SAD for around 25 years in Punjab, but it did nothing concrete for betterment. “Now when the PM is visiting Punjab, he should write off the debt of the state and farmers. Also, Chandigarh should be transferred to Punjab,” he added. Covid norms go for a tossAt a time when cases of Covid are rising and concerns over Omicron variant are mounting, safety norms went for a toss at the rally with hundreds of participants seen without masks and not adhering to social distancing guidelines. Sunny Kainth is party candidate from Gill constituencyDuring the rally, Bains announced Gagandeep Singh Kainth (Sunny) as the party’s candidate from Gill constituency. Kainth is the state president of the LIP’s youth wing and was appointed as in-charge of Gill constituency in the past. He was once considered a close aide of sitting Congress MLA from Gill constituency, Kuldeep Vaid. Former district vice-president of Youth Congress, Kainth had left the party in 2019 after he was reportedly sidelined. He had accused Vaid of corruption and promoting nepotism by trying to bring his family members into politics. Since then, Kainth had been targeting Vaid in the constituency over the problems being faced by residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lip-will-form-an-alliance-with-a-pro-punjab-party-bains-says-at-ludhiana-rally-101641162146341.html

03-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Contractual employees lay siege to NH-44||Members of the Theka Mulazam Sangharsh Morcha, Punjab, along with their families and various labour unions launched an indefinite protest and blocked the National Highway 44 (NH-44) in Khanna on Sunday. The protesters blocked the highway in front of the house of Punjab industry and commerce minister Gurkirat Singh Kotli. The police tried to pacify the them, but when they did not relent, cops diverted the traffic that resulted in a massive jam on alternative routes connecting the highway. The protesting union activists refused to lift dharna till their demands were met. The day also saw the death of an 18-month-old child, who was in an ambulance stuck in the traffic jam. The parents of the child are residents of Mohanpur village in Khanna.However, leaders of the protesting union said they were not responsible for the death. Varinder Singh Mohi, president of the morcha, said they had submitted a memorandum to the district administration nearly 15 days ago. He said that thousands of employees, along with their family members and children, were also bearing the vagaries of harsh cold weather. Khanna SDM Manjeet Kaur expressed regret over the death of the child. The SDM said she was informed that the child was seriously ill. “The reason of the death is being verified and it is being checked how and where the ambulance got stuck,” she added. In the meantime, the government is in talks with the protesting employees, she said. ‘Govt’s claim mere an eyewash’“The government’s claim of regularising the jobs of 36,000 contractual employees is mere an eyewash and a publicity stunt ahead of the elections. We have a simple demand. Enrol the daily wage employees on contract and regularise those working on contractual basis for a year,” said Mohi.He said that nearly 10,000 members of the union have arrived at the protest site so far and the number is likely to increase in the coming days. He said that each union member has been told to contribute for bedding and food arrangements.Commuters bear the bruntQueues of vehicles were seen on both sides of the highway in Khanna. While cars were being diverted to alternative routes, many passenger buses which were stuck cancelled their onward journey. Several private buses were diverted to Neelo Road, Samrala-Khanna road and Payal - Katani road, which led to a massive traffic jam at Katani Chowk and Samrala city.“We were heading towards Phagwara, but cops diverted the vehicles from Khanna. Now we are told to first go towards Morinda and from there take the connecting highway which leads to Phagwara. It is unfair to commuters and a sheer harassment. First, there should be no protest on the highways. And secondly, the authorities should make proper arrangements to tackle the problem if a prior announcement is made about the protest,” said Surinder Kumar from Karnal, who was visiting a relative in Phagwara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-contractual-employees-lay-siege-to-nh44-101641161666174.html
03-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh clamps fresh restrictions as daily Covid cases reach 96||With the daily Covid-19 cases hitting the 96 mark on Sunday, a 37% spike from the 70 cases the day before, the UT administration announced a slew of restrictions to contain the spread of the infection.An order issued by UT administrator Dharam Pal stated that restaurants, hotels, cafes, coffee shops, eating places, marriage palaces and banquet halls can operate only at 50% capacity, and only fully vaccinated adults or those who are not due for their second dose will be allowed inside.

Police will ensure that visitors wear masks and maintain social distancing, and violators will be issued challans.Any breach of these orders will invite action under Sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act and Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Owners of commercial establishments violating the orders will be fined ₹5,000 and will face action as per law on repeated violation.No access to public places without vaccinationReiterating its earlier order, the UT administration said that people who have yet to receive both doses of Covid-19 vaccine will not be allowed in public places in Chandigarh and will face a ₹500 fine if caught.A notice issued by the administrator said, “In public places with large gatherings, like vegetable and grain markets, public transport, parks, religious places, malls, shopping complexes, markets and other similar places, only fully vaccinated adults will be allowed from January 1. In case any adult, with overdue second dose is found, they will be fined ₹500. Non-payment of the fine will attract proceedings under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code.”Daily tally highest since June 5Chandigarh’s 96 Covid-19 cases on Sunday were the highest single-day count since June 5 when 98 people had tested positive.The city has been witnessing a continuous uptick in cases for the past five days, leading to concerns of another surge.The positivity rate also shot up overnight from 4.75% to 5.5%, as 96 of the 1,744 people tested were found infected. As many as 18 of these were reported from Manimajra alone. As per the UT health department, 82 of the 96 people found infected on Sunday are fully vaccinated.

Besides, seven have not been vaccinated yet as they are aged less than 18.“Of the 96 patients, only two required hospitalisation due to their medical history. Most of the fully vaccinated patients are asymptomatic. Though vaccinated people can also get infected, the vaccine is certainly helping in controlling the severity of infection and lowering hospitalisation and fatality rates,” said Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh.Virus claims 60-year-old woman’s life in MohaliA 60-year-old woman from Sector 78 became the latest Covid fatality in Mohali on Sunday.

03-01-2022||Chandigarh||Two days after stone-laying, GMADA cancels site for bus stand in Mohali’s Sector 77||Two days after Punjab local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra laid the foundation stone for the new bus stand in Sector 77 on December 31, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has cancelled the site, finding it unviable.The 14-acre site had been finalised along the Airport Road for the ₹150 crore bus stand project. But now stands cancelled, confirmed a senior GMADA official, privy to the development.“The site is not viable as a bus stand in Sector 77 will cause traffic gridlocks near the Airport Road. We are looking for an alternative site and will finalise it soon,” the official added.During the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the bus stand, Brahm Mohindra had said that due to its proximity to Airport Road, passengers would find it more convenient to travel to the Sector-43 Inter-State Bus Terminus (ISBT) in Chandigarh and to other cities from there.In November last year, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had directed GMADA to finalise a new site for the ISBT near Gurdwara Singh Shaheedan in Sohana, where around 14 acres of land is lying vacant. Local MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu and GMADA chief administrator Vipul Ujwal had attended the meeting along with other senior officials.Mohali already has the region’s first air-conditioned ISBT along the Chandigarh-Kharar highway in Phase 6. Twelve years after its inception, the bus terminal, which also houses a commercial complex, has become partially operational, but the commercial project is stuck in the corporate insolvency resolution process.The demand for a new bus stand within the city was made by Sidhu, following which the CM had directed GMADA to finalise the site, said a senior official who was present in the meeting.When contacted, Sidhu said, “I am not aware of this development, but we will not allow this to happen, as the foundation stone has already been laid for the bus stand. I will take up the matter with the authorities concerned on Monday.”He said as the Mohali municipal corporation was set to launch a local bus service, a bus stand in the centre of the city was the need of the hour.“The new bus stand on the Airport Road will be convenient for local commuters as well. The present bus stand weighs heavy on the pockets of passengers, who have to pay additionally to reach it before starting their journey,” he said.
03-01-2022||Chandigarh||Shown the door by Congress, Devinder Babla joins BJP with councillor wife||Hours after he was expelled by the Congress following his verbal spat with city Congress president Subhash Chawla on Saturday, party’s vice-president Devinder Singh Babla and his councillor wife, Harpreet Kaur Babla, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday. Having served the Congress for over three decades, the couple joined the saffron fold in the presence of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Chandigarh member of Parliament (MP) Kirron Kher, Chandigarh BJP president Arun Sood and senior party leader Sanjay Tandon. With this, BJP’s votes in the MC House, ahead of the mayoral elections, have matched the Aam Aadmi Party’s tally of 14 elected councillors. Apart from BJP’s 13 councillors, MP Kher also has one vote in the House.Before Harpreet switched sides, the BJP had 12 seats in the House, the Congress eight and the Shiromani Akali Dal one.In the House of 35 councillors, the majority mark is 18 votes. With the Chandigarh MP’s vote, 19 becomes the majority mark out of total 36 votes.‘Humiliated several times’Lashing out at the Congress, Devinder said he had been feeling suffocated in the Congress after being humiliated several times. “Even during the MC elections, no senior Congress leader came to our aide and we were left on our own. I have joined the BJP without any condition and hope to revamp the city in the next six months,” he said, claiming that the remaining seven Congress councillors will also soon be joining the BJP.Taking a dig at AAP, Babla said it was a group of frauds, which won the 14 seats by befooling the people of Chandigarh: “Most of their promises before elections were fake.”Wife likely to be BJP’s mayoral faceAs per party sources, the BJP is likely to field Harpreet as its mayoral candidate. She had won the MC election from ward number 10, which was reserved for a woman candidate, with the highest winning margin of 3,103 votes.While welcoming the couple in the party fold, Kher said they will be given full respect in the party. “Tussi saade wehde aaye, tuhadda welcome (Your arrival at our house is welcome),” she said.AAP’s Chandigarh convener Prem Garg said, “Ever since the results of MC elections were announced, BJP has been indulging in horse-trading, which they have proved today. This is not good for the democracy. People should boycott such councillors, who are shifting loyalties right after elections as the public mandate should be respected.”Earlier in the day, Punjab and Chandigarh Congress in-charge Harish Chaudhary expelled Devinder from the primary membership of the party. Through a press release, Chaudhary stated that Devinder had been expelled following various complaints regarding indecent behaviour and anti-party activities.More voices of dissent against ChawlaEven as Devinder Singh Babla and wife Harpreet Kaur Babla joined the BJP, more Congress leaders are demanding the resignation of party’s Chandigarh chief Subhash Chawla.On Sunday, senior party leader Jagjit Singh Kang said it was due to Chawla’s decisions that Congress fared poorly in the MC elections: “He should resign from the party president’s post on moral grounds.”Justifying the verbal spat between Chawla and Babla on Saturday, he said the latter was right on his part.Another Congress leader Harmohinder Singh Lucky said they did not get any support from the leadership and after ticket allotment, candidates were left on their own.“There was a massive flaw in ticket distribution. The stage was set, the Congress was certain to return to power in the municipal corporation, but denying deserving candidates a chance to contest the polls proved to disastrous for the party,” Manoj Lubana, president of the Chandigarh Youth Congress, had said earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shown-the-door-by-congress-devinder-babla-joins-bjp-with-councillor-wife-101641158071763.html

GMADA chief administrator Vipul Ujwal said, “We were able to sell most of our bigger sites, which shows the real estate market is bouncing back after a slump of almost one year.”Umang Jindal, CEO of Homeland Group, said looking at the trend over the past one year, most of investors were interested in projects on Airport Road.In the auction held in August, GMADA had sold only nine of the 44 properties and earned ₹405 crore. Before that, in April, the sale of 11 of 44 sites on auction helped it earn ₹301 crore. The year’s first auction in February had brought in ₹544 crore, while in the auction held in December last year, out of 78 properties, only 10 were sold for ₹134 crore.

03-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi’s air pollution climbs, back in ‘severe’ zone||The Capital recorded its first ‘severe’ air day of the year on Sunday, worsening to that zone for the first time since December 26, showed data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).On Sunday, Delhi’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was 404, considered to be in the ‘severe’ zone, in a deterioration from 362 (very poor) the previous day.The city’s AQI was last ‘severe’ on December 26, when the Capital’s pollution gauges hit 459.Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that Sunday’s AQI spike was due to accumulated pollutants over the last two days, caused by combination of low temperatures and cracker bursting on New Year’s Eve and January 1.Forecasts by Safar, the air quality monitoring body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, predicted further deterioration in air quality till Tuesday, owing to firecracker emissions and cold wave conditions.“Cold wave and emissions from crackers will continue to impact Delhi’s air till Tuesday, after which there will be a slight improvement. The major cause of this dip in air quality is low temperature,” Safar’s air quality forecast read on Sunday.Met officials said temperatures in Delhi are expected to rise from Monday, which will eventually bring the city some respite from the high pollution levels.There is also a forecast of a fresh western disturbance impacting Delhi and the neighbouring states from January 5, which will also result in light rain and improved wind speed in the region, facilitating dispersion of pollutants.“Wind speeds will start improving from Tuesday and the accumulation of pollutants will clear off slightly. On Monday, the AQI will slip back to the very poor zone,” said a senior IMD scientist.Meanwhile, temperatures in the city are likely to increase in the coming days, IMD said.On Sunday, the minimum temperature at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the base station for Delhi, was 5 degrees Celsius, two below what is considered normal for this time of the year.Meanwhile, the maximum temperature was 20.4°C, a notch above normal.“From Monday, temperatures will start increasing and from January 5 to January 8, minimum temperatures could touch 10°C,” the Met forecast said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-air-pollution-climbs-back-in-severe-zone-101641150202335.html

Swift action by the troops deployed at the Line of Control foiled the bid and eliminated the terrorist, identified as Mohd Shabbir Malik, a Pakistani national,” said Maj Gen Abhijit S Pendharkar, GOC, 28 Division, in a press briefing at Kupwara.“This clearly establishes that Pakistan continues to sponsor cross border terror. A hotline communication has been made to the Pakistan army asking them to take back the body of the killed individual,” he said.According to officials, BAT is said to be a mix of regular Pakistani soldiers and militants who are known for attacks on the Indian army on the border. Pakistan has always denied these allegations.Pendharkar said that the infiltrator was equipped with weapons, ammunition and warlike stores.“The incident site is located on the Pakistani side of the Anti-Infiltration Obstacle System, kept under surveillance by the Indian army to effectively counter any nefarious activity by the infiltrators or Pakistan army,” he said.In February, Indian and Pakistan’s militaries had agreed to strictly observe a ceasefire agreement along the LoC after years of tumultuous relationship on the border between the two armies.Pendharkar said in complete breach of the ceasefire understanding arrived at between the DGMOs, the armed intruder dressed in Pathani suit and a black jacket was detected moving from areas under the control of the Pakistan army across the LoC on Saturday.“Ambushes were laid along likely routes that could be adopted by the intruder and movement was followed. The ambush was sprung at the opportune moment and the infiltrator was eliminated. The body of the slain infiltrator was recovered along with one AK 47 and a large quantity of ammunition, including seven grenades,” he saidThe army said that the surveillance of the area is in progress, denying any “exploitation” of the bad weather condition prevailing in the area.“A search of the belongings revealed Pakistani national’s identity card and vaccination certificates (issued by the ministry of national health services regulation and coordination, Government of Pakistan) identifying him as Mohd Shabir Malik. The belongings also include a photo of the infiltrator in army uniform,” he said.In response to a question, the officer said that the intelligence inputs of these areas are always there from where infiltration may be attempted by some terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/army-infiltrator-killed-in-jammu-and-kashmir-s-kupwara-pakistan-s-bat-bid-foiled-101641155305448.html

03-01-2022||Chandigarh||Private varsity in Solan sold 50,000 fake degrees: SIT||With the investigation into multi-crore fake degree scams on the conclusive stage, sleuths have come across 50,000 bogus degrees sold by Manav Bharti University in Solan. “From the records we have so far concluded that 45,000 fake degrees were sold by the university and its touts spread in various states. The number could be more. About 5,000 more degrees are being scrutinised,” said an official of the Special Investigating Team (SIT). “The numbers could be more. We have come across lots of digital evidence suggesting that more degrees were sold,” he said.The probe revealed that each degree related to technical subjects was sold to students within and outside Himachal Pradesh from ₹1 lakh to ₹3 lakh. The SIT team during the investigation rounded up a Jammu-based agent of the university who struck deals locally for selling the fake degrees. The SIT headed by additional DGP (CID) N Venugopal has four teams looking into the financial part -- land procurement, digital evidence, inter-state linkages as well as identification of fake degrees. The sleuths scanned more than 60 hard disks to acquire information.They found that the manager of Manav Bharti University sold degrees outside the state through “agents” who in return got handsome commissions. In a majority of cases, buyers paid cash for degrees to these agents who provided details of the candidates to the university for making the fake degrees. Sleuths were sent to seven states, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. Visits were also made to Jammu, Delhi, Chandigarh and Kashmir to trace the whereabouts of the agents. The probe found that the university enrolled more than 95,000 students in different courses. The fake degree scam was unearthed in February 2019, a year after the University Grants Commission (UGC) received an anonymous complaint about the alleged sale of more than 5 lakh degrees by two private universities in HP, MBU in Solan and APG in Shimla. The UGC then apprised the state government of the matter and sought appropriate action against the institutes. A case under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered against university officials for cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy on March 3. Manav Bharti University chairman Raj Kumar Rana, registrar of the university KK Singh, two university officials, Anupama Thakur and Munish Goel, were arrested in March 2021.Of the ₹440-crore properties belonging to Rana and his family, those valuing ₹194.74 crore are linked to the proceeds of the crime and have been attached. His wife and daughter are in Australia. Investigating agencies have stepped up efforts to bring them back to India.

In the week ending on December 26, 2,301 people were getting inoculated.In the past week, against the target of 8.4 lakh, the health department has administered the first dose to 9,95,025 (118%) people, which includes migrants, and both doses to 7,61,882 (90%). On Sunday, 9,126 people got jabbed in UT, of which 6,603 got their second dose. UT health secretary Yashpal Garg, said, “Around 10 days ago, only 2,000 to 2,500 people were getting vaccinated in Chandigarh per day. Over 1 lakh people who had taken their first dose had not turned up to take their second jab, even after completion of the recommended vaccine time gap. However, after the UT administration announced the ban on partially vaccinated people from entering any public place in Chandigarh, people have started coming forward.”“The overdue cases are also decreasing and if the daily vaccination average remains the same, UT will soon accomplish its target of fully vaccinating its eligible population”, Garg said, adding that the first dose of vaccine helps in building antibodies, but without a booster dose, the antibodies are insufficient to fight the virus, especially with variants like Omicron spreading fast.“The vaccinated people, especially those who have completed their vaccination cycle, are not getting severe complications even after getting infected with the virus. The hospitalisation and fatality rate have drastically come down as vaccination is helping in controlling severity and transmission of the virus”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-surge-chandigarh-sees-400-increase-in-daily-vaccinations-101641153266849.html

03-01-2022||Lucknow||UP excise department to launch campaign on responsible alcohol consumption||LUCKNOW: Concerned over rising deaths and injuries due to drunken driving, the excise department has decided to launch a campaign to sensitise people on responsible alcohol consumption. The state’s new excise policy that was announced on Saturday provides separate fund for this campaign that would create awareness among people against drunken driving and about responsible alcohol consumption. The period of this drive is yet to be announced. In 2020, Uttar Pradesh (UP), as per the national crime records bureau (NCRB), was among the worst states in terms of deaths and injuries due to drunken driving, with at least three deaths daily. “The situation hasn’t improved much in 2021 too and now, as we enter 2022, there is a need to make people aware about the hazards of drunken driving,” an official said. Additional chief secretary, excise, Sanjay R Bhoosreddy said that the campaign would focus on underage drinking, drunken driving and promote responsible liquor consumption. “A provision of ₹1 crore has been set aside for this,” the official said. The timings of the country liquor, foreign liquor, beer and model shops have been left unchanged in the new policy. It means that the liquor shops would continue to adhere to 10 am to 10 pm time, he added. “Overall, it remains to be seen how far the new excise policy has been received by the liquor sellers but as far as supporting the policy to promote responsible consumption is concerned, we are going to back the government,” said Devesh Jaiswal, an office bearer of the Liquor Sellers Welfare Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-excise-department-to-launch-campaign-on-responsible-alcohol-consumption-101641150444791.html
03-01-2022||Chandigarh||Pink bollworm attack: Punjab agri dept chalks out protocol to protect cotton crop in next season||BATHINDA: After facing a massive cotton crop loss to the pink bollworm infestation in the last kharif season, the Punjab agriculture department has devised a triple-tier field management protocol for crop protection ahead of sowing in the 2022-23 season.According to the action plan prepared in consultation with farm experts from the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) and Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR), the core focus of the state authorities would be on the complete disposal of existing cotton crop residue and timely sowing from April 15.Officials said teams of the agriculture department will start working at village, block and district levels from Monday for the implementation of the new protocol at all cotton ginnery and oil extraction units and the field level.Agriculture director Gurvinder Singh said the crucial pest management exercise in the pre-sowing would be over by March. Singh said real-time monitoring would be done at the state level where the officials would interact directly with the farmers to audit the effectiveness of the sensitisation programmes.“Huge pest population that devastated crop last year is in hibernation in the residue stocks, used as firewood, lying in the villages. It is crucial to eradicating sticks before the deadly pest starts reproduction at the congenial climatic conditions in the next two months. Half of the pest management success depends upon only the timely burying the leftover dried bolls,” he said.The director hopes that the area under cotton would not drop in the next season even as farmers faced financial losses due to the infestation. “Coordinated efforts would be made to achieve success as was done after widespread whitefly infestation in 2015,” he added.In 2021-22 kharif season, 3.25 lakh hectare area was under cotton cultivation and authorities were expecting production of 50 lakh quintals. But owing to the first-ever devastating attack of the bollworm, crop production was severely hit in the major cotton-growing districts of Bathinda and Mansa.Till January 1, Punjab recorded a purchase of 13.64 lakh quintals as the purchase of the non-perishable cash crop may continue till March.SK Verma, head of the Sirsa-based CICR, a central organisation, said the state should ensure that ginning and oil extraction units have pheromone traps in its vicinity to monitor traces of the moth population.“Experience in the last two seasons in Bathinda says the moth larvae reached Punjab with cottonseed consignments brought from south-west states, including Maharashtra and Karnataka. It is important that these factories complete end operations by March-end and sanitise their premise after complete destruction of waste material,” said Verma.The state government has planned to discourage staggered sowing and ensure that farmers complete the sowing of cotton by May 15.“Coordinated efforts would be made to ensure sowing starts from April 15 and is completed within a month. Delayed sowing is more susceptible to bollworm attack. In case of a pest attack, it is easy and effective to use pesticides when the crop growth has a uniform stage,” said the director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pink-bollworm-attack-punjab-agri-dept-chalks-out-protocol-to-protect-cotton-crop-in-next-season-101641150265020.html

Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu were present in the meeting in which the committee discussed the district and block-level campaign strategy, plans for big rallies, slogans, jingles, etc. “The meeting was held in a very cordial atmosphere. All the leaders put their heads together in planning for the campaign. There were no fireworks,” said a party leader who was present in the meeting. The panel has already decided to centre its election campaign on the government’s achievements in the past five years. The meeting was held in the backdrop of growing discord within the state Congress over the chief ministerial face of the party. Though a decision has been taken to go into the polls under “collective leadership”, Sidhu is making a strong push for naming him the CM face before the elections, besides targeting the party’s government on a daily basis. His ways have riled several leaders, including ministers, who are demanding that the state chief be disciplined by the central leadership. Besides Sidhu and Channi, Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary, joint secretary Krishna Allavaru, cabinet ministers Manpreet Singh Badal and Pargat Singh, Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu and former Punjab Youth Congress Amarpreet Singh Lally.

03-01-2022||Chandigarh||Pending Bill: Guv raises queries, puts ball back in govt’s court||Chandigarh: A day after chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi threatened to stage a sit-in against him for not clearing a Bill for regularising the services of 36,000 contractual employees, Punjab governor Banwari Lal Purohit on Sunday put the ball back in the government’s court, asking it to reply to six queries relating to pending court cases, reservation and funding raised on the proposed legislation. Calling the chief minister’s claim as “factually incorrect”, the governor, in a written statement, said the file regarding the regularisation of the services of contractual employees were reverted to the office of Punjab chief minister with six queries, which need to be clarified by the state government. “This file was duty received by the CMO on December 31 and the reply is awaited,” he said. Channi, while addressing a press conference on Saturday on completing 100 days in office, alleged that the governor was holding up the file under pressure from the BJP-led central government. “If the governor does not clear the file, I will sit on dharna with my cabinet colleagues against him,” he warned. Responding to the chief minister’s threat, the governor advised him to give reply to queries raised on the file. “Once the reply comes, the Bill will be re-examined at governor’s secretariat,” he said. The Bill regarding regularisation of the services of contractual employees was passed in the state assembly on November 11. The governor’s office also said the file regarding the Bill was sent to Raj Bhawan on December 1 and the governor was on tour to various districts of the state last month. The governor concluded the tour on December 21 and thereafter, on December 23, the CM came and met him at the Punjab Raj Bhawan. The file was duly studied and reverted with observation/queries to CMO on December 31,” reads the statement. In its queries, the Raj Bhawan has asked the state government about the pending court cases in which “The Punjab Adhoc, Contractual, Daily wages, Temporary, Work charged and Outsourced Employees Welfare Act 2016”, which the current Bill seeks to repeal and replace, was challenged, their current status and the details of interim or final orders of judicial courts in such cases. Referring to the Punjab and Haryana high court order of 2017 directing the state government to examine the legality aspect of the Act in the light of the decisions of the Supreme Court in secretary, state of Karnataka, Vs Uma Devi (2006) case, it has asked the state government to clarify whether the current bill is not in contravention of these decisions. Another query relates to the opinion given by the Advocate General vide his letter number 237 on August 25, 2021, mentioning several aspects of the bill that are in contravention of the 2006 case and that this bill continues to remain vulnerable to legal challenge. The government has been asked to clarify how these specific views of the AG have been addressed in this bill and for what reasons some aspects are not being considered by the state government. The Raj Bhawan has also asked the Punjab government that since the contractual employees have been recruited at various times without following the reservation rules, how it proposes to fulfil the shortfall in the reserved posts that may arise due to such regularisation of contractual employees without being in contravention with the decisions of the apex court in State of Karnataka Vs Uma Devi case. Similarly, the government has also been asked to explain how it proposes to meet the annual burden of ₹827.87 crore arising on account of regularisation of 32,166 employees in government departments and another ₹974 crore on 34,007 such employees in boards and corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pending-bill-guv-raises-queries-puts-ball-back-in-govt-s-court-101641149844925.html

03-01-2022||Delhi||Man killed for resisting robbery at bus stop in Delhi, one held||Two men allegedly stabbed a 38-year-old man to death for resisting their robbery attempt at a bus stop near Badli Mor in northwest Delhi, where he was waiting for a bus on Saturday night, said police. According to police, after stabbing the man, the suspects fled with his mobile phone and a bag. One of the suspects was arrested on Sunday evening, after the northwest district’s special staff team scanned nearly 50 CCTV cameras in 1km radius of the crime spot and identified the suspects, said police. “The arrested suspect has been identified as Babul (22), a resident of Jhuggi number-15 in Shalimar Bagh. Our teams are conducting searches for the other suspect, who is homeless but is involved in some crimes,” said deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani.The DCP said around Saturday midnight, the Shalimar Bagh police station received a call from Babu Jagjivan Ram hospital about an unidentified man who was brought dead by a patrolling van. There was a deep cut at the man’s left thigh and he died of excessive bleeding. “The staff of the patrolling van told the local police that they found the man unconscious and bleeding at Badli Mor bus stand on the Ring Road. Accordingly, a case of murder was registered and investigation was taken up,” said Rangnani.“The members of the special staff team visited the crime scene but did not find any eyewitness. Inspection of the bus stand and the amount of blood found at the spot indicated that the man was stabbed by someone. His mobile phone was also missing. Through local enquiry, the deceased was identified as Gajender Singh, a resident of Mohan Garden in west Delhi. He is survived by his wife, a 10-year-old son and two daughters,” said an officer investigating the case. Police said Singh worked in a printing press at Bawana and took a bus to commute between his home and workplace. His family members and colleague told investigators that every evening, Singh boarded a bus from Badli Mor bus stand after finishing work. They also informed police that apart from his mobile phone, his bag was also missing.As there were no CCTV cameras near the crime spot, investigators started scanning cameras installed on all the adjoining routes leading to the nearby residential areas. In one camera, which was installed some 700 metres away from the crime spot, the police spotted two men running towards a slum in Shalimar Bagh with a bag that looked similar to the one that Singh carried. Through local intelligence, the suspects were identified and one of them, Babul, was arrested on Sunday evening.During interrogation, the investigating officer said, Babul disclosed that he, along with associate (name withheld by police since he is yet to be arrested), was wandering on the Ring Road when they spotted a man waiting alone at the Badli Mor bus stop. The duo went there, pointed a knife at the man and asked him to hand over his bag and mobile phone. “When the man resisted, one of the two stabbed him in the thigh. Thereafter, they robbed him of his bag and phone and fled, leaving the man bleeding at the spot. The crime took place around 10pm but since the area was deserted, no one spotted the injured man. He died of excess bleeding at the crime spot itself. The patrolling van staff spotted him more than an hour after the crime,” said the officer.

As it will be the last board meeting during the present regime ahead of the Uttar Pradesh polls 2022, which are scheduled between February and March this year, the Yeida will take crucial decisions now because the next board meeting will be conducted only after the new government takes charge after the elections.“The board will discuss all the project proposals, and take important decisions related to the development along the Yamuna Expressway,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida.One of the most important project proposals will be to review progress made on the development of the Noida international airport project in Jewar. If required, the board will give requisite approvals on the developmental work such as road construction, pavement, park and other basic facilities, which is to be taken on the periphery of the airport.As the Uttar Pradesh government gave all requisite clearances on the projects on November 21, 2021, Yeida issued a global tender the same day to select a developer who will develop the Film City on 1,000 acres in Sector 21 along the Yamuna Expressway. The move came after the Uttar Pradesh government gave a green signal to draft the bid document, which defines the agreement terms between the developer and the state government. The tender was published globally, so that a competent film production house or film company could be engaged in the development work of the project. At least 20 companies showed interest in the Film City project, and Yeida has taken a pre-bid meeting with these companies to explain the terms and conditions of the bidding process, and how the project will be developed. Subsequently the companies made some suggestions regarding the bid document, and the state government asked Yeida to make some changes in the bid document. Now, Yeida may take the revised bid document to the board for approvals, said the officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/yeida-to-take-major-decisions-on-jewar-airport-projects-near-yamuna-e-way-today-101641149246203.html
03-01-2022||Chandigarh||AAP slams Punjab govt for not arresting Majithia as his photos surface online||Chandigarh: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha on Sunday slammed the Charanjit Singh Channi government in Punjab for not arresting Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia who has been booked under the NDPS Act. Alleging that Majithia is “roaming around openly”, Chadha claimed that pictures of the Akali leader surfaced on social media on Saturday showing him paying obeisance at the Golden Temple. The AAP leader alleged the Channi government did not want to arrest Majithia as there was a “setting” between it and the Badals. Even as the Punjab Police is hunting for Majithia, booked under the Narcotic Drug and Psychotropic Substance (NDPS) Act, his pictures at the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar went viral on social media. Without mentioning when they were clicked, the Youth Akali Dal, the youth wing of the Shiromani Akali Dal, shared the leader’s photos on its official Facebook page on Saturday. The pictures surfaced at a time when the Punjab Police has been conducting raids to arrest Majithia, who is a former state minister. Last month, Majithia was booked under the NDPS Act on the basis of a 2018 report of a probe into a drug racket in the state. He is the brother-in-law of Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal and brother of former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal. Addressing the media here on Sunday, Chadha said nearly two weeks have passed since the registration of FIR against the Akali leader but he has not been arrested yet. It has been happening for the first time in the history of the country that an accused, whose anticipatory bail had been rejected, could not be arrested, he added. “The accused (Majithia) has been “roaming around openly”, alleged Chadha. “Yesterday, some pictures of Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia surfaced on social media, showing him paying obeisance at the Golden Temple,” he said. Despite CCTV cameras installed in and around the Golden Temple and the presence of the task force of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, police could not nab him, Chadha said. “The Channi government will neither arrest nor want to arrest Majithia as there is a setting between the government and the Badals,” he alleged. The AAP leader alleged that Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi had given directions to police not to arrest Majithia. He alleged that the registration of FIR against the Akali leader was an “election stunt.” AAP convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday had targeted the Congress government in Punjab, alleging that it does not have the courage to arrest Majithia. A lookout circular, which prevents a person from leaving the country, had been issued against the former Punjab minister last month. After Majithia’s anticipatory bail plea was rejected by a Mohali court, he had moved the Punjab and Haryana high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-slams-punjab-govt-for-not-arresting-majithia-as-his-photos-surface-online-101641149244807.html
03-01-2022||Lucknow||Over four years after being set up, “Krashak Samridhi Aayog” to hold first meeting today||The “Krashak Samridhi Aayog” will on Monday mull measures to enhance income of farmers in Uttar Pradesh in its first-ever meeting after the expert body was established in the state in November 2017 with a view to doubling peasants’ income by 2022. The “Aayog” (commission) will, among other things, also give suggestions about introduction and promotion of cooperative farming, contract farming, collective farming or corporate farming in the state. As the Election Commission gears up to announce the assembly poll schedule for the state next week, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has called the commission’s meeting at his residence on Monday evening to discuss a seven-point agenda with the aim of increasing income of farmers. “The suggestions to be received at the meeting may be put to the Cabinet in the form of proposals the following day for its nod,” a senior official said.As per the seven-point agenda accessed by the HT, the commission will give recommendations on how to curtail the cultivation cost and increase the production, analyse reasons responsible for reducing farmers’ agricultural income and give suggestions for income augmentation, development of allied sectors such as animal husbandry, fishery, sericulture, agroforestry and establish coordination among these sectors.The commission will also make recommendations on soil improvement and give suggestions about cooperative farming, contract farming, collective farming or corporate farming, suggest long-term and short-term policies for production of various crops apart from giving suggestions on increasing efficiency cost effectiveness of agriculture related works and activities. Set up on November 10, 2017 with the stated objective of making agriculture and related sectors a profitable venture and double income of farmers by 2022, the “Krashak Samridhi Aayog” never had a meeting in the past drawing criticism from some quarters. Last year in February, one of the members, Dharmendra Malik, representing farmers even resigned from the commission saying that he was miffed over the fact that not a single meeting of the commission was convened after it was set up. He also urged the CM to brief the Centre of farmers’ apprehensions about the three farm laws (now repealed).“This is true the ‘Krashak Samridhi Aayog’ is holding its meeting for the first time after its constitution four years ago,” another official said. “Perhaps the need for holding the meeting was not felt because similar other bodies like the state council for agricultural prices already working for the same purpose,” he said. The commission headed by the CM comprises a dozen experts coming from various organisations besides some farmers’ representatives.

The police have arrested the accused and booked them under Section 302 (murder), 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code (IPC). The victims were identified as Manjit Singh and Gurmeet Kaur.Victims’ son Ravinder Singh, who had recently returned from Portugal, told the police that last night when he reached home late in the night, the gate was locked from inside. He entered the house by scaling the wall and saw that his parents’ charred bodies were lying in their room while his wife Mandip Kaur was tied to a chair. Mandip claimed that some unidentified persons had locked her in a room and killed the elderly couple, Ravinder said.He suspected that his wife had killed his parents as they had come to know of her extramarital relationship and often reprimanded her for that.Tanda deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Raj Kumar revealed that after initial investigation, accused Mandip and her accomplice Jasmeet Singh, a resident of Sanghar village in Amritsar, had been arrested.“The duo smothered the couple with a cloth and stabbed them with a knife. Later they set the bodies on fire to eliminate evidence,” the DSP said.He said Jasmeet had also stolen cash and ornaments from the house which have also been recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/exarmyman-wife-killed-by-daughter-in-law-aide-in-hoshiarpur-village-101641149064772.html
03-01-2022||Noida||88 fresh Covid cases in Ghaziabad; district yet to achieve daily testing target||Ghaziabad on Sunday reported 88 fresh coronavirus disease cases amid a rise in the infections in the district, officials of the health department said.According to official records, the district reported 81 fresh Covid cases the previous day.With 280 active Covid cases at present, the total tally in the district has reached 56,017. The active cases include 171 patients in home isolation and five patients in facilities.Meanwhile, facility allocation for 104 patients is still pending. “The Covid cases are on the rise, and we have already put 58 hospitals on standby in anticipation of more cases being reported in the coming days as the patients may require hospitalisation. At present, most of the cases being reported are asymptomatic, and the remaining are showing mild symptoms. We are tracking contacts of the Covid-positive patients... We are also trying to get more VTM vials to increase the testing,” said Dr Sunil Tyagi, additional chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.The daily testing has been at an average of 4,792 for the past 10 days as the district has also been facing a shortage of viral transport media (VTM) vials, which are being used for Covid testing, said officials familiar with the development.An officer from the district health department said that the shortage of VTM vials has also affected Covid testing in the district.“We have procured a lot of vials from neighbouring districts, and there is a shortage of VTM vials at present. Despite this, we are conducting more tests per day than other districts in the region,” said an officer from the health department, requesting anonymity. In the past 10 days -- from December 24, 2021, to January 2 this year -- the district has taken up a total of 47,924 tests, with a daily average of nearly 4,892 tests per day against the daily target of conducting 7,400 tests as directed by the Uttar Pradesh government. There has been a shortage of nearly 26,076 Covid tests being conducted in the district in the past 10 days, against the set target. Health experts said that the district should conduct more tests now on.“The district needs to trace more Covid cases, so that patients could be identified and treated at an early stage. Strict enforcement should be in place... The only plus point is that the latest Covid patients are showing mild symptoms, with the cases having a low severity... It is, however, expected that the Covid cases are likely to rise in the coming weeks,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). Amid the increase in the number of cases in the district, the sample positivity rate in Ghaziabad has shot up from 0.19% on December 24, 2021 to 1.72% on January 2. The overall sample positivity in the district rate now stands at 2.68%.
03-01-2022||Delhi||No monkey business: Delhi Cantonment asks people to refrain from feeding simians||The Delhi Cantonment Board (DCB) issued an order recently stating that people feeding monkeys near human habitation will be fined. The warning added that the incidents of man-monkey conflict are on the rise in various parts of Delhi.“The public is hereby warned not to feed monkeys in human habitation, particularly in residential colonies, and in the vicinity of religious places. Anyone found feeding the monkeys in human habitation will be challaned or fined in accordance with existing municipal laws,” the order issued by officer-in-charge (OIC), sanitation, Delhi Cantonment Board Gyanendra Singh said.Till now, none of the Capital’s other four local bodies have imposed a restriction on feeding monkeys. On Thursday, Singh confirmed to HT that fines up to ₹5,000 can be issued if anyone is found violating the order. “We are empowered to issue fines up to ₹5,000 as per the Cantonment regulations 2006,” he added.The Cantonment comprises an area of approximately 10,521 acres. It also covers residential areas and markets, such as Sadar Bazar, Shastri Bazar, Nangal Raya, Mehram Nagar, and Naraina village, besides ridge areas.Officials from the veterinary departments of the municipal corporations said that they have not issued any such order so far either.However, a senior forest official, part of a meeting held recently between the corporations and the Delhi Cantonment Board, said the forest department asked the corporations to look at penalising people who fed monkeys at spots which could be dangerous or increase their numbers. “There are provisions under the Municipal Corporation Act to prohibit the feeding of strays and monkeys. The officials have been asked to explore deterrents,” the official said, requesting anonymity.Despite relocating more than 21,000 monkeys to Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary over the last decade, Delhi still does not have any official count of monkeys in open areas or sanctuaries. The SDMC official said that the project has only led to an increase in the man-monkey conflict in South Delhi areas, as monkeys from all over Delhi are relocated to Asola Bhatti, which has no natural food source or boundary to prevent the entry of monkeys into residential areas.Ved Pal, councillor from Aya Nagar ward, situated next to the relocation area, said that the whole region has been facing an increasing number of monkey attacks over the last 10 years. “There is no natural food source in the sanctuary so monkeys enter kitchens. There have been complaints from several schools about attacks during lunchtime. Water tankers on several houses have been damaged. There are groups of hundreds of monkeys on roads along Asola,” he added.The region where there is increased conflict includes Aya Nagar, Tughlaqabad extension, Jaunapur, Fatehpur Beri, Asola, Dera Mandi and Bhati.The relocation of captured monkeys to the Bhati mines area started in 2007 after a Delhi high court order. Earlier that year, deputy mayor SS Bajwa died of head injuries after falling from the terrace of his house, following an attack by monkeys.The official relocation data for 2021 presented by municipal commissioners in November showed that the East Delhi Municipal Corporation managed to catch and relocate 45 monkeys to Asola Bhatti while the North MCD relocated 58 monkeys and the SDMC shifted 336 monkeys last year.An SDMC veterinary department official said that around 50-60% simians were caught from areas around the Radha Soami Satsang Beas ashram when a Covid treatment centre was being operated at the site. The civic body offers compensation of ₹2,400 per monkey to monkey catchers for this job.“Despite providing the highest rates in the country, monkey catchers have been reluctant to work in Delhi due to fear of legal cases being filed against them. The pandemic has further worsened the situation. There are only three monkey catchers currently working with us,” the official said, requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, the forest department (under the Delhi government) and the municipal corporation’s veterinary department continue fighting regarding jurisdiction over the matter.“Several communications from the ministry of environment forest and climate change (animal welfare division) clearly state that monkeys are not stray animals, and catching, trapping or controlling the population of monkeys can only be done by the forest department. If we catch monkeys, we will be breaking the law,” a senior official of the veterinary department said.A senior official from the forest department, however, said the Delhi high court order of 2019 makes it clear the responsibility to capture monkeys lies with the corporations, not the forest department. “We have been asked to take care of the animals being shifted to Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, and, each month, we spend over ₹8 lakh on their food. The high court made it clear corporations will be the ones transporting the monkeys there,” he said.During May-June earlier this year, several cut-outs of langoors were placed in the Covid centre at Radha Soami Satsang Beas ashram to scare away the rhesus monkeys. This temporary solution also exposed the administrative failure in tackling Delhi’s simian menace.Ved Pal argued that the money spent on feeding monkeys could have been used to create a zone with natural fruit trees. “The area would be able to naturally sustain the monkey population and the annual expenditure on feeding may be saved,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-monkey-business-delhi-cantonment-asks-people-to-refrain-from-feeding-simians-101641148944921.html
03-01-2022||Delhi||AAP demands north MCD mayor’s resignation over ‘dilapidated’ TB hospital||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday sought the resignation of North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Raja Iqbal Singh over the Rajan Babu TB Hospital, which it claimed is in a dilapidated condition and is putting the lives of patients taking treatment there at risk. Addressing a press briefing, AAP’s leader of opposition in the north municipality Vikas Goel said despite the BJP’s standing committee deeming the hospital building dangerous, it was still treating patients there. “The mayor, Raja Iqbal Singh, issued a statement on Saturday claiming that no one is being treated in the wards. On the other hand, the chairman of his own committee claims that 9-14 wards are operational and that certain patients are admitted and they are attempting to relocate them as soon as possible. The chairman of his standing committee has agreed that this structure is unsafe, and experts from IIT Roorkee have been asked to look into it. Raja Iqbal Singh should resign on moral grounds,” said Goel.Singh said that it’s a political design of AAP. “Only a portion of the hospital is unsafe, but they (AAP leaders) have been repeatedly claiming that the whole hospital campus is unsafe. The fact is that the Opposition wants to deprive common people of common medical facilities,” said the north MCD mayor. On Saturday, Delhi’s urban development minister Satyendar Jain ordered an inquiry into the allegations that the north MCD-run Rajan Babu TB hospital was operating out of a dilapidated building that the civic body itself declared dangerous for use. The North Delhi Municipal Corporation, however, described the order as “politically biased”, and argued that only a “small section” of the building, which is already empty, has been declared unfit. It said that ten other wards of the 700-bed hospital are in a fully usable condition.On Sunday, AAP leader Adil Khan said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has only given two gifts to Delhi in the 15 years of its rule in municipal corporations. “One is waste, and the other is corruption. You must have noticed that AAP senior leader Atishi ji and North MCD leader of opposition Vikas Goel Ji visited Rajan Babu Hospital in the past few days. The BJP-ruled MCD is forcing people of Delhi to die inside that building, while the MCD itself is saying that the building is dilapidated and can collapse at any time. AAP’s Goel has filed a written complaint with the police, and we thank the Delhi government for taking such a serious stance on this issue and ordering an investigation,” he said. In its response, the Delhi BJP demanded health minister Satyendar Jain’s resignation for the death of three children due to wrong medication at AAP’s mohalla clinics. “Before seeking the mayor’s resignation over a hospital building, the AAP leaders should tell when will health minister Satyendra Jain resign for the death of three children due to wrong medication at Delhi government’s mohalla clinics. The AAP has made it a prestige issue to get Rajan Babu Hospital shut and to satisfy its ego, Jain issued an unjustified order for an inquiry on Saturday,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-demands-north-mcd-mayor-s-resignation-over-dilapidated-tb-hospital-101641148648789.html
03-01-2022||Delhi||Fourth runway, T1 upgrades: 2022 a crucial year for Delhi airport||A fourth runway, a revamped and expanded Terminal 1, as well as a significant upgrade in passenger handling capacity – 2022 is likely to be a significant year for the Indira Gandhi International Airport, which has seen its upgrade plans hindered several times over the past two years due to lockdowns and curbs on construction.The revamped T1, which is currently undergoing work to double its capacity from 20 million passengers per annum to 40 million passengers, will integrate the departure and arrival terminals under one roof. While the arrivals hall could be complete in 2022, a new T1 apron is also expected to be ready by the end of the year, said officials.The Delhi airport will also become the first in the country to have four runways. Officials aware of the matter said that while construction work for the fourth runway was complete, it will take several months to install requisite equipment, such as instrument landing system localisers or CAT gear, which is required for aircrafts to land during poor visibility, after which inspections and tests are expected to take up a significant portion of the year. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) will approve the runway once these processes are completed.The fourth runway is expected to be around 4,400 metres long and 75 metres wide. It is slightly smaller than the third runway (known as 29/11).The airport also expects to make significant advances in its aim of becoming a ‘net zero carbon emission’ airport by 2030. A smart apron being built at T1 will not only increase the number of parking stands from 55 to 82, but will also have 22 ‘contact’ stands and eight Multiple Apron Ramp System (MARS) -- which can accommodate much larger aircrafts.So far, 19 new stands have become operational, after statutory approvals from DGCA in early December 2021, said the airport operator.The airport estimates that the new smart apron will cut carbon dioxide emissions by 70kg per flight. Once the 22 contact stands are made operational, officials said they expect a further reduction of 255kg of CO2 emissions per aircraft during the turnaround process for domestic airlines.“The new layout will facilitate improved air traffic flow and enhance airside safety. The creation of new contact stands will also lead to a reduction in the Ground Support Equipment required. This will ensure faster aircraft turnaround time and improve safety in the apron area, resulting in improved operational efficiency on the airside,” said a spokesperson of the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL).An airport official aware of the ongoing work said that while T1 is not expected to be fully complete this year, there is a good chance the new-look arrivals hall will be ready by 2022. However, work on the airport has seen a host of interruptions due to the Covid-19 lockdowns and constructions ban owing to the pollution spikes in Delhi.“Timelines have been impacted to an extent and work was delayed considerably last year. This year, efforts were made to regain lost time, but even this winter, the construction ban and to an extent, the second wave has impacted the expansion work,” said the airport official.“Despite these setbacks, we expect the fourth runway to be operational this year, as well as a new arrivals hall at T1 and a new smart apron for planes,” the official added.While construction work on the dual-elevated cross taxiway (ECT) is also expected to be completed by December 2022, it is only likely to become operational by 2023, DIAL said. The ECT will be built on the same lines as the elevated cross-taxiway at Singapore’s Changi Airport, allowing those reaching the airport a visual of aircrafts taxing above them as they approach Terminal-3.The 2.1km-long dual ECTs, along with the new runway are expected to help decongest the airport and reduce turn-around time for an airline, with passengers also having to wait inside the flight for a shorter duration of time after landing or during take-off.According to DIAL, once the ECT is complete, the distance covered by an aircraft after landing for taxiing will reduce from around nine kilometres to two kilometres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fourth-runway-t1-upgrades-2022-a-crucial-year-for-delhi-airport-101641148406091.html
03-01-2022||Noida||Noida crosses 100-mark of Covid cases reported in a day, 1st time since May 2021||Noida: With 117 fresh coronavirus cases reported in Noida on Sunday, the daily infection caseload in the city crossed the 100-mark for the first time since the last week of May 2021, said officials of the district health department.The active Covid cases in Gautam Budh Nagar now stand at 335, they added.The caseload in Gautam Budh Nagar nearly doubled within a day, as the total infections reached 178 -- 117 cases reported on Sunday and 61 cases on Saturday. Cases reported in the first two days of January 2022 are already two-thirds of the total cases (261) reported in December 2021. The Covid-positive patients include three male travellers -- one each from the United Kingdom (UK), Singapore and Russia. Nearly 15 travellers have been identified in the district, however, no confirmed case of the new coronavirus variant ‘Omicron’ has been reported yet. Two inmates from the Luksar Jail in Noida are also among those who tested positive for the virus on Sunday. One of them is lodged in the jail, and another person was tested before being lodged in the prison. Both the inmates have been admitted at the Noida Covid hospital. According to the health officials, 10 patients are in institutional care and 325 others are in home isolation. Those in hospital include one inmate from the Luksar Jail, another one under trial, three international travellers, one pregnant woman, and four other people were identified during random sampling. “The inmate was taken to the jail on December 26, 2021, and his rapid antigen test had come negative. His RT-PCR test was conducted on December 30 last year, and his report came positive on January 1 this year. He has been admitted to the hospital and his contacts in the jail are being tested. All the patients have mild symptoms and are not on any kind of support,” said Dr Tritya Saxena, medical superintendent of Noida Covid hospital. Dr Sunil Sharma, chief medical officer (CMO), said, “We have increased the Covid testing and tracking in the district, and have prepared a database of the available hospital beds, which can be used in the time of need. As of now, Noida Covid Hospital and Kailash Hospital in Noida are notified for treating coronavirus patients. We will increase the numbers of beds and hospitals according to the requirements. 99% of the patients are asymptomatic.”The Covid patients in institutional care need to be isolated mandatorily according to the government norms, but none of them needed oxygen or any other medication yet, said the officials.The district has increased Covid testing to nearly 4,000 per day as the positivity rate increased to 3%, from a total 65,000 tests (approximately 2,097 per day) in December 2021 when the positivity rate was less than 1%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-crosses-100-mark-of-covid-cases-reported-in-a-day-1st-time-since-may-2021-101641148404745.html
03-01-2022||Delhi||Five years on, Katputli Colony residents in Delhi wait for promised homes||Five yearsafter their homes were demolished for the Capital’s first in-situ redevelopment project at Kathputli colony, close to 2,800 families are still waiting to move into their new houses. The Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) redevelopment project, which was to be completed by March 2019, has missed several deadlines and is slated for completion in 2022.While the families were moved to a transit camp in west Delhi’s Anand Parbhat, a few kilometers away from where the new housing complex is being constructed, they are running out of patience due to the inordinate delay.Patasi (65), a Rajasthani folk artist and local leader of Bhat community (one of the many communities at Kathputli colony), said, “We were to get our flats within two years after demolition of our houses. But it has been over five years and we have no idea when we will be able to finally have a house of our own.”She said that each family has just one room and has to share the toilet at the camp. “Each family has 6-10 members. It is difficult to live in one room. We want to move into our own flats. We had a meeting with DDA officials last month and requested them to complete the work at the earliest,” she said.Dilip Bhat, another resident, said, “No timeline has been given to us about the project. They (DDA officials) keep extending the deadline.”While facilities are being provided at the transit camp, residents say they want to have a house of their own. “How long can one live here? There are around 500-odd families, which have been living here for the past eight years. DDA should give us a clear timeline,” said one of the beneficiaries, who didn’t wish to be named.In 2016, the DDA started large-scale demolition at Kathputli Colony in a bid to implement its first in-situ redevelopment project on public private partnership (PPP) model. Under the project, the private developer is supposed to provide housing to 2,800 families and in exchange will be allowed to develop a commercial complex to recover the cost of construction and make the project financially viable. There are 16 15-storey towers proposed at the location to accommodate 2,800 families.Though the project was conceived in 2008, it couldn’t be implemented due to stiff resistance from locals.In December 2016, the DDA finally started the demolition exercise amid protests from locals and civil society members. It took DDA almost a year to clear the land parcel. The construction work started in April 2018 and the first batch of houses were to be given by March 2019. “We got the permission to clear encroachments from a large piece of land at the site in April last year. Due to this, the work got delayed,” said a senior DDA official aware of the development.The ban on construction activity followed by the Covid pandemic, DDA officials said, led to the inordinate delay. “The construction work was affected due to the ban. We are hopeful of completing a few towers by the end of this year. We will soon have a meeting with the developer and get a new timeline,” said a DDA official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/five-years-on-katputli-colony-residents-in-delhi-wait-for-promised-homes-101641147870605.html
03-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi University entrance tests to FYUP: A year of reform beckons||With the Delhi University (DU) giving its approval to a number of key decisions in 2021, this yearpromises to be a year of change for the university, which for the first time will admit students into the newly structured undergraduate programmes with the help of an entrance exam that the varsity will either conduct itself or will be conducted by the National Testing Agency. Until last year, admission to undergraduate courses at DU was done on the basis of cutoff marks. All applicants who met the cut-off criteria were eligible for admission. However, a case for review of the admission process was felt as sky-rocketing cutoffs, including 100% in the first list, started becoming a regular feature. At least eight DU colleges announced 100% marks as the eligibility criteria for admission to 11 graduation programs last year. The challenges posed by over-admission and under-admission also necessitated the need for a review of the admission mechanism. In October last year, DU constituted a nine-member committee to deliberate on undergraduate admission reforms. Subsequently, the university’s academic and executive council passed a proposal for the introduction of a common entrance test for admissions to undergraduate courses in December. While the modalities of the common entrance exam are still being worked out, DU has made it clear that admissions to different undergraduate courses in the 2022-23 academic session will only take place through the CUCET or Delhi University Common Entrance Test (DUCET). DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh told HT last week that the university will opt for the CUCET, if it’s conducted. In a situation where the CUCET is not conducted, the university will conduct its own entrance test--the DUCET. The admission will be based entirely on the entrance exam while the Class 12 scores will serve as a qualifying factor. DU registrar Vikas Gupta said that the entrance exam is in the interest of students. “In the past few years, we have seen students getting exorbitant marks, which in turn was leading to very high cutoffs. The entrance exam from this year will bring some relief to students. The pressure of high cutoffs will not be there. They can focus on specific subjects for preparation,” said Gupta. He said the university was awaiting details on the schedule of the CUCET. “If the CUCET is conducted, it will be in the interest of students since they can appear for one exam over multiple exams,” said Gupta. Besides the phasing out of the cutoff-based admission format, the university will be implementing the four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP) along with other provisions laid down in the National Education Policy, 2020, including enrolling itself in the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) system and allowing students to opt for Multiple Entry-Exit Scheme (MEES) for increased flexibility in higher education. Under the new structure for undergraduate courses, DU will allow students to opt for a three-year honours programme or a four-year honours in a discipline or a four-year honours in a discipline with research. In addition to the courses that exist in the current honours programme, the new programme shall include a number of additional courses in the first three years of the programme. These courses will focus on social and emotional learning, innovation and entrepreneurship, extracurricular activities, ethics and culture and multidisciplinary research. The Academic Bank of Credits (ABC), proposed under the NEP, allows students to earn credits for different courses and then transfer them to their academic bank. The MEES allows students to transfer and carry forward credit from one university to another. The two schemes allow students to gain credits as per their learning, store them in a digital vault, and use them to switch courses and resume their study at any point if they have to exit the course after the first, second, or third year. Last week, two frameworks for the proposed NEP course structure were also sent to colleges for feedback. Gupta said the university was in the process of finalizing the modalities of the course structure as part of an ongoing process and feedback was also being sought from necessary stakeholders. “Many changes are being introduced keeping in mind the larger interests of students this year,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-university-entrance-tests-to-fyup-a-year-of-reform-beckons-101641147564731.html
03-01-2022||Delhi||How Covid killed the calendar||It is afternoon on New Year’s Day, and Babu Lal, a retailer of calendars in Delhi’s Nai Sarak, home to some of the country’s biggest calendar companies, is waiting for customers. Early January is peak business season, but he says there are few takers for his vast range of wall and desk calendars.“The pandemic has killed calendar sales. Earlier I used to sell 500 calendars a day in December and January; now I am lucky if I sell 50 a day. Many of my old customers for whom buying a calendar was an annual ritual for decades have not shown up in the past two years,” says Lal.He is not the only one—calendar manufacturers and dealers at Nai Sarak say sales of paper calendars, which survived the digital age, have suffered a massive drop in the past two years, what with the pandemic causing unprecedented disruptions in the social, personal and professional lives of people, rendering calendaring not- so- necessary.“My orders are down by 60%, and it has to do with the fact that a lot of people have worked from home with few personal and professional engagements to keep in the past two years, ” says Gulshan Kumar, who runs Sunshine Enterprises, a manufacturer and wholesale dealers of calendars at Nai Sarak.“Besides, businesses that bought calendars worth lakhs of rupees every year from us have suffered heavily and have not wanted to spend on calendars and planners in the past two years, ” adds Kumar, who, this year, has also produced a range of desk calendars with Covid-19 themes, with messages on the need for masking, taking vaccines and washing hands and others. “ These reflect the times we are living in and are selling slightly better than others.”In fact, over the past two decades, Delhi-NCR has emerged as a major hub of calendar manufacturers. Calendar companies, which have printing presses in areas such as Okhla, Naraina, Kundli and Sahibabad, start printing calendars in August for the sale season that starts during Diwali. “In 2020 and 2021, I had to trash thousands of unsold calendars, suffering a huge loss. Unsold calendars have no use and have to be trashed, ” says Prakash Chandra Gilotra, who runs Subhash Calendar Co, one of the biggest calendar manufacturers and dealers in Delhi. The walls of his first-floor shop at Nai Sarak are adorned with new 2022 calendars of various sizes, featuring gods and goddesses. “ Looks like Omicron, the new variant of the coronavirus will kill the sales for the third year running,” says Gilotra.Ranjeet Singh, one of the most celebrated contemporary calendar artists in Delhi, is equally worried. Singh says he used to produce about 40 new artworks for calendars – paintings of gods and goddesses such as Shiva, Ganesha, Vishnu, the Buddha--in a year. “ But I have not received a single commission from calendar manufacturers since the pandemic began two years ago. This has never happened in the 73-year history of our art studio,” says Singh, who runs Rangroop studio with his artist brother. The studio, famous for calendar art across the country, was set up by his father in 1951. “Calendar manufacturers are using old paintings for the few calendars they are printing during the pandemic,” he adds.He feels that the coronavirus has dealt a severe blow to calendar art, an essential art of India’s visual culture and tool of advertising.Indeed, in the 1920s and 1930s, brands such Sunlight Soaps, Woodwards Gripe Water, and British Alizarine Company were among the first to bring out calendars featuring the art of Raja Ravi Varma. Later, Vasudev H Pandya, who was known for his paintings of Krishna, was commissioned by many brands for calendar art.“New art is key to sales of calendars and we commissioned artists to do fresh paintings every year, but during the past two years we have not done commissioned any new art,” says Ankit Jain, who runs Jain Calendar Company at Nai Sarak. “ Last year even the Central government stopped bringing out new year calendars. I just hope the companies do not take a cue and turn to digital calendars in a big way”.In January 2021, the Union ministry of information and broadcasting launched an Android and iOS mobile application for a digital calendar and diary, doing away with its decades-old practice of bringing out GoI (Government of India) paper calendars and diaries. “Every year we printed close to 1.1 million calendars and 90,000 diaries, but we have gone digital this year,” said Prakash Javadekar, then information and broadcasting minister while unveiling GoI digital calendar. “Last year, around ₹7 crore was spent in printing the calendars and diaries. This year the ministry has gone digital and the cost is ₹2 crore,” he added.But compared to over a million paper calendars the government printed, so far, there have been only about 50, 000 downloads of the official Government of India Calendar-Diary’s Android App.Proponents of paper calendars say digital planners and calendars are no match for the good old paper calendars—one of the cheapest and most effective means of advertising for businesses of all sizes and a way for brands to make and maintain their social and commercial connections since the early 20th century.“I used to receive at least five desk calendars but this year, I am yet to receive any, which is a very strange feeling. I still have many calendars from 2019, which makes me feel I am caught in a time warp; these old calendars also keep reminding me that there was a normal, happy pre-corona world, ” says Suhani Gupta, 34, a graphic designer.“I love this analogue way of time management and hope that calendars will soon stage a comeback. It is only a matter of time, ” says Gupta.

Her father works as a bus conductor. “Even PM Sir had reminded me of his promise during a breakfast meeting with all the Indian Olympians in New Delhi in August. It’s like a dream come true when I along with my parents met him. PM Sir asked me about my further plans in sport,” Goswami said.She also hailed the laying of foundation stone of a sports university in Meerut. “It’s going to be a big positive step for sports and sportspersons of the state. The university will help stop migration of UP sportspersons to other states,” she said. Goswami wasn’t alone as it was also a big surprise for young hockey drag flicker Shardanand Tiwari when he found PM Narendra Modi in front of him at Meerut, asking about his journey in the game of hockey. “How do you people manage your day, play, fooding and other things etc” were the common questions the PM asked him and his 17 other teammates.“This could all be made possible only after we won the junior national title after a gap of 30 years and it was a great honour for all of us,” Tiwari said. Tiwari, who scored a match-winning goal against Belgium in the quarterfinal of men’s junior world cup in Bhubaneswar last month, said he had never imagined meeting the PM ever in his life. He said a historical win at the national championship at Kovalpatti in Tamil Nadu last month made it possible.Tiwari, who has a silver medal at the Sultan Johar Cup event at Malaysia in the past, has a gold medal at the Khelo India and a silver medal at the junior national championship. Son of a home guard in the state capital, Tiwari said he could play hockey and attain success in his life because of the full support of the Uttar Pradesh Sports Directorate.“Whatever I am today is because of hockey and I feel proud to have played an important role in UP’s win at the junior nationals after 30 years as I was told that UP could never emerge champion at the nationals after 1990,” he said, adding, the PM spent almost 20 minutes with sportspersons today (Sunday).”Other members of the hockey team who were introduced to the PM included Prateek Nigam, Vikas Gaur, Haaris, Manish Sahani, Amit Kumar Yadav, Aditya Singh, Vishnukant Singh, Aamir Ali, Ankit Singh, Rajan Gupta, Sujeet Kumar, Uttam Singh, Samarth Prajapati, Zaid Khan, Saurabh Anand, Arun Sahani, coach Vikash Pal and manager Rajesh Kumar Sonkar.Besides them, Olympians and Paralympians at Tokyo like Lalit Upadhyay, Shivapal Singh, Priyanka Goswami, Anu Rani, Satish Kumar, Suhas LY, Praveen Kumar, Jyoti, Vivek Chikara, Ajeet Singh, Deependra Singh and Akash too met the PM in Meerut.“It was a great moment for all the leading sportspersons, including Olympian and Paralympians of the state, to meet PM Modi Ji. Everybody is impressed with the way PM discussed their sporting culture and history of the state,” said director, sports, Uttar Pradesh, RP Singh.While talking about the sports university, Singh said it was going to be a big milestone in the history of UP’s sports as now the youth of the state could look for a different way of life in sport. “Certainly, UP’s sports standard will touch new heights in future,” he said. It is learnt that the Yogi government recently honoured all the Olympians and Paralympians who won medals at the Tokyo Games with cash awards.

Figures for Wales and Northern Ireland were not released.“I think we’ve got to recognize that the pressure on our NHS, on our hospitals, is going to be considerable in the course the next couple of weeks, and maybe more,” Johnson said during a visit to a vaccination center in Aylesbury, 85 kilometers (53 miles) northwest of London.Johnson was speaking after The Sunday Times newspaper reported that a group of hospitals in the eastern county of Lincolnshire had declared a “critical incident” due to “extreme and unprecedented” staff shortages.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts that run hospitals around the country, told the BBC: “We’re seeing increasing staff absences, and that’s coming on top of a very significant amount of wider pressure.”And Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation that represents 1.5 million health workers, said much of the health service is in “a state of crisis” that's exacerbated by a high demand for services and staff absences.“Some hospitals are making urgent calls to exhausted staff to give up rest days and leave to enable them to sustain core services. Many more hospitals are having to ban visitors to try to reduce the spread of infection," he said.Johnson’s government removed almost all coronavirus restrictions in July, but last month reversed course and triggered its “Plan B” for England — ordering face coverings be worn in indoor public places, requiring proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter nightclubs and asking people to work from home if they can.Johnson on Monday urged people to adhere to those rules and get a booster vaccination shot, as the government seeks to shore up staffing shortages.“So do all the things that I’ve said, make sure we follow a Plan B, get boosted but also help the NHS with their staffing requirements, and we’re looking at what we can do to move people into those areas that are particularly badly affected," he said.But Johnson appeared to rule out any tightening of measures in coming days.“I think the way forward for the country as a whole is to continue with the path that we’re on. We’ll will keep everything under review," he said.“The mixture of things that we’re doing at the moment is, I think, the right one."Earlier, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC that data from London, which has seen surging infection rates in recent weeks, appear to show a “plateauing” of rates, but he added, "we are seeing leakage into the over-50s in terms of infections, and it’s generally the over-50s who end up with severe infection and hospitalization.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-new-covid-measures-in-uk-even-as-pm-johnson-says-health-services-under-strain-101641232306165.html
03-01-2022||World||Fire reignites at South Africa's Parliament in Cape Town||The fire that has already destroyed South Africa's main Parliament chamber flared up again Monday about 36 hours after it started in the 130-year-old complex of historic buildings, authorities said.Firefighters have been sent back to the Parliament precinct in the center of Cape Town after flames re-appeared on the roof of the main Parliament building in the late afternoon. More than 30 firefighters were battling the fire again, Cape Town Fire and Rescue Service spokesman Jermaine Carelse told the News 24 website.Before the blaze reignited, authorities had said it had been contained and had begun to assess the damage. The fire had started around 6 a.m. on Sunday morning.Still a mystery is the role of a man who has been arrested and is being questioned by police in connection with the fire. The man is due to appear in court on Tuesday and authorities weren't commenting further on his involvement or any possible motives, other than to say he would likely be charged with breaking and entering, theft and arson.The man is also facing charges under South Africa's National Key Points Act, a security law that restricts access to government buildings and other places of national importance.The man, who has not been named, was arrested Sunday at the scene, authorities said. South African media reported he had to be rescued from the fire, while questions have been raised over if there was a deliberate attack on the seat of South Africa's democracy.Parliament was closed for the holidays and no injuries have been reported in the fire.Extensive damage has been done to the stately white and red brick buildings in the Parliament precinct. The fire had already burned down the chamber in the National Assembly building where South African legislators meet to pass laws, Parliament said in a statement.“We are indeed devastated,” Parliament said.“We stand in front of a broken Parliament, a burnt down Parliament,” lawmaker Natasha Mazzone said at the gates of the complex before the fire reignited. “Look at our roof, our beautiful roof, burnt, collapsed.”“The National Assembly chamber is completely destroyed. I’ve seen it for myself. Everything is destroyed. This will take an operation second to none to rebuild," she said.Two other buildings had also been badly damaged in the inferno, Parliament said, including the original Parliament building that had been built in the 1880s and had weathered much of South Africa's tumultuous history, including British colonialism and the apartheid regime.The South African Parliament moved to the New Assembly building, built in the style of the old building, in the 1980s and it had been the seat of the national legislature for the momentous end of apartheid and the country's transition to democracy under the presidency of Nelson Mandela.Firefighters had been working on “hotspots” in the National Assembly building on Monday morning, Carelse said, but it was largely contained at that stage and the fire crews had been scaled back.As the fire was originally brought under control, what was left was blackened, unrecognizable ruins inside some of the rooms.“This is an incredibly sad day if you are a normal human being, to stand in front of this building and realize what we’ve lost,” lawmaker Mazzone said.Patricia de Lille, the Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, said that someone had turned off a valve which prevented a fire sprinkler system from functioning.She said the investigation into the cause of the fire has been taken over by the Hawks, a South African police unit that deals with serious and high-profile crimes. An initial report on the fire from a special fire investigating team would be completed by Friday, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-reignites-at-south-africa-s-parliament-in-cape-town-101641231445397.html

Biden told Putin in a video call the US and allies will inflict “serious costs and consequences” and Putin warned of a “complete rupture” in ties.“President Biden made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine,” the White House said in a readout of Biden’s call with Zelenskyy.Biden underscored the commitment of the United States and its allies and partners to the principle of “nothing about you without you” and “reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.In a Tweet, Zelenskyy praised the “unwavering support” that Ukraine has received from the US.President Biden has called for Russia and Ukraine to resolve their differences through established diplomatic channels and has sought to keep open his channels of communications with Putin while making it clear to him that America and its allies will respond with unprecedented sanctions that will potentially cripple the Russia economy.“We made it clear to President Putin that if he makes any more moves and goes into Ukraine, we will have severe sanctions. We will increase our presence in Europe with our Nato allies and it will be a heavy price to pay for it,” Biden told reporters in a day after the call on New Year’s eve.The United States and its western allies have watched with alarm Russia amass more than 100,000 troops along the border with Ukraine raising fears of an imminent attack. The build-up appears to be a repeat of a similar deployment preceding the 2014 invasion when Russia annexed Crime from Ukraine.The Russia lead is seeking guarantees that Ukraine will not be inducted - or joins - Nato, which will bring alliance troops right up the Russian border.The Ukrainian Parliament adopted legislation in June 2017 reinstating membership in Nato as a strategic foreign and security policy objective. In 2019, a corresponding amendment in its Constitution went into force.And in September 2020, President Zelenskyy approved Ukraine’s new National Security Strategy, which provides for the development of the distinctive partnership with Nato with the aim of membership in the alliance.American and Russian officials will hold talks in Geneva, Switzerland on January 10 - which will not be attended by Biden and Putin - and a meeting between Russia and Nato is scheduled for January 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-allies-will-respond-decisively-to-russian-invasion-joe-biden-to-ukraine-101641231691910.html

And on Saturday there were more than 2,700 US flights cancelled and more than 4,700 worldwide.A winter storm is expected to bring as much as 10 inches (25 centimeters) of snow for the District of Columbia, northern Virginia and central Maryland through Monday afternoon.The cancellations, coupled with more than 5,000 flight delays on Monday, just add to the despair felt over the weekend by holidays travelers trying to get home.“It was absolute mayhem,” said Natasha Enos, who spent a sleepless Saturday night and Sunday morning at Denver International Airport during what was supposed to be a short layover on a cross-country trip from Washington to San Francisco.Saturday’s single-day US toll of grounded flights was the highest since just before Christmas, when airlines began blaming staffing shortages on increasing Covid-19 infections among crews.A winter storm that hit the Midwest on Saturday made Chicago the worst place in the country for travelers throughout the weekend. About a quarter of all flights at O’Hare Airport were canceled Sunday.Denver’s airport also faced significant disruptions. Enos, who was flying on Frontier Airlines, didn’t learn that her connecting flight home to California was canceled until she had already landed in Denver. Then it was a rush to find alternative flights and navigate through baggage claims packed with stranded and confused travelers, amid concerns about the spread of the highly transmissible omicron variant of Covid-19.“It was a lot of people in a very small space and not everybody was masking,” said the 28-year-old financial analyst. “There were a lot of exhausted kids and some families were so stressed out.”In Michigan, the authority that runs Detroit International Airport said crews were working around the clock to remove snow and maintain the airfield. Atlanta’s airport authority advised travelers to arrive earlier than usual because of high passenger volume, potential weather issues and pandemic-fueled staffing shortages that could lengthen the time it takes to get through security gates.And thousands of miles from the closest snow storms, Hawaiian Airlines said it had to cancel several flights between islands and across the Pacific due to staffing shortages.Southwest Airlines said it was working to help customers affected by about 400 flights canceled around the country Sunday, about 11% of its schedule. The Dallas-based airline anticipates even more operational challenges to come as the storm system pushes into the Eastern seaboard.Delta Air Lines said Sunday it was issuing a travel waiver for planned flights this week out of mid-Atlantic airports in Baltimore and Washington in preparation for forecasted winter weather.American Airlines said most of Sunday’s canceled flights had been canceled ahead of time to avoid last-minute disruptions at the airport.SkyWest, a regional carrier that operates flights under the names American Eagle, Delta Connection and United Express, grounded more than 500 flights Sunday, about 20% of its schedule, according to FlightAware.Airlines have said they are taking steps to reduce cancellations caused by workers affected by the pandemic. United is offering to pay pilots triple or more of their usual wages for picking up open flights through most of January. Spirit Airlines reached a deal with the Association of Flight Attendants for double pay for cabin crews through Tuesday, a union spokesperson said.Airlines hope that extra pay and reduced schedules get them through the holiday crush and into the heart of January, when travel demand usually drops off. The seasonal decline could be sharper than normal this year because most business travelers are still grounded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-winter-storm-delay-thousands-of-flights-on-first-working-day-of-2022-101641220189566.html

They would continue bilateral and multilateral approaches to nuclear arms control, it said.The statement comes amid increased geopolitical tensions between Moscow and Western nations over concerns about Russia's military build-up near neighbouring Ukraine. Moscow says it can move its army around its own territory as it deems necessary.Last Thursday US President Joe Biden told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that a possible move on Ukraine will draw sanctions and an increased US presence in Europe, where tensions are high after Russia's military buildup at the border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-russia-britain-us-and-france-say-no-one-can-win-nuclear-war-101641220100664.html

03-01-2022||World||Sudan's PM announces resignation amid political deadlock||Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok announced his resignation Sunday amid a political deadlock and widespread pro-democracy protests following a military coup that derailed the country's fragile transition to democratic rule.Hamdok, a former UN official seen as the civilian face of Sudan's transitional government, had been reinstated as prime minister in November as part of an agreement with the military following the October coup. In that time he had failed to name a Cabinet and his resignation throws Sudan into political uncertainty amid uphill security and economic challenges.In a televised national address Sunday, Hamdok called for a dialogue to agree on a “national charter” and to “draw a roadmap” to complete the transition to democracy in accordance with the 2019 constitutional document governing the transitional period.“I decided to return the responsibility and declare my resignation as prime minister," he said, adding that his stepping down would allow a chance for another person to lead the nation and complete its transition to a “civilian, democratic country.” He did not name a successor.The prime minister said his efforts to bridge the widening gap and settle disputes among the political forces have failed.He warned that the ongoing political stalemate since the military takeover could become a full-blown crisis and damage the country's already battered economy.“I tried as much as I possibly could to prevent our country from sliding into a disaster. Now, our nation is going through a dangerous turning point that could threaten its survival unless it is urgently rectified,” he said.The October coup had upended Sudan's plans to move to democracy after a popular uprising forced the military's overthrow of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir and his Islamist government in April 2019.Four months after al-Bashir's ouster, the generals and the protesters reached a power-sharing deal to rule the country through elections in 2023. However, military-civilian ties have been frayed by the military takeover that has threatened to return Sudan to international isolation.Hamdok's resignation comes amid a heavy security crackdown on protesters denouncing not only the takeover but the subsequent deal that reinstated him and sidelined the pro-democracy movement. He was returned to office in November amid international pressure in a deal that calls for an independent technocratic Cabinet under military oversight led by him.“I have had the honour of serving my country people for more than two years. And during his period I have sometimes done well, and I have sometimes failed,” Hamdok said.The Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change, an umbrella group of Sudanese political parties and pro-democracy organizations, has rejected the November deal and sa remains committed to ending military rule. The alliance accused Hamdok of allowing the military to dominate the government and continued to organize anti-coup street protests which were met with a heavy crackdown.Over the past two weeks, there was increasing speculation that he would step down. National and international efforts have failed to convince him to stay in office.The US State Department urged on Twitter Sudan's leaders to “set aside differences, find consensus, and ensure continued civilian rule” following Hamdok's resignation.It also called for the appointment of the next premier and Cabinet to “be in line with the (2019) constitutional declaration to meet the people's goals of freedom, peace, and justice.”Hours before Hamdok's resignation speech, Sudanese security forces violently dispersed pro-democracy protesters, killing at least three people, according to the Sudan Doctors Committee, which is part of the pro-democracy movement. The group said dozens of protesters were injured.The protests came despite tightened security and blocked bridges and roads in Khartoum and Omdurman. Internet connections were also disrupted ahead of the protests, according to advocacy group NetBlocs. Authorities have used such tactics repeatedly since the October 25 coup.Sunday's fatalities have brought the death toll among protesters since the coup to at least 57, according to the medical group. Hundreds have also been wounded.Allegations surfaced last month of sexual violence, including rape and gang rape by security forces against female protesters, according to the United Nations.The ruling sovereign council has vowed to investigate violence against the protesters.On Saturday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged security forces to “immediately cease the use of deadly force against protesters" and to hold those responsible for the violence accountable.“We do not want to return to the past, and are prepared to respond to those who seek to block the aspirations of the Sudanese people for a civilian-led, democratic government,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudans-pm-announces-resignation-amid-political-deadlock-101641202047883.html

They said the news site will stop publishing on Tuesday.“We all love this place, deeply. Regrettably, what was ahead of us is not just pouring rains or blowing winds, but hurricanes and tsunamis,” Citizen News said in a statement on Sunday, when it originally announced the closure.Citizen News is the third news outlet to close in recent months, following pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily and online site Stand News.The outlet was founded in 2017 by a group of veteran journalists. While small, it focused on political news and analysis pieces, as well as investigations.The space for doing those types of stories has shrunk since China's central legislature imposed a sweeping National Security Law in Hong Kong in 2019 following massive anti-government protests. As authorities stepped up arrests of political activists, civil rights groups and unions disbanded, and some activists fled.Independent media have been one of the more prominent casualties of the ongoing crackdown.“What we understood about press freedom has changed a lot,” said Chris Yeung, founder and chief writer at Citizen News. “What's the line between, say, freedom and what the government has always emphasized responsibilities or obligations like upholding national security, public order, etc.”Yeung said at a news conference on Monday that the trigger for their decision to shut down was what happened to Stand News. Last week, authorities raided Stand News and arrested seven people — including editors and former board members — for allegedly conspiring to publish seditious material. Stand News announced on the same day that it would cease to operate.Two of Stand News' former editors who were arrested were later formally charged with sedition.In the summer, authorities forced the closure of Apple Daily, the newspaper owned by media tycoon and democracy activist Jimmy Lai. Lai is currently in jail and was newly charged with sedition last week.The U.S. and other Western governments have condemned the limits on media and civil freedoms that Beijing promised to uphold for 50 years following Hong Kong's 1997 handover from Britain.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam last week defended the raid on Stand News, telling reporters that “inciting other people ... could not be condoned under the guise of news reporting.”The only remaining pro-democracy news media in the city are Hong Kong Free Press, an English-language news outlet, and Initium, a Chinese-language news outlet which moved its headquarters to Singapore in August, but still has staff in the city.Citizen News likened itself to a small dinghy in rough waters.“At the center of a brewing storm, we found (ourselves) in a critical situation. In the face of a crisis, we must ensure the safety and well-being of everyone who are on board," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-news-site-shuts-as-pro-beijing-lawmakers-sworn-in-101641200823067.html
03-01-2022||World||South African police charge man with arson over destructive blaze at parliament||South African police said on Monday they had charged a man with arson over a fire that caused extensive damage to the national parliament building in Cape Town, as firefighters struggled to extinguish the last remains of the blaze.The fire broke out early on Sunday at the parliamentary complex, some of which dates back to 1884 and includes the National Assembly, or lower House of Parliament.It caused the collapse of the roof of a part of the complex housing the upper chamber, or National Council of Provinces (NCOP), on Sunday and gutted an entire floor, though there were no reports of anybody being hurt in the incident.A 49-year-old suspect arrested in connection with the blaze is expected to appear in court on Tuesday and will face charges of housebreaking and theft as well as arson, an elite police unit known as the Hawks said in a statement."It is alleged that he gained entrance through the window in one of the offices," Hawks spokesperson Nomthandazo Mbambo told eNCA television, adding that investigations were continuing into how the suspect had managed to evade security at the parliament."There is a possibility of other charges being added as there was a security breach here," Mbambo said.Jean-Pierre Smith, a Cape Town mayoral committee member responsible for safety and security, said firefighters were still dealing on Monday with "hotspots on the 4th floor of the National Assembly which is still smouldering"."Lots of books and bookshelves (are) smouldering," he said, adding that the interior of the National Assembly had been extensively destroyed by fire, water, heat and smoke.The National Assembly is situated in what is known as the New Wing, which suffered the worst damage in the blaze. The fire was more quickly contained on Sunday in the Old Wing, parliamentary authorities said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-african-police-charge-man-with-arson-over-destructive-blaze-at-parliament-101641201134954.html
03-01-2022||World||Taiwan deploys first advanced F-16V fighter squadron||Taiwan held a ceremony on Thursday to commission the first squadron of its most advanced F-16 fighter, a US-made jet that will strengthen the island's defences against threats by China.President Tsai Ing-wen oversaw the ceremony at an air base in the southern city of Chiayi alongside Sandra Oudkirk, Washington's de facto ambassador to Taiwan."This represents the steadfast promise of the Taiwan-US partnership," Tsai said."I trust that in holding fast to democratic values, there will definitely be more countries with similar values who will stand with us on this front."The F-16V is an upgraded and much more sophisticated version of Taiwan's other ageing F-16 fighters which date back to the 1990s. The island also has French-made Mirage jets and its own indigenous warplane.A fourth-generation multi-role fighter, the F-16V boasts more advanced radar systems as well as more sophisticated weaponry, navigation and electronic warfare systems.It is however less advanced than fifth-generation fighters like China's J-20, Russia's Su-57 as well as the US-made F-22 and F-35 warplanes.Taiwan is in the middle of upgrading 141 older F-16s to make them the V version and has also ordered 66 new F-16Vs.The deployment of the first squadron comes at a time of soaring tensions between Beijing and Washington over Taiwan's fate.The self-ruled democracy of 23 million is claimed by Beijing which has vowed to one day take the island, by force if needs.The ceremony prompted a fiery response from Beijing at a press briefing, with an official saying "China opposes any official contact between the US and Taiwan".Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian urged the United States not to send "wrong signals to separatist forces", adding that those supporting Taiwan's independence "have spared no effort to split the motherland and collude with foreign forces"."Their actions are akin to throwing an egg against a rock," he said.Chinese sabre-rattling has reached new heights under President Xi Jinping with Beijing sending record numbers of warplanes routinely crossing into Taiwan's air defence zone and state media regularly publicising invasion drills.In the last decade, China has built up its military to the point where Taiwanese and US military officials have publicly voiced fears it could soon pull off an invasion.Washington diplomatically recognises Beijing over Taiwan.But it opposes any attempt to change Taiwan's status by force and is bound by an act of Congress to help the island maintain its own defences.The F-16V deal was approved by the administration of Donald Trump as he feuded with China on a host of issues but his successor Joe Biden has maintained similar support for Taipei.Maintaining Taiwan's defences has become a rare bipartisan issue in Washington.China has lambasted military sales to Taiwan and imposed sanctions on US arms giants such as Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin in response.jta-bys/axnBOEINGLOCKHEED MARTINRAYTHEON||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-deploys-first-advanced-f-16v-fighter-squadron-101637241886532.html
03-01-2022||World||Jerusalem Post hacked on Iran general Qassem Soleimani's killing anniversary||Hackers targeted the website of an Israeli newspaper on Monday, the anniversary of the 2020 killing of a top Iranian general, replacing its content with an image threatening a site associated with Israel's undeclared nuclear weapons program.No group immediately claimed responsibility for the hacking. The image posted on the Jerusalem Post's website depicts a missile coming down from a fist bearing a ring long associated with Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian general killed by a U.S. drone strike in Iraq two years ago.Also Monday, a Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen accused the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels there of seizing an Emirati-flagged vessel off the port of Hodeida in the Red Sea. The rebels did not immediately acknowledge the incident.Also Monday, a group overseen by the British military said it had reports of a possible attack on a ship off the coast of Yemen in the Red Sea, a crucial route for international trade. Yemen remains mired in a yearslong war pitting Iranian-backed rebels against a Saudi-led coalition.The image posted in the hack depicts an exploding target from a recent Iranian military drill designed to look like the Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center near the city of Dimona. The facility is already home to decades-old underground laboratories that reprocess the reactor’s spent rods to obtain weapons-grade plutonium for Israel’s nuclear bomb program.Under its policy of nuclear ambiguity, Israel neither confirms nor denies having atomic weapons.In a tweet, the Jerusalem Post acknowledged being the target of hackers.“We are aware of the apparent hacking of our website, alongside a direct threat to Israel,” the English-language newspaper wrote. “We are working to resolve the issue & thank readers for your patience and understanding.”The newspaper later restored its website. It noted Iran-supporting hackers previously targeted its homepage in 2020 “with an illustration of Tel Aviv burning as then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu swam" with a life preserver.There was no immediate response from the Israeli government. The hack comes after Israel’s former military intelligence chief in late December publicly acknowledged his country was involved in Soleimani's killing.Iran also did not immediately acknowledge the hack. However, the country has in recent days stepped up its commemorations of the slain Revolutionary Guard general. Memorial services were scheduled to be held Monday marking his death.Meanwhile, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations said it had received reports of an attack on a ship, giving its location as off the coast of Yemen, near the contested port city of Hodeida. The British military did not elaborate.The coordinates it offered corresponded to the Emirati-flagged landing craft Rwabee, which hadn't given its location via satellite-tracking data for hours, according to the website MarineTraffic.com.A statement from the Saudi-led coalition, carried by state media in the kingdom, later acknowledged the attack, saying the Houthis had committed an act of “armed piracy” involving the vessel. The coalition asserted the ship carried medical equipment from a dismantled Saudi field hospital in the distant island of Socotra, without offering evidence.“The Houthi militia must immediately release the ship, otherwise the coalition forces shall take all necessary measures and procedures to deal with this violation, including the use of force,” Brig. Gen. Turki al-Malki said in a statement.A similar incident happened in 2016 involving the Emirati vessel SWIFT-1, which had been sailing back and forth in the Red Sea between an Emirati troop base in Eritrea and Yemen. The vessel came under attack by Houthi forces in 2016. The Emirati government asserted the SWIFT-1 had carried humanitarian aid; U.N. experts later said of the claim that they were “unconvinced of its veracity.”An employee at the vessel's owners, Abu Dhabi-based Liwa Marine Services, told The Associated Press that the Rwabee appeared to have been the target but said they had no other information and declined to comment further. The employee did not give her name and hung up.As the head of the Quds, or Jerusalem, Force of the Revolutionary Guard, Soleimani led all of its expeditionary forces and frequently shuttled between Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. Quds Force members have deployed into Syria’s long war to support President Bashar Assad, as well as into Iraq in the wake of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, a longtime foe of Tehran.Soleimani rose to prominence by advising forces fighting the Islamic State group in Iraq and in Syria on behalf of the embattled Assad.U.S. officials say the Guard under Soleimani taught Iraqi militants how to manufacture and use especially deadly roadside bombs against U.S. troops after the invasion of Iraq. Iran has denied that. Many Iranians to this day see Soleimani as a hero who fought Iran’s enemies abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jerusalem-post-hacked-on-iran-general-qassem-soleimani-s-killing-anniversary-101641199354653.html

Children over the age of 12 are being offered vaccinations at their schools.The first case of the Omicron variant was reported on Dec. 13 in Karachi and a total of 75 cases were confirmed up to Dec. 27, according to National Institute of Health (NIH).Twelve of the cases were linked to international travel, it said.The provincial government of Sindh, of which Karachi is capital, is working on a strategy to contain the variant, which has included a partial lockdown of a Karachi neighbourhood last week after about a dozen Omicron cases were detected in a family.

03-01-2022||World||Sudan PM resigns as deadly crackdown on protesters goes on: Report||Sudan's civilian Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok resigned Sunday, more than two months after a coup and following another deadly crackdown on protesters, with the military now firmly in control.Sudan had been undergoing a fragile journey toward civilian rule since the 2019 ouster of autocrat Omar al-Bashir, but was plunged into turmoil when military leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan launched his coup on October 25 and detained Hamdok.Hamdok was reinstated on November 21 under a deal promising elections for mid-2023, but local media had recently reported he had been absent from his office for days, with rumours swirling over his possible resignation."I have tried my best to stop the country from sliding towards disaster," Hamdok said Sunday evening, addressing the nation on state television.Sudan "is crossing a dangerous turning point that threatens its whole survival," he said.Hamdok was the civilian face of the country's fragile transition, while Burhan has been the country's de facto leader following Bashir's ouster.Hamdok cited "the fragmentation of the political forces and conflicts between the (military and civilian) components of the transition" and said that "despite everything that has been done to reach a consensus... it has not happened".Mass protests against the coup have continued even after Hamdok was reinstated, as demonstrators have distrusted veteran general Burhan and his promise to guide the country toward full democracy.Protesters have also charged that the deal to reinstate Hamdok simply aimed to give a cloak of legitimacy to the generals, whom they accuse of trying to continue the regime built by Bashir.- 'No to military rule' -Thousands of demonstrators on Sunday braved tear gas, a heavy troop deployment and a telecommunications blackout to demand a civilian government.They lambasted the coup, shouting "power to the people" and demanding the military return to the barracks, at protests near the presidential palace in the capital Khartoum and in its twin city Omdurman.The pro-democracy Doctors' Committee said security forces killed three protesters, including one who was shot in the chest and another who suffered a "severe head wound".As with previous demonstrations, which have become regular since the coup, the authorities had erected roadblocks, with shipping containers blocking Nile River bridges between the capital and outlying areas.But thousands still came out to demonstrate "in memory of the martyrs", with at least 57 protesters now killed since the coup, according to pro-democracy medics.Young men on motorcycles were seen ferrying wounded protesters to hospitals as security forces blocked ambulances from reaching them.Web monitoring group NetBlocks said mobile internet services were cut from mid-morning ahead of the protests, the first of the year. They were restored in the evening.Activists use the internet for organising demonstrations and broadcasting live footage of the rallies.Protests since the army's takeover have been repeatedly broken up by security forces firing rounds of tear gas, as well as charges by police wielding batons.- 'Year of resistance' -Sudan has a long history of military takeovers, but Burhan has insisted the armed forces' move "was not a coup" but a push to "rectify the course of the transition".On Friday an official advisor warned that the demonstrations are "a waste of energy and time" which will not produce "any political solution".Activists have said on social media that 2022 will be "the year of the continuation of the resistance".They demand justice for those killed since the coup as well as the more than 250 who died during the months of mass protests that paved the way for the toppling of Bashir.Activists have also condemned sexual attacks during December 19 protests, in which the UN said at least 13 women and girls were victims of rape or gang-rape.The European Union and the United States issued a joint statement condemning the use of sexual violence "as a weapon to drive women away from demonstrations and silence their voices".On Saturday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that Washington was "prepared to respond to those who seek to block the aspirations of the Sudanese people for a civilian-led, democratic government and who would stand in the way of accountability, justice, and peace".Over 14 million people, one in three Sudanese, will need humanitarian aid during the coming year, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs -- the highest level for a decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudan-pm-resigns-as-deadly-crackdown-on-protesters-goes-on-report-101641196285990.html
03-01-2022||World||Australian PM Morrison says ‘well equipped’ to tackle Covid amid surge in cases||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday said his country's health system can cope with the new wave of coronavirus infections as Victoria state reported a record number of new cases and hospitalizations surged in New South Wales.Morrison spoke in two television interviews before Monday's figures were released.Victoria reported 8,577 new cases, a record for the state which eclipsed the previous peak of 7,442 on New Year's Day.New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, saw a slight decline in case of numbers from a record 22,577 on Saturday to 20,794 on Monday. But the number of people in hospitals rose to 1,204 from 1,066 the day before. There were 95 people in intensive care, a rise of 12 on the previous day.Speaking with the Seven Network, Prime Minister Morrison said Australia's health system is well equipped to deal with the surge in case numbers caused by the spread of the omicron variant.“It's important that with the rising case numbers, we see that the severeness of this illness is already being shown to be around 75 per cent less than what we saw with delta,” Morrison said. “Rising case numbers is part of the omicron period, it's part of the new phase of the pandemic we're in.”“That doesn't mean to say it can't put pressure on the hospital system. It can and that's why we're working very closely with the (state) premiers and chief ministers to make sure those resources are there," Morrison added.Morrison said the federal government would take steps to ensure hospitals had the resources they need to cope with rising admissions. His government last week changed the definition of “close contact” to ensure health workers who might have been exposed to an active case do not have to isolate and can return to work.“We're looking to make further changes on that this week to get more staff back into our hospitals and deal with the need,” Morrison told 9 News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-morrison-says-well-equipped-to-tackle-covid-amid-surge-in-cases-101641186642291.html

I requested the test today after exhibiting symptoms while at home on leave," Austin said, adding that his "symptoms are mild" and he is following his physician's directions."In keeping with those directions, and in accordance with CDC guidelines, I will quarantine myself at home for the next five days," he added.The Pentagon chief said that he is going to attend upcoming key meetings virtually."Stemming the spread of this virus, safeguarding our workforce and ensuring my own speedy and safe recovery remain my priorities. To the degree possible, I plan to attend virtually this coming week those key meetings and discussions required to inform my situational awareness and decision making. I will retain all authorities. Deputy Secretary Hicks will represent me as appropriate in other matters," the statement read.He specified that the last time he met with US President Joe Biden was on December 21 and the last time he visited the Pentagon was on Thursday."My last meeting with President Biden occurred on Tuesday, December 21st, more than a week before I began to experience symptoms. I tested negative that very morning. I have not been in the Pentagon since Thursday, where I met briefly - and only - with a few members of my staff. We were properly masked and socially distanced throughout," Austin said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-defense-secretary-lloyd-austin-tests-positive-for-covid-19-symptoms-mild-101641185048509.html
03-01-2022||World||South Korea's president Moon Jae-in promises final push for North Korea peace||South Korean president Moon Jae-in vowed on Monday to use his last months in office to press for a diplomatic breakthrough with North Korea, despite public silence from Pyongyang over his attempts for a declaration of peace between the two sides.“The government will pursue normalisation of inter-Korean relations and an irreversible path to peace until the end,” Moon said in his final New Year's address before his five-year term ends in May. “I hope efforts for dialogue will continue in the next administration too.”In his own address on New Year's Eve, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made no mention of Moon's calls for a declaration officially ending the 1950-1953 Korean War, or of stalled denuclearisation talks with the United States.Moon held multiple summits with Kim, including once in Pyongyang, during a flurry of negotiations in 2018 and 2019, before talks stalled amid disagreements over international demands that the North surrender its arsenal of nuclear weapons, and Pyongyang's call for Washington and Seoul to ease sanctions and drop other “hostile policies.”Moon is pushing an “end of war declaration” as a way to jumpstart those stalled negotiations and his administration has hinted at backchannel discussions.But North Korea has not publicly responded to the latest push, and the United States has said it supports the idea but may disagree with the South over its timing.“It is true that there is still a long way to go,” Moon acknowledged but argued that if inter-Korean relations improve, the international community will follow.Moon said his outreach to North Korea had been enabled by a large military buildup that helped make South Korea safer.“Peace is possible on strong security,” he said.The Covid-19 pandemic overshadowed the standoff with North Korea, as Pyongyang put the country into an unprecedented lockdown and Moon faced domestic pressure to tamp down the first major coronavirus outbreak outside of China in early 2020.Since then, South Korea used aggressive tracking and tracing, as well as social distancing rules and a belated but thorough vaccination campaign to keep overall cases and deaths relatively low by global standards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-president-moon-jae-in-promises-final-push-for-north-korea-peace-101641184883215.html

He gave the message in his New Year address, as the world entered in its third year of the pandemic.Latest updates: Curbs return, cases surge as world copes with Omicron in 2022"While no country is out of the woods from the pandemic, we have many new tools to prevent and treat COVID-19. The longer inequity continues, the higher the risks of this virus evolving in ways we can't prevent or predict. If we end inequity, we end the pandemic," he said.Highlighting that Covid-19 is not the only health threat the world's people will face next year, Tedros said that millions of people have missed out on routine vaccination, services for family planning, treatment for communicable and non-communicable diseases.He further stated that to help prepare the world for future epidemics and pandemics, “we established the new WHO BioHub System for countries to share novel biological materials”.All the countries must focus on vaccinating more and more of their populations, added the WHO chief. "We need all countries to work together to reach the global target of vaccinating 70 per cent of people in all countries by the middle of 2022," said Tedros.A new variant of coronavirus, named Omicron, recently emerged in South Africa and has been causing a surge in Covid-19 infection across the world. It has already been classified as a ‘variant of concern’ by the WHO.A few days ago, Tedros had said at a media briefing that "2022 must be the year we end the pandemic".The remarks were made after the WHO gave emergency use authorisation to ninth vaccine produced by Serum Institute of India (SII) under license from Novavax. The WHO chief said that the new vaccine is part of the COVAX portfolio, and hoped that it will play an important role in achieving global vaccination targets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-will-end-in-2022-if-who-chief-lists-one-condition-101641180781852.html
03-01-2022||World||‘A hero’: Hockey fan spots cancerous mole during NHL game, saves staffer's life||In an intriguing development from North America, a hockey fan ended up saving the life of a team staffer after happening to spot a cancerous mole on the latter's neck. Describing the fan as “a hero”, Brian Hamilton – the assistant equipment manager for the Vancouver Canucks ice hockey team – expressed his gratitude and noted how one message had changed his entire life and saved him from near-certain death a few years down the line.Vancouver Canucks, a professional ice hockey team based in Canada, was competing in a National Hockey League (NHL) game against the Seattle Kraken on October 23 when Nadia Popovici, a fan sitting close to a team bench, spotted a small mole on the back of Hamilton's neck.The mole, measuring “about two centimeters and was irregularly shaped and red-brown in color”, would probably have gone unnoticed had it been anyone else, but on that day it did come across Popovici, a future medical student volunteering at hospitals as a nursing assistant and trained to spot such potentially cancerous moles.The 22-year-old Popovici told her parents “I need to tell him” and, in a brief second, typed a message on her phone – "The mole on the back of your neck is possibly cancerous. Please go see a doctor!”She patiently waited for the game to end, waved several times to draw Hamilton's attention, and finally placed her phone against the plexiglass for the Nucks staffer to read her text, which had the words “mole,” “cancer” and “doctor” colored in bright red.“Well, that's weird,” Hamilton remembered saying to himself after he saw the message, according to recollections later narrated to The New York Times. However, he didn't entirely dismiss the text, later going home and consulting his partner if the mole was indeed there.It only took a subsequent biopsy result to confirm that the fan sitting behind the team’s bench had been right and that she indeed just saved his life.In a press conference this Saturday, Hamilton broke down in gratitude for the young fan. “She took me out of a slow fire,” he said. “And the words out of the doctor’s mouth were if I ignored that for four to five years, I wouldn’t be here.”The mole, according to Hamilton's physicians, was a type-2 malignant melanoma, a form of skin cancer that can be removed and treated safely once detected early, but also has the potential to turn fatal if left unchecked.Hamilton later sought out his “hero”, the 22-year-old Popovici, and met her in person. The young fan, too, acknowledged the rare happenstance and said that she will “just cherish” the entire experience.In the meanwhile, both Vancouver Canucks and the Seattle Kraken have decided to present Popovici with a combined scholarship of $10,000 for her medical school expenses in acceptance of the miraculous, lifesaving diagnosis during the match.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-hero-hockey-fan-spots-cancerous-mole-during-nhl-game-saves-staffer-s-life-101641177495723.html

He said that despite rolling out more than 4.2 million coronavirus booster shots to the country’s population of 9.3 million since July, “the storm is coming to us these very days”.Daily cases in Israel have risen in the past two weeks from around 700 to the more than 4,000 reported on Sunday.“These are numbers that the world has not known, and that we also haven’t known,” Bennett said. He said that the government’s aim is “to allow the economy to function as much as possible, while protecting the most vulnerable among us.”Israel has recorded at least 8,244 deaths from coronavirus since the start of the pandemic.A surge of Omicron infections could see Israel reaching herd immunity, the country’s top health official said on Sunday.Until late December, Israel managed to stave off Omicron to some degree but with infection rates now gaining pace, daily cases are expected to reach record highs in the coming three weeks. This could result in herd immunity, said director-general of the health ministry, Nachman Ash. “The cost will be a great many infections,” Ash told 103FM Radio.“The numbers will have to be very high in order to reach herd immunity. This is possible but we don’t want to reach it by means of infections, we want it to happen as a result of many people vaccinating,” he said.Meanwhile, secondary school students in England will be required to wear face masks when they return to classes after the Christmas holidays.Education secretary Nadhim Zahawi said on Sunday the move was an attempt to “minimise disruption” in schools as Omicron variant drives infections in the UK to record levels. Students and teachers are set to return to classrooms on Tuesday after more than two weeks off.The government has urged schools and other public sector workplaces to be prepared for staff absences as Covid sickens more people or forces them to isolate.Two-thirds of the 25 workers at a scientific outpost in Antarctica have contracted Covid-19, the BBC reported. The cases are so far mild, and the infected have opted not to leave the Princess Elisabeth Polar Station.“While it has been an inconvenience to have to quarantine certain members of the staff who caught the virus, it hasn’t significantly affected our work,” Joseph Cheek, a project manager for Belgium-led outpost, told the BBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-pm-warns-of-coming-covid-19-storm-101641171529131.html
03-01-2022||World||A year after Capitol riot, Americans fear for their democracy: Polls||One year after the violent assault on the US Capitol, Americans remain deeply concerned about the health of their democracy and about a third say violence against the government can sometimes be justified, according to two polls published Sunday.The January 6 attack on the seat of Congress, led by supporters of Donald Trump, was "a harbinger of increasing political violence," and American democracy "is threatened," according to two-thirds of those surveyed for a CBS News poll.Meantime, Americans' "pride" in their democracy has dropped sharply, from 90 percent in 2002 to 54 percent now, a Washington Post/University of Maryland survey found.With the January 6 anniversary nearing, the polls offer specific causes for concern: CBS found that 28 percent of respondents believe force can be used to defend the result of an election, while 34 percent told The Washington Post that violent action against the government can sometimes be justified -- the largest percentage in decades.The results underscore the seemingly almost irreconcilable views dividing American society, which President Joe Biden -- who took office 14 days after the Capitol rioting -- has promised to overcome.Two-thirds of Trump supporters continue to believe his baseless charge that Biden is not the legitimately elected president.Trump had addressed thousands of supporters shortly before the Capitol assault, telling them the election had been "rigged" and that they should "fight like hell."Some 60 percent of those polled say Trump bears a heavy responsibility for the invasion of the Capitol just as lawmakers were set to certify Biden's victory.'Coordinated effort'There again, opinion follows partisan lines: 83 percent of Trump voters placed his level of responsibility at only "some" or "none," the Post survey found.And 26 percent of Americans want him to run again in 2024, according to CBS.A select committee of the House of Representatives has spent months working to establish the roles and responsibilities of those who incited or may have organized the protest.Despite limited cooperation from Trump's inner circle, the panel has conducted more than 300 interviews and collected thousands of documents."We have uncovered some things that cause us real concern, things like people trying to ... undermine the integrity of our democracy," the panel's chairman, Representative Bennie Thompson, said Sunday on ABC."It appeared to be a coordinated effort on the part of a number of people to undermine the election," he said."It could be people in the executive branch. It could be people in the Department of Defense... and some very wealthy individuals."He said he would not hesitate to refer any evidence of illegality to the Justice Department.Liz Cheney, one of only two Republicans on the panel, on Sunday strongly condemned Trump for waiting hours before urging the Capitol rioters to stand down.He could easily have issued such a call, she told ABC."He failed to do so. It's hard to imagine a more significant and more serious dereliction of duty."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-year-after-capitol-riot-americans-fear-for-their-democracy-polls-101641171657110.html

Wankhede has denied the allegations, including a charge of forging his caste certificate.The NCB, under Wankhede, had earlier arrested Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan in a narcotics case and the agency has recently moved the Bombay High Court to cancel the bail given to the latter in this case. Prabhakar Sail, an ‘independent’ witness in the cruise drugs case, had claimed and filed an affidavit that there was an extortion bid of ₹25 crore by some agency officials, and others for letting off Aryan Khan from the case.Sail had stated that he overheard that ₹8 crore ‘bribe’ out of this money was to be paid to Wankhede. Following these allegations, the agency headquarters here had removed Wankhede from the case apart from five others and had placed their investigation under a team led by its deputy director general (DDG) operations based in Delhi.Another DDG (northern region) is conducting a vigilance probe into the allegations of extortion in the cruise drugs case.Wankhede and his family had categorically denied these charges and said these allegations were made to deter the officer from taking strong action against drugs peddlers and syndicates operating in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sameer-wankhede-s-tenure-with-mumbai-ncb-ends-sent-back-to-dri-101641233552399.html
03-01-2022||India||Lakhimpur charge sheet names Mishra||LAKHIMPUR KHERI/LUCKNOW: Investigators probing the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence filed a charge sheet against 14 people on Monday, naming the son of junior home minister Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ as the main accused and citing witness statements to confirm his presence at the spot during the incident. Four farmers and a journalist were allegedly mowed down by the minister’s son, Ashish Mishra, and others during a farm protest in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. A special investigation team (SIT), which filed the charge sheet on Monday, told the local court last month that it was a “well-planned conspiracy”. The SIT filed the 5,000-page charge sheet in the court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM) Chinta Ram on Monday. It included thousands of pages of case diary, and documentary, scientific, forensic, physical and electronic evidence, said senior prosecution officer (SPO) SP Yadav. “Witnesses in the case confirmed Ashish Mishra’s presence on the spot and the same are part of the case diary,” said Yadav. Mishra had repeatedly denied being present at the spot when violence broke out. The SIT included the statements of 200 witnesses in the charge sheet, and named Ashish Mishra as the main accused.But family members of the victims alleged that the government was protecting the minister by not naming him in the charge sheet. “The SIT is playing at the hands of the government that seems adamant on saving Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’. The minister is the real mastermind of the incident and justice will not be done till the time he is put behind bars,” alleged Sukhwinder Singh, the father of 18-year-old Gurvinder Singh,who was killed on October 3. Amaan Ahmad, who represents the farmers in the case, said they were angered over the omission despite the minister being named in the initial police complaint. “The SUV that mowed down farmers is also registered in Teni’s name. We will appeal in the court for proper investigation into the case,” he said.The violence sparked nationwide condemnation and energised Opposition parties to demand the minister’s resignation, months before high-stakes polls in the crucial state. In the previous winter session of Parliament, several opposition parties disrupted proceedings to demand Ajay Mishra’s removal. The initial complaint into the case only named Ashish Mishra and unknown persons. Subsequent investigation by the SIT identified 12 other accused. In the charge sheet, the SIT added a 14th accused -- Virendra Shukla, a relative of the minister who is yet to be arrested.The 13 accused were charged under sections 147(rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapons), 149 (unlawful assembly ), 307(attempt to murder), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 302 (murder) and 120B (criminal conspiracy), section 427(mischief causing damage ), 34(acts done with common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),and Section 177 (wilfully disobeying directions) and B177 of the Motor Vehicle Act, said Yadav.The people in jail are Ashish Mishra, Ankit Das who is a relative of the Lucknow-based businessman, his aide Nandan Singh Bisht, his private security guard Latif alias Kaale, and driver Shekhar Bharti, who were said to be present in one of the three SUVs in Mishra’s cavalcade.The SIT filed additional charges under section 3/25 of the Arms Act against Sumit Jaiswal, section 30 of the Arms Act against Ashish Mishra, Ankit Das, Latif alias Kaale and Satyam Tripathi and section 5/27 of the Arms Act against Nandan Singh Bisht, said Yadav. Virendra Shukla’s name was added in the charge sheet under section 201 of the IPC (disappearance of evidence) and he was called to the court on January 10. Four farmers and a journalist died when an SUV owned by Ajay Mishra ran over farmers from behind in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. In the ensuing violence, three more people — two of whom were Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers and one was the driver of the car — were killedOn December 14, a court in Uttar Pradesh added stringent sections of the IPC and Arms Act, including attempt to murder, to the First Information Report (FIR) after the SIT said that incident was “well planned” and “deliberate”. The prosecution urged the court to exclude copies of case diary and some other documents from a list of papers to be disclosed to the accused, said Yadav. It will not be in public interest to do so, he added.Some family members of the farmers killed on October 3 expressed discontent over the charge sheet. “Police officials promised us to ensure that all accused of the incident will be put behind bars. But they are clearly saving the mastermind Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’,” said Jagdeep Singh, son of Nacchhatar Singh, a father killed in the violence.The Opposition criticised the government over the development. “The BJP has a washing machine. After getting washed in this special BJP washing machine, a criminal doesn’t look criminal anymore,” said Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav. “The 5000 page charge sheet is actually a black box of the double engine government of the BJP,” he tweeted. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted ,” The whole country has seen the truth of the 5000-page chargesheet in the form of a video, yet the Modi government is trying to save the accused. India is a witness!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-charge-sheet-names-mishra-101641233071309.html

The two are at Pul-e-Charkhi prison in Kabul since 2019, before the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan.Francis said he feared for the lives of his 32-year-old daughter and nine-year-old granddaughter, and sought the top court’s intervention.“First you have to persuade the Indian government. You should have first approached the government instead of moving the court,” a bench comprising justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai said.Commenting on news reports suggesting cordial diplomatic ties being established between India and Afghanistan, the bench said, “The relationship appears to be good.”The woman left the country on July 30, 2016 to join her husband, who was working with ISIS in Afghanistan. On an Interpol red corner notice issued on March 22, 2017, Ayisha and her daughter surrendered before Afghan forces on November 15, 2019, and were jailed.India’s National Investigation Agency has charged Ayisha under various provisions of the anti-terror law UAPA.“There are several treaties in force under which extradition is possible. But in cases involving UAPA, they (Centre) do not initiate,” the bench said, expressing its limitations.A representation was moved before the federal government but there’s been no response yet, advocate Renjith Marar, appearing for Francis, told the court.The petition was filed in the Supreme Court in July last year. Disposing of the petition, the apex court bench said, “We direct the cabinet secretary and secretary, ministry of external affairs (MEA) to consider and dispose the request for extradition of the detenues, preferably within eight weeks from today.”The apex court also permitted Francis to approach the Kerala high court, instead of approaching it, if he is aggrieved with the decision taken by the Centre after the eight-week period.During the hearing, Marar pointed out that the jail in which the kin of the petitioner were lodged was destroyed by the Taliban and prisoners were shifted to detention centres in border areas adjoining Pakistan.In his petition, Francis said that India was duty bound under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to bring back its citizens. He requested the Indian government to extend consular access to ensure the safety of his daughter and granddaughter through diplomatic channels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decide-on-plea-to-bring-back-kerala-woman-from-kabul-jail-for-isis-link-sc-101641227852144.html

After the introduction, the bill was sent for examination and scrutiny to a 31-member committee that consisted of only one woman—Trinamool Congress MP Sushmita Dev.According to the members’ list of the parliamentary standing committee, led by senior BJP leader Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, available on the Rajya Sabha website, Sushmita Dev is the only woman among the 31 members.TMC MP Sushmita Dev also sought inclusion of more female MPs in the parliamentary panel and wrote to the Chairperson of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth and Sports and senior BJP leader, Vinay Sahasrabuddhe.“Under Rules 84(3) and 275 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Council of States (Rajya Sabha), I wish to propose that any woman member of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha be empowered to testify either in writing or in person before the Committee on this issue,” Dev wrote.Dev said there were 29 women in the Rajya Sabha and 81 in the Lok Sabha. “I am sure all my Honourable female colleagues will have much to contribute in the discussion on this issue,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-chaturvedi-seeks-more-women-mps-in-panel-to-discuss-marriage-age-bill-101641220830980.html

Otherwise, they (farmers) will never pardon you. Nor the souls of 700 farmers who sacrificed their lives,” he added.Malik triggered a massive row after reports of his statement at an event on Sunday. Malik, who has been critical of the Centre's handling of the farm agitation over the now-repealed three laws, said: “When I went to meet the Prime Minister to discuss the farmer issue, I ended up fighting with him within five minutes. He was very arrogant. When I told him that 500 of our own (farmers) had died… he said, ‘Did they die for me?’ I told him yes, since you are the king. I ended up having an argument with him.”Asked by HT, Malik said: “I did not say the PM was arrogant, he was just adamant about his position.” The Meghalaya governor also stressed that the home minister did not speak ill of the prime minister and told him that people are telling Modi different things so he must meet and give him the right picture.At the press briefing on Monday, Surjewala also accused the Modi-led government of compromising national security and the country’s territorial integrity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-demands-pm-s-apology-amid-uproar-over-satya-pal-malik-s-arrogant-remark-101641218481408.html

Samples of all the passengers were tested after a crew member contracted the viral disease.The ship was initially made to wait at anchorage on Sunday for a few hours as the authorities debated the steps to be followed before asking the ship operators to get all the 2,000 passengers tested.“Out of 2000 samples tested from Cordelia cruise ship, 66 passengers tested positive for #COVID19 Respective collectors & MPT (Mormugao Port Trust) staff have been informed. The government will take appropriate measures to discuss disembarking of passengers,” Rane said.The passengers who were found negative will now have to await further instructions before being allowed to disembark.The state recorded four more cases of the fast-spreading Omicron variant of the virus with the National Institute of Virology, Pune, confirming the same during the day.Among the four, one has no prior travel history, leaving officials flummoxed and leading to the belief that the variant has already begun spreading in the state.“One patient is from within the state with no travel history, indicating indigenous spread to be further examined by experts,” Rane said, adding he would discuss the matter with chief minister Pramod Sawant regarding the steps ahead.The Goa administration is likely to impose a night curfew between 11pm and 6am, besides cancelling classes for students of classes VIII to XII.

He reiterated Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s remarks that the onus is on India to take steps to create an environment conducive to dialogue between the two sides.The 19th Saarc Summit was to have been held in Islamabad in November 2016 but was called off after New Delhi pulled out over the Uri terror attack that was blamed on Pakistan-based terrorists. There is also uncertainty about the status of Afghanistan, one of the eight members of the grouping, following the Taliban takeover of the country last year. Qureshi, who was speaking in Urdu, described Saarc as an “important forum” and said: “Unfortunately, India has made this forum dysfunctional because of its stubbornness. They are not ready to come to Islamabad, they are hesitant.” He added: “Because of India’s obstinacy, this forum is suffering. If India does not want to come [for the Saarc Summit], then new means are available. I reiterate our invitation to all Saarc members and Pakistan is willing to host the 19th Saarc Summit in Islamabad. If India doesn’t want to come, they can attend virtually.”Qureshi further said, “If they [India] have problems coming here physically, they can attend virtually but they shouldn’t stop others. They should let others come and not affect this forum.”There was no immediate response by Indian officials to Qureshi’s comments. Saarc operates on the principle of consensus and the summit cannot be held if even one member decides not to attend. With India-Pakistan relations at an all-time low following a string of terror attacks blamed on Pakistan-based groups, New Delhi has said there cannot be any dialogue between the two sides if Islamabad does not act against terrorist groups operating from its soil.In recent years, India has also focused on other regional groupings, such as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) to take forward developmental cooperation.Qureshi further told the news conference that prospects for durable peace and stability in the region and the potential for economic development and regional cooperation had been “held hostage by the hegemonic and hostile behaviour of India”, whose leadership has adopted a “particularly irresponsible and politically motivated anti-Pakistan posture”. He contended that India’s “unilateral and illegal actions” in Jammu and Kashmir since August 2019 had “vitiated the environment and threatened international peace and security”. Qureshi said, “Resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute is a prerequisite for durable peace and stability in South Asia.” He added that Pakistan will continue to extend “moral and diplomatic support” to the Kashmiri people in their struggle for self-determination.

03-01-2022||India||In setback to Bengal govt, SC declines to lift Suvendu Adhikari’s arrest shield||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to interfere with the Calcutta high court order granting protection from arrest to Bharatiya Janata Party leader and West Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari in connection with criminal cases lodged against him.On September 6 last year, a single judge bench of the HC had granted an interim stay on any coercive action against Adhikari in connection with criminal cases -- which were registered after he switched from the ruling Trinamool Congress to BJP. This order was challenged by the West Bengal government before a division bench, that refused to stay the order. Against this dismissal, West Bengal had appealed to the top court.During Monday’s hearing, the bench of justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna observed that this was the second case coming up against the same order. On December 13, the court had dismissed appeals filed by the West Bengal government and a complainant in one of the cases on the ground that the HC order was passed as an interim direction, pending final consideration of Adhikari’s petition. The top court’s order had permitted the state to file an application before the high court to vacate the stay.In the present appeal, the state government took fresh grounds questioning the dismissal of its letters patent appeal (LPA) by the HC’s division bench. The bench said, “Since the order of the single judge was assailed before us, the issue of maintainability of LPA pales into insignificance. Parties are to be governed by our order of December 13.”Senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy, appearing for the state government, informed the Court that the issue raised in their appeal was similar in nature to a case already pending before the top court. She said, “the issue here is whether LPA can be moved in terms of a writ petition before the high court under Article 226 of Constitution. This question is pending consideration in the Anup Majee v CBI case pending before this Court.”“We have already dealt with the HC order on merits; then where is the question of LPA? Once you have approached us on merits and we have dismissed your appeal, there is no question of dealing with another petition against the same order,” the bench said.Guruswamy sought to argue that the question raised by the state has not been dealt by the December 13 order. She even requested the court to allow this matter to be tagged with the Anup Majee petition as similar questions of law have to be decided. For Adhikari, senior advocate PS Patwalia opposed the state’s arguments and requested the court to dismiss the same. As regards clubbing the petition with the other pending case, the bench told the state, “The state is already before us in the Anup Majee matter.”Adhikari had approached the HC seeking stay of arrest in seven criminal cases lodged against him in the state. The high court order had stayed any coercive action against Adhikari even as the state government was directed to file its response.In its December 13 ruling, the top court had said, “Since the high court is seized of the proceedings, and the special leave petitions arise from an interlocutory order, we are not inclined to exercise the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution.” At the same time, the bench had said, “The High Court may either consider taking up the petition (pending before it) for expeditious final disposal or, in the event that it is not possible to do so, to consider any application that may be filed for modification of the interim order based on the material which is produced by the investigating officer in the affidavit-in-opposition (by state government).”Adhikari has claimed that the FIRs were the result of “regime revenge”. One case pertained to a theft of ₹5,000 and a gold chain while another related to theft of tarpaulin sheets at the behest of Adhikari. Even an old case of an alleged suicide of Adhikari’s personal security officer (PSO) was sought to be re-investigated on a complaint by the deceased’s widow who alleged murder of her husband.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-setback-to-bengal-govt-sc-declines-to-lift-suvendu-adhikari-s-arrest-shield-101641213510930.html

He used to introduce himself as a student of a reputed university and cheated passengers on the pretext of missing his flight. Once he was able to convince the passenger, he used to get the ticket money transferred into his bank account and would cheat the passengers, the senior officer said.It also came to light that 5 more FIR’s already stands registered against the accused and on Twitter also, there were many complaints against him, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-man-held-at-delhi-airport-for-conning-people-saying-he-missed-flight-101641213005228.html

The government said in a release that the media reports were “false and misleading and based on incomplete information.”“There have been some media reports alleging that expired vaccines are being administered in India under its national Covid-19 vaccination programme. This is false and misleading and based on incomplete information,” the release said.The government highlighted that the 3-months extension of the shelf life of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin was approved by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) in October last year. It further said that the shelf life of Covishield, the Indian version of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, was also extended from six to nine months in February 2021."The shelf life of vaccines is extended by the National Regulator based on comprehensive analysis and examination of stability study data furnished by the vaccine manufacturers," the release added.Bharat Biotech earlier said that the approval of the shelf-life extension was based on the availability of additional stability data, which was submitted to CDSCO. Amid the issue of vaccine wastage, the Hyderabad-based manufacturer also recently announced that the opened vials of its Covid-19 vaccine can be stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius for up to 28 days and are not required to be discarded immediately in a day or at the end of the immunisation session. Covaxin has been approved for use under the 28-day multi-dose vial policy from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and the WHO Emergency Use Listing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-rejects-reports-of-expired-vaccines-being-administered-in-india-as-misleading-101641206925139.html

We are committed to inoculation of all minors over 15 years of age besides providing booster doses to senior citizens," he told reporters.Asked about the recent spike which has led to clamping of night curfews in a number of states, Kumar said in Bihar the existing guidelines will remain in force till January 5."Tomorrow, a meeting of the COVID task force will be held to review the situation, which is changing rapidly, and further decisions will be taken," he said.The chief minister said that the testing rate in Bihar was higher than many states but in view of a rise in the positivity rate, "there is a need to crank it up".Asked about his statewide campaign against alcoholism, child marriage and dowry, as part of which he is scheduled to address a public gathering in Gaya on Tuesday, Kumar said, "Tomorrow's programme will take place. A decision on other future events will be taken in due course.""Due care is taken to ensure compliance of COVID protocol among the crowds," he added.Kumar also rebuked RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav for mocking his statewide tour."He will realise the importance of such social an awareness drive someday.

Bandi and resorted to violence and lathi charge, thrashed and manhandled senior party leaders and workers is highly deplorable and condemnable. It is yet another glaring example of the murder of democracy and constitutional rights by the Telangana government,” Nadda said in a statement.Bandi was arrested on Sunday after he sat on a fast and a night-long vigil in alleged violation of Covid protocol to press for changes to guidelines on the transfer of employees.

This is what CM Bommai said||The Karnataka government is likely to impose more restrictions to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The state cabinet may decide in this regard later this week after consulting experts, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Monday.The cases have been rising due to the Omicron variant, which was first detected in South Africa on November 24 last year and has since then spread across more than 100 countries. In India, the Omicron tally has crossed 1,700."We are monitoring both Covid and Omicron situation. It is spreading at a very fast pace in the country, in the state and in neighbouring states, so we need to have a discussion with experts. In this regard I will have a discussion with experts tomorrow evening," Bommai said."Having the experience of managing the earlier two waves, we have already asked the experts to recommend containment measures, with limited impact on daily lives of the people," he further said.The chief minister also urged people of the state to show self-control and follow the Covid-19 guidelines.The Karnataka government has already imposed containment measures like "night curfew" from 10pm to 5am since December 28 till January 7 morning, to control the spread of the infection.Karnataka has been witnessing a surge in COVID cases over the last five days, with daily figures crossing the 1,000 mark.

He left his studies, later his addiction affected his marital life and even his parents started living separately because of his habits. But, Sahu is a changed man now.He has not only overcome his addiction, but also helps local police in nabbing drug peddlers and motivates other addicts in his area to quit drugs and liquor consumption. Like him, there are several men in Chhattisgarh's Korea district who have quit addiction in the last six months, thanks to a campaign being run by local police against drugs and illegal liquor sale. Under the 'Nijaat' (riddance) drive, launched in July last year, the police have been successful in effectively curbing the smuggling of drugs and illegal liquor, and also persuaded a large number of addicts to quit the habit and lead a normal life, Korea Superintendent of Police Santosh Singh claimed while talking to PTI. The campaign is gaining momentum across Korea, a small district in Chhattisgarh's tribal-dominated Surguja division, with wall paintings, posters and banners of 'Nijaat' seen at many places in urban areas and remote villages of the district. According to the police official, the campaign is drawing more attention as celebrities like Prabhu Deva, Arbaaz Khan, Rajpal Yadav and Kailash Kher have been roped in to appeal to people, through video messages, to quit drugs and liquor. Some noted artists from Chhattisgarh, like actor Anuj Sharma and folk singers Teejan Bai and Mamta Chandrakar, have also extended support to the campaign. Singh, the brain behind the drive, said "the campaign has started yielding results and local public representatives as well as the common people have taken it forward in their areas on their own”. Around 200 public awareness programmes have been conducted so far under the drive in the district where hundreds of drug addicts have been counselled and successfully convinced to quit the habit, said the 2011-batch IPS officer. Besides, since July last year, so far 152 people have also been arrested in 126 cases registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, while 822 arrests have been made in 935 cases pertaining to the sale of illegal liquor, the police official said. After attending an event under the campaign in Sonhat village, Mukesh Sahu, a local, came in contact with police who convinced him to quit the addiction. "I started consuming liquor when I was in Class 10. I did not even appear for the exams and later quit studies. Soon, from liquor, I shifted to smoking ganja and chewing tobacco, and became addicted to these narcotics. I had no idea that I had started on a catastrophic journey,” Sahu told PTI. He said he used to buy liquor with money given to him for household items. His parents thought he might quit drug addiction after getting married. "I got married in 2016, but I continued with my habits and even assaulted my wife in drunken state. My wife started living most of the time at her maternal home along with my two children and even my parents left me," he said. "A few months back, I got in touch with Sonhat police station house officer Shiv Kumar Yadav, who encouraged me to quit the addiction," Sahu said, adding that he is now living happily with his whole family. Amitabh Gupta, a 48-year-old social activist whose organisation 'Samanata Kranti' has been associated with 'Nijaat', said as part of the campaign, people have now voluntarily formed committees at local level, and this has given a boost to the drive. “The campaign has two purposes- to locate drug peddlers and take action under the law which was already underway, and to understand the feelings of families of addicts and help them,” Gupta said. He said they have conducted various programmes, visited villages and contacted addicts and their families. "The prime focus was on Chhindiya village under the district's Patna police station which was infamous as a drug peddling hub. Narcotic substances from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand were believed to be smuggled into Chhindiya from there and circulated across the district,” he said. The police successfully cracked down on peddlers there and arrested many of them in the last six months, he said. The campaign is showing significant results in many parts of the district, though it will take time to reach a conclusion (to end the drug menace in the district), Gupta said. With the initiative of the superintendent of police, a de-addiction centre comprising 50 beds has also been set up at Baikunthpur in the district, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nijaat-campaign-helps-addicts-shun-drugs-alcohol-in-chhattisgarh-101641192254978.html
03-01-2022||India||Renaming places in Arunachal is part of Chinese psy-ops||Playing mind wars with the adversary is an old Chinese tactic since Sun Tzu days with deception, treachery, and propaganda legitimate tools of Communist Party arsenal. The Chinese renaming of 15 places in Arunachal Pradesh in mandarin language is part of the same psychological warfare designed to keep Narendra Modi government on tenterhooks and declare a new normal of Beijing’s strategy on boundary resolution.The Chinese are playing similar mind games with Republic of Taiwan and its western backers with its PLA warplanes breaching the Taipei’s southwestern air identification zone or ADIZ virtually on a daily basis throughout 2021. The last big Chinese breach took place on November 28, 2021 with 27 fighters, bombers and aerial reconnaissance planes bullying Taiwan into a new normal with regional and global powers on perpetual tenterhooks. Since the dawn of 2022, there has been a breach of Taiwan ADIZ by Chinese reconnaissance plane on January 1 and 2 respectively as if the Chinese Communist Party under its all-powerful leader Xi Jinping is marking territory.While India dismissed the Chinese renaming of some places in Arunachal Pradesh, the national security planners understand Beijing’s mind games and will respond to this at the right place and right time. The Narendra Modi government is in no mood to be reactive to Chinese psy-ops but will not allow any free lunches to Beijing.Perhaps, the Chinese move itself was a reaction of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat calling upon His Holiness the Dalai Lama on December 21 at McLeodganj. The RSS chief not only exchanged notes with the 14th Dalai Lama but also met the leaders of Tibet Government-in-Exile in Dharamshala. It is quite evident from the Chinese embassy reaction to Indian MPs attending a reception hosted by the Tibetan Government in Exile that the Tibet issue is as much as a red rag to CCP as Taiwan if not more. Breaching diplomatic etiquettes, the Chinese Embassy virtually threatened the six MPs attending the reception in December 2021 and asked them to refrain from supporting the Tibetan cause. Even in the past, junior level diplomats of Chinese embassy and consulate in Mumbai have breached diplomatic etiquettes by openly questioning Indian Ministers in the previous UPA regime including Pranab Mukherjee, who later became President, on 1962 war. Besides, Beijing has a habit of issuing a statement every time an Indian VVIP visits Arunachal Pradesh.While China takes serious umbrage on any issue concerning Tibet, Sinkiang and Taiwan, India in the past has followed the Beijing’s practice of changing names of towns and cities in Tibet and in Sinkiang. The Indian Embassy in Beijing has practiced diplomatic etiquettes by not writing directly to Chinese propaganda media who routinely project India in very poor light as part of its information warfare. Maybe the time has come for Indian surveyor general to publish new maps that call a spade a spade in Tibet and not pander to the Xizang nomenclature of CCP.

Keeping in view the rising concerns over the virus variant, Adityanath said while requisite precautions must be taken to cut the spread of the disease, there is no need to panic.“It's true that Omicron is highly contagious,” the UP chief minister acknowledged while addressing reporters on concerns about a third wave of the pandemic. “However, it is also true that compared to the second wave, the Omicron variant is weaker and is comparable to a simple viral fever.”“Safety precautions are necessary when dealing with any disease,” he added. “And in this case, too, safeguards are necessary. But there is no need to panic.”#WATCH | #Omicron spreads fast but causes very mild disease. The virus has weakened. It is like viral fever but precautions are necessary.

03-01-2022||India||Covid-19: Vaccination of children aged between 15 and 18 begins today||Amid concerns over the new, highly transmissible Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, India is all set to begin vaccinating the 15 to 18-year-old age group against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from today. It is, however, to be noted that only Bharat Biotech's indigenously-made shot ‘Covaxin’ will be used for vaccinating this age bracket. According to a note sent by the Union health ministry to all states and Union territories, additional doses of Covaxin will be sent to the states for administering the vaccine to this population category.The government's decision to begin the vaccination drive in this regard was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Christmas Day last December. It was said that while vaccination for the age bracket of 15-18 will begin from January 3, 2022, the administration of a precautionary third dose (booster shot) for vulnerable categories of people will begin from January 10.Who are potential beneficiaries of the vaccination drive?According to an official release by the Union health ministry, those people with the birth year of 2007 or before will be eligible for vaccination under the category of 15 to 18 year-olds.States have been asked to ensure there are separate queues and vaccination teams for the 15-18 age group to avoid confusion with the vaccination process of all adults.Potential beneficiaries began registering themselves on the Co-WIN portal from January 1; however, there is also the option of walk-in registration (albeit limited) at multiple vaccination centers when the immunisation drive begins today.Where to get vaccinated?While most existing vaccination centers shall have separate queues beginning today, states have also been informed that they have the option to dedicate a few Covid Vaccination Centres (CVCs) as ‘dedicated CVC’ exclusively for the 15-18-year-olds. The same shall also reflect on the Co-WIN app to ensure that there is no confusion in administering the vaccines to the different age groups.The states have also been advised to ensure the orientation of vaccinators and vaccination team members for the immunisation of 15-18 year-olds and the identification of dedicated session sites for the same. The states were further exhorted to undertake proper planning in advance for the distribution of Covaxin to identified session sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-of-children-aged-between-15-and-18-begins-today-101641167567261.html

03-01-2022||India||Students denied entry to class for wearing Hijab||Bengaluru: Six students were denied entry into classes by college authorities in Udupi district, located around 400 km from Bengaluru, for wearing hijabs, the students and their parents claimed. The incident took place at the government pre-university college for women. On Saturday, the parents of these students along with activists held a protest against the authorities for not allowing the students inside the class for three days. Apart from not being allowed into the class over the dress code, the students also complained that they are not being allowed to talk in Urdu, Arabic and Beary languages. The girls stood outside the classroom for three days in protest. The students claimed though their parents approached the principal Rudra Gowda for talks, he refused to hold a discussion on the issue. The girls said they have not been given attendance for the last three days and feared they might face an attendance shortage. “We were told to bring our parents to college, but when they arrived, school authorities made them wait for some three to four hours,” a student told media. Another student said, “ Everything was fine before we started wearing the hijab, but now we are being discriminated in this manner.” College principal Rudra Gowda said the students can wear hijabs on the school premises, but not inside the classrooms. The rule is being followed to ensure uniformity in classrooms, he said. Talking to the media in Udupi, the college principal, clarifying on the issue, said a parents-teachers meeting will be called to discuss the matter. “There are no provisions to have hijab as the uniform in our school’s rules. For the past three days, six students out of a total of 60 Muslim girl students are arriving at the college wearing Hijab. So, we have not allowed them to attend classes. They can attend classes if they remove the Hijab. We have called their family members and discussed the issue,” he said. On Saturday, a delegation including some students at the college along with some members of the Islamic Organization of India approached district collector Kurma Rao regarding the incident. Five girls who were stopped from entering the classroom were part of the delegation. Rao was not available for comment. Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) Udupi unit chief Nazeer Ahmed said that the party will stage a protest if the students are not allowed to attend classes with their hijabs. In a press conference, the Campus Front of India warned of gherao if the college does not reconsider its decision of not allowing Muslim girls to wear hijab.The issue comes up at the time when the Karnataka government is pushing for the anti-conversion bill. The bill is yet to become a law as it is yet to be approved by the Legislative Council. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai termed the bill as both constitutional and legal. He said that the bill aimed at getting rid of the menace of religious conversion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/students-denied-entry-to-class-for-wearing-hijab-101641149967868.html
03-01-2022||India||Row erupts over move to free temples from Karnataka govt’s control||The BJP has hit back at the Congress after its president opposed the Karnataka government’s move to bring in a law to free temples from the state’s control. BJP national general secretary and former minister CT Ravi told reporters on Sunday that the Congress does not have the mindset to address issues pertaining to the majority community. Ravi said the Britishers in India took over the temples not because of the respect they had for the Gods, but for the income the temples generated, and the BJP is bringing a law to remove this practice. “It is a matter of faith, and it is given by devotees with the same in mind. The government doesn’t have to run on this donation money, it is the property of society. That money should be used for developing temples and social work. There is no need for this money to run the government,” he said. Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday said that the government plans to introduce a new bill to free temples and Hindus religious institutions in the state from government control. “Hindu temples are under different types of control bylaws and rules. Before the budget session, a law would be given shape to make our temples free from such restrictions. Temples will be allowed to function freely, and there will be only regulations,” Bommai said. Responding to this announcement, DK Shivakumar, president of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC), on Saturday said that Congress is opposed to freeing temples from state control. “The state’s temples belong to the people. The BJP government in the state has decided to transfer this public property to the workers of the BJP and members of the Sangh Parivar. This is an anti-Hindu move and the people of the state, as well as Gods, would not forgive them. This is a huge blunder. Congress is not anti-Hindu; it is the BJP which is really against the interests of the Hindus.” “The government is planning to overturn the policy that has been in place for a long time. Apart from a few temples and mutts, the remainder comes under the control of the government. People contribute crores to these temples which have accrued over hundreds of years. The BJP is making plans to distribute these funds to their workers,” he added. There are 180,000 temples in Karnataka, among which 35,500 come under the Muzarai department. As per the records of the Muzarai department, there are 207 ‘A’ grade temples that get an annual income of more than ₹25 lakh, 139 ‘B’ grade temples that have an income between ₹5 lakh and ₹24.99 lakh. These ‘A’ and ‘B’ grade temples are required to submit accounts annually, as mandated by the law. Only four temples in the state -- Chamundeshwari temple of Mysuru, Yediyur Siddalingeshwara temple, Ghati Subramanya temple and Banashankari temple of Bengaluru -- are submitting audit reports every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-erupts-over-move-to-free-temples-from-karnataka-govt-s-control-101641149964803.html

He said the officials of districts bordering Maharashtra have been directed to be extra cautious as the neighbouring state is witnessing a spike in cases. “Our stand is very clear. In the past, lockdown was imposed. The same should not happen again. For this, we are taking stringent measures. People have to cooperate with us,” Bommai told reporters in Bengaluru. The statement comes as daily increase in Covid-19 cases in Bengaluru is inching towards the 1,000 mark. On Sunday, Bengaluru reported 923 new Covid cases and three deaths. Karnataka on Sunday added 1,187 new cases to the state’s overall infection count. In comparison, Bengaluru reported 1,033 new cases on Saturday, 832 on Friday, 707 on Thursday and 566 on Wednesday. According to the health department bulletin, while the positivity rate for the day stood at 1.08%, the case fatality rate (CFR) was 0.50 per cent. There were 275 discharges on Sunday. Of the six deaths reported in the state, three are from Bengaluru Urban, and one each from Tumkur, Dakshina Kannada and Uttara Kannada. After Bengaluru Urban, Dakshina Kannada accounted for the second-highest number of new cases with 63 . Regarding extending the night curfew or imposing tough rules, he said it would be decided either on Monday or Tuesday. “We have to see how coronavirus is spreading. We saw it increasing in a big way in Bengaluru. We will take a call keeping that in mind,” he said. Bommai said he has directed the officials to be cautious in the districts such as Belagavi, Vijayapura and Bidar bordering Maharashtra, which is witnessing a rise in cases. He added that those entering Karnataka would have to be fully vaccinated and they should also possess a negative RT-PCR test report. “These measures will cause trouble to the travellers but we are doing it keeping in view the public health of people of Karnataka, especially Belagavi,” Bommai said. Keeping in mind the oxygen shortage last time, the government has now contacted the oxygen plants to supply life-saving to the state. “These plants have been asked to start operations in preparation for the spike in the cases. Also. I have directed the officials to add 4,000 more ICU beds in the state. We are also making preparations for adequate medicines,” he said. Stating that the government was also focusing on the vaccination drive, the chief minister said vaccinating teenagers from 15-18 years would start from Monday. Booster doses would be given to those who have co-morbidities, he added. Karnataka revenue minister R Ashoka said the spike in infections in Karnataka was a serious issue. “Bengaluru is in the Red Zone according to the list declared by the Union government. It is important to sound an alert in Bengaluru. We can save people’s lives if we impose more restrictions in Bengaluru and reduce the number of hospitalisations,” he said. He said that the government is mulling to announce ‘some tough rules’ in coming days. “We will convene a meeting and announce some tough rules before January 7 when the night curfew will be lifted,” Ashoka said. He added that the experts’ committee would convene a meeting before January 7. “We will implement the recommendations of the committee in toto because we have seen the sufferings and deaths last time,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-covid-guard-up-to-avoid-lockdown-karnataka-cm-101641149906074.html
03-01-2022||India||Chennai man kills self, wife, two sons due to debt: Police||A family of four, including a one-year-old child, were found dead inside their posh apartment in Chennai’s upscale Perungudi on Sunday. Police said the 36-year-old man killed his wife and two children and he died by suicide. According to preliminary investigations, the cause of the crime was the man’s mounting debt. “At least four money lenders showed up today at the apartment to whom he owed 80 lakh,” said the investigating officer in the case who did not wish to be named. “He seems to have promised to settle all the repayment on January 2.” The Thoraipakkam police station have registered a case under section 174 (police to enquire and report on suicide) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). As the new year began, the facts of the tragic crime that have emerged so far in the case have shocked the surrounding community. The apartment also provides assisted living for senior citizens. Money lenders and neighbours rang the bell several times on Sunday morning and since no one opened the door, they rang police control room. Cops and neighbours together attempted several times before they could open the main door. They found the man hanging from a ceiling fan. His wife, 35, was lying dead with a deep injury on her head. “He had hit her with a cricket bat,” the officer quoted above said. “We don’t know how he killed his children. We are waiting for the post mortem reports.” The children are two boys aged 1 and 10 years. The bodies of all four have been sent to Chennai’s Royapettah Government Hospital. Police suspect the murders happened after Saturday evening. “The door was locked from inside so we don’t suspect any other foul play,” the police officer said. The man and his family lived in a three-bedroom house for rent paying ₹35,000. The man had worked abroad at a Barclays Bank before returning to India. His native is Coimbatore district and he had been living in the Chennai apartment for a year. He had been working in a call centre in the city but recently has been out of a job, police said.

During a pre-wedding mehendi ritual at Kota Thattu village on December 27, a police team had attacked Koraga community members, including the groom. “I am pained by the way the police department dealt with the Koraga community at Kota during a mehendi programme. This case will be handed over to CID. In addition, all those who were assaulted by police will be given ₹2 lakh from the government,” Jnanendra said after visiting the Koraga settlement on Saturday. He visited the house of the groom, Rajesh, and consoled the family members. “The sub-inspector of Kota police station did not bring the incident that occurred on the night of December 27 to the notice of higher officials. As he acted as if he was supreme, the situation went from bad to worse. The police system is there in place to control the outlaws and maintain peace in society. Police themselves should not behave like rowdies,” the home minister said. According to the complaint registered by members of the community with the police chief in Udupi, the incident occurred on Monday night when the police team, led by sub-inspector Santhosh, arrived at the groom’s house after neighbours complained of loud music. After an initial altercation with the locals, the team began assaulting those present at the ceremony and later took five people, including the groom, to the police station and assaulted them, the complaint said. The detention led to a protest outside the police station by the community members. The home minister said the attack on the community, categorised as a scheduled tribe (ST), has caused the government pain. “The innocent community, which is at the lowest rung of the society, rarely does this kind of mehendi programme. This incident has caused pain to the community and shocked the family,” he said. The attack on the Koraga community was the third incident where a police officer has faced action for assault against minorities. In September, the CID arrested a police sub-inspector for allegedly forcing a Dalit man to drink urine, while the latter was in custody in May. Arjun Horakeri, the sub-inspector posted with Gonibeedu police station, was produced before a court in Chikkamagaluru, and an additional district and sessions judge remanded him to 14 days judicial custody. On December 8, a police sub-inspector was suspended after he had allegedly manhandled a young man and forced him to drink urine in Bengaluru. Sub-inspector Harish KN was suspended after a departmental inquiry. He was charged with “dereliction of duty and not registering a complaint.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cid-to-probe-police-attack-on-koragas-in-udupi-home-minister-101641149786185.html
03-01-2022||India||Jagan to call on Modi, Shah for aid||Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy is set to leave for a two-day visit to New Delhi where he is expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, an official from the chief minister’s office (CMO) said. “He has got an appointment with the prime minister at 4 pm on Monday, and is expected to meet the home minister on Tuesday,” the CMO official said on Sunday. The official said chief minister Jagan would raise the issues related to flood relief funds and the Centre’s indifferent attitude towards the state during his visit. “He is expected to present a list of demands before them, among the others,” the official said. Nearly a month-and-a-half since heavy rains flooded south coastal and Rayalaseema districts of Andhra Pradesh, leaving a trail of destruction of properties and standing crops and claiming around 60 lives, the state government is yet to receive relief funds from the Centre despite representations made to Modi and Shah, apart from the reports submitted to the Central team which visited the flood-affected areas in the last week of November. The four south coastal districts of Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam and Nellore and four Rayalaseema districts of Kurnool, Anantapur, Kadapa and Chittoor received an average rainfall of 11.1 cm, against the normal rainfall of 3.2 cm between November 13 and 20, according to state meteorological department. In a single day, on November 19, the highest rainfall of 20 cm was recorded at Peddamandyam block in Chittoor district, followed by 19.3 cm in Galiveedu block of Kadapa district and 17.8 cm in Nallacheruvu block of Ananthapuram district. In a statement made in the state assembly representation on November 26, the chief minister said as many as 44 people were declared dead, and 16 others could not be traced. He pointed out that several highways, irrigation tanks and canals got breached and damaged at several places in Kadapa, Chittoor, Ananthapuram and Nellore districts. Somasila reservoir in Pennar basin received heavy inflows of more than 500,000 cusecs of water in 48 hours, causing inundation of low lying areas in Nellore town and Kovvur in the district. In all, 1,990 villages in 119 mandals across four districts were affected by the floods, of which 211 villages were completely inundated. As many as 1,169 houses were completely damaged and 5434 houses were partially damaged, the assembly representation stated. In a representation made to the prime minister on November 24, Jagan said the state had suffered a loss of ₹6,054 crores in the form of destruction of properties and infrastructure and damage to standing crops. He requested that the Centre release an amount of ₹1,000 crore towards immediate relief and restoration works in the flood-affected areas. On November 27, an inter-ministerial central team, headed by Kunal Satyarthi from the ministry of home affairs, toured the flood-affected areas for three days. The central team interacted with the affected people, besides holding a series of discussions with the state government officials. The team also had a winding-up meeting with the chief minister and appreciated the efforts made by the state government in providing relief to the people. “We have asked for the Central assistance what we are entitled to. So far, we have not heard anything from them,” state disaster management authority commissioner and secretary K Kanna Babu told HT. He said the state government was regularly following up with the Centre to get the promised assistance. “We hope they will extend the financial assistance at the earliest,” Kanna Babu added.
03-01-2022||India||Don’t talk about national institutions lightly: Kerala Governor hits out at Chennithala’s remark||Thiruvananthapuram: Political leaders should not drag constitutional authorities into controversies, Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan urged on Sunday, a day after Congress party leader Ramesh Chennithala asked if the state government was involved in the Kerala University’s rejection of the governor’s recommendation to confer a D.Litt on President Ram Nath Kovind. “We should not talk about national institutions in a light manner. It is a question of national prestige and dignity,” Khan told reporters. “I am not going to respond to statements made out of sheer ignorance. Some of these statements are unfortunate and disturbing.”The state government and Khan have been at loggerheads over the appointment of vice-chancellors to universities. As far as a recommendation was concerned, it was within the remit of the university or the chancellor, Khan said. The governor is chancellor of universities in all states in India. “What I have to speak, I have spoken,” Khan said. “I am not going to respond to irresponsible and ignorant statements.”Chennithala had claimed on Saturday that the government rejected Khan’s recommendations to confer D Litt to the visiting President two weeks ago. Later, state opposition leader V D Satheesan of the Congress criticised Khan “for making an inappropriate recommendation.” Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, state secretary of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), however, denied any knowledge of the matter. “We have no idea about it,” he said. “Either the governor or Chennithala will have to explain it.” The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party has also asked the state government and political leaders not to insult constitutional positions. Khan’s remarks come in the midst of a standoff with the state government. In a letter sent to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan last month, Khan had said he was pained over the “dipping standard” of higher education and blamed it on “brazen political interference”. The reappointment of Kannur University vice-chancellor Gopinath Raveendran is among the points of contention. He was reappointed for four years in November after the state government issued a notification and appointed a selection committee for a new vice-chancellor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-talk-about-national-institutions-lightly-kerala-governor-hits-out-at-chennithala-s-remark-101641149725162.html
03-01-2022||India||18 years and fighting: HIV-infected Kerala mother seeks job for her educated children||Thiruvananthapuram: Stigmatised and alienated by the society for being HIV-positive, a woman and her three children in north Kerala’s Kottiyoor are fighting a valiant battle for 18 years. The mother, Rema (47), who was the face of the state government’s campaign against the dreaded disease and social stigma attached to it, now says she is tired of her fight. She wrote a letter to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in June, asking the government to provide jobs to her educated children to keep the hearth burning, but her wait still continues. An optimist and a fighter, she is hoping against the hope. The heart-rending tale of Rema and her three minor children surfaced in 2003 when a lower primary school in Kottiyoor (Kannur district) expelled her two children after it came to know that they were also infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It shocked the conscience of the state and she also threatened to fast outside the school. The school was forced to bend its knees before the fighting mother. Later the state government appointed her as a “positive worker” for three years and she drew a monthly stipend of ₹3000 then. As a “positive worker” she tried to bust some of the myths attached to the disease. Rema’s life turned upside down in 2002 when her husband K Shaji, who was working with a private firm in Mumbai, returned home after he was infected with AIDS. Later tests done on the mother and two children also revealed that they were infected -- the eldest daughter was negative. Her children were thrown out of their school but she fought back and ensured education to her children at the same school (HT had profiled her in 2003). Before his death, Shaji confided to his wife that he used to frequent red light areas in Mumbai. “I somehow married off my eldest daughter last year. She holds a post-graduate degree in engineering. And remaining two, a girl and boy, also completed their graduation and are waiting for a job. There were enough promises and claims but nothing happened,” said the mother, adding that they lived all these years due to magnanimity of some good Samaritans. ”Stigma, aversion and indifferent attitude are still there. I don’t know how I lived all these years. I have to fight every inch to open a path before us. I feel exhausted. My children desperately need jobs. There were enough promises and claims but all remained in thin air,” she said, adding that she thought of suicide several times but the innocent face of her children prevented her from it. “Even after 18 years, the attitude of the society remains same. My daughter was selected for a job last year but failed to get it because she’s HIV-positive. We don’t need sympathy but we need wherewithal to live an ordinary life,” she said, adding many film personalities and others promised help to her but all waned later. “We were subject of ridicule and discrimination. We fought our way back. But things remained more or less same. Society still views us with stigma and aversion. What we need is acceptability and means to live an ordinary life,” she said, adding she will meet the chief minister again to help her children get jobs. When contacted, a spokesman of the government refused to comment on the woman’s letter to the CM.
03-01-2022||India||45 new Omicron cases detected in Kerala||Kerala on Sunday reported 45 new Omicron cases, highest single day tally since the first case of the new Covid variant was detected on December 7. Total Omicron cases went up to 152 in the state, said health minister Veena George. Of the new cases nine persons came from high-risk countries and 32 came from the nations marked as low risk, the minister said in a statement, adding four contracted the infection locally. Among new cases 16 reported in Ernakulam followed by Thiruvananthapuram with 9 cases. Two days ago the state had logged 44 cases crossing the 100 mark. The minister has called for heightened vigil in view of rising cases. “We have to be extremely careful in coming days. We have to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour strictly. We have noticed people removing masks while talking and this should be discouraged,” the minister said, adding the state was well prepared with enough oxygen stock and beds. The state detected the first case of the new variant on December 7 and cases crossed 100 in less than a month. Experts said Omicron cases are likely to peak in the state in two months. The government said it has taken enough precautions to meet the exigency. At least 98 per cent of eligible population in the state received the first dose of vaccine and 77 per cent received both and experts said good vaccination rate will help contain the new threat of Omicron but they warned it is too early to lower guard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/45-new-omicron-cases-detected-in-kerala-101641149487584.html
03-01-2022||India||Covid cases double in Tamil Nadu in a week||In a week’s time Covid-19 cases have doubled in Tamil Nadu from the range of 600 new daily cases to 1594 new cases on January 1 which authorities link to the rapid transmission due to Omicron variant. There are 118 cases of the variant so far including the highest of 92 in Chennai. Chennai and adjoining district of Chengalpattu are reporting the highest Covid-19 cases in Tamil Nadu. The two districts on January 2 reported 776 and 146 cases, respectively which is a rise from 171 and 48 that it registered a week ago on December 26. Daily testing during both periods has been in the same range of more than a lakh. Since patients with Omicron only have a mild form of the disease, health minister M Subramanian said they’re likely to monitor people from home as cases are expected to go with the Pongal festival coming up in mid-January.The state is focusing primarily on vaccinating the population as part of its prevention measures. It held its 17th Mega Vaccination Camp in 50,000 camps across the state on Sunday. More than 14-lakh people got inoculated in a day at these camps.Addressing a press conference at a camp in Chennai, Subramanian said those infected with the Omicron variant mostly test negative after three days, and the state is repeating a test on the fifth day and only then discharging them. “It is not severe like the Delta variant where a majority required hospitalisation and oxygen support. Most patients are asymptomatic,” the minister said. Tamil Nadu will begin vaccination for children aged above 15 from Monday onwards. Chief minister MK Stalin will inaugurate the drive in Chennai on Monday, Subramnaian said, adding that 26 lakh school children in Tamil Nadu have been identified.Health secretary J Radhakrishnan said 96 lakh individuals are due to receive the second dose of vaccination while 70 lakh people are yet to receive the first dose in the state. The health department and Greater Chennai Corporation held a meeting on Sunday to discuss re-opening more Covid care centers and imposing more enforcement.The officials have decided to bring back infrastructure which was in place during the second wave driven by the Delta variant. The city will now bring back screening centres where patients will be triaged, 20 car ambulances for positive patients will be readied. Covid-19 control room will be re-opened at the city corporation which was functioning during the second wave.“People have dropped their guard so civic and police officials will together enforce 100% mask compliance in the city,” Subramanian said. Chennai’s corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said the civic body has collected ₹105 crore as fines from people who violated Covid-19 norms in public. About 5-lakh people are yet to be vaccinated in Chennai, he said, urging people to get vaccinated. On the eve of the new year, Tamil Nadu came up with more restrictions in view of the rising cases such as going back to 50% capacity in theatres, restaurants and fitness centres.

03-01-2022||India||Marriage bill: Women groups reach out to Parliamentary panel||Several women organisations have reached out to the Parliamentary committee assigned to examine the The Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which seeks to raise the legal age of marriage for women to 21, a senior member of the panel said on Sunday. “Many women organisations and individuals would be invited. We will hear views of different sections before preparing our report. Some women organizations have already contacted us to depose before the panel. This bill would not be reviewed hastily,” the member said, seeking anonymity.The remarks came after Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi pointed out that the panel of 31 members included only one woman. She was referring to Trinamool Congress MP Sushmita Dev. “Women participation for a woman centric bill! In a committee of 31 only 1 is a woman,” Chaturvedi tweeted. Another member, however, argued that the composition of the panel depends on the nomination of MPs by various parties and the decision of the Rajya Sabha chairman.“But we will hear many women and women organisations during the discourse on the bill. It would not be that the bill would be reviewed by only the men present in the committee,” the member said, seeking anonymity.“We are meeting on January 5 to decide the methodology of reviewing the bill. Usually, all committees invite public response for bills. We will also follow the same route.” Vinay P. Sahasrabuddhe, panel chairman, told HT. The Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was tabled in the Lok Sabha during the Winter Session of Parliament and later referred to a parliamentary panel for further scrutiny by a voice vote. The bill seeks to modify the definition of a child, stating that it means a male or female who has not completed 21 years of age. It also seeks to make consequential changes to various personal laws relating to the marriage of different communities to ensure a uniform marriage age.According to the draft legislation, “women are often put in a disadvantageous position in regard to higher education, vocational instruction, attainment of psychological maturity and skill-sets, etc. Entering into the employment sphere and being part of the workforce to make themselves self dependent ... is a critical area”. “These disadvantages perpetuate the dependence of women on men,” it added. The draft legislation seeks to amend seven personal laws – the Indian Christian Marriage Act; the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act; the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act; the Special Marriage Act; the Hindu Marriage Act; the Hindu Minority and Gaurdianship Act, and the Foreign Marriage Act. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently backed the central government’s decision to increase the age of marriage of daughters from 18 to 21. “We have decided daughters will be allowed to marry at the same age sons are allowed to. With 21 years of age for marriage of daughters, they will get full time to study and will also be able to make their career,” he said. The bill evoked mixed responses. While a section of political leaders have extended their support, a few Muslim organisations have raised concerns over the bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/marriage-bill-women-groups-reach-out-to-parliamentary-panel-101641148464821.html

Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) and Police authorities are coordinating further action,” Vaishnaw tweeted. Meanwhile, the Delhi Police Sunday said they had registered a first information report (FIR) at the cyber cell police station of south east district against unidentified persons. The incident comes nearly six months (July 2021) after unidentified persons created an app and uploaded photographs of Muslim women with derogatory messages. No arrests were made in the case. One of the woman journalists whose doctored image was also uploaded on the app took to Twitter to express her anguish. She also posted a copy of the complaint she filed over the matter with the Cyber Cell of the Delhi Police. Acknowledging the complaint, the Delhi Police tweeted: “The matter has been taken cognizance of. Concerned officials have been directed to take appropriate action.” Another complaint was filed in Mumbai regarding the matter. “The case was registered under the Indian Penal Code. It is likely to be transferred to the Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations unit of Delhi Police,” said a senior cyber cell officer pleading anonymity. Meanwhile, a GitHub spokesperson said, “GitHub has longstanding policies against content and conduct involving harassment, discrimination, and inciting violence. We suspended a user account following the investigation of reports of such activity, all of which violate our policies.”  The incident evoked a strong criticism from many political sections, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who tweeted Sunday saying the humiliation and communal hatred against women will stop only when all raise a united voice against it. “The year has changed, the situation has also changed -- now we have to speak,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muslim-women-s-photos-morphed-centre-steps-in-police-file-fir-as-outrage-mounts-101641148344787.html

The flight landed in Delhi at 11.15 am. As per standard operating procedures (SOPs), an aircraft has to take multiple permissions from ATC before taking off from an airport. It needs to take permission to push back from the aircraft stand. Then, it has to take permission before starting the engines. Then, it has to take permission to stand in the line up, and then a final permission is given for take off.“An enquiry is being held to ascertain the reasons for the lapse and based on the outcome, appropriate action shall be taken against those found irresponsible,” DGCA director general Arun Kumar said. “Pilots have been off rostered pending an inquiry,” a SpiceJet spokesperson said, seeking anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-spicejet-pilots-temporarily-suspended-for-taking-off-without-atc-nod-101641148224994.html

The circular, issued by the top court’s registry, said, “Keeping in view the rising number of cases of Omicron variant (Covid-19), the competent authority has been pleased to direct that…physical hearing (with hybrid option) before courts will remain suspended for the present and all hearings before the courts for a period of two weeks from and with effect from January 3 shall be through virtual mode only.”The notification came on a day when Delhi reported more than 3,000 cases on Sunday with the fast-spreading Omicron variant being reported from 23 states. On Sunday, India reported a little over 18,000 cases and 284 deaths, according to the dashboard maintained by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).The Supreme Court had allowed physical hearings (with an option to login virtually) from October 7.

Therefore, leave no stone unturned in ramping up infrastructure to manage a high surge so that India escapes unscathed from this episode of Covid-19,” said Mandaviya during a review meeting on the pandemic situation and vaccination progress, the statement said.Also Read| Covid-19: Can at-home tests detect Omicron? Here's what experts are saying“The meeting was basically to discuss together bottlenecks and how the preparations can be expedited and streamlined to manage the expected surge,” said a health ministry official, who was part of the meeting.The health minister in particular directed states to better utilise funds under the Emergency COVID Response Package (ECRP-II ) for an adequate number of ICU beds, oxygen beds, paediatric ICUs, high dependency unit beds etc. So far, the states collectively have used just over 17% of the available funds.“Effectively use IT tools for tele-medicine and tele-consultation, including training and capacity building of human resources, timely availability of ambulances, readiness of states to operationalise Covid-19 facilities for institutional quarantining, and effective and supervised monitoring of those in home isolation,” he said.The health minister also emphasised that irrespective of the Covid-19 variants in circulation, measures for preparedness and protection remain the same. He asked the states to re-invigorate their teams to work at the ground level and strengthen monitoring and containment mechanisms.Critical bottlenecks in medical infrastructure were also discussed at the review, according to the statement. “We have put up a strong fight against Covid earlier and this learning must be used to re-focus on efforts against the Omicron variant. There is a continued need to follow Covid appropriate behaviour along with renewed and stringent focus on containment measures for addressing the present surge,” he said.He also asked states to start preparations to administer Covid vaccine doses to children aged 15-18 years from January 3. “We must focus on planning with regard to the 15-18 age group vaccination and precautionary doses for eligible beneficiaries. Ensure that the healthcare workers and frontline workers are fully vaccinated, as they form the vulnerable categories,” said Mandaviya.While appreciating the efforts of states and UTs in achieving the national average of 90% coverage of first dose vaccination of all eligible adults, he urged those states, whose progress of vaccination is below the national average, to ramp up their vaccination campaign.“States were also advised to prepare a weekly plan to catch up and exceed the average national vaccination coverage and review the implementation of this plan on a daily basis at the level of Secretary/ACS Health [with special emphasis in 5 poll-bound States of Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur],” read the health ministry statement.Also Read| Covid spreading faster than it was in second national wave: DataStressing on the need to ensure smooth implementation of new vaccination guidelines, States were advised to ensure the orientation of vaccinators and vaccination team members for vaccination of 15-18 years age-group, and the identification of dedicated session sites for vaccination of 15-18 years age-group. To avoid the mixing-up of vaccines during administration, separate covid vaccination centres, separate session sites, separate queue (if at same session where adult vaccination is ongoing) and separate vaccination team (if at same session site) should be formed.States have also been asked to share their requirement of vaccine doses through district wise estimation of beneficiaries using CoWIN, and plan for distribution of Covaxin to identified session sites well in advance and publish sessions for at least 15 days to provide sufficient visibility.

These are among the challenges outlined in the discussion paper, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times.The move comes amid a series of charges against Meta (formerly known as Facebook) by a former employee in UK stating that the social media giant stokes online hate and extremism, fails to protect children from harmful content and lacks any incentive to fix these problems“It is recognized that while technology and internet have many advantages, several challenges in user harm, security, child safety have emerged that need legislative response,” the discussion paper states.“It is time to look at the digital India legislative architecture differently — instead of more laws and more authorities — why not look at current laws, rules and institutions and see if we can pivot and transform them into being aligned to future needs of digital India, that is, global standard cyber laws,” it adds.On November 26, Union minister for electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, had told HT that the Centre is deliberating a “global standard law” for social media companies to curtail user abuse. “For a country like India, where 800 million users are online, it becomes imperative to develop a safe and open cyberspace as the country moves towards a $5 trillion economy,” Chandrasekhar said then.At present, the different laws that govern the technology sector in India include the Telegraph Act, the information technology act, the new intermediary guidelines, TRAI Act and sections of the IPC. The country’s first data protection law is also in the works, with the joint parliamentary committee examining the framework tabling its report in the winter session of Parliament.“The IT Act and TRAI Act date back to the pre-internet, pre-digital India era,” states the discussion paper. “Current laws are rigid, inflexible, narrow and do not enable evolutionary policy making,” it says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/child-safety-content-moderation-among-key-issues-in-social-media-law-outline-101641147872936.html

A criminal case has been already filed in the matter.The move comes a day after investigators added two more names — Yati Narsinghanand, the organiser of the event, and Sagar Sindhu Maharaj — to the list of accused persons, the Uttarakhand’s director general of police Ashok Kumar said on Saturday, taking the total number to five. The first information report registered on December 23 listed only one accused, Jitendra Narayan Tyagi, formerly Waseem Rizwi. Later, two more names, Annapurna Maa alias Pooja Shakun Pandey, and Dharamdas Maharaj, a general secretary of the Hindu Mahasabha, were added.The SIT has been formed “for a fair and unbiased probe”, said Karan Singh Nagnyal, deputy inspector of police, Garhwal range.“The SIT will be led by a superintendent of police, assisted by an additional SP, one inspector and two sub-inspectors. The case, which was being investigated by Haridwar Kotwali police, will be handed over to the SIT. Necessary legal action will be taken against the accused after investigation,” said Nagnyal.Police have added Section 295(a) (insulting a religion with deliberate and malicious acts) under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to the complaint. Earlier, only Section 153 (a) (promoting disharmony, enmity or feelings of hatred) of the IPC was mentioned.In another development, police on Sunday registered one more case against accused Tyagi at Jwalapur police station of Haridwar after receiving a complaint from a local resident. “Following a complaint by a local resident Nadeem Ali, a case was registered against him under Sections 153(a) and 298 (deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any person) of the IPC,” said inspector Chandrakar Naithani, station house officer of Jwalapur police station. The decision to assign a special team to probe the politically sensitive case comes against the backdrop of criticism that the police probe has been moving at a slow pace. On Friday, lawyer Kartikeya Gupta said police should have been more “active” in probing the case relating to communal issues.Uttarakhand police chief Kumar, however, insisted police are “taking all necessary action” in the case.The event where hate speeches targeting minorities were made from the podium was held from December 17-19 in Haridwar.A police case was registered after videos of the event emerged on social media on December 22. Initially, the case was assigned to a sub-inspector of the Kotwali police station for investigation.

The measures were announced following a meeting of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine (SMVDSB) with the L-G. More than 27,000 pilgrims had visited the cave shrine on Saturday, while over 15,000 visited on Sunday till 6 pm, officials said.“Chaired a meeting of SMVD Shrine Board. Several decisions have been taken to ensure safety of pilgrims. Besides ₹10 lakh announced as an ex-gratia, additional amount of ₹5 lakh to be given to the next of kin of the pilgrims who lost their lives in the unfortunate tragic incident,” Sinha, who is also the chairman of SMVDSB, tweeted.The L-G said that directions were “issued for physical and systematic improvements wherever required after critical examination, augmentation of infrastructure:. “Online booking to be made 100 per cent,” he said. Besides these, Sinha informed that measures such as “decongestion of the entire track, appropriate use of technology for effective crowd control and queue management besides RFID tracking shall be put in place”. The meeting also discussed the modalities for suspension bridge, a ropeway and skywalk for effective queue management, besides identifying more halting spots to cater to large crowds at the Mata Vaishno Devi Bhawan and Katra, the base camp for the pilgrims visiting the shrine atop Trikuta hills in Reasi district, an official spokesperson said.The members of the board will monitor the implementation of the decisions, the L-G said.On Saturday, at least 12 people were killed and over a dozen others were injured in the stampede as hundreds of thousands of pilgrims rushed to offer prayers at the shrine on the first day of 2022.The J&K administration has constituted a three-member panel, headed by principal secretary (home), to probe the incident and submit its report within a week. It also announced a relief of ₹2 lakh to the injured which will be paid by the Shrine board. While an official said the stampede likely occurred after an altercation between some boys among the pilgrims, witnesses alleged mismanagement on part of the shrine and also demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the alleged lapses. J&K director general of police Dilbag Singh said action will be taken against those involved in the alleged scuffle that led to the stampede. ““The committee constituted would look into the causes that led to the stampede,” Singh said.Replying to a question whether police will take action if those involved in the scuffle were identified, he told PTI “yes” and added that “police would do its work simultaneously”.Meanwhile, the administration has issued a public notice asking eyewitnesses to share information on the incident.“It is for the information of the general public that any person who desires to furnish any facts, statements, electronic evidence etc. regarding the incident (stampede) may share the same,” the notice issued by Jammu Divisional Commissioner Raghav Langer, one of the members of the probe panel, said. “Any person, who desires to furnish any facts, statements,evidence may share the same on email Id: divcomjmu-jk@nic.in or at whatsapp number 09419202723 or at landline number 0191-2478996 by or before January 5.

03-01-2022||India||Measures to conserve Western Ghats to be delayed by 6 months||Measures to conserve the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats will be delayed by another six months after the central government extended the deadline to notify the new rules till June 30 citing difficulties in consultations due to the coronavirus pandemic, a notification from the Union environment ministry stated. Earlier, the deadline was set to expire on December 31. The union environment ministry issued a notification on December 31 amending the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986. In rule 5, sub-rule (3) and clause (d), “for the words, letters and figures 31st December, 2021, the words, letters and figures 30th June, 2022 shall be substituted,” the notification stated. The clause applies to prohibition or restrictions imposed by the government on the location of industries or the carrying on of processes and operations in an area.After floods and landslides in the Western Ghats in Maharashtra and Kerala last year, experts had called for an immediate demarcation of the ecologically sensitive areas. The government intends to prohibit or restrict industrial and developmental activities in some 37% of the area of the mountain range, an area of 59,940 sq km spread over five states. The environment protection act rules enjoin the central government to consider all observations and objections within 120 days of publication in the official gazette, and impose the new curbs within 180 days which has been now been amended to extend the timeline. The five Western Ghats states – Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat – have opposed several of the measures. Last year, these states did not agree with the Union environment ministry’s fourth draft on the subject in a notification dated October 3, 2018. In view of the pandemic, the ministry had on June 16 extended the validity of the notification till December 31. But once again, the five states were not able to reconcile their differences, a ministry official said, requesting anonymity. Several activities such as mining, operating thermal power plants or specified polluting industries, building townships and area development will either be completely banned or severely restricted. The Western Ghats is an ecologically fragile region. An expert panel led by ecologist Madhav Gadgil in 2010 recommended that 75% of the 129, 037 sq km area should be declared an environmentally sensitive area because of its dense forest and a large number of endemic species. In 2013, a panel headed by rocket scientist K Kasturirangan scaled it down to 50%. The Kasturirangan report’s recommendations were further diluted, and four draft notifications have been issued since. “The need for conserving Western Ghats ecology without compromising local livelihoods has been recognised in various planning, policy and scientific documents,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research, a think tank. “Its legal and regulatory enforcement has, however, been a vexed process. “This new extension for the finalisation of the notification represents political negotiations and prioritisation challenges of various governments,” Kohli said. “It is also an important moment to strengthen the process by reflecting on post-Covid consciousness around public health, food security and biodiversity.” Several experts have linked unplanned construction and quarrying to the worsening of disasters in the Western Ghats. “I know what kind of vested interests are prevailing. They are nurtured. They are the construction lobby who work so that the rich can make more and more money,” Gadgil had told HT in an interview in October after floods in the Konkan and landslides in Uttarakhand. “People in the Konkan have now started talking a great deal about improper construction of bridges, high embankments and highways in vulnerable areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/measures-to-conserve-western-ghats-to-be-delayed-by-6-months-101641146425111.html
03-01-2022||India||Number Theory: A data wish-list for the New Year||Every day, the data and political economy team of the Hindustan Times brings you stories we call Number Theory. They are based on databases from India and sometimes even abroad. We will continue to do this in the New Year as well. However, to give tradition and our readers a welcome-break, we have decided to do a wish-list on behalf of the data and political economy team. The stories we do depend on availability of data. In most cases, whether or not such data is available, is a function of the government deciding to collect or publish such data. Here are four databases our team would like to have access to in 2022. Census of India data 2021 was supposed to be the year of the decadal census in India. This exercise has not been delayed even once until 2011 since 1881, when India conducted its first full census. 2021 is over and we do not know what the progress is vis-à-vis the conduct of this all-important data collection exercise. In a response to a Lok Sabha question on December 7, 2021 the government simply said that the 2021 census and related activities “had been postponed” in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. This decision would have made sense a year ago, when we knew little about the pandemic and did not have vaccines. But with the country well on its way towards fully vaccinating all adults; we have announced vaccines for even children and booster doses now, it does not make any sense. When seen against the fact that a lot of contact-intensive activities; commercial as well as things like campaigning for elections, are going on like business-as-usual scenario, it seems preposterous that the census should be delayed anymore. This is all the more important because the census is not just about the number of people living in India. It gives us a whole lot of valuable information, from employment, languages spoken and quality of dwelling as well as access to various amenities. Given the fact that a lot of census data is available only after years of completion of the exercise, it makes even more sense to start the process as soon as possible. Consumption Expenditure Survey The Consumption Expenditure Survey (CES) used to be conducted every five years by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). The latest published estimates of the CES go back to 2011-12. That is 10 years back in time. While the NSSO did conduct a CES in 2017-18, the report was scrapped after leaked findings in 2019 suggested a drop in inflation-adjusted average consumption levels. The decision to scrap the report was widely condemned by academics. However, what is even worse is the fact that we do not have clarity when another CES will be conducted and its findings published. The CES is not just about whether or not there was a fall in average consumption levels from one period to another. Given the economic shock of the pandemic, this is now a very likely possibility. It also tells us how consumption baskets of households changes over time, an information which is essential for updating other important economic databases such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket and even the GDP series. To give an example, India’s households consumed a lot more cereals than vegetables a couple of decades ago. Now, if we did not have regular CES data to capture this fact, our inflation numbers would have failed to capture the price burden (or lack of it) on household budgets because they would not have increased the weights of vegetables or reduced that of cereals. Lack of such data is not just a handicap for journalists like us, it also blindsides policy, especially at a time when boosting household demand is an important economic challenge.A socio-economic caste census Political pressures driving policy is often cited as a bane in India. However, its importance as a safety valve of sorts for our democracy cannot be overstated. Caste is one of the biggest routes through which politics has driven policy in India. 2022 is likely to be an eventful year on this count, with a lot of political parties making a demand for conducting a caste census in India, a practice which was abandoned in 1931 by the British. To be sure, the politics is behind such a demand is not driven by some esoteric quest for statistics. It is using this to build a case for breaching the existing 50% cap on reservations by increasing the 27% quota for Other Backward Classes (OBCs). Most survey-based estimates suggest that OBCs account for more than 40% of India’s population. While such data clearly shows that in relative terms, OBCs continue to lag behind the population which does not belong to Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) or OBC groups. However, this is entirely consistent with the possibility that in terms of absolute numbers, the rich among OBC ranks are at par, even greater than their non-SC-ST-OBC counterparts (see https://bit.ly/3JqYbqJ for example). An HT editorial had described the demand for a caste census as something with a “troubling premise and potentially disturbing consequences”, but also an eventuality which “is inevitable now”. Whenever such a census is conducted, and it is likely that 2022 will see concrete movement on this count, it is essential that the exercise looks at the socio-economic traits of each sub-caste in India rather than just doing is a simple head count. This is absolutely essential for an informed overhaul of affirmative action policy in the country.A detailed district-level testing database of the pandemic If there is one count where 2022 already looks ominous, it is on the pandemic front. With the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus spreading rapidly, it looks like we are set for a third nation-wide wave of the pandemic. To be sure, we do not know whether infections from the Omicron variant will be as severe as the ones due to the Delta variant, which, to put it politely, tested the limits of India’s medical infrastructure. If there is one statistic which will answer this question about Omicron, it is consistent availability of hospitalisation across the country.The Hindustan Times newsroom, in line with the best in the world, has tried to analyse the pandemic on the basis of numbers. This endeavour was driven by both government data, as well as public data communities such as Covid19india.org stepping up by creating data sets out of disparate pieces of statistics around the pandemic. Despite these efforts, there continue to be significant gaps in public access to consolidated pandemic statistics. District-wise testing numbers and therefore positivity rates are one such key statistic which we still do not have. More than anything else, it hides the adequacy of testing outside the large urban centers or state capitals, something this story by Abhishek Jha had highlighted vis-à-vis Uttar Pradesh, India’s largest state (https://bit.ly/342HFNn). This is one data the government can make available at the stroke of a pen. And doing this will make our and everybody else’s news coverage of the pandemic far more informed.
