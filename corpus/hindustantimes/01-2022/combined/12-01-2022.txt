Considering the experience from the first and the second wave, Pune is almost three weeks behind Mumbai and its Covid graph is likely to plateau from January end onwards, said Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao. According to Rao, the health experts have predicted Pune’s positivity rate to climb up to 35% from current 21% in the coming days considering the trend seen at Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata though fatalities and hospitalisations will not increase much. Currently, Pune district’s hospitalisation rate for Covid-affected patients stand at 6%. Doctors and public health experts said they have observed that in most cases of Covid patients, lungs are not affected as a result of which fatalities rate is less than 0.01%. He said going by how experts have assessed situation in Mumbai, Pune is likely to reach situation where Mumbai currently is. The current weekly positivity rate in Pune stands at 21% and is likely to move up to 35%. “The Covid situation data collected earlier shows that Pune is three weeks behind Mumbai as far as pace of the infection is concerned,” Rao said. He, however, highlighted that factors like non-adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour by people, the local climatic conditions and demography may also play role in advancing or delaying the peak in the district. The Pune district is currently witnessing over 8,000 cases daily (as of January 12), which is almost double than what was being reported a week ago. Around two weeks ago Pune’s positivity rate was 3 per cent. The positivity rate for the past four to five days has climbed to 21 per cent even as fatalities are under control. “According to experts and administration, we hope to be in better place by second week of March,” he said. As on Wednesday, Pune district recorded 8,261 Covid cases, taking the district’s tally beyond 1.21 million with the death toll increased by two to touch 20,214. Even as the daily case load has increased, the current rate of hospitalisation, which stands at 6 per cent, is low, an indication that most patients are either asymptomatic or suffering from mild infections. “This is a silver lining for us that hospitalisations are under control. At the same time, in most cases, doctors have reported that lungs of Covid-infected patients are not damaged unlike in the second wave,” he said. Rao said if the current situation is compared with the international data, none of the countries’ rate of hospitalisation or criticality has drastically moved in an upward direction. Citing the reasons for less hospitalisation, he said that there are three factors that can be attributed to less hospitalisation. First is Omicron is creating less complications among patients while the second is treatment protocol is improved and evolved and doctors have become more confident. “The third and important factor is public at large, too have gained sufficient confidence and the panic which used to be there, is now less,” he said. Speaking about restrictions in the region, Rao said, the administration is unlikely to impose any additional restrictions when it will review the situation on Friday with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. He said that in the present scenario, both Omicron and Delta are affecting people. “As per the virus behaviour, it is predicted that in the later part of the wave, Omicron will replace Delta completely and the fatality rate may again go down,” he said. When asked whether there is any data on how many critical are infected by Omicron or Delta, he said that so far, the treatment protocol for Omicron and Delta is the same. “But we are not doing genome sequencing to ascertain the variant, but those who are going on ventilators or critical. We are scientifically assuming that it is going to be a Delta variant,” he said.

12-01-2022||Lucknow||BJP loses an MLA to RLD, gets one from Congress in UP’s Jatland||MEERUT The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP) suffered a blow in west UP ahead of the coming state assembly polls, as its disgruntled MLA from Meerapur constituency of Muzaffarnagar Avtar Singh Bhadana announced to join the Rashtriya Lok Dal ( RLD)on Wednesday and contest the election on Jewar seat of Noida. The Congress got a similar jolt as its MLA from Behat seat Naresh Saini defected to the BJP in Delhi. Speaking to HT on phone, Avtar Singh Bhadana said that he decided to quit the BJP because the party hurt the honour of the Gurjar community by creating undue controversy on Gurjar Pratihar Samrat Mihir Bhoj. Bhadana claimed that he would contest on Jewar seat of Noida as an SP-RLD alliance candidate. In a tweet, he also posted his picture during his meeting with RLD chief Jayant Choudhary on Wednesday. He said that he was in politics for honour and self-respect and not for making money or wealth. “ I can’t compromise with honour and respect of Gurjar Samaj and myself. So, I decided to quit the BJP which has been ignoring farmers and our community,” said Bhadana who claimed that he along with his supporters and Samaj worked hard to ensure the victory of the BJP in the previous election. “Hamne Yogi ko jitaya ab harwane ka kaam karenge aur SP- RLD gathbandhan ko jitayenge,” said Bhadana who won the previous election as BJP candidate from Meerapur constituency of Muzaffarnagar. Bhadana was inactive in his constituency for the past three years after failing to get a berth in the Yogi government and resigned as member of the national executive committee of the party. Earlier, former MP of Congress and a prominent Jat leader in western UP Harendra Malik, his former MLA son Pankaj Malik and national secretary Imran Masood had also joined the Samajwadi Party. They all said that in the changed political situation, only Samajwadi Party could defeat the BJP. So, they decided to quit the Congress and joined the SP.Meanwhile, Congress MLA from Behat seat Naresh Saini joined the BJP in Delhi two days after party leader Imran Masood and MLA from Sadar Dehat of Saharanpur Masood Akhtar joined the Samajwadi Party. BJP’s district president in Saharanpur Bijendra Kashyap said that Saini joined the BJP in Delhi in the presence of the party’s state president Swatantra Dev Singh and deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma on Wednesday. MLA Naresh Saini’s phone was switched off. Naresh Saini defeated former MLA and BJP leader Mahaveer Singh in the 2017 assembly elections on Behat seat of Saharanpur amid resounding victory of the party in western UP. Saini was considered a close associate of former Congress leader Imran Masood and Saharanpur was the only district in the region where the Congress won two seats in 2017. Naresh Saini won on Behat seat and Masood Akhtar on Saharanpur Dehat seat. He is also a close aide of Imran Masood. Akhtar joined SP with Imran Masood on Monday but Naresh Saini didn’t open his cards and two days later he decided to join the BJP, leaving Imran Masood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-loses-an-mla-to-rld-gets-one-from-congress-in-up-s-jatland-101642011590415.html

Some sources in the party have indicated that the party may not announce YAD president for Urban-1 as selecting one leader might demoralise the others who will be left behind and the party is not willing to take the risk ahead of assembly elections. The party may appoint the president after elections on the basis of the work carried out during elections.Meanwhile, the SAD district leadership stated that Gosha’s exit will not affect the party.Lambasting Gosha for leaving the party ahead of assembly elections, SAD district president, Harbhajan Singh Dang said there are many other capable youth leaders in YAD and Gosha’s exit will not affect them. He said that discussions are on with the high command and the final decision has to be taken by the high command only. The party will look into the working of these leaders before appointing the new district president. Gosha had joined BJP in Delhi on Tuesday. YAD leaders said he was aspiring for a party ticket in the upcoming elections and had joined the BJP after facing rejection from the SAD high command.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/after-gurdeep-gosha-exit-from-youth-akali-dal-local-leaders-in-ludhiana-scramble-to-clinch-his-post-101642011050398.html
12-01-2022||Lucknow||Will take a final call on my political future tomorrow, says Swami Prasad Maurya||LUCKNOW Supporters wearing red caps replaced those with saffron scarves at bungalow number 14 on Kalidas Marg on Wednesday morning, after UP labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya tendered his resignation from the state cabinet on Tuesday. Located 25 yards from the residence of chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, the official bungalow of Swami Prasad was agog with activities as a large number of his supporters from various districts thronged the place to express their loyalty to him. Hordes of SP leaders and workers sporting red caps raised slogans in support of Maurya. “BJP supporters, who used to assemble in the bungalow, have disappeared within 24 hours. A barrier has been erected on the road leading to deputy CM Keshav Maurya’s bungalow,” said Mahadev Kushwaha, an aide of Swami Prasad Maurya.Maurya was holding closed-door meetings with rebel BJP MLAs to discuss the future course of action. “While three rebel MLAs - Roshan Lal Verma, Brijesh Kumar Prajapti and Bhagwati Sagar resigned from the BJP on Tuesday, others will follow suit after getting a green signal from Mauryaji,” added Kushwaha. Meanwhile, Maurya came out of the meeting to announce that he will make an announcement about his political future on January 14. “It’s an auspicious day when the country celebrates the festival of Makar Sankranti.

Stating that his meeting with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh on Tuesday was warm and cordial, Maurya said: “We had discussions over the current political scenario in UP and plan for the assembly elections. A large number of BJP MLAs are in contact with me. They will soon desert the party.” When asked that the BJP had directed deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya to talk to him and withdraw his resignation, Swami Prasad said: “Backward leaders in the BJP, including Keshav Prasad Mauryam, are sidelined in the party. They should join hands with me in the fight for social justice and rights of weaker sections in society.”

Farmer loses revolver, Canadian dollars to burglarsIn the first case, a gang of burglars stole a .32 bore licensed revolver, 7,100 Canadian Dollars and some cash in Indian currency from a locked house in Golden Avenue on Hambran road. Complainant Sukhdeep Singh, who is a farmer, said that he, along with his family members, had gone out of station when the crime took place.When they came back on Wednesday morning, they were shocked to see the entire house ransacked and immediately sounded the police.Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Gian Singh, the investigating officer, said closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras have captured two masked miscreants entering and escaping the house. A case under Sections 380 (theft), 454 (house breaking) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against unidentified persons.Rishi Nagar house burgled while family was vacationing in ShimlaA Rishi Nagar family that had gone to Shimla to enjoy the snowfall was in for a shock when they returned home. In their absence, thieves broke into the house and took away an LCD, a laptop, a thinkpad, two gold earrings, one pendant, ₹5,000 and other valuables.Complainant Munish Kumar of Rishi Nagar said he, along with his family, had left for Shimla on January 8. When they returned on Tuesday night, they found the entire house ransacked. He said the burglars seem to have entered the house after breaking open the grilles of a window on the second floor. Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Gian Singh said a case has been registered and cops are scanning CCTV cameras to identify the accused.

12-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: Samajwadi Party grapples with problem of plenty ahead of ticket distribution||Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav had declared his intent to form alliances with smaller parties, instead of the major players, over 14 months before the scheduled for the UP (Uttar Pradesh) polls was announced. He had made the announcement at his ancestral village Saifai in Etawah district the day before Diwali in November 2020.“No alliance with any big parties. The experience with the big parties on both occasions was bitter (The SP had tied up with the Congress in the 2017 assembly polls and the BSP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections without much success). Only small, regional parties. And anyone and everyone from other parties is welcome to join the SP,” he had said.The influx had begun a few months before with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) former minister Ghura Ram in July 2020. Since then, inductions from all the major political parties into the Samajwadi Party have increased for the UP polls.Commenting on the trend, Akhilesh had said about three months ago: “The Samajwadi Party never had such a beeline (of leaders from other parties) in its entire history and more are waiting to join it.”This trend lies at the root of the party’s problem of plenty when it comes to the number of ticket aspirants and probable candidates for the 2022 UP polls.In October 2020, as advance preparations for the polls, the Samajwadi Party formally announced an application process, asking ticket seekers to send in their applications. Despite the already overwhelming response to the process, the deadline of January 26, 2021 was extended till August 2021. The SP has received nearly 7000 applications for tickets for the 2022 polls.Yet, till Wednesday (January 12) morning, the SP had not declared even a single list despite the election dates having already been announced on January 8.Never before in its history has the SP delayed the process to this extent.Although the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress always begin declaring their candidates after the poll announcement, the SP has never done so in the past.The Samajwadi Party had declared its first list of candidates for the 2012 UP assembly polls as early as March 2011 and for the 2017 elections in April 2016. Of course, the party kept on modifying the lists. This tradition was in sync with the party’s then national president Mulayam Singh Yadav’s strategy to give the candidates a headstart in their constituencies.“Never before did the SP have such support of people and parties across the regions of UP. People are so anti-BJP and know that the SP is going to displace the BJP. The candidates’ selection process is on. It’s only a matter of time that the lists would start coming,” said Samajwadi Party national secretary and spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary.The SP’s problem of plenty of ticket seekers has two elements — one related to the alliances and the other has emerged due to individual leaders (MLAs, ex-MLAs, former legislators, ministers) who have joined from the other parties.The Samajwadi Party has allied with the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L), the Mahan Dal, the Janwadi Party (Socialist), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in Uttar Pradesh.The SP chief on Wednesday held a three-hour meeting with the heads of these parties. This was the SP’s first joint meeting with all the alliance partners.After the meeting, Mahan Dal chief Keshav Dev Maurya said: “It was a very harmonious meeting. We also had a wonderful breakfast together and strategised. The seats (of the SP and alliance partners) for the first and the second phases of the polls will be announced in a day or two.”The SP, according to the alliance talks, is likely to keep 350 of the total 403 seats with itself and distribute the remaining 53 seats among the alliance partners in the east, west, Rohilkhand, and Ccntral UP. The SP will keep all the 19 Bundelkhand seats to itself.“About 36 seats will be given to the RLD, about 10 to the SBSP, nearly six to the PSP-L and the rest will be distributed among the other partners,” said a senior party leader privy to the developments over the alliances.Hours after the meeting, the Samajwadi Party (SP) named Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader KK Sharma as first candidate for the UP assembly elections. “NCP leader KK Sharma will contest Bulandshahr’s Anupshahr constituency (number 67) as the joint candidate of SP-NCP,” the SP said.The RLD and the PSP-L are looking for more seats. The RLD, people aware of the matter, said also wants two seats in eastern UP, though it is basically a western UP party.So far, 10 BSP and four BJP MLAs have joined the SP ahead of the polls. Five more BJP MLAs, including Swami Prasad Maurya who quit the Yogi cabinet on Tuesday (January 11), are all set to join Akhilesh’s party. The SP is likely to field most of these turncoats. There are a large number of former MLAs, ex-MPs, former ministers and ex-senior office bearers from other parties who have joined the SP in the last two years.This heavy influx of leaders from the other parties and alliance partnerships would deprive many of the SP’s original leaders the opportunity to contest the polls on nearly 80 seats. This has triggered a bit of dissatisfaction among the SP cadres and also those leaders who have recently entered the party as not all the new entrants will get the ticket.When Akhilesh had invited applications from the aspirants for the polls, he had put a rider that no application will be accepted for the 47 seats that the SP had won in 2017 as the party is likely to take a call on these seats separately. This way, the SP has prevented any heartburn among the sitting MLAs of the party.On alliances, the SP also has made a deal on some seats with the alliance partners to field SP candidates.As for the turncoats, only those will be given tickets who have their own support base (Dalit, Muslim, backwards etc) to add to the SP’s strength, said a senior SP leader.So, what about the ticket seekers from among the SP’s homegrown leaders and those who joined it from other parties?“Akhilesh has not promised tickets to all while they joined the party. However, Akhileshji has been always saying that “sabko samman milega (all will get respect). So as you know, the UP assembly seats are not the only option for such deserving aspirants (who would not get the ticket) and the turncoats. The party has told them they will be accommodated in other ways — Rajya Sabha membership, UP Legislative Council membership, chairmanship of various boards of the UP government (minister rank positions), senior party positions and tickets for the next Lok Sabha polls ,” said a senior SP functionary.Prof SK Dwivedi, a political analyst and former head of the department of political sciences, Lucknow University, said, “So far as I have observed, Akhilesh Yadav had been behaving in a mature manner. Unlike other parties, the SP, so far, has not shown any major panic. At least, it has not surfaced yet. Disgruntlement will be there as any alliance partner would want more and more share while all aspirants would like to contest. These are not new problems for any political party that is resurgent. Let’s see how things unfold. The battle certainly has revved up and the UP elections will not be one-sided this time unlike 2017.” However, even as the UP poll scene appears to have become electrified now, an SP MLA from Sirsaganj (Firozabad) Hariom Singh Yadav joined the BJP. Soon after, the SP expelled him for six years from the party.

12-01-2022||Pune||140,000 students’ forms not forwarded by colleges with SPPU exams set for Feb 15||PUNE As the state government has closed down colleges and university campuses till February 15 due to the Covid pandemic, preparations for conducting online exams has begun at the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). One of the major issues which SPPU’s examination department is facing is a delay in the inward process of the movement of examination forms by colleges. Of a total 850,000 students across streams, only 500,006 students have filled the forms, and colleges have forwarded 361,434 forms. Over 300,000 students are yet to fill the forms. Colleges do not forward the exam form to the SPPU if a student has not paid his/her fees. Now the SPPU examination department has set a deadline of January 15 for all its affiliated colleges in Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar district to forward all the exam forms. “We have been taking continuous follow up and instructing the colleges to forward the examination forms submitted by the students immediately. Still a large number of forms have not yet forward by colleges. This delays the entire examination process, as only after all the filled-up forms are in can we start to schedule the examinations as per courses and subjects. There are 6,862 subjects for 284 courses with the university and its affiliated courses. To set up the papers and carry out the examination process preparations, it takes 15 to 20 days,” said Mahesh Kakade, SPPU examination and evaluation department head. “So we have not given a deadline of January 15 to all the colleges to forward the available to the university, so we can start our further process of scheduling the exam dates. Most probably the examinations would start from February 15 and its detailed schedule will soon be declared on the universityofficial website,” added Kakade. On other hand students are facing many difficulties to appear for the semester exams. Kedar Mande, a Commerce student said, “My father passed away due to Covid last year and we are suffering financially. I cannot afford to pay college fees for this year, but want to appear for the examination. We will pay the college fees in installments, but my exam form has not yet been forwarded by the college.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/140000-students-forms-not-forwarded-by-colleges-with-sppu-exams-set-for-feb-15-101642010030207.html
12-01-2022||Pune||MSRTC staff firm on strike, 73 days and counting...||The striking workers of Maharashtra State Transport Corporation (MSRTC) division are firm on not resuming duty, even after several attempts by the state government to placate them, the latest being a meeting between transport minister Anil Parab, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and the transport body unions. For the past 73 days, MSRTC workers have been on strike over the primary demand of urging the transport body becoming a state government department, a possibility the government has refuted citing the financial burden. As workers have refused to toe the line taken by unions, the MSRTC and the government has also decided to take a tough stand. The MSRTC management has began hiring drivers on contract, while also offering jobs to the retired staff to enable more buses to get on the streets. “Not many workers have joined work in the last one week and still there is a shortage of drivers and conductors in the division. Although we have started contract bus operations for Shivneri and Shivshahi buses, for normal ST buses to run in full swing we have now started the process of getting contract drivers from the appointed agencies,” said Ramakant Gaikwad, MSRTC Pune’s divisional controller. The most crucial part of the agitation has been that striking workers have refused to be part of any union, all of which are affiliated to different political parties. “The state transport department has appointed four agencies to provide contract drivers on a daily basis and initially, daily, eight divisions will be given 100 drivers each to start the service from Sunday. Accordingly, we have now started bus operations on various routes with contract drivers. Each driver will be given a salary of around ₹20,000 per month and these drivers are in eight divisions - Pune, Nagpur, Bhandara, Dhule, Jalgaon, Nashik, Aurangabad and Solapur,” added Gaikwad. For the last two months MSRTC workers and several unions are protesting various demands. A Kruti Samiti of unions was formed earlier to have a conversation with the state government. Apparently, the main demand of merging the MSRTC into state government was compromised, according to workers, so now workers (apart from union members) are on strike. To support the state government, private tourist bus associations gave 2,000 buses to be used across the state, operating from state transport depots. Sandeep Jagdale, an MSRTC driver said, “We had a meeting of all the workers who are still participating in the strike. Though we all are suffering financially there is a lot of anger against the state government. Till the merger process is not done we will continue to fight and remain on strike.” Action in Pune divisionIn MSRTC’s Pune division, a total of 1,300 workers of the 4,200 workers have resumed work. Show cause notices has been served to 69 workers After three rounds of inquiry hearing, these will be dismissed if the do not resume duty. Pune division has suspended 488 workers, of which 66 workers have since rejoined work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msrtc-staff-firm-on-strike-73-days-and-counting-101642009491987.html

12-01-2022||Mumbai||State cabinet approves property tax waiver for houses of up to 500 sq ft in Mumbai||Mumbai Weeks ahead of the civic polls, the state cabinet approved the proposal to waive off property tax for 1.61 million flats of up to 500 square feet in Mumbai and suburbs. Cumulatively, the waiver will save ₹462 crore for the citizens. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had on January 1 announced waiver of entire property tax for the smaller houses below the size of 45.45 sq mt or 500 sqft.The decision came amid criticism of the partial waiver announced by the previous Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena coalition ahead of the Brihnamumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections in 2017. The previous Devendra Fadnavis government, in consultation with the Shiv Sena led-BMC in 2019, had announced the wavier of only the general tax component of the property tax, drawing criticism for alleged half-hearted implementation of the poll manifesto.The decision of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government’s cabinet also comes after the Opposition had raised the issue during the Winter Session held in December.“The decision taken by the CM on January 1 received the state cabinet nod on Wednesday. The government has already issued a gazette notification last week. It will be applicable for the flats in BMC jurisdiction,” said an official from the urban development department.BMC collects ₹4,000-5,000 crore in property tax annually, of which ₹462 crore, including ₹45 crore of state government’s share, come from smaller flats.The property tax has eight components, including general tax, education cess, water tax, sewerage tax, tree cess and water benefit tax.While the previous Sena-BJP government had waived off only general tax (around 30% of the total property tax), the new decision will result in a complete waiver of the property tax, which ranges between ₹5,000 and 12,000 per flat per annum.Announcing the waiver on January 1, CM Thackeray had said, “We have fulfilled most of our promises made during 2017 BMC polls and this one is another important promise being fulfilled.”There are 4,00,000 housing societies in Mumbai. BMC individually issues property tax bills to flat owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-cabinet-approves-property-tax-waiver-for-houses-of-up-to-500-sq-ft-in-mumbai-101642007450056.html
12-01-2022||Bangalore||Cong’s Mekedatu march banned, orders Karnataka govt after high court rebuke||BENGALURU: Karnataka’s Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday ‘prohibited’ with immediate effect any participation in the ongoing Mekedatu Padayatra by the Congress hours after the Karnataka high court pulled up the government for its inaction. In its order on Wednesday evening, the government said that “all, inter-district (within Karnataka) and intra-district (within Ramanagara), movement of vehicles and persons for participating in “Nama Neeru Namma Hakku” padayatra, or whichever name it is called with similar purpose from Mekedatu to Bengaluru, is prohibited with immediate effect and will be in force until further order for strict implementation by all Deputy Commissioners, Superintendents of Police, all Police Commissioners of the State.”The order comes after the Bommai-led administration was sharply criticised by the high court for inaction against the Congress and its padayatra with hundreds and thousands of people at a time when Covid-19 infections across the state have seen a steep and scary rise.“The transport commissioner is directed to take adequate measures to implement this order and aid the district administrations and police commissioners of the state. Any person violating these measures will be liable to be proceeded against as per the provisions of Section 5l to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, besides legal action under Section l88 of the IPC, and other legal provisions as applicable,” the state government’s order said.The government also said that the Congress, in an “act of defiance, is endangering lives of large number of people.”The Congress started the march from January 9 to pressure the government into initiating works to construct the contentious Mekedatu reservoir-cum-drinking water project.“The protest/padayatra is likely to aggravate already worsening Covid-19 situation in the state. The state government is satisfied that the current circumstance requires stringent enforcement of Covid-19 behaviour and prevent large gatherings in protests, rallies, padayatra, etc, to break the chain of transmission of Covid-19 in the State,” according to the government order.The Congress has so far heeded to no threats and continued its march despite several participants testing positive.Congress state president DK Shivakumar also challenged the government to take action as the march itself promises rich political dividends for the part and him personally in the Old Mysuru region or Vokkaliga belt ahead of crucial zlla and taluka panchayat elections which can help indicate the prospects in 2023 assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/congs-mekedatu-march-banned-orders-karnataka-govt-after-high-court-rebuke-101642007389805.html
12-01-2022||Patna||Bihar Council polls: Cong awaits word from Delhi after RJD offer of tie-up||Congress leaders in Bihar said they were waiting for a word from the party high command to resolve the coalition issue with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) ahead of the impending election for 24 Legislative Council seats the state. The alliance between the two parties was all but broken during the bypolls for two seats of the state assembly in October last year, when both contested in two seats against each other. Soon after the election results, which saw both losing Tarapur (in Munger) and Kusheshwar Asthan (in Samastipur) out to the ruling Janata Dal (United), RJD chief Lalu Prasad had announced that the coalition with the Congress would continue. Talking about Council elections, likely in February-March, Prasad had hinted that the Congress would be offered 7-8 seats while Chirag Paswan faction of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and left parties could be allowed to field nominees on 1-2 seats under the alliance. While the RJD had already finalised candidates for seven-eight seats, Congress is showing little urgency. “The issue of coalition rests with the party high command. We are waiting for their word to engage in talks with the RJD,” said Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha. A senior Congress leader said RJD’s de facto leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had talked to Jha to discuss the seat-sharing issues on Monday, but it could not happen. “Elections have not announced yet. We have enough time resolve the seat-sharing formula and finalise candidates, who have already started their preparations on all seats they are comfortable with,” Jha said. Last time, Congress had contested four seats — Bettiah, Saharsa, Katihar and Purnia — and won only Bettiah local bodies’ seat. However, winner Rajesh Ram switched sides and joined JD(U). Likewise, RJD had won four seats — Munger, Vaishali, Arrah and Sitamarhi — in the biennial elections held in 2015. However, three of its winning leaders, Sanjay Prasad, Radha Charan Seth and Dilip Rai, quit the party ahead of 2020 assembly polls. Only Subodh Rai, who won from Vaishali seat, remained loyal to the party. Soon after elections for Panchayati Raj institutions (PRIs), the state election commission had sent its recommendation to the Election Commission of India to conduct the polls for 24 Legislative Council seats of the local bodies’ constituencies, which have been vacant since July 16 last year when the six-year tenure of the elected representatives expired. The elections to these seats could not be conducted owing to the delay in reconstitution of the PRIs. 
12-01-2022||Patna||Bihar govt defends move to honour CM’s father on Jan 17 every year||Amid opposition from some quarters, Bihar’s chief secretary Amir Subhani has justified the state government’s recent decision to hold a state function at Bakhtiyarpur in Nalanda district on January 17 every year to honour five freedom fighters from the area, which includes chief minister Nitish Kumar’s father Kaviraj Ram Lakhan Singh “Vaidya”.Bakhtiyarpur is the native place of Kumar. “The cabinet decision mentions not only late Kaviraj Ram Lakhan Singh, but also four others, whose participation in the freedom struggle is well known locally. The cabinet took a decision which is appropriate ,” Subhani told HT on Wednesday.On January 5 this year, the state cabinet had passed a resolution declaring that a state function would be held near the statues of all five eminent freedom fighters — CM’s father Ram Lakhan Singh, Sheel Bhadra Yajee, Mogal Singh, Shaheed Natun Prasad Yadav and Doomar Prasad Singh — near their statues at Bakhtiyarpur on January 17 every year.On January 17 last year, Governor Phagu Chouhan had unveiled life size statues of the five freedom fighters at different places in Bakhtiyarpur.The reasons behind choosing January 17 as the day are not very clear.Asked if Kumar’s father drew the pension meant for freedom fighters, Subhani said it was not a yardstick for somebody to be recognised or being honoured as a freedom fighter. “There are many prominent freedom fighters who never took pension,” he said. In the past, CM Kumar has talked about how he, as a student, would often listen about the freedom struggle from his father who was a freedom fighter and also an Ayurvedic practitioner “Vaidya”. CM father was also in Congress for a long time. After the cabinet decision, former Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Amitabh Kumar Das sent a letter to Governor Phagu Chauhan, urging him to seek a detailed report from the state government about Kaviraj Ram Lakhan Singh’s contribution in the freedom struggle. “I have also filed an RTI (right to information) application seeking details from the prison department as and when Singh was in jail and in which prison he was lodged and under what charges,” Das said. “I have been a student of history and I have done extensive study on Indian freedom struggle. But there is no mention of Singh as freedom fighter,” he said. Das, an IPS officer of 1994 batch, was given compulsory retirement in 2018. Over the past few years, he has made several allegations against top politicians, including the chief minister. Das had returned his police medal to the President of India Ramnath Kovind when there was a move to demolish a part of the historic Khuda Baksh library in Patna for the proposed elevated road on Ashok Rajpath. The elevated road’s alignment was later altered. Meanwhile, chief secretary Subhani said the government would definitely give a reply to the RTI query on the contribution of Ram Lakhan Singh in freedom struggle if it has been submitted.
12-01-2022||Patna||Council polls: BJP no to 50:50 sharing; says 13 seats belonged to BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has shot down the proposal by ally Janata Dal (United) in Bihar that both parties contest an equal number of seats in the upcoming elections for 24 seats in the state’s Legislative Council, likely to be held in February or March. “First and foremost, BJP central parliamentary committee will take a final decision on the matter. Secondly, and most importantly, of the 24 seats falling vacant, 13 were of BJP,” state BJP president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said on Wednesday. On Tuesday, JD(U)’s parliamentary board chairman and former union minister Upendra Kushwaha had demanded an equal share of seats for the Council elections.Deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad, who is from BJP, on Wednesday said Kushwaha’s statement had no significance. “The top leadership will decide and fix the electoral formula.” he said.Kushwaha had cited the formula adopted by the two allies during the 2020 assembly polls, when JD (U) got 122 seats and BJP 121, of which they adjusted smaller allies like VIP and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi’s party Hindustan Awam Morcha (HAM). Kushwaha on Tuesday also demanded a share for the two smaller constituents of NDA. However, a senior BJP leader familiar with the developments, said, “Our party is unlikely to adjust HAM-S and VIP.“We will rethink our strategy if our demands are not met,” said HAM-S spokesperson Danish Rizwan. VIP president and minister Mukesh Sahni said his party has demanded four Council seats. “It is up to BJP. There is no pressure. If we are not adjusted, we might contest on all 24 seats,” he said.

12-01-2022||Patna||Delay in proposal for 7th UGC pay reimbursements costs Bihar ₹383 cr||The Bihar government has suffered a financial loss of ₹383.50 crore, as it could not ensure timely submission of proposal and requisite documents to avail reimbursement of central share in lieu of implementation of the seventh UGC pay scale in the state, officials familiar with the matter said.The last date submission to the union ministry of human resource development (HRD) was March 31, 2021, when the scheme expired.Though the government had blamed Covid pandemic and the lockdown as reasons for delay, it was not accepted.Bihar’s former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who is currently a Rajya Sabha member, said he had also raised the issue in the Upper House, but union minister of state for education Dr Subhash Sarkar said the scheme had been closed.“The central government had decided to reimburse the financial burden due to implementation of revised pay scales on the basis of 7th Pay Commission recommendations for teachers and equivalent cadres in universities and colleges to all states wishing to adopt and implement the scheme. The reimbursement to be made was for the period from January 1, 2016, till March 31, 2019. The state governments needed to furnish necessary documents i.e. notification/ order issued by the state government for implementation of the scheme of revision of pay, undertaking of the amount released by the state government, copies of amended statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, etc. of state universities for reimbursement of the central share by the central government,” he said.Modi said the last date for submission of complete documents for reimbursement under the scheme was March 31 2021. “The Bihar government had submitted a proposal for reimbursement of central share amounting Rs. 383.53 crore on account of implementation of revised pay scales of teachers and equivalent cadres. However, the complete proposals along with the requisite documents, as per the norms of the scheme, could not be received in the MHRD within the stipulated time i.e. before last date of the expiry of the scheme on March 31 2021,” he said.State’s higher education council vice chairman Kameshwar Jha said the Nitish Kumar cabinet had notified the new 7th UGC pay scale much in advance and also made payments to serving teachers and employees, but the submission of desired documents to the HRD ministry for reimbursement got delayed at the level of the directorate.“The government is also working to clear the arrears of the pensioners and it will also happen soon. But yes, the delay has hurt Bihar financially,” he said.However, in Magadh University, even widows, who lost their husbands to Covid-19, having been waiting for regularisation of pension for over six months while other pensioners are awaiting payment, as the university does not have a registrar after the arrest of the incumbent PK Verma last year along with three other senior officials in connection with a corruption case. Verma was also holding the additional charge of registrar at the Aryabhatt Knowledge University (AKU), where a temporary arrangement was made earlier this week.MU vice-chancellor Bibhuti Narayan Singh said that soon after the arrest of the registrar, he had requested the Raj Bhawan for a replacement, as pension and salary payment had also got stuck. “Later, I was asked to send a panel and I sent three names. On Tuesday, Raj Bhawan notified JP University (Chapra) registrar Ravi Prakash ‘Bablu’ as the temporary arrangement in MU until further orders. Once he joins, things will proceed,” he said.

12-01-2022||Lucknow||Purvanchal: Crucial region has changed political colour every election in Uttar Pradesh||Ten districts of the crucial Purvanchal (east UP) region have kept changing political colour since the 2007 assembly election, each time going on to support the eventual winner in the assembly polls.A strong performance in the region is a lucky charm for political parties, observers say. These 10 districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh have 61 assembly seats.The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) won 37 seats in 2007, the Samajwadi Party (SP) 33 in 2012 and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) 35 in 2017 as the region travelled through different political shades from blue to red, and then red to saffron over the last 15 years. Once again, eastern Uttar Pradesh is in focus, this time for the 2022 assembly elections. While the ruling BJP is leaving no stone unturned to retain the Purvanchal region, the main opposition Samajwadi Party is on its toes to restore the political ground that it lost in 2017.Past statistics say whichever party the majority of eastern UP supported in successive assembly elections since 2007 has formed the government in Uttar Pradesh.This trend started in the 2007 assembly election in which the voters of Purvanchal (eastern UP) supported the BSP that won 37 seats in the region and 206 seats overall, four seats above the magic figure of 202 needed to form the government.That year, the SP won 18 seats in the region and the BJP just four. However, the BSP couldn’t maintain its bond with the people of this region and others for five years as it fell short of the people’s expectations, local people say.“We thought there would be development in rural pockets across the state, but it didn’t happen,” says Santosh Rai, resident of Ghazipur. Suresh Yadav and Durga Chaurasia, two other residents of Ghazipur, echoed similar sentiments. Chaurasia said during the BSP’s tenure, city-centric development happened, that too was focused on Lucknow and Noida. People’s disenchantment with the BSP became an opportunity for the Samajwadi Party which worked at the grassroots level to win their support.As a result, the SP wrested most of the seats from the BSP in the 2012 election to win 33 seats in the region, including nine in the SP stronghold Azamgarh alone. The BSP’s tally in eastern UP shrank to eight seats and the BJP’ increased to 11 seats (in 2012). The Congress won three seats. Independents bagged three seats, the Quami Ekta Dal two seats and the Apna Dal one seat. With 224 seats, including 33 from eastern UP, the SP formed a full majority government in UP. But by the time the SP government completed its five-year tenure, majority of the voters started looking for an alternative due to several reasons like rising crime rate and preference to two communities, say Omprakash Pandey, resident of Naseerabad village in Ballia.The majority of eastern Uttar Pradesh voters turned to the BJP in 2017 and the party won 34 of the region’s 61 seats. Its allies Apna Dal (Sonelal) bagged four and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) three seats. Together with its allies, the BJP registered a resounding victory on 41 seats, while the SP’s tally shrank to 12 and the BSP’s to 7. The BJP alone won 312 seats in Uttar Pradesh and formed the government. Its allies won 13 more. One of them, the SBSP led by Om Prakash Rajbhar, parted ways with the BJP after the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Excluding the SP stronghold Azamgarh, the BJP performed well in 2017 in the Purvanchal region’s all other nine districts —Varanasi, Mirzapur, Bhadohi, Chandauli, Ghazipur, Sonbhadra, Jaunpur, Mau and Ballia.The SP failed to open its account in Mirzapur, Bhadohi and Sonbhadra and Varanasi, the BJP stronghold, in 2017.Thus, the BJP’s tally in the region went up from four in 2007 to 34 in 2017. This time, too, the BJP is leaving nothing to chance. It has worked at the grassroots to strengthen its organisation and held hundreds of meetings with the party workers in the last over 70 days in Purvanchal. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Varanasi thrice from October 25 to December 23 and launched various developmental projects. In addition, Union home minister Amit Shah also visited Varanasi twice since November 12 and held meetings with his party office bearers.It clearly indicates the BJP would like to repeat its performance in eastern UP as the road to power passes through this region, says political analyst Kaushal Kishore Mishra, professor at the department of political science.Will eastern UP be painted saffron again?Mishra says, “The majority of eastern UP voters love all colours. In 2007, they strongly supported blue (the colour of the BSP’s flag) and then they gave a chance to red (the SP has a red-green flag and its workers wear red caps). In 2017, they supported the BJP, which is also called saffron party by its political opponents. As of now, I can tell you that saffron has become quite vibrant.”Veteran socialist Vijay Narayan Singh says Ballia, Ghazipur, and Varanasi gave several socialist leaders like Raj Narain, former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, SP leader the late Janeshwar Mishra, among others.“The socialist movement flourished in this region, but it has lost sheen at present because the people who claim to be socialists want to live a leisurely and lavish life,” he says.

The annual Magh Mela is set to start at the banks of Sangam from January 14/15.To start with, Magh Mela police fined six of their own men, on Wednesday.These included five constables and one woman head constable, informed officials. “We want to give a clear message to everyone coming to Magh Mela area that they have to strictly comply with the set norms in view of Covid-19 pandemic and setting an example, we thought of correcting our home first and thus six of our own police personnel were fined for not wearing masks,” said superintendent of police, Magh Mela, Rajiv Narayan Mishra.

The SP Magh Mela further added that police personnel are repeatedly appealing to seers, devotees and visitors coming to mela area to wear facemask and follow all the set norms laid down under Covid-19 protocols. However, making people aware and request has to go along with a deterrent and fining the offenders is one such step, added Mishra.

12-01-2022||Lucknow||Prayagraj region: Heart of Uttar Pradesh vital for all parties in poll race||The Bharatiya Janata Party, which won 13 of the 22 assembly seats in the Prayagraj region in 2017 will look to continue its sway this time too. Besides, three seats are with its ally Apna Dal.The region comprising the three districts of Prayagraj, Pratapgarh and Kaushambi is the heart of Uttar Pradesh just as geographically UP is the heart of India. It is also the gateway to the eastern part of the state.The BSP has two, the SP and Congress one each and Independents have two in the region.Among the three districts, Prayagraj is the biggest. It has 12 assembly seats. The city of Prayagraj is on way to getting transformed into to a smart city in the next few years. Located on the banks of the Triveni Sangam, the Ganga Jamuni (composite) culture of this place is much discussed in intellectual circles.Prayagraj, regarded as politically, socially and academically conscious, has given many Prime Ministers, Union ministers, governors, top bureaucrats, historians and judges of international repute and litterateurs to the nation.The 2022 assembly polls are witnessing a key thrust on development, condition of health infrastructure, and women empowerment to name a few, in a marked shift from earlier elections in Uttar Pradesh, where political parties played primarily on caste and community with promises of development thrown in between.Community, caste, price rise, unemployment and crime have not lost their importance in the elections.“For the BJP, the region is significant as three state ministers—Rajendra Pratap “Moti” Singh (Patti in Pratapgarh), Nand Gopal Gupta “Nandi” (Allahabad South in Prayagraj) and Sidharth Nath Singh (Allahabad West in Prayagraj) —will seek re-election from here in 2022 too. Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, who is currently an MLC, had won Kaushambi’s Sirathu seat in 2012. It was the BJP’s first ever victory there. This time, he will strive to ensure that all three seats of Kaushambi are retained by his party. Currently, BJP has Sheetla Prasad as the sitting MLA from Sirathu, besides Lal Bahadur from Manjhanpur and Sanjay Kumar Gupta from Chail,” said political scientist Prof MP Dube, former vice-chancellor of Uttar Pradesh Rajarshi Tandon Open University (UPRTOU).If the BJP fails to match or better its tally in the Prayagraj region from the existing 13 seats (16 including three seats of ally Apna Dal), it could be seen as the loss of Keshav’s influence in the region, he maintains.Dube said that it was no mere coincidence that top BJP leaders including PM Narendra Modi, Union road transport minister and highways minister Nitin Gadkari, chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya have inaugurated and laid foundation stone of hundreds of development projects worth over ₹8,700 crore in the region in December and January.The region is no less vital for other parties, says another political commentator Prof Badri Narayan , director of Govind Ballabh Pant Social Science Institute (GBPSSI), Prayagraj.“Out of the 19 seats that BSP won across the state in 2017—two including Pratappur (where its candidate Mohd Mujtaba Siddqui won) and Handia (from where its candidate Hakim Lal Bind won)—fall in this very region. The importance of these two seats for the BSP can be gauged from the fact that in eastern UP, BSP won just 8 out of the 102 seats on offer in 2017,” he said. The region is prestigious for the Congress also as it traditionally was once a party bastion and is the hometown of the Nehru-Gandhi family, he says.“Currently, it has a mere one seat (Rampur Khas in Pratapgarh from where Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhana Misra is the sitting MLA). This one seat was among just seven that Congress had managed to win in 2017 in UP,” he added.The region also has former UP cabinet minister Raghuraj Pratap Singh’s assembly seat Kunda in Pratapgarh from where he has been winning non-stop from 1993 onwards, including for the sixth time in 2017.As for the issues, Navin C Agarwal, senior chartered accountant of Prayagraj, believes that for development of any economy, inflation and subsequent price rise is a necessity.“This is the reason since 1951, all the budgets presented by Central and state governments have witnessed increase in outlays. To grow the economy, the government has to increase the spending and to garner proportionate revenue to support that spending, price rise is a must,” he says.He particularly appreciates the efforts of the Central government in upgrading technology by which direct account transfer is happening now, removing human interface and weeding out corruption from the system.Referring to the Income Tax Act, he says that with the use of technology, suitable amendments have been made to remove the interface with the department by introducing faceless assessment and faceless first appeal. Further, he suggests that the government take appropriate steps to transfer benefits directly to the farmers, so that the role of middlemen is cut and that the income of the farmers can increase.Silky Biswas, a homemaker, raised concerns over the skyrocketing prices of cooking gas, edible oils and vegetables within the last year and a half. The household income did not see much increase during this period as markets opened intermittently. Steep rise in prices has disturbed the monthly budget of the family, she claims.“As it is, we are fighting the coronavirus and price rise. We have to now cut down on consumption of essentials,” she says.Brijesh Kumar Shukla, a government job aspirant hailing from Pratapgarh, expresses his disappointment with the working of Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC). He also says nothing has changed in the last five years.“In fact, a CBI inquiry was initiated earlier but no concrete report has come out in public domain. UPPSC exams are still not held as per the time published calendar and results too are not declared on time. Due to this delay, the student fraternity loses time, energy and money,” he claims.Another youth Rajesh Kumar Srivastava, who is preparing in Prayagraj for competitive exams, says ,“Kaushambi is an international tourism destination for followers of Jains and Buddhism all over the world. Many youths can get self-employed in the field of tourism, handicrafts but lack of infrastructure development is forcing even educated youth of this region to take up daily wage-earning jobs in big cities to make ends meet.”Saurabh Srivastava, an Allahabad high court lawyer, says a clear picture is yet to emerge on the future over the shifting of the tribunal offices out of Prayagraj.“Earlier, the government wanted to shift them but due to massive agitation withheld it for time being. If in future the government does so, it will hurt the dignity of the city and impact the smooth operational functioning of the court,” he says.Also, Saurabh says he fails to understand as to why during each election season, the leaders talk of establishing a bench in western UP. He is aggrieved at what he calls the failure of the law enforcement institutions to give protection to lawyers who have fallen victim to attacks.

Seeks tractor or trailer as a poll symbol The SSM has given three options --- a tractor, tractor-trailer or trailer --- to the Election Commission of India (ECI) for the allotment of election symbol. Bhangu said these symbols are the icons of successful agitation led by farmers for the repeal of three laws. Meanwhile, the Joginder Singh Ugrahan-led BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) on Wednesday decided to launch a campaign after the January 15 meeting of the Samyukt Kisan morcha, to educate the people, particularly the farmers, about the election process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-ssm-declares-10-candidates-rajewal-to-fight-from-samrala-101642003309998.html
12-01-2022||Mumbai||Animals, birds charred to death in fire at pets shop in Kalyan||Several animals and birds kept for sale in a pets shop died after a fire broke out in the shop at Rambaug locality of Kalyan (W) on Wednesday at around 8am.As soon as the fire officials learnt about it, a team reached the spot and initiated fire fighting operations. The shops had parakeets, rabbits, cats and lovebirds among others.“We also managed to rescue some of the birds and animals. However, many were charred in the fire. The cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained,” said an officer of the fire department, KDMC.In Rambaug, there are several small shops where the birds and animals are kept for sale. Though illegal, the trade has been in operation for many years. Several people visit these shops on a daily basis.The fire officials claimed that the fire might have ignited due to a short circuit. “We suspect there was a short circuit in the shop that led to the fire. No one was injured in the incident,” said the officer.Following the fire incident, the founder of Plants and Animals welfare society (PAWS) has demanded legal action against the shops selling animals and birds without permission.“There is a need to take strict action against such shops. These shops operate without any license and are illegal. They cannot be allowed to operate,” said Nilesh Bhanage, president of PAWS.
12-01-2022||Mumbai||Aaditya Thackeray asks CIDCO, JNPT to expedite process of transferring mangroves to Forest Dept||Reacting to the environmentalists’ concerns on the delay in various government agencies transferring mangroves to the Forest Department for conservation, Maharashtra Environment Minister, Aaditya Thackeray, has asked CIDCO and JNPT to expedite the process.Thackeray held a review meeting on Tuesday and took stock of the record of transfer of mangroves. He asked the agencies specifically to speed up the process for conserving mangroves as reserve forests under the Indian Forest Act.Thackeray tweeted: “Conducted review meetings with the officials of the Forest Department, JNPT, CIDCO, and Divisional Commissioner for Palghar, Mumbai Suburban, Thane, Raigad, Ratnagiri & Sindhudurg to expedite the pending final notification for the mangroves under the Indian Forest Act.”Welcoming the development, NatConnect Foundation director, BN Kumar, said the government, and the forest department in particular, must also take over the mangroves under Navi Mumbai SEZ that have been since denotified. The inordinate delay in implementing the three-year-old High Court order to conserve the mangroves is only giving an opportunity to destroy the sea plants for creating dry areas for land-grab, Kumar pointed out in his tweet to Thackeray.JNPT has 900 hectares of mangroves that are supposed to be handed over to the Forest Department. NMSEZ is developing at least 4,000 acres in Dronagiri alone, he said. “We have been complaining to various authorities against the destruction by various project proponents, apart from the debris mafia, but no action has been taken,” said Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan.Kharghar-based activist, Naresh Chandra Singh, regretted that the node does not seem to exist on the radar of any government agency as all complaints from the citizen groups have fallen on deaf ears.It is important to keep an eagle’s eye on the mangroves even after the forest department takes over. In the absence of any surveillance, the land grabbers will have a field day, Jyoti Nadkarni, another Kharghar activist, pointed out. As per official records, Maharashtra has a total of 32,000 hectares of mangroves, of which 19,000ha is under government control and 13,000ha privately owned. As much as 16,984.17ha are reserved under Section 4 of the Forest Act and 11,549.33ha under Section 20. Thus, the government says the area of pending takeover is 3,000ha. But Kumar and Pawar say this could be much more than 3,000ha. “Our request to CM has been referred to the Environment and Forest Departments, it is important to protect these sea plants in the interest of Uran,” Kumar said.Similarly, large stretches of mangroves in Kharghar, Ulwe, Nerul, etc are yet to come under the Forest Department’s fold, Singh added.Sanjay Mukherjee, VC-MD of CIDCO, said, “We are committed to the environment. While planning a city, CIDCO has always kept a 40% area for green cover. CIDCO has planted mangroves in over 400ha in Airoli and that’s where the mangroves’ Cell Interpretation Centre and Office is located. “So far, CIDCO has handed over 2000ha of land to the forest department, making it the only government organisation and Public Sector Undertaking to hand over such large pieces of land. Last year, we handed over 280ha of land to the Forest Department. We shall implement the decisions taken in the Minister’s meeting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aaditya-thackeray-asks-cidco-jnpt-to-expedite-process-of-transferring-mangroves-to-forest-dept-101642001749260.html
12-01-2022||Patna||BJP’s 1st response to ally JDU’s 50-50 formula for Bihar council seats is a ‘No’||PATNA: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is reluctant to accept a new demand from Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) (JDU) to extend the 50-50 agreement reached between the two parties for the 2020 Bihar assembly elections to the Bihar Legislative Council polls expected to be notified soon. There are 24 vacant seats in the legislative council.BJP leaders said the party is not going to accept this demand, and the BJP, as one party leader put it, “has almost rejected it.”Upendra Kushwaha, chairman of JDU’s parliamentary board and former union minister floated the 50-50 demand on Tuesday, insisting that there was no reason to digress from the formula sealed during the assembly elections.“The JDU and its bigger partner in any alliance always shared the seats under the 50:50 ratio formula from the 2015 assembly elections, including in 2019 parliamentary and 2020 assembly elections. So, we expect that same formula will be followed this time as well,” Kushwaha said on Tuesday.As part of the 50-50 deal in 2020, the JD (U) got 122 seats and the BJP 121 as part of the arrangement. The two alliance partners adjusted former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi’s party Hindustan Awam Morcha (HAM) and the Vikassheel Insaan Party(VIP) from their respective quota of seats.Kushwaha also batted for other alliance partners in Bihar’s ruling coalition and demanded that smaller constituents of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) -VIP and HAM - should also get a slice of the legislative council seats.Bihar BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal suggested that a decision on the number of seats to be contested will be taken in Delhi, and indicated why the JDU formula was unlikely to be acceptable.“First and foremost, the BJP central parliamentary committee will take a call on how many seats will be contested by us. Secondly, and most importantly, of the 24 seats falling vacant, 13 were of the BJP,” said Sanjay Jaiswal.Deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad was dismissive of JDU leader Kushwaha’s statement. He said Upendra Kushwaha’s statement has no significance. “The top leadership will decide and fix the electoral formula, on how many seats the candidates are to be fielded,” Prasad said.A senior BJP leader familiar with the developments said that the BJP will contest on 13 seats, leaving 11 for the JD (U). “The party is unlikely to adjust other allies HAM-S and the VIP,” the BJP leader added.The HAM-S and the VIP, which have been keeping the NDA government in state on the tenterhooks, have sought two and four council seats each, respectively.“We will re-think our strategy if our demands are not met,” said HAM-S spokesperson Danish Rizwan.The VIP, which has already upset ally BJP over its announcement to contest the Uttar Pradesh elections, signalled that it didn’t intend to sit tight if the BJP doesn’t accommodate them.“It is up to the BJP to take a call on it. There is no pressure. If we are not adjusted, we might contest on all 24 seats,” said VIP leader and state minister Mukesh Sahni on his party’s demand to be given four council seats. 
12-01-2022||Mumbai||State continues statement of no coercive action against Nitesh Rane||Mumbai The state government on Wednesday continued its statement that no coercive steps would be taken against MLA Nitesh Rane till his anticipatory bail application was decided by the Bombay high court (HC).While arguing for Rane, the HC was informed that the FIR was an act of vendetta for the cat calls made by him against Sena leader and minister Aditya Thackeray outside Vidhan Bhavan on December 23 and to ensure that he did not participate in the elections of a bank.Rane’s counsel also argued that the mere statement of the victim of the attempt to murder case could not be relied upon to implicate Rane in the absence of any incriminating evidence. The court will continue hearing of the ABA on Thursday.When the petition came up for hearing before a single judge bench of HC on Wednesday, advocate Niteen Pradhan for Rane submitted that he had cooperated in the investigation and had attended the police station on December 24 wherein his statement was taken down after four hours of interrogation after which he was allowed to go.On December 18, Santosh Parab, a Shiv Sena functionary from Kankavli in Sindhudurg, was allegedly assaulted in the backdrop of the Sindhudurg District Cooperative Bank election scheduled for December 30. Parab is a close associate of chairperson Satish Sawant, who was defeated by Nitesh Rane in the 2019 assembly polls for the Kankavali seat.Parab told the police that while he was on his bike on the Kankavli Nardave road at around 11 am, an Innova car without a number plate hit his vehicle. A person alighted from the car and told Parab that since he (Parab) worked for Satish Sawant (a Sena leader), the assailant would ‘deal with him and stabbed Parab in the chest’. The complaint stated that Parab heard the assailant tell another occupant in the car to inform Nitesh Rane and another accused of the incident before fleeing the spot.Pradhan further submitted that as per the FIR, Parab received one blow and suffered two abrasions on the chest but there was no explanation as to how he received the injury and hence invoking section 307 (attempt to murder) charges against Rane was preposterous. He added that the allegations in the FIR were a conspiracy to ensure that Rane was terrorised and was kept away from the bank elections.After hearing the submissions due to paucity of time the bench posted the further hearing of the application to Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-continues-statement-of-no-coercive-action-against-nitesh-rane-101641999291694.html
12-01-2022||Lucknow||Cong pushed into political isolation in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW A day after Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar spoke about his party’s tie-up with the Samajwadi Party, the latter firmed it up by declaring NCP leader KK Sharma as the alliance’s first candidate for the UP polls, pushing the Congress further towards isolation on the political horizon of Uttar Pradesh. The All-India Trinamool Congress is also going to contest UP polls in alliance with the Samajwadi Party. The Congress adopted ‘ekla chalo’ strategy in 2022 UP assembly elections following the failure of alliance experiments with the BSP in 1996 and the Samajwadi Party in 2017 Assembly elections. Not able to woo major sections of castes/communities or strengthen its organizational base, the party is being pushed towards political isolation, which is likely to lead to straight contests between the BJP and the Samajwadi Party. “The Congress’ move of ‘ekla chalo’ may work for it in the long run as it will help in building the organizational structure at the grassroots level. Other like-minded parties are apparently isolating the Congress as they are working with a strategy of forming a non-BJP and non-Congress alliance for 2024 Lok Sabha elections. So, all these parties, be it the NCP or the TMC, have to keep the Congress out,” said a senior Congress leader. Political observers said the opposition needs to put up a show of unity to strongly fight the BJP in 2022 UP polls. “If the opposition fails to make any impact in these elections, its dream of giving a strong alternative to the BJP in 2024 will have no meaning. The onus to check division of non-BJP votes lies with the Congress too just like the other like-minded parties,” they said. “The Congress, by not joining the alliance, is acting against its own political interest. It will be in the interest of the party to come out of its isolation and be a part of an all-opposition alliance to give a fight to the BJP. I am sure the Congress will work on this and join the alliance sooner or later,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of department, political science, Lucknow University. A considerable section of Congress workers, who are not happy with the way things are going in the party, have begun looking for other options instead of waiting for Congress’ long-term strategy to succeed. “The Congress is nowhere to be seen in UP. It is neglecting its own leaders including the old guards. The party is being pushed into political isolation due to the policies being followed by those who are running the show. The party has failed to get support of any sections of society,” said former Congress MLC Siraj Mehandi, who joined the NCP in Mumbai on Tuesday. “I was among the old guards expelled from the Congress for no reason. I waited for nearly one and a half years, and when the party failed to revoke my expulsion, I decided to move on,” he said. But Mehandi is not alone. A number of Congress leaders have switched over to other like-minded parties in recent years/months and are now providing them a strong organizational support. Such disgruntled leaders, be the younger ones or the elders, are set to get rewarded with tickets from other parties like the NCP and the TMC in 2022 UP assembly polls. 
12-01-2022||Chandigarh||Cong should declare CM face to help it reap poll gains: Channi||Chandigarh: With polls in Punjab a month away, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi feels that the Congress should declare its chief ministerial candidate, pointing out that doing so in the past has favoured the party reap electoral gains.Channi’s statement has come at a time when opposition parties have targeted the Congress, saying it has many chief ministerial aspirants, including its state unit president Navjot Singh Sidhu and party leader Sunil Jakhar.AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said his party’s chief ministerial face for the Punjab Assembly polls will be announced next week. It is likely that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) may declare its MP Bhagwant Mann as the chiefministerial candidate .Replying to a question on the chief ministerial candidate for the February 14 polls, Channi said the decision has to be taken by the party.Asked should the Congress declare its candidate for 2022 Punjab assembly election because going by the past trend sometimes the party makes such announcement and sometimes not and last time they had declared Amarinder Singh as CM candidate, Channi replied, “Last time, when they had declared Capt (as CM’s face), we won and previous time the (CM) candidate was not declared we lost and before that when they gave (CM candidate) we won and when they did not declare candidate we lost” “This time, they should give (declare the CM candidate). (Navjot) Sidhu is also saying that they (Congress) should declare,” Channi said in an interview to a news channel.To another question during his interview, Channi claimed that “it will be a one-sided sweep” by the Congress. “We will win the election with an overwhelming majority,” he said. To a question on some survey which claim he was ahead of others in popularity ratings, Channi said then it means more seats will be impacted in Congress’ favour.When asked if the AAP declares its chief ministerial candidate and names party MP Bhagwant Mann then the popularity of the parliamentarian may soar, Channi said then the same logic will work for him as well.At the same time, Channi said neither Mann nor he have been declared as chief ministerial candidates by their respective parties.Asked if his party should declare him as the chief ministerial candidate, Channi replied, “I have never thought about such things. Last time when Partap Singh Bajwa was the state unit chief, I was standing with him against Capt (Amarinder). But going by the voice of people at that time, I told Rahul Gandhi that Capt should be declared candidate and he should be made CM as people are in his favour. They (party) conducted a survey and people wanted him (Amarinder). This time whom people like they will tell and party will go by that”.Replying to a question if people like him, Channi said he loves the people of Punjab and they too love him. “But whom they want to see as CM, they will tell in survey,” he said.The Congress is yet to announce its CM’s face for the next month’s polls. If Congress retains power in Punjab, where it faces infighting, Charanjit Singh Channi, appointed the CM after the ouster of Amarinder Singh, is also being seen as a strong contender.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-should-declare-cm-face-to-help-it-reap-poll-gains-channi-101641999288844.html

Senior officials of the state government under chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarti were present.PCB CEO Amit Kumar said “ We have given our representation to the chief secretary and now the matter is with the state government. We have pointed out that the precarious financial condition of the board for the past many years has hit all the development projects. For developments to take place, LBT funds which are due will help us tide over the worst financial crisis of the board . Currently the board is starved of funds and citizen work is getting affected due to the financial crisis.”After hearing counsel for parties in the case for a considerable length of time , the court had granted the reliefs prayed for by the petitioners and the PCB has been given an opportunity to make representation within a period of two weeks to the chief secretary. The state of Maharashtra has been directed to dispose of the representation within two months after giving an opportunity to the petitioners of being heard. Prior to 2013, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had been collecting octroi and PCB was getting a share from PMC .Subsequently, the state government abolished octroi with effect from April 1, 2013. Further as per notification in 2013, the PMC started collecting Local Body Tax (LBT) instead of octroi within its jurisdiction. There is no revenue sharing agreement between PMC and the PCB from April 1, 2013.Under section 71 of the Cantonments Act,2006, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) authorised the board to impose LBT through a resolution dated June 4, 2015 and the board was able to generate revenue to the tune of ₹88 crore per annum. On April 12, 2017,Goods and Service Tax (GST) was enacted by the central government and implemented with effect from July 1, 2017.Due to the annual revenue loss to the tune of ₹90 crore, a self sufficient Cantonment Board has become a deficit Cantonment Board and is presently in such a precarious financial condition that the board is not able to meet its mandatory expenses on account of salary, pension, the development works and maintenance of civic amenities has also been adversely affected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/chief-secretary-conducts-video-conference-hearing-in-pcbs-459-crore-lbt-tax-case-101641998151960.html

The HC also asked the state to prepare an audit report of the working of the committee after it was informed that there was no information on how the committee was functioning after the demise of the committee’s secretary Prof Avinash Dolas.On Wednesday, the division bench of justice Prasanna Varale and justice Anil Kilor, which was hearing the suo motu PIL, was informed by court-appointed amicus curaie advocate Swaraj Jadhav that the petition had been filed and apart from the state, a government-appointed committee, reference of other agencies involved in publishing the works of Dr Ambedkar across the world had also been included in the petition.Following a news report of November 24 last year, which had stated that though the state government had issued directions to print nine lakh copies of the volumes of Dr Ambedkar’s speech and writings and printing paper worth ₹5.45 crore was purchased by the state, in the last four years, only 33,000 copies were printed and the paper purchased for the project was lying unused in the godowns.While ordering the initiation of the suo motu PIL the bench had noted, “The news item reflects a sorry state of affairs... The publication is absolutely necessary and desirable for present and future generations. It is useful to members of the legal fraternity as well as to general members. So, we feel that there is a need for this court to look into the issue of halting the project... Considering the nature of the grievance raised in the news item, we are treating it as a matter for public interest litigation.”According to the petition filed by advocate Jadhav, directions were sought to the authorities to publish and print writings of Dr Ambedkar in sufficient quantity proportionate to demand in the market and there is a steady supply of the same. The petition also sought directions to the committee to acquire articles, interviews and other published or unpublished material from independent sources so that same can be made available to the public at large and a direction to Principal Secretary, Department of Higher and Technical Education to monitor the work of the committee.After being apprised of the filing of the petition, the bench asked the state government represented by the government pleader not to treat the petition as adversarial litigation but to consider it as a necessity and also asked it to file its reply and prepare an audit report of the functioning of the committee and posted further hearing after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-calls-for-audit-report-of-committee-set-up-for-publishing-dr-b-r-ambedkar-s-works-101641995867987.html

12-01-2022||Pune||Now, treated water use mandatory for construction||PUNE The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Tuesday issued a circular making it mandatory for all construction sites to use the treated water for construction activity in the city instead of using underground or potable water.The builders in the city have welcomed the usage of treated water generated through sewage treatment plants, however, they have pointed out some practical issues.Suhas Merchant, former president, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (Credai) said, “The municipal corporation’s intention is good, but the civic body needs to address a few problems. Practical and logistic issues like tanker availability, water quality, transport cost and storage at site among others need to be addressed.”Water department head Aniruddha Pawaskar said, “In any new scheme, the initial phases have some practical issues. While making it mandatory, the PMCs approach would be positive and the civic body will address the practical problems faced by builders.”Pawaskar added, “Currently the builders are hiring borewell water which is paid for by them. We are giving them treated water free of cost, but they are not ready to pay transport charges.The civic body has five to six times more capacity of treated water than the demand for construction activity. In future, when this becomes a routine, the PMC will ask tanker owners to give different colours to treated water tankers. Pune would be first city in the country which would be using treated water for construction activity.”BOXIrrigation department not lifting treated water from Mundhwa JackwellThe PMC erected Mundhwa Jackwell so that the irrigation department can lift water from here and use it for agricultural purposes. As per the agreement, PMC would give 6.5 TMC treated water per annum to irrigation department and they would give more water from Khadakwasla dam. But for last many years, the irrigation department has not been lifting this water for agriculture purpose. PMC water department head Aniruddha Pawaskar said, “Irrigation department is lifting almost fifty percentage water per annum. The civic body gives them water as per their demand, but it is true that they are not making demand for hundred percentage capacity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/now-treated-water-use-mandatory-for-construction-101641995333144.html

12-01-2022||Other||AAP to announce CM face for Punjab next week: Kejriwal||Chandigarh : Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said his party will announce its chief ministerial face for the February 14 elections in Punjab next week. Kejriwal said this on reaching the Chandigarh airport to launch his party’s 10-point agenda and door-to-door campaign in the poll-bound state. He also targeted the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government over the law and order in the state, stating that the security of Prime Minister and common man will be ensured if his party is voted to power in Punjab. The Delhi chief minister is on his first visit to Punjab since the announcement of the poll schedule by the Election Commission. AAP state unit president and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann is being seen as the favourite to become the chief ministerial face of the party. The AAP had contested the 2017 assembly elections without a CM face and this was seen by many party leaders as one of the primary reasons for its performance falling short of expectations. The party has named its candidates for 109 of the 117 assembly seats in the state. In 2017, it won 20 seats to become the principal opposition party in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-to-announce-cm-face-for-punjab-next-week-kejriwal-101641992514745.html

12-01-2022||Chandigarh||Three-day Maghi Mela from Jan 13, maintaining Covid protocols a challenge||Faridkot : Despite recent surge in coronavirus cases in Punjab, large gatherings are expected at Muktsar for the historic three-day Maghi Mela beginning Thursday.The biggest challenge for the administration is to maintain Covid protocols during the mela, which starts on the maghi day and continues for another day, as people from Punjab and other states come to Muktsar to take a holy dip in the sarovar of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib. Punjab on Tuesday witnessed another surge in Covid cases registering 4,593 fresh infections and nine deaths. The Punjab government has already imposed night curfew from 10pm to 5am till January 15, besides a number of restrictions. The Maghi Mela is celebrated in the memory of 40 Sikh warriors, who in 1705 fought the Mughals in the battle at Khidrana, later named Muktsar. There will be no political conference at the mela as the Election Commission has banned physical rallies and roadshows of political parties till January 15 due to surge in Covid cases across the country. Deputy commissioner Harpreet Sudan said the district administration has made all arrangements as per the Covid-19 protocols. “We have set up vaccination camps at the venue so the people who are not fully vaccinated can be inoculated. Health teams will conduct random Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) and collect samples for RT-PCR testing. We will ensure not more than 600 persons are allowed to gather at a religious procession,” he added. Senior superintendent of police Sarbjit Singh said: “A special route plan has been prepared to control traffic, besides seven temporary bus stands have been set up for the convenience of devotees. Heavy vehicles will be banned from entering the city on January 14. Seven emergency police assistance centres have also been set up. CCTV cameras and drones will keep a vigil during the fair,” he added. 
12-01-2022||Uttar||OBC leader Dara Singh Chauhan also quits UP cabinet, BJP in damage control mode||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh’s environment minister Dara Singh Chauhan, also an OBC, sent his resignation to the governor on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost four legislators including state labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya.Dara Singh Chauhan, like Keshav Prasad Maurya, attributed his decision to what he called was “the government’s neglectful attitude towards the backward classes, the underprivileged, the Dalits, the farmers, and the unemployed youth”.Dara Singh Chauhan and Keshav Prasad Maurya were imported by the BJP from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the run-up to the 2017 UP polls. His resignation was anticipated as he was spotted at Swami Prasad Maurya’s Gomti Nagar residence in Lucknow on Tuesday.Chauhan resigned shortly after another OBC legislator Avtar Singh Bhadana, who quit the BJP earlier but whose resignation was on hold, joined the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), an ally of UP’s main opposition Samajwadi Party (SP).As on Tuesday, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya immediately tried to reach out to Chauhan, urging him to reconsider his decision. “One feels bad if a family member loses way. I would just request the respected leaders who have resigned to reconsider their decision as they won’t achieve anything by riding a sinking boat. I would appeal to big brother Dara Singhji to reconsider his decision,” tweeted Keshav Prasad Maurya.Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, also an OBC face of the BJP in UP, along with chief minister Yogi Adityanath and other deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma is in Delhi since Tuesday, for the candidate selection meetings for 58 constituencies in 11 districts that will vote on February 10.The resignations of Swami Prasad and Dara Singh from the council of ministers haven’t yet been accepted yet, a development that some BJP leaders see as a glimmer of hope though Swami quickly negated any reconsideration. “I haven’t resigned as a BJP member yet. I will reveal everything on January 14 though one thing is clear that I am not going to the BJP,” Swami said on being asked about his status as BJP leader.The BJP did try to showcase that the party has a counter plan in place, as it quickly got Naresh Saini, the Congress’ OBC lawmaker from Saharanpur in western UP and who hails from the same backward community as Swami Prasad Maurya to join the saffron party along with three-time SP lawmaker Hari Om Yadav and former SP lawmaker Dharampal Singh in Delhi in the presence of Keshav Maurya as well as party’s UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev, an OBC.The fast-paced political developments on Tuesday and Wednesday meant that BJP strategists, who apparently had seen Dara Singh Chauhan’s resignation coming and were even trying to persuade him against taking the decision, had more tasks on their hands. The BJP’s damage-control plan was clear - to make up by engineering defections in opposition ranks and reach out to disgruntled party leaders. While a glimpse of the first round of the damage-control exercise was visible with the joining of some OBC lawmakers into the party, it was the latter plan of reaching out to and placating disgruntled leaders that is seen to be much more challenging.“It’s not good optics,” said a party leader while indicating that some “big leaders” would join the BJP too. Swami Prasad also said that after his resignation and with it that of others, BJP leaders have started to give respect to leaders and lawmakers, and added that now several sitting BJP MLAs, who were likely to be axed, might be retained.Several BJP lawmakers - many of them fearing that they may not get the party ticket - have been leaving the party. On Monday, BJP MLA from Bilsi Assembly segment in Budaun Radha Krishna Sharma joined the SP, the second Brahmin MLA of the party after Digvijay Narain Chaubey, MLA from Khalilabad in Sant Kabir Nagar, to join the main opposition party. Earlier, BJP MLA from Bahraich Madhuri Verma, Rakesh Rathore from Sitapur, both OBCs, also joined the SP.While admitting that the high-voltage political drama in Lucknow caught them off guard, some BJP leaders made it clear that Tuesday’s developments were unlikely to alter the party’s “candidate selection” strategy.A BJP leader said the party’s core group that was discussing candidate selection in national Capital Delhi was unlikely to be influenced by these developments.“UP elections are important. Naturally, if some candidates are dropped, it could be because of some specific input that might have emerged through field surveys. While it is true that we don’t want to lose any leader, at the same time why do you think a certain political development that could be big news for the media would force us to compromise on candidate selection. Only the best will be selected. There are hundreds of claimants from each assembly segment and all know that only one eventually will get to contest,” a senior leader said.While UP’s labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya merely cited generic reasons for his quitting the Yogi Adityanath cabinet, a section in the party believes that like in 2016 when he presumably left the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) after failing to secure a ticket for his daughter Sanghmitra (now a BJP MP from Badaun) and son Utkrisht – this time too, he fell out with the party over a ticket for his son.Maurya said that his daughter was free to take her own call after his exit. “It’s for her to decide on what she wants to do. I can’t force my decision on anyone including family,” Swami Prasad said.
12-01-2022||Mumbai||Police register FIR in bogus promotion order||Mumbai The Marine Drive Police registered an FIR against an unidentified person for issuing a fake order, promoting five additional district collectors to Indian Administrative Service (IAS).Joint secretary Dr Madhav Veer has filed the complaint in the case as the fake order was issued in his name. As per the complaint, no such promotion order was issued by the government, the police said. On January 6, a copy of the promotion order was making rounds on social media platforms, especially on WhatsApp groups of government officials.According to this order, Ramdas Khedkar, Personal Secretary to the Revenue Minister, was promoted to the post of Chief Secretary of the revenue department. Besides this, Gadchiroli additional collector Unmesh Mahajan was promoted as Gondia District Collector, Thane Municipal Corporation additional commissioner Sanket Chavan was promoted to additional commissioner (A Grade), Amravati Additional Collector Manisha Waze as Additional Municipal Commissioner and Dhananjay Nikam, Additional Collector of Bhandara, was promoted to District Collector of the district. “Generally orders for promotion or transfer to the Indian Administrative Service are issued by the general administration department. But the January 6 order was issued by the Revenue and Forest Department, hence suspicion were being raised about its authenticity,” said a police officer. A preliminary inquiry found the order to be a fake one. It was found that a bogus order was issued by forging the signature of joint secretary Madhav Veer, the officer added.On Veer’s complaint, the Marine Drive police recently registered a case under sections 420, 464, 465, 466 and 467 of the Penal Code for cheating and forgery. “We are trying to find out who could have benefitted the most from the said bogus order or was it a deliberate attempt to influence any future promotion/transfer. We are roping in cyber officials and are also in process of writing to WhatsApp to get information about the source of the bogus order,” said Vishwanath Kolekar, senior inspector of Marine Drive police station. In a similar incident, an old list of transfers and promotions of senior police officers also went viral on social media platforms on Tuesday. Home department officials said that no such order was issued by the government and it could be mischief done by someone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/police-register-fir-in-bogus-promotion-order-101641990587369.html
12-01-2022||Delhi||Takeaways the only hope now for restaurants to survive the virus||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) decision to have bars and restaurants shut for dine-in and only allowing takeaways has business owners worried. Their revenue was already hit as they were only allowed to operate at 50% capacity till 10pm. And the weekend curfew also had a massive impact on sales. “We have observed a marked slowdown of traffic at our outlets, without a significant increase in deliveries. This may be due to the uncertainty about opening hours, curfew timings, bad weather and a wait-and-see attitude of patrons,” says Laurent Samandari, CEO and co-founder of L’Opéra, who hopes that more clarity will bring some improvement. While Samandari is gearing up the back-end and in-house delivery infrastructure including own vehicles, drivers and website to cope with the necessary demand, others are looking to open more kitchens. Zorawar Kalra, director, Massive Restaurants, says, “There is going to be a very huge surge as is always the case when there is a curfew or a lockdown. We are retro-fitting two kitchens to start delivery. We will be geared up for serious increase in volumes and we are increasing delivery hours till 3am. We are also ramping up new cloud openings.”Another restaurateur, Amit Bagga, co-founder, Daryaganj adds, “We are focussing on deliveries as well since the pandemic started and have 20 percent revenue from deliveries as of now. There is an increased demand for cloud kitchens and we are also planning to do the same to cater to the demand.”A few plan to come up with special delivery menus along with safe packaging. Vikrant Batra, founder, Cafe Delhi Heights, adds, “With restrictions coming back in the industry, we have to up game the delivery side of our business again. In the first lockdown, we created special delivery menus. In second lockdown, we started our bakery brand and now in the third, we are creating a stand alone brand for burgers. There will for sure be great demand in delivery brands owing to the fact that people will avoid going out for dine ins. We also worked on new safe packaging.”However, some players who believe that just allowing takeaways won’t help in surviving in the industry due to rents and salaries and may lead to closure of restaurants. “As the announcement today is aimed at saving lives, it is significant. Dine-in customers are the main source of revenue for us. If the restrictions persist for a long time, there is a possibility that it might lead to the closure of the business. With delivery representing only 30% of our sales, and the platforms charging hefty commissions, it’s not even close to being sustainable to operate exclusively on delivery, as the resulting revenue won’t cover our overheads - salaries, rent, etc,” says Mohit Ahuja, owner, Shakespeare Cafe. Vishal Anand, Founder, Moonshine Food Ventures adds, “Government needs to look at solutions which doesn’t kill businesses yet doesn’t compromise on the safety of people. Delivery can only replace cooking at home and not dine in experience at a Restaurant. For experiential restaurants, delivery can never be mainstream business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/takeaways-the-only-hope-now-for-restaurants-to-survive-the-virus-101641990415403.html

12-01-2022||Bangalore||Congress march continues in Karnataka despite surge in Covid cases||BENGALURU: A third complaint was filed against Congress leaders in Karnataka on Wednesday for endangering lives as hundreds of people are participating in their march to Bengaluru despite a surge in Covid-19 cases.The march was started despite restrictions ordered to check the pandemic spread to press for the building of a reservoir on the Cauvery to supply drinking water to Bengaluru and neighbouring areas.The three complaints under the Epidemic Diseases Act have been filed by the same person, who identifies himself as Venkatesh, against 64 people including state Congress chief DK Shivakumar and Opposition leader Siddaramaiah.“If you can’t fly, let’s run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then let’s crawl. But let’s move towards our goal. The fourth day of the Mekedatu Padayatre has begun. With the same vigour, keep strong steps,” Shivakumar said in a tweet.Shivakumar said those participating in the rally should register their names or take pictures with posters or with leaders and certificates of participation will be given later.The Congress remained defiant and has continued with the march ahead of panchayat elections and the 2023 assembly polls. “Let’s see what action is taken. We are also ready to face all the consequences. It is their government and if they take action, we will fight it legally,” Siddaramaiah said. “If they slap FIRs (First Information Reports), will they be able to scare us? We have seen many such FIRs. There is no offence. They have registered an FIR. Where is the offence?”Araga Jnanendra, Karnataka’s home minister, said it seems Congress leaders are only bothered about taking political advantage and not about public health. He added they were not heeding calls to postpone the march to draw political mileage. “The Congress leaders are precipitating the Covid crisis in the state,” Jnanendra said.The march is heading towards Bengaluru, the worst-hit region in Karnataka with nearly 60,000 active cases, even as the government has announced restrictions to check the Covid-19 spread. The test positivity rate in Bengaluru is over 15%. The restrictions include night and weekend curfews as well as on weddings and other events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/congress-march-continues-in-karnataka-despite-surge-in-covid-cases-101641985600492.html

In his resignation letter, Chauhan mentioned that he was quitting the ministry because of the government's “neglectful attitude” towards the backward classes, the underprivileged, the Dalits, the farmers, and the unemployed youth.“As minister of forest and environment in the Yogi Adityanath ministry, I have wholeheartedly worked throughout my tenure for the betterment of this department,” wrote Dara Singh Chauhan in his resignation letter, accessed by the ANI news agency on Wednesday. “However, I am hurt by the government's neglectful attitude towards the backward classes, the underprivileged, the Dalits, the farmers, and the unemployed youth. At the same time, the matter of reservation of the Dalits and the backward classes is being toyed with; in view of this, I resign from the Uttar Pradesh ministry.”Dara Singh Chauhan's resignation from the Yogi cabinet could give a jolt to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s electioneering prospects ahead of the upcoming assembly polls, especially since the latest development comes barely a day after state minister Swami Prasad Maurya also resigned from the Yogi Adityanath cabinet.Addressing reporters after his resignation, Maurya, too, said that he had quit the Yogi cabinet keeping in mind the government's “attitude” towards Dalits, backward classes, farmers, youth, and traders. He also said that he will join the Samajwadi Party on January 14.In a similar vein, Dara Singh Chauhan told reporters today, “The BJP formed the government with the support of Dalits and backward communities, but did not serve them well, which is why I resigned.”Notably, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said in a tweet that he welcomed Dara Singh Chauhan to the party.Chauhan, however, said, “The next step would be to hold discussions with my society people and then take a call for future course of action.”‘सामाजिक न्याय’ के संघर्ष के अनवरत सेनानी श्री दारा सिंह चौहान जी का सपा में ससम्मान हार्दिक स्वागत एवं अभिनंदन! सपा व उसके सहयोगी दल एकजुट होकर समता-समानता के आंदोलन को चरम पर ले जाएँगे… भेदभाव मिटाएँगे! ये हमारा समेकित संकल्प है! सबको सम्मान ~ सबको स्थान!#मेला_होबे pic.twitter.com/rGxMYUyvsdElections for the 403-member Uttar Pradesh assembly will be held in seven phases.The polling will be held on February 10, 14, 20, 23, 27, and March 3 and 7 in seven phases.The counting of votes will take place on March 10.In the 2017 Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, the Bharatiya Janata Party bagged 312 seats out of the 403-seat Uttar Pradesh Assembly while Samajwadi Party (SP) bagged 47 seats, Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) won 19 and Congress could manage to win only seven seats.

12-01-2022||Pune||Sutradhara’s Tales: When young Peshwa enjoyed the company of fearsome animals||Sawai Madhavrao was the youngest member to be conferred Peshwa paraphernalia, at the age barely above a month. The trusteeship of running the Maratha affairs fell on the consortium of ministers led by finance minister, Nana Phadnis. Against the backdrop of Narayanrao’s (father of Sawai Madhavrao) murder and looming danger to his safety from enemies of the state and near home, Nana Phadnis was personally devoted to upbringing of the young Peshwa. In order to entertain the young child and divert his attention from personal tragedy, Nana Phadnis introduced him to company of animals at a tender age. This collection of animals was unique of its kind in the Deccan and there was a regular department opened in Poona for its upkeep. Nana Phadnis once ordered an exotic ostrich for Madhavrao’s collection, but it died along the way. Unfamiliar with the nature of unseen bird, Nana Phadnis asks for a drawing of dead bird instead, in order to satisfy his curiosity! In Sai Madhavrao’s times, the Shikarkhana (plot near Sarasbaug) extended to almost 45 acres and occupied land up to present day, Dattawadi. It was not a zoo of captive animals in cages, but more like a sanctuary of animals where it were free to roam, restricted only by ropes and log chains. Peshwa chronicles provide a list of various animals and birds that were part of Sawai Madhavrao’s Shikarkhana — 700-750 rabbits, 200-250 deer, blackbucks, 11 cheetahs, 20 Royal Bengal tigers, lions, rhinoceros, various birds such as peacocks, partridges, mynas, parrots, water hens, ducks, pigeons and cranes were part of the royal collection. Exotic animals such as lynx, double humped Bacterian camel and alpine birds could be found in this eclectic menagerie; it contained finest specimens of brute creatures that existed. Mahadaji Shinde gifted Sawai Madhavrao with rhinoceros procured from north India. Rhinoceros roamed on an open ground named ”Gendemal”. Major Price who visited Pune in 1791 recollects his experience of visiting the Peshwa menagerie in following words: “Next to the lion, and equally as accessible to the fresh air, was, also fastened in the same manner, the finest and most perfect model of a rhinoceros, that I have ever seen, either before or since. For, unlike the shapeless monster that we usually see exhibited, with his body enveloped in loose and flaccid folds of indurated hide, this stupendous animal was filled out to its utmost proportions; and its huge armour-like exterior being stretched almost to bursting, it was as round as a hogshead; and at the same time as lively, I was going to say, as any sucking pig. Indeed, when the keeper, by a slight touch with his wand made him rear up a little on his hind legs, while the alertness surprised me, I could not but compare him to a wine pipe, set a little on one end. “At all events, the ponderous agility of the animal was astonishing. Its small, but prominent eye, appeared sparkling, and full of animation; and the horny mass upon its snout, though it did not yet seem to have attained to its full growth, by its backward turn and hook-like shape, furnished sufficient proof, that when applied by a momentum of such force, its effect must be tremendous; and renders less surprising the accounts we receive of its power to subdue the otherwise surpassing strength of the elephant.” Around 7-8 acres was especially reserved for various deer species and blackbucks near Lotan baug. The antelopes had an ear for music and were trained to dance and swing for purpose of entertainment. Sir Charles Malet recalls event from 1792 where Sawai Madhavrao invited him to witness a special spectacle in deer park. All the dignitaries were conveniently seated on carpets in pitched tents along with young Peshwa. He quotes “Four black buck antelopes, of noble vein and elegant form, made their appearance at some distance, moving gracefully before a party of cavalry, who forming a semi-circle, gently followed their pace, each horseman holding a long pole, with a red cloth at the end. On approaching the tent, a band of music struck up in loud notes, and three of the antelopes entered in a stately manner. Two swings, commonly used by the Indians, being suspended for the purpose, an antelope ascended on each swing, and couched in the most graceful altitude; the third reclined on the carpet in a similar posture.” Malet was astonished to witness the blackbucks danced to musical tunes along with the female dancers and perform the most graceful dance! Sawai Madhavrao, later, informed Malet that training blackbuck to come to this degree of familiarity took seven months without holding them hostage in any way! Sir James Wales was so inspired by the Peshwa menagerie that he ordered his accomplished trainee chitari, Gangaram Tambat to make clay models and paintings of various animals. The base of Parvati hill housed the tigers in an enclosed yard. Two tigers were especially sent by Lord Malet from Calcutta presidency as a gift. One tiger named Shambhu was stark yellow in colour and most favourite. His love for animals is evident from the fact that he refused to lend a blackbuck to Mahadji Shinde for fear of it getting killed. On being assured of its safety and use for breeding more blackbucks, Sawai Madhavrao gifted Mahadji Shinde with a blackbuck male. Sawai Madhavrao was particularly fond of a cheeky macaque called “Kabu” which was notorious for its naughtiness and entertained the inhabitants of Shaniwarwada with its silly monkey play! Sawai Madhavrao was so fond of his animals that he carried a small part of his Shikarkhana during the campaign of Kharda. His love for animals was so well known that bards have imagined various animals and birds crying insolently on hearing the unfortunate death of Sawai Madhavrao, in the Marathi Powadas (heroic eulogised poetry). Upkeep of these animals was an elaborate affair. One finds curious mention of talking mynas and singing parrots trained in speaking Bengali language! They were fed with a luxuriously curated diet of musk mixed with spices such as cardamom, nutmeg, clove and saffron. Bajirao II (son of Raghunathrao Peshwa), too, maintained a Shikarkhana near his Kothrud residence. It mainly consisted of diverse birds such as mynas, pigeons, parrots, ducks, and trained bird of prey such as Peregrine falcons. These were caged and used mainly for entertainment. As the Maratha Empire came to an end in 1818, the hunting and gaming by royals continued but the menageries suffered heavy neglect. It was in 1953, the growing Pune city felt a need of zoo parks which led municipal corporation to establish “Peshwe Park” housing the wild animals and birds, at roughly the same location of Sawai Madhavrao’s Shikarkhana. Today, as most of the animals are shifted to bigger, better Katraj garden, the memories of young animal loving Sawai Madhavrao’s menagerie barely survive in fading existence of Peshwe Park!

Youngsters who went to Canada for employment will return in five years.” Besides generating employment, he said, the AAP would create a drug-free and corruption-free state, restore law and order, improve education, health, agriculture and industrial sectors, provide free power to a certain segment and give ₹1,000 a month to each woman above the age of 18. “The Congress ruled the state for 25 years and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) for 19 years, but they ruled in partnership and have looted Punjab. They didn’t work for the welfare of the people,” he said.

The Madhya Pradesh government had recently recommended handing over the probe to the CBI. A survivor from the family had undertaken a 'nyay yatra' from Nemawar to Bhopal demanding justice and had reached Raj Bhawan on Tuesday along with senior Congress leaders Digvijaya Singh and Sajjan Singh Verma as well as party workers. Angry that the girl could not meet Patel, Congress leader Verma said, "We were proud that a tribal man was appointed the governor of Madhya Pradesh. What did we know that the governor is afraid of coronavirus, and cannot give justice to his own community? Death is better than such a life." Congress workers present outside Raj Bhawan also shouted slogans against the governor. Hitting back, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan tweeted that Congress leaders were violating political decorum. "Congress leaders are not only losing patience but also their conscience. Such petty remarks against a person holding a constitutional post is not only a violation of political decorum, but also an insult to the Indian tradition of wishing the welfare of all. Your remarks are a blow to the heart of the state," Chouhan said in a tweet. MP Home minister Narottam Mishra and state BJP chief VD Sharma also attacked the Congress on the issue. "The indecent and senseless remarks made by Congress leaders Digvijay Singh and Sajjan Singh Verma against Mangubhai Patel ji, holding the highest constitutional post of Madhya Pradesh, is condemnable. The Congress's hatred towards the tribal class is at its peak that they are wishing death for a representative of that community," Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-tribal-family-murdered-cong-bjp-fight-as-girl-fails-to-meet-guv-101641972670649.html

He also hinted that restrictions clamed in Delhi will be lifted."It seems like Covid cases have stabilised in Delhi, soon we will see a decline," Jain told reporters."If Covid-19 cases come down in 2-3 days, restrictions will be lifted," he further said, adding that Delhi is likely to see around 25,000 cases today.The health minister said that the positivity rate can't determine if Covid-19 cases have peaked or not. "The hospitalisation rate has stabilised and cases have plateaued," said Jain."Covid-19 cases have started coming down in Mumbai, we will soon see the same trend in Delhi," he added.While key data indicators in Mumbai suggest that numbers in the city have already started peaking, Delhi is experiencing what could be the first indication that the rise of cases has slowed down, according to an analysis of the Covid-19 data by Hindustan Times.In Mumbai, the positivity rate has started dropping. Positivity rate (the proportion of daily tests returning positive for Covid-19) is one of the first statistical measures that indicate a reversal in trend. This number has now fallen for five days in a row - the figure was 29.9% last Thursday, 29% on Friday, 28.6% on Saturday, 28.5% on Sunday, 23% on Monday, and touched 18.8% on Tuesday.As expected, this trend was closely followed by a drop in daily infections, which have now fallen for four consecutive days – there were 20,971 cases on Friday, 20,318 on Saturday, 19,474 on Sunday, 13,648 on Monday, and finally 11,647 on Tuesday.In Delhi, while cases and positivity rate have not yet started declining, the rapid rise seen over the past two weeks appears to have slowed , hinting that the peak may be approaching - a factor that has been pointed out by several health experts, both government and independent.Sutra - a mathematical model developed by scientists at IIT-Kanpur and IIT-Hyderabad to assess the peak in Covid-19 cases in India - has predicted that Delhi could see a peak in Covid-19 infections around January 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-cases-have-stabilised-in-delhi-restrictions-could-be-lifted-jain-101641967472955.html

It is also considering involving NGOs for the pledge against dowry. In 2020, Bihar was second in the country in terms of dowry deaths with 1,046 cases, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.Chief minister Nitish Kumar has appealed for the pledge against accepting dowry and getting declarations against it printed on the wedding cards. In January 2017, he launched an anti-dowry campaign and a human chain was later formed against the practise.“For anti-dowry declarations, there is a need to make people aware... The WDC is preparing to launch an aggressive awareness drive (for it),” said Ajay Shrivastava, project coordinator, WDC.Meena Tiwari, the National general secretary of the All-India Progressive Women’s Association, welcomed the move. “Every woman appreciated his (Kumar)’s appeal to the people to make an anti-dowry declaration on wedding cards. But the problem is how to get this executed.”Jaimangal Dev, a psychology teacher at Patliputra University, said everybody knows that dowry is illegal. “Even then this evil practice continues. The only way to stop it is to bring attitudinal changes in people.”
12-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiwale: Life in the slow lane||The tree is tall, wide and choked with green leaves. You can spend a long time surveying its immense proportions consisting of dozens of branches. The tree gets even more elaborate because it is casting a shadow equally huge on a building’s long wall that runs along a path. Some leaves tremble with a sudden breeze. So do the shadows of those leaves.But this is just one tree. Babar Road has a multitude of trees with similarly magnificent canopies. The avenue is in Delhi’s heart, but feels far from the metropolis, as if it were the suburb of a suburb. So detached. Full of birds twittering. The muffled roar of passing autos and cars sound like the drone from distant motor boats speeding down a river.Indeed, the road is like a stream coursing through a getaway resort of cosy beauty. And the sidewalk is unimaginably gigantic, almost the width of the road — a rarity in our walk-unfriendly city.This afternoon, the sidewalk is empty, making you feel that the entire stretch was built for your convenience. Large houses stand on both sides — you may see colourful laundry hanging on the roofs. One house has French windows with shutters.The road is punctuated with side lanes, harbouring more of such trees and such residences. Some of the buildings happen to be offices and clinics (one banner reads: “Centre of excellence for stem cell therapy and research”). Some parts of the sidewalk are decorated with well-maintained potted plants.An adjoining U-shaped market is sprinkled with a handful of dhabas serving affordable khana. Even so, the area exudes an unmistakable vibe of privilege. As if no matter what happens everywhere else in smoggy, disparate Delhi, the gentry of tranquil Babar Road will continue to live unaffected in their little haven.Nearby, there are rail tracks. So you frequently hear the sound of rushing trains.Towards the end of the road, the sidewalk skirts past a red building with a most arresting staircase (see photo). The top flight is shorn of walls, and descends like a cascading waterfall. Just this sight alone is enough to make Babar Road worthy of an expedition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-life-in-the-slow-lane-101641947728992.html

12-01-2022||Chandigarh||Better synergy, intel behind elimination of 13 militants in Kashmir this year: Officials||In the first 10 days of January, Kashmir witnessed eight encounters resulting in the elimination of 13 terrorists, including five foreign militants. The surge in militant killings has been attributed by officers on ground to better synergy, human intelligence, and targeting of the overground workers and ‘particular modules’. Last year, as per J&K Police official figures, 171 militants were killed in encounters and search and cordon operations in Kashmir. Now, January figures take the number of those eliminated in last 13 months to 184. Most of the militants were killed in gunfights in south Kashmir‘s Anantnag, Shopian, Pulwama and Kulgam, the districts which have seen uptick of young boys taking arms, especially after the killing of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani in 2016. Five years down the line, police officers keeping an eye on the militancy admit that local recruitment has come down owing to police pressure on OGW networks and recruiters. “We can’t deny the fact local boys are picking up guns, but the number has come down as compared to the previous years, especially 2018 and 2019,” said a police officer working in south Kashmir. Alone in Shopian, as per the police data, 33 youths joined militant ranks last year and many among them were killed months or weeks after joining the terror folds. “As many as 30 new recruits were killed within one month of their joining,” Kashmir IGP Vijay Kumar had said on his year-ender press briefing. Among those killed were top commanders of Jaish, Lashkar, Hizbul and The Resistant Front (TRF), besides over 20 foreign militants. Of 128 youths who joined militancy last year, 78 were killed within first year of joining the militancy and 16 were arrested during different operations. A senior police officer, who has served in both south and central Kashmir and actively participated in anti-militancy operations, said there was a proactive action by the government not only against active militants but also on the support network. “The support network usually provides the new recruits. But now, the new recruitment has gone down and that has resulted in a drop in number of local terrorists,” he added. The officer said that elimination of militants in back-to-back encounters has demoralised their supporters on the ground. “The choking of terror-financing channels has led to decrease in recruitment as logistics needed to sustain a certain figure of active terrorists aren’t available,” the officer said. The police data of 2021 revealed that at least 2,000 OGWs were arrested, many of whom, officers say, provided “fruitful information” to the agencies that resulted in successful operations. As per the figures, 192 terror incidents were reported last year as compared to 238 in 2020, which is more than a 20% decline. Even the number of civilians and security personnel killed in 2021 was 34 and 29, respectively, against the previous year’s 37 and 57, respectively. There has also been decline in new recruits joining militancy. Against 167 in 2020, last year saw 128 new recruits, 78 of whom joined Lashkar/TRF. IGP Kumar said there were 168 identified and categorised active militants in the Valley of whom, the locals and foreigners were almost equal in number. “About 85 are locals and 83 are foreigners, besides 25 who are hybrid,” he said, adding that 171 militants were killed in 2021, of whom 152 were locals and 19 foreigners. Hybrid terrorists pose a challenge: PolicePolice officials say that they now face a challenge from ‘hybrid terrorists’, whom they described as people who indulge in terror activities and kill people, but there is no record of theirs in police stations. Even parents and security agencies are unaware of them, they say. Officials privy to the information related to the security grid claim that less number of infiltration attempts on the LoC in earlier months had affected the ground situation. “The focus is to target JeM group, which has always been planning to carry out the bigger attacks. Recently, they attacked a police bus as well. Our primary focus is to eliminate the JeM militants. Through our intelligence-gathering system, we have been able to carry out operations in different areas. Our operations will continue to eliminate all militants, with special focus on JeM,” said a police officer overlooking operations in Srinagar city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/better-synergy-intel-behind-elimination-of-13-militants-in-kashmir-this-year-officials-101641943478099.html

12-01-2022||Delhi||Senior citizens with limited mobility to get booster jabs at home: Delhi govt||The Delhi government will administer at home Covid-19 booster shots to senior citizens and the differently abled with limited or restricted mobility, senior officials of the health department said on Tuesday.A senior health official said that if any eligible person above the age of 60 years is either bedridden because of illness or disability they will be administered the third precautionary dose at their homes.“It is unlikely that there will be many such persons who have already completed nine months after their second dose. Any bedridden 60-plus individual who by nature of his/her illness or disability is rendered eligible for the precautionary dose by their doctor shall be administered the dose at home,” the official said, asking not to be named.The official also added that while the Delhi government began at-home vaccinations for senior citizens and the differently abled last year itself, on the directions of the central government, they were unable to extend this service to as many people as they would have liked.In August 2021, the Delhi high court issued notices to the Centre and the Delhi government, based on a petition filed by an 84-year-old senior citizen who informed the court that she was unable to visit a vaccination centre to get her jabs as she was suffering from severe arthritis. The petition also pointed out that several senior and bedridden citizens, who were vulnerable to Covid-19, did not have private transport to reach a vaccination centre or even a family member to help them with the registration process.In September, the Centre issued directives to state governments to make arrangements to vaccinate “those with restricted mobility, who cannot step out of their house to get vaccinated, such as the differently abled, elderly or those with special needs” at their homes.A senior official of the east Delhi district said all district officials have been reaching out to senior citizens who have completed nine months since their second dose to come and get their precautionary shot. For all of those who are eligible under this category, but are unable to reach their nearest vaccination centre, a facility of at-home vaccination has been extended.“Apart from sending text messages to those senior citizens who have completed nine months since their second dose, we are also reaching out to the eligible people on phone and asking them whether they have the means to reach the vaccination centre. The vaccination process is taken care of by trained vaccinators, following the requisite standard operating procedures,” the district official said, asking not to be named.

The hospitalisation was more than 20% during the second wave from February to June 2021. The state has recorded nearly 4,500 cases in first 10 days of the January, while the active cases have reached 4,186.Himachal Pradesh has a total of 3,356 beds reserved for Covid patients across 42 dedicate Covid health centres in its 12 districts.Of these, only 59 were occupied as on January 10.There are 2,310 oxygen-supported beds of which 30 were occupied and 2,280 vacant. Of the 284 ICU beds, 28 were occupied and only one standard bed out of 762 was occupied. Given the fact that more than 98% patients are recuperating at home, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has directed the district health authorities to strengthen the home-isolation mechanism. The state government would also provide home-isolation kits to such patients. Further, he has directed to ramp up the transportation system so that home-isolated patients can be shifted to the nearest hospital at earliest if required.Positivity rate shoots above 6%Meanwhile, the positivity rate in the state has gone past 6% as on January 10.

While Kangra is the worst-hit district reporting more than 1,200 cases in the New Year, Hamirpur, Solan, Sirmaur, Shimla, Mandi and Bilaspur also have also registered cases in clusters.More curbs likelyMeanwhile, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has said that the state may consider imposing more restrictions if the cases continue to rise.“The situation is quite concerning and more curbs would likely be enforced not only in Himachal, but entire country,” said Thakur while interacting with media after inaugurating the new OPD building of IGMC, Shimla.He said currently, the state government has imposed fewer restrictions so the economic activities and development works can go on and people do not face any inconvenience.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called a meeting of all chief ministers on January 13 and the situation will be discussed after which we will decide the further course of action,” he added. For now, we urge people to follow the Covid norms strictly and help prevent the spread, the CM said. HPSSC postpones recruitment exams as Covid cases surge in HimachalIn the wake of rising Covid-19 cases in the state, the Himachal Pradesh Staff Selection Commission (HPSSC), Hamirpur, has postponed screening exams and skill tests for recruitment to various posts which were scheduled between January 11 and 24.

12-01-2022||Delhi||AAP accuses BJP-ruled MCDs of issuing showcause notice to traders despite proposed withdrawal of hiked taxes||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), on Tuesday, accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs) of issuing show cause notices to traders demanding lakhs of rupees, despite announcing the withdrawal of all hikes in fees proposed in April last year. Refuting the charges, the BJP said that the civic bodies are issuing notices for the recovery of commercial property taxes and the AAP is blowing it out of proportion to create confusion among the voters ahead of the civic polls, which are due in April this year. Senior AAP leader and MLA Atishi said that in the last 15 years, the BJP have onlypracticed corruption. “In April 2021, the three MCDs significantly hiked their tax rates. This included trade licence fees, factory licence fees, health licences, commercial property tax, rented property tax, vacant land tax which were hiked three to six times than normal. AAP raised its voice against this organised loot and ran a signature campaign. In June-July 2021, over five lakh traders from Delhi supported our stand. This resulted in the hike being rolled back on August 26. But, the East MCD has sent notices to several commercial properties, on the basis of the taxes which have been rolled back,” she said. She also said that it’s a mystery that under which law the MCDs are sending such baseless notices when the taxes have been rolled back. Refuting the allegations, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that it’s really surprising that AAP is creating an issue by opposing the notices sent for recovery of commercial property tax. “It’s strange that on one hand, the Delhi government is not releasing municipal funds, while AAP leaders often accuse MCDs for not recovering their revenue and on the other, when East MCD is trying to recover its property tax revenue, the same party is objecting to it, alleging corruption,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-accuses-bjp-ruled-mcds-of-issuing-showcause-notice-to-traders-despite-proposed-withdrawal-of-hiked-taxes-101641936517904.html
12-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi riots: Court exonerates six men accused of unlawful assembly and arson||A Delhi court on Tuesday gave a clean chit to six persons accused of rioting, unlawful assembly and arson in the Jyoti Nagar area during the northeast Delhi riots in February 2020, saying that there was no worthwhile material to frame charges against any of the accused persons.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat discharged Amir, Saddam, Mohammad Rahis, Amir, Akram and Wasim in the case of ransacking and burning of two tractors belonging to Shahid and Firoz Khan and some others at the parking lot, behind Ambedkar college, Kardam Puri, on February 25, 2020.The court said that the only incriminating material against the six accused persons was the disclosure statements made by them consequent to their arrest, adding that “disclosure statement, by itself, has no value in the eyes of law”.The judge said that there is no witness, whether public or police, who identified the accused persons while committing the offences. He also said that the Special Public Prosecutor for the police has also not put forth in his arguments any incriminating material/evidence against the accused persons.“Based upon the contents of the entire charge-sheet including the annexures, I am of the opinion that there is no worthwhile material at all to frame charges against any of the accused persons in respect of the offences covered in the present case. Thus, all the six accused persons Amir S/o Nafis; Amir S/o Abrar; Saddam; Mohd. Rahis; Akram and Wasim are discharged of all the offences punishable u/s 147 (rioting), 148, 427(damage), 436 (arson) read with Section 149 (unlawful assembly) Indian Penal Code,” the judge said in his six page order.Meanwhile, on December 7, a city court acquitted four men in a riot case, saying it feels “absolutely loath” to place any trust in the testimonies of two prosecution witnesses — a constable and a head constable — on the aspect of identification of rioters.In an order, which was made available late Monday night, additional sessions judge Virender Bhat acquitted Dinesh Yadav, Tinku, Sahil and Sandeep in a case related to robbing, vandalising and setting a house and shop on fire at the Bhagirathi Vihar area during the February 26, 2020, riots in the national capital. The case was registered against them on the basis of two complaints filed by Afzal Saifi and Shoaib.In his complaint, Saifi claimed that a riotous mob barged into his house, vandalised it, robbed articles, and set it on fire. Shoaib approached police with a similar complaint regarding theft at his shop, which was clubbed with Saifi’s complaint.“In view of the nature of evidence led by the prosecution, the identification of the accused as rioters who committed loot and arson in the house of PW­1 (Saifi) becomes intensely doubtful. This court feels absolutely loath to place any trust upon the testimony of PW­8 and PW­12 on the aspect of identification of the accused as rioters,” Bhat stated in his judgment.The judge said that their deposition “needed a detailed scrutiny” as they saw the accused participate in the riotous incidents.The judge said that the manner in which the two star witnesses — constable and a head constable — claimed to have identified the four accused as being amongst the rioters who looted and set Saifi’s house on fire “creates doubt in the mind of court”.“They claim that all the four accused were known to them and hence, they could identify them in the mob. Intriguingly, they did not inform either their senior officers or the IO (investigation officer) of this case about the fact that they knew some of the rioters who were involved in the rioting incidents in Bhagirathi Vihar on February 26 (2020),” the judge added.Communal riots had broken out in northeast Delhi in February 2020, claiming 53 lives and leaving over 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-court-exonerates-six-men-accused-of-unlawful-assembly-and-arson-101641935557174.html

12-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi reports 23 Covid deaths, highest in 208 days||With Covid-19 cases continuing to surge, the national capital on Tuesday recorded 23 deaths from the disease, the highest toll in 208 days, according to the government’s daily health bulletin. Delhi recorded 21,259 new Covid-19 infections on Tuesday, an increase from Monday’s tally of 19,166 new cases. The infection rate -- the number of samples returning positive from among the total tested -- has also spiked to a little above 25%, the data showed. However, it is important to note that on Tuesday, 82,884 tests were conducted across the city as opposed to just 76,670 tests on Monday. The city also recorded 23 deaths by Covid infections, which is the highest toll since June 16, 2021, when the Capital had reported 25 deaths. Experts, however, said because of the highly infectious nature of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, people whose immunity is already compromised by other ailments, including terminal diseases, were also testing positive of Covid-19 in hospitals. “The spike in deaths cannot solely be because of the virus; it is also because of the high transmissibility of this variant among the comorbid and the already compromised sections. Everyone is testing positive, including doctors and caregivers at hospitals, so this is a problem in the quality of care rather than the seriousness of the variant,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital. The test positivity rate on Tuesday touched 25.65%, just marginally up from the 25% reported the previous day. According to government records, this was the highest positivity rate in the city since May 6, when 26.3% of all samples returned positive results. Government data also showed that of the total 14,621 beds available in dedicated Covid hospitals, only 2,209 were occupied as on Tuesday, leaving 12,412 (84.89%) vacant. The numbers are heartening, said experts, as despite the surge in cases, only 2,209 were admitted to hospitals. Of them, 84 required ventilator support and 523 patients were admitted to ICUs (intensive care units), according to the health bulletin. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus, which is fuelling the current wave of infections in the city, while being more transmissible than previous variants, is mostly causing mild infections, thereby lowering hospitalisations, according to trends observed in India and elsewhere, medical experts said. Most patients have only mild symptoms, and are able to recover at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-reports-23-covid-deaths-highest-in-208-days-101641933279334.html
12-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi high court slams parallel talks in Metro case||The Delhi high court on Tuesday pulled up Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited (DAMEPL) for carrying out a “parallel settlement discussions” with Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) relating to execution of the more than ₹4,600 crore arbitral award, and said that the former was playing hide and seek with the court.Justice Suresh Kait said DAMEPL, a subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure, has not approached the court with “clean hands” while asking its counsel not to waste precious judicial time, if the company intended to settle the matter outside the court.“Since the petitioner’s (DAMEPL) counsel is making submission before the court and simultaneously communicating with the judgment debtor (DMRC) to settle the dispute in this manner... In this fashion the decree holder is not coming to court with clean hands. Therefore, re-notify on March 29,” the court said while adjourning DAMEPL’s plea seeking execution of the multi-crore arbitral award it had won against DMRC.The court also observed that DAMEPL was not fair to the court despite having won the arbitral award. The judge noted that pursuant to its December 22, 2021 order, DMRC has filed an affidavit furnishing the details of its bank accounts along with the balance amount.The court was hearing an application by the Reliance Infrastructure’s subsidiary which was filed in the ongoing proceedings before the high court, claiming that DMRC was deliberately trying to delay the execution of the over ₹4,600 crore arbitral award against it.On Tuesday, senior advocate Parag Tripathi, for DMRC, submitted that it was ready to take over the liabilities of Reliance Infrastructure subsidiary to the extent of the award money as it would be in a better position to negotiate with the lender banks, however, the offer was turned down by DAMEPL.He informed the court that on December 30, 2021, DAMEPL had written a letter to DMRC, asking if it was ready to take over its debt which was to be paid by DAMEPL and Reliance Infrastructure to their lenders. DMRC responded to the letter saying that DAMEPL should first disclose the full amount of its liabilities, he submitted.To this, Justice Kait said DAMEPL was taking a different stand in the court while it was writing letters to DMRC to settle the dispute.“If you are settling the dispute outside the court, why are you wasting the court’s time? Don’t communicate with them when the matter is before the court. If you want to, then withdraw the case. I will throw out your case,” the judge said.Appearing for DAMEPL, advocate Prateek Seksaria, argued that the company was exercising its legal right in the court by seeking execution of the decree passed in its favour and claimed that DMRC was not disclosing the whole issue.“DMRC was calling and holding meetings with my lenders on outstanding loans to banks in my absence. You cannot meet my lenders behind my back. If you want to meet them then take over my entire liabilities and have meetings with the lenders. If we arrive at a settlement, we will inform the court. I was against the move because they met my lenders without informing me so I wrote a letter to DMRC,” he contended.The counsel also said that the offer given by DMRC was not acceptable and DAMEPL does not want to settle the dispute in this fashion.The matter will now be heard in March. DAMEPL and DMRC are locking horns in the former’s execution plea for the arbitral award won by it against the corporation.The consortium of Reliance Energy Limited (renamed as Reliance Infrastructure Limited) and M/s Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles, SA terminated the Concession Agreement in October 2012 citing failure of DMRC to cure defects in the structure supporting the Airport Metro Express Line. DMRC invoked the arbitration clause of its contract with the consortium.The concession agreement between the two was signed on August 25, 2008. Under the agreement, DMRC was to carry out the civil works, excluding at the depot, and the balance, including the project system works, were to be executed by DAMEPL, a joint venture of Rinfra and a Spanish construction company -- Construcciones Y Auxiliar De Ferrocarriles -- with a shareholding of 95 and five per cent respectively.In 2017, the Arbitral Tribunal awarded damages to Reliance Infra, an award upheld by a single-judge bench of the Delhi high court in 2018. A division bench of the same court set aside the award in 2019 after which Reliance Infra approached the top court.In September this year, the apex court set aside the division bench’s judgment of January 15, 2019 order and upheld the arbitral award in favour of DAMEPL, saying that there was a disturbing tendency of courts setting aside arbitral awards.In November, the Supreme Court had dismissed DMRC’s plea seeking a review of its judgment which upheld the 2017 arbitration award in favour of DAMEPL, enforceable against it. The apex court on September 9 had upheld the arbitration award enforceable against DMRC.The DMRC had stated that since the corporation was facing a “financial crunch”, undertaking a “sudden liability” would impact public interest and authorities were, therefore, working out a solution. It had also claimed that the amount liable to be paid was approximately ₹5,000 crore which was lesser than DAMEPL’s claim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-slams-parallel-talks-in-metro-case-101641933037158.html
12-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi riots: HC tells cops to identify errant officials in national anthem case||The Delhi high court on Tuesday pulled up the city police over delay in identifying the police officials who allegedly assaulted five Muslim men and forced them to sing the National Anthem during the north-east Delhi riots in February 2020.Justice Mukta Gupta, hearing a plea by the mother of one of the victims, Faizan, seeking a Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe into the death of her son, said why the errant persons have not been apprehended even after two years of the incident.The court also asked the police as to whether it had checked the records of the police officials who were deployed on duty on February 25, 2020 when the incident took place in Bhajanpura. According to the plea by Kismatun, Faizan’s mother, filed through advocate Soutik Banerjee, the police illegally detained her son on February 25, and denied him critical health care, resulting in his death on February 26. She alleged in the petition that her son was mercilessly beaten by the police on February 24, which is evident from a viral video of the incident.When the former investigating officer, who was present in the hearing, said there were thousands of police officials who were deployed during the riots, the court said, “Let’s take the number to be 20,000. Out of this 20,000 force, everyone’s height, weight and structures are different. If you segregate on that basis, there would be around 5000..How much time does it take?The officer said that the video was shot from a distance, and the face of the police personnel has not been identified. He said cyber experts have been contacted to enhance the video quality and identify the errant officials.The investigator also told the court that they have identified a constable, Ravindra, from whose phone the video was obtained. He informed the court that Ravindra has been interrogated several times during which he has denied shooting the video.The investigator, who has now been transferred from the crime branch, said following this, a lie detector test was conducted on the constable, the result of which came out to be “deceptive”. He also said that the video has been sent to the forensic laboratory, and efforts were on to identify the persons. He said that the video has been sent to all the police stations across the city to identify the police officials but no breakthrough has been achieved.When advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for Faizan, told the court that the police have not even preserved the CCTV footage and the records at the Jyoti Nagar police station, the investigator said the CCTV cameras inside the police station were not working since February 24, the date of the incident.The court also said that it wants all the answers in a fresh status report while adding that there can be no log books or records of the relevant time since it was a complete mess during the riots, and which is why it is seeking the scientific results.During the proceedings, advocate Mehmood Pracha, who filed an intervention plea on behalf of one of the victims of the incident, told the court that even after two years, the statement of his client has not been recorded.“You are going to identify the constable. You have victims who are alive. You can’t get the sketches made from them?,” the court said, adding “I hope that you will record the statement of the witnesses”.Special Public Prosecutor Amit Mahajan for the Delhi police told the court that they had recorded the statement of the witnesses and it would be produced before the court on the next date of hearing. He sought more time to file the status report. The court asked the police to file the status report with all the answers under the signature of Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Rajesh Deo, and posted the matter for hearing on February 22.
12-01-2022||Chandigarh||At 100, Punjab’s oldest ex-MLA Sahi Ram wants electors to choose educated, clean faces||On the eve of his 100th birth anniversary, Sahi Ram Bishnoi, the oldest former MLA of joint Punjab, wants the electors to vote for educated and clean candidates in the forthcoming state elections. Bishnoi was elected from the Abohar assembly segment in 1957, the second state election after the Independence. According to an archive of the Election Commission of India, Bishnoi had defeated Congress’s heavyweight Chandi Ram by 2,646 votes. He was elected on the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the forerunner of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), from the Hindi-speaking belt of the present Punjab. He now identifies himself as a ‘proud sewak’ of Bishnois, and not a Jana Sangh leader. Bishnoi leaders from Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan will assemble on Wednesday to celebrate the centenary birthday of their leader by partaking of his favourite ‘gajar ka halwa’. In a video phone interview with this reporter from his village at Sakta Khera in Sirsa district, Bishnoi, a law graduate from Lahore and Shimla, said the deteriorating political morality made him choose social activities over politics. “The younger generation is more mature and aware and they have a duty to elect the upright candidates. Similarly, the conduct of the elected representatives should be pro-people and they should maintain high levels of morality in the public life,” said Sahi Ram, who was assisted for a video call conversation by family friend Puran Bhanerwa, a journalist-based in Dabwali town. Born on January 12, 1922, at Bahawal Nagar in the erstwhile princely state of Bahawalpur (now in Pakistan) Bishnoi completed his studies at the village school before joining DM College in Moga in 1942. “I was a law student in Lahore when the Partition took place in 1947. After large-scale violence, I led a large group of family, relatives and residents of several villages around my native place Kumbhana for a safer place in India. We managed to enter from Rajasthan’s Karanpur with one casualty in communal riots. Later, I assisted the community settling in and around Sirsa,” he recalled. Being the most educated youth, who worked to help the displaced community in reclaiming land and property rights, Bishnois encouraged him to contest from Abohar in 1952. But he lost the first polls. “People contributed more than ₹5,000 for my electioneering to contest against the Congress candidate Chandi Ram. Bishnois wanted to register their electoral annoyance with then Prime Minister Pt Jawahar Lal Nehru for the Partition that led to the displacement of millions,” he said. Bishnoi said former deputy prime minister late Devi Lal, then a Congress activist had advised him to contest on a Jana Sangh ticket in 1957.He recalled how austere the electioneering used to be. “The electioneering used to be funded voluntarily by villagers. No big rallies were held as candidates would address residents of 5-6 villages at one place. In the Vidhan Sabha, too, members from the opposition were courteous to each other,” he recalled while battling fading memory. “I had strong political differences with Devi Lal but he earned respect for being an honest politician. He was 7-8 years elder to me and always guided me on key social and political issues,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/at-100-punjab-s-oldest-ex-mla-sahi-ram-wants-electors-to-choose-educated-clean-faces-101641932377290.html

12-01-2022||Chandigarh||BJP accuses Congress of bungling funds under garb of Punjab Nirman scheme||The Ludhiana unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accused the Congress of committing fraud in the name of Punjab Nirman scheme, which is aimed at helping the poor and backward to repair their houses.Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, BJP leader Anil Sareen alleged that in North constituency, cheques of the scheme went straight into the pockets of Congress leaders and workers.“Under the scheme, ₹15 crore was allocated to each MLA for distribution among schedule caste, backward class and economically disadvantaged families for repair of their houses. Each family was to be given ₹10,000 to 35,000 under the scheme,” said Sareen.“The list of beneficiaries was prepared by Congress leaders in violation of all guidelines, and funds were given to Congress workers or their relatives. The list was passed by the Ludhiana municipal corporation following which the cheques were distributed,” he added. The BJP leader further claimed that on checking in North constituency, he found that ₹5 crore was disbursed to 2,200 people, without following the set criteria.”“As per the criteria, only one member of a family was eligible to receive the fund. But on close scrutiny, it was found that in some cases, each member of the family was shown as a beneficiary,” alleged Sareen. “It has also come to my notice that some people from Philluar where given cheques, even though it does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Ludhiana municipal corporation. We demand a case against Congress leaders, workers and officials of the municipal corporation who passed the cheques, and a thorough probe in the matter,” said Sareen.Refuting the BJP’s claims, former minister and Congress MLA Rakesh Panday said, “The allegations are baseless.

The accused came to India on a business visa in 2019, police said, adding that the CCB was on the lookout for an associate of the arrested man. According to police, 900 gm of cocaine, 50 gm of MDMA crystals, 580 gm of sodium hydroxide crystals, worth ₹50 lakh have been recovered from Richards’ possession.“He procured raw material from Mumbai, Delhi and foreign countries.

We are questioning him further to understand how he learnt to make the drugs,” said a senior CCB official, requesting anonymity. On August 17, last year, the CCB had raided a drug manufacturing unit in Bengaluru and four kg of MDMA, a psychoactive drug worth approximately ₹2 crore was seized.As per police data, in 2021, Bengaluru police arrested 5,644 drug peddlers in 4,275 cases and seized around ₹59 crore worth of drugs.

Pant said that during the last two years, there was an emphasis on cracking down on the drug rackets in the city. “All DCPs were asked to give special focus on the drug cases. We were constantly in touch with other departments and central agencies to track interstate peddlers. If you look at the numbers, you will see that we have caught more peddlers selling synthetic drugs. This drive will continue,” said Pant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/foreign-national-arrested-for-making-drugs-at-karnataka-home-police-101641931482901.html

The members of the hotel and restaurant association said the sector has already been struggling to make ends meet due to lockdown restrictions imposed in the last two years and this has come as another blow to the industry.The owners of banquet halls and palaces said the residents are cancelling the Lohri events, as these events are mostly held at night with residents lighting up bonfire. But due to imposition of night curfew, the units have to be closed by 10pm and it is very difficult to wrap up the celebrations by that time even as the events are allowed with 50 percent gathering.Former Hotel and Restaurant Association president owner of Nagpal Regency, Manjit Singh Nagpal said, “ A few have changed the timings to organise the event during the day. But gatherings have been restricted, which is again a loss for the sector. The owners are struggling to pay bank loan installments, salaries, and power bills, while the customers are asking for refunds of advance payments. The sector is in a very tight situation.”  Paramjeet Singh, a resident of BRS Nagar, who had booked a palace at Pakhowal for first Lohri celebration of his grandson on January 7, said, “We were all set for celebrations and invitations were also sent to friends and family but we had to cancel the celebrations at the last moment due to imposition of night curfew. It is not possible to finish the celebrations by 10pm and also fear has been inculcated in the minds of people amid rising cases of virus. The government should atleast inform the public about the restriction in advance so hat everyone could plan accordingly, otherwise it results in losses and harassment.”Citing the rising cases of Covid-19, the sector is further staring at more losses with the wedding season beginning from January 15.President of Hotel and Restaurant Association, Punjab, Amarvir Singh said apart from the losses suffered in context to Lohri celebrations, the sector is staring at losses during the wedding season which starts from January 15. It is suspected that the restrictions will be extended by the administration and the customers have already started calling to postpone the events or restrict the gatherings. “The sector is moving through a rough patch. Even as gatherings are allowed at 50 percent capacity, people are not showing up for holding events,” said Amarvir Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-curbs-set-to-dampen-lohri-spirits-for-ludhiana-s-hospitality-sector-yet-again-101641931481627.html
12-01-2022||Chandigarh||Gurcharan Tohra’s grandson Kanwarveer Singh joins BJP||Akali stalwart late Gurcharan Singh Tohra’s grandson Kanwarveer Singh joined the BJP in New Delhi on Tuesday. The Shiromani Akali Dal has fielded no one from the Tohra family for the upcoming state polls. Though Kanwarveer’s mother Kuldeep Kaur and father (former minister) Harmail Singh, both SAD leaders, are yet to clear their stand, the family is toiling hard for a stable political footing. No one from the family has won an election since the 2002 state polls. This is not for the first time that a member of the Tohra family parted ways with the SAD. In 2016, Tohra’s daughter Kuldeep Kaur, her husband Harmel Singh and elder son Harinderpal Singh, had joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Kuldeep Kaur, currently a Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) member, had contested on AAP ticket from the Sanour in 2017 but lost to SAD’s Harinderpal Singh Chandumajra by 20,818 votes. Also, she had unsuccessfully contested the 2012 assembly polls as a SAD nominee. The trio rejoined the SAD before the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. For 2022 state polls, the family was expecting ticket from Patiala (Rural) assembly segment but the SAD declared Jaspal Singh Bittu Chatha as its candidate. “It is my personal decision. I am mature enough to decide my political course. I have joined the BJP due to its ideology and decision making,” said Kanwarveer, who got married recently. Meanwhile, his elder brother Harinderpal said his brother informed the family about his decision. “It was a political compulsion for him as Kanwarveer told us that the Akali Dal has not kept its word and ignored the (Tohra) family,” he said. Kanwarveer’s father Harmel Singh and mother Kuldeep Kaur said the family will decide the further course of action after discussion with other members. Harmail won as a SAD candidate from the Dakala constituency (now Sanour) in 1997 and was public works department minister.

While a senior officer said four people have been arrested so far in the case, police have not yet released any details about them as they suspect involvement of more individuals.Police said the main accused in the case is the owner of a travel agency, who took the help of three others for scamming vehicle owners and selling stolen cars. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) North Division, Vinayak Patil, said the thefts began in March last year and the accused would offer up to ₹18,000 for each car as rent, which they paid for the first few months. “Once they convinced enough car owners, they began selling cars with a dealer in Andhra Pradesh and eventually closed their agency in October 2021,” said the officer. The incident came to light in November last year when a case was registered, police said. A special team was formed to investigate the case, which was able to track the suspects and recovered 67 cars, the DCP said. Among the 67 recovered vehicles, there were 12 Toyota Innova Crysta, five Toyota Innova, 10 Toyota Etios, 23 Maruti Suzuki Swift Dzire, four Mahindra Verito, one Tata Indigo, nine Hyundai Xcent, one Honda Amaze, one Mahindra Xylo and one Ford Figo. “Documents of all the cars were forged and they were sold in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. There are more cars that are to be recovered and the process is ongoing,” Patil added. There has been a spike in cases of thefts of automobiles in Bengaluru over the last six-eight months. According to the data released by the Bengaluru police, there were 4,126 motor vehicle thefts last year, of which only 915 were traced. The vehicle theft in 2020 was 3,797, of which 1,308 were detected, police data suggests.In November last year, a Bengaluru police constable and his three associates were arrested for stealing two-wheelers in the city. The accused constable has been identified as Honnappa Duradappa Malagi, who is attached with Vidyaranyapura police station. He had recruited the associates for the crime, two of them were minors. The minors were working at a two-wheeler service station in Vidyaranyapura, police said.The two minors allegedly stole vehicles from Nandini Layout, Vijayanagar, Gangamma Circle, Peenya, and other areas. After stealing the vehicles, they rode bikes to Vidyaranyapura’s residence and replaced defective parts. The constable used online advertising platforms to find details of bikes on sale. They then replaced the number plates and sold them in the districts in north Karnataka, police said. A complaint has been filed in this matter on October 29, when a bike was stolen from outside of a businessman’s house in Rajajinagar Industrial Town. Sanjeev M Patil, DCP (west) formed a special team to investigate the matter after which they learnt the role of a constable. 
12-01-2022||Delhi||Ensure extra care to Covid patients with comorbidities: Delhi govt||The Delhi government on Tuesday issued an advisory asking all government and private Covid-19 hospitals to ensure that all patients with co-morbidities are duly attended to by specialists and extra care is ensured in their care.In the advisory, the government said that the Capital has witnessed an uptick in Covid-19 deaths, with over 70 fatalities being reported between the last week of December and January 10. The advisory noted, “...most of the deceased patients suffered from comorbidities such as cancer, heart and liver diseases.“It may be ensured that all Covid-positive patients admitted with various comorbidities or the patients admitted with other serious diseases who turn out to be Covid-positive are duly attended by concerned specialists and due attention is to be given to the patients,” the advisory said.Delhi recorded 21,259 fresh Covid cases on Tuesday, taking the active caseload to 74,881. The health bulletin also reported 23 deaths, pushing the Capital’s cumulative toll to 25,200.Data released by the Delhi government on Monday showed that of the patients who died due to Covid-19 in the city between January 5 and 9, 35 out of 46, or 76%, were unvaccinated, and 21, or almost half, were admitted for other reasons before they were detected as infected with coronavirus.In all, 34 of the 46 patients who died had comorbid conditions known to raise the risk of severe Covid-19, and 23 – or 50% -- of all deaths were recorded within a day of the patients being admitted, suggesting their condition was already critical when they received medical attention.The number of deaths classified as Covid fatalities has been rising over the last few days in Delhi. On Sunday, Delhi reported 17 Covid deaths—the highest since June 16. There were 17 deaths on Monday as well. On Tuesday, the count went up to 23.“Medical directors/medical superintendents of all hospitals are directed to issue necessary directions to all concerned to put in place prompt and appropriate systems in their hospital to ensure compliance of timely management of hospital admissions as per protocol, proper treatment protocol, satisfactory levels of patient care and analysis of Covid-19 deaths,” the advisory said.A senior official of the Delhi government’s health department said that while the Omicron variant of coronavirus is largely leading to milder symptoms, that last for a shorter duration than symptoms caused by other variants, senior citizens and patients with comorbid conditions are still at high risk.“We still need more analysis of the reasons behind the spike in deaths due to Covid-19 over the last two-three days, but what we currently know is that these patients belonged to the high-risk category. This is why we have issued these special directions to put special focus on the care of comorbid patients,” the official said, requesting anonymity.Health experts also said that while infection from the Omicron variant might not cause deaths per se, but people older population, with conditions such as diabetes, heart conditions and liver and kidney problems, are more vulnerable to the virus.“The virus has not created comorbidities, but India has a large share of a vulnerable elderly population, and also a generally high anaemic population, along with poor health-seeking behaviour. The combination of the three issues gives us a population that is vulnerable to collapse the moment they are infected. The death rate, vis-a-vis the infections, is still a small share,” said Dr GS Grewal, president of the Delhi Medical Association.

12-01-2022||Chandigarh||Covid curbs: Ludhiana gym owners seek reopening of gyms at 50% capacity||Gym owners raked state government over the coals for their decision to order a complete shutdown of gyms amid rising cases of Covid-19, and submitted a memorandum with deputy commissioner’s (DC) office on Tuesday seeking reopening of gyms. Giving reference of the relief orders issued by administration in Bathinda and Sri Muktsar Sahib to open gyms at 50 percent capacity, the representatives of the fitness sector under the banner of Gym Ekta Welfare Association, demanded the same.Ruing losses, the owners termed the decision taken by the government ‘unfair’ and ‘irrational’ as all other sectors have been allowed to operate with 50 percent capacity. They said they were not even able to recover from the losses suffered due to lockdown in the past and this decision will further bring many gyms on the verge of closure again. As per the orders issued by the state government on January 4, gyms in the state (except those being used by sports persons participating in international, and national-level contests) will remain closed till January 15. However, bars, cinema halls, malls, restaurants were allowed to operate at 50 percent capacity.General secretary of Punjab Gym Welfare Society Pardeep Appu said, “Surprisingly, the fitness industry is being targeted for improving the health of the residents. How will we be able to pay the rent, power bills and salaries for the staff. If gyms can be opened in Bathinda and Sri Muktsar Sahib, then why not in Ludhiana. We will take all the precautions.”“We are not able to understand why gyms have been closed and no restrictions have been imposed on holding political rallies wherein thousands of people gather. Many gym owners will be forced to shut down their units permanently if no relief is provided. Last year too, a few gym owners were forced to commit suicide due to financial constraints,” saidAppu.The gym owners also announced to launch an agitation if no relief is provided to them in the coming two days. The sector had also launched an agitation last year as the gyms remained closed for around five months due to Covid restrictions imposed by the government. “We have been struggling to make ends meet and if the government does not pay heed to our problem, we will be forced to move on roads. Thousands of families are dependent on the sector and closure of gyms will also lead to unemployment. With the imposition of Model Code of Conduct, DC has the power and we appeal him to save the sector,” said Ramesh Bangar, director of Gym Ekta Welfare Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-curbs-ludhiana-gym-owners-seek-reopening-of-gyms-at-50-capacity-101641930938210.html
12-01-2022||Delhi||Dense fog spell delays early flights||Delhi recorded its second “dense fog” spell of the season on Tuesday, with visibility dropping down to about 50 metres at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) 5am onwards, delaying over 50 flights until 9am but not resulting in any cancellations.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said rain over the weekend brought sufficient moisture to Delhi, which may lead to spells of moderate to dense fog in the coming days as well.RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said the Palam observatory recorded a visibility of 50 metres between 5am and 7am; it improved marginally to around 100 metres at 8.30am before getting better 9,30am onwards. “This is the first time this winter season that CAT-III procedures for low visibility were initiated at the Delhi airport, for which readings at Palam observatory are considered. In comparison, Safdarjung station reported moderate fog,” he said.Delhi last reported about one hour of dense fog on December 29.IMD classifies fog to be “dense” when visibility drops below 200 metres, while it is classified as “very dense” when it drops below 50 metres. A visibility between 200 and 500 metres is “moderate” while between 500 and 1000 metres is classified as “shallow” fog. Jenamani said there was high probability of Delhi recording dense fog in the next two days.“The entire northern plains are now seeing moderate to dense fog. This is the first prolonged spell for Delhi,” Jenamani said.An airport official said while no cancellations or diversions were reported on account of fog, several flights were delayed in the morning. “Despite low visibility procedures being initiated, operations were still smooth at the airport,” h he said.Delhi has also seen a sharp drop in the minimum temperature over the last 48 hours, with colder winds now blowing towards the Capital from snow-clad mountains, where fresh snowfall was reported over the weekend. On Tuesday, Delhi’s minimum temperature was recorded at 6.5 degrees Celsius – one degree below normal and a drop of nearly 3 degrees from Monday’s minimum of 9.6 degrees.An IMD forecast said the minimum to remain between 6-8 degrees Celsius till the end of this week, while Delhi’s maximum, which was recorded at 18.3 degrees on Tuesday, could hover between 18-20 degrees.Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) spiked in the last 24 hours, deteriorating to the “poor” category with a reading of 224, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4pm bulletin. It was 151 (moderate) on Monday.Agencies have forecast that the air quality may worsen in the next three days, on account of low wind speed. “Delhi’s air quality will remain ‘poor’ for the next three days, but from January 15, an improvement is expected due to wind speeds picking up, leading to strong ventilation near the surface,” said the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dense-fog-spell-delays-early-flights-101641930368853.html

12-01-2022||Delhi||Marital rape: All women have the right to say ‘no’||Every woman, married or unmarried, has a right to say “no”, and the fact that a married woman has other civil and criminal remedies does not mean marital rape should not to be taken seriously, the Delhi high court on Tuesday observed.A bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar, while hearing a clutch of petitions to criminalise marital rape, questioned how the dignity of a married woman is different from that of an unmarried woman.“Why is it different for a unmarried woman? How does it affects an unmarried woman’s dignity, but not a married woman’s dignity? Whether she is married or not, she has a right to say ‘no’. Have 50 other countries (where marital rape is a criminal offence) got it wrong? I find it difficult to appreciate when you are saying that there are other remedies and hence, there is no violation of Article 21 (right to life and liberty). The question is whether it is an offence or not, and whether this offence is tenable under our Constitution,” justice Shakdher, speaking for the bench, observed.The judge added that the exception in the rape law (Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code) creates a “firewall” from making marital rape an offence, and it has to be tested on the anvil of Article 14 (right to equality) and Article 21 of the Constitution.An exception clause in Section 375 in the IPC decriminalises marital rape, and mandates that sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age, is not rape.“A woman remains a woman. You can show us the section, but jurisdiction after jurisdictions, it has been held that merely because you are married, it is not a good enough to say that it is not an offence,” remarked the bench as it questioned the submissions by the Delhi government counsel Nandita Rao.Rao argued that since a married woman has the remedies of lodging a complaint for domestic violence, grievous hurt, or get divorced on the grounds of cruelty, there would be no violation of her rights under Article 21 of the Constitution.On Monday, the bench observed that even though there can be no compromise on the bodily autonomy of a woman, marital rape may not be treated as a prosecutable offence because of the qualitative difference between a marital and non-marital relationship. The court was hearing PILs by NGOs RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association, and two individuals, who have sought removal of the exception to Section 375, saying that it discriminated against married women who were sexually assaulted by their husbands.The central government, in its affidavit filed in 2018, maintained that marital rape cannot be made a criminal offence as it could become a phenomenon that may destabilise the institution of marriage and an easy tool for harassing the husband.Last week, the city government said that courts do not have the power to create a new offence even as it argued that marital rape is treated as a “crime of cruelty” in India.On Tuesday, Rao argued, “There is no dispute that a woman has the right to bodily integrity; she has a right to say no. Just because this is not a criminal offence under Sections 375, does that create a compulsion on a woman to have sex with her husband? The answer is no. She has a remedy to have divorce on the ground of cruelty. This is under Hindu and Muslim law. She also has a right to register a criminal case under Section 498A (cruelty)of IPC. As of today, FIRs have been registered by the spouses under sections 377 (carnal intercourse), 498A and 326 (grievous hurt) of IPC.”To this, the court asked what is the remedy available to a woman in case her husband forces himself on her, despite her refusing to have sexual intercourse. “You are saying that she can go and seek divorce on the ground that she doesn’t want to cohabitate. That is not the point. The point is an offence has taken place. The exception created a firewall. Is that firewall justifiable on the test of Article 14 and 21? It is only that particular narrow aspect that we have look into,” justice Shakdher said.Rao said the existence of the exception to Section 375 does not take away a woman’s right to say “no” in a marriage, and stressed that the sections applied in case of a married woman are different to those applicable in case of an unmarried woman.The court will continue to hear the matter on Wednesday.

The suspects were identified as Zubair Azad, 21, Rashid, 19, and Kalim,20, all residents of Palwal in Haryana. Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP) Noida, said on January 9, the manager of a public sector bank filed a complaint at the Sector 20 police station that money was fraudulently withdrawn from one of their ATMs. “The manager informed us that some suspects had manipulated the ATM in Noida’s Sector 31 and withdrawn ₹6 lakh in multiple transactions,” he said. A case was registered against unknown persons the same day under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code. The police said they launched an investigation into the matter. “We scanned the CCTV footage from the ATM and identified the suspects. The police team was deployed near the same ATM to arrest the suspects in case they returned. On Wednesday, around 11.15pm, the three suspects reached the ATM in a Maruti Swift Dzire and the police arrested them,” he said. The police seized the car, ₹21,000 cash, three mobile phones and two debit cards from them. During interrogation, the suspects revealed that they used to visit the ATM and often withdraw cash. “When the machine dispensed the cash, the suspects would grab the cash and push a few notes back into the machine. Once the notes went inside, the machine’s system showed a failed transaction. In such circumstances, the amount is not deducted from the holders’ account,” police said. These suspects used this trick to manipulate the machine and fraudulently withdraw cash. Two suspects used to enter the ATM kiosk while the third stood guard and alerted them in case anyone was approaching. The suspects have been involved in these fraudulent activities for the past six months, police said. The three men were produced before the court and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/three-arrested-for-involvement-in-atm-fraud-in-noida-sent-to-judicial-custody-101641930216799.html

A decision has been taken to authorise the deputy commissioners of respective districts to take a call on closing schools based on the number of cases, reports from the BEOs and health officers,” read a communication from the chief minister’s office (CMO).The decision came following a high-level meeting convened by the chief minister to review the pandemic situation in the state with senior government officials and members of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Covid-19. The meeting was held virtually, which the CM attended from a personal residence in RT Nagar, a day after he tested positive for coronavirus.Karnataka on Tuesday registered 14,473 new Covid-19 cases, with Bengaluru accounting for 10,800 new infections, the health department said in its bulletin.

12-01-2022||Delhi||No new taxes next fiscal, say Delhi municipal corporations||The standing committees of the three BJP-ruled municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs) have made it clear that no new taxes proposed in the budgets by respective civic commissioners will be imposed in the next financial year. Though the BJP justified it as a pro-public move during the times of pandemic, the Opposition AAP took pot shots saying it is the “BJP’s farewell gesture” in the poll year. The municipal corporations are due to go to the polls in April this year. Col (retired) BK Oberoi, the chairman of the standing committee of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), said before giving the final shape to the budget on January 18, they were holding consultations with the ward members and general public. “We can’t burden our residents with new taxes, particularly during the ongoing pandemic. In fact, we are discussing how we can reduce the existing tax rate to give them relief,” he said. According to the SDMC sources, the standing committee is likely to continue with the recommendations of the third municipal valuation committee (MVC), which had asked to implement partial rollback of the property tax hike that was enforced in last financial year. “Besides, the education cess, which is presently being charged on the basis of the ratable value of the property, will now be taken like the income tax. All the recommendations of hike in property tax, made by the SDMC commissioner in his budget speech, are also expected to be rejected. Not only that, the standing committee may also suggest reducing the property tax,” said a senior SDMC official, who asked not to be named. Jogiram Jain, chairman of the standing committee of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, also said that no new tax will be imposed this year. “The fact is that we can’t compensate our dues on the Delhi government, by putting tax burden on our residents. Our main focus will be on generating money from internal resources. No new tax will be levied this year,” he said. Shyam Sunder Agarwal, the mayor of East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), said instead of imposing new taxes or recommending hike in the current rates, the EDMC will encourage its residents for one time settlement, with waiver from penalty and interest. “We can’t pressure our residents during the ongoing pandemic situation. The need of the hour is to provide them relief,” he said. The principal opposition Aam Aadmi Party, however, termed the assurances by the three corporations as too little, too late, and it was the last ditch bid by the BJP to hold on to power. AAP leader and party’s MCD in-charge, Durgesh Pathak, also said that the BJP leaders in the fund-starved MCDs are promising moon to the voters. “After five years of failure on all fronts, they want to woo them with false promises. Have they returned the extra education cess charged from the residents? The voters have already made up their minds, and this budget will be the farewell budget of the BJP,” he said.Senior Congress leader and Andrews Ganj councillor, Abhishek Dutt, said the decision of not imposing any new tax will not do any magic to the BJP’s prospects in the municipal elections. “They (the BJP leaders) know that their budget recommendations for the fiscal 2022-23 will prove a mere folly in just two months as the elections will be held in the second month of budget coming into effect,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-new-taxes-next-fiscal-say-delhi-municipal-corporations-101641930037979.html
12-01-2022||Chandigarh||Rule to associate independent witness in drug seizure cases not absolute: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has said that in ‘chance recovery’ cases, prosecution cases do not get vitiated merely because of the fact that an independent witness was not present at the time of the seizure. “There is no hard and fast rule that an independent witness is required to be associated in every case. It is a rule of prudence only and not an absolute rule that the recovery must be witnessed by an independent person,” the high court bench of justice Gurvinder Singh Gill said, dismissing a bunch of bail and suspension of sentence petitions based on argument that police didn’t rope in independent witnesses and a gazetted officer during the seizure. The court further added that in ‘chance recovery’ cases, the contentions of not effecting recovery by a gazetted officer or a magistrate will not hold ground. Such seizures cannot be said to be a case of recovery pursuant to personal search of the accused, it added. In one case, the FIR was registered on seizure from two persons coming on a motorcycle, who upon noticing the police party tried to take a U-turn. In the process, they slipped and a plastic bag kept between them fell off, from which the police recovered drugs. The police in this case had failed to effect seizure in the presence of a gazetted officer and independent witness could also not be associated. In the second case, a person booked in 2016 in a drugs case was awarded 10 years imprisonment and had sought suspension of the sentence. In this case, too, no independent witness joined the probe. “The testimonies of official witnesses, who effected the recovery and conducted investigation in discharge of their official duties, cannot be doubted merely on account of non-joining of independent witness,” the bench recorded. In the third case, registered in SBS Nagar in June 2021, the police had booked a person for possessing drugs. As per the police, he, upon noticing a police party, threw away a packet he was carrying. The packet, when examined, contained drugs. In this case, too, no independent witness was associated with the probe and a gazetted officer also did not conduct the search. The prosecution had claimed that it was a case of “chance recovery” from an envelope thrown by the accused and there is no question of compliance of provisions of Section 50 of the Act or for association of any independent witness. The person was booked in a drugs seizure case earlier too. The court in this too denied bail, observing that he cannot be given relief merely because of the fact that seizure was not made in the presence of a gazetted officer and an independent witness did not join the police.

It is for the second time in 23 days that robbery has been committed at a religious place in Ludhiana. The FIR has been lodged on the statement of Lekh Raj of Mundian Kalan, who is a follower of Dera Bhuri Wale Sant Ashram in Raqba village.Lekh Raj said he was present in the Dera when the accused, wearing police uniforms, barged in after scaling the compound wall.The accused claimed that they are cops and had information about presence of weapons in the dera, so they wanted to carry out a search.Lekh Raj said he found the men suspicious and raised the alarm, following which the latter thrashed him and locked him up in a room.The accused then ransacked other rooms in the dera and took away four mobile phones and some cash. The next morning some devotees freed Lekh Raj following which he informed the police. Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Hamir Singh, the investigating officer, said a case under Sections 458 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night after preparation for hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint), 380 (burglary), 342 (wrongful confinement), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offense committed in prosecution of common object) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against unidentified accused. The dera followers are still trying to ascertain how much money was lost in the incident. Police are going through closed-circuit television cameras installed in the vicinity to identify the accused. On December 18, 2021, some men posing as cops had targeted a dera in Ranian village of Dehlon and robbed ₹1.65 lakh cash, a mobile phone and two silver bracelets after injuring the dera head and his followers. The Dehlon police had registered an FIR against unidentified accused, but have so far had no headway in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/posing-as-cops-seven-miscreants-commit-robbery-at-dera-in-ludhiana-s-raqba-village-101641929978201.html

These employees had got vaccinated in the second phase when frontline workers became eligible for vaccination. Fearing that zilla parishad (ZP) employees could also turn out to be super spreaders, the Pune district administration decided to test the workers and ensure early isolation. With 21 employees tested positive for the infection, the positivity rate among the employees who are fully vaccinated came close to 6.9%. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO) of Pune zilla parishad, said, “We had recently reported a few positive cases from the office and so we decided to test all employees as they could turn out to be super spreaders. Even during the peak of lockdown, our office was working with 100% capacity to expedite the process of vaccination and surveillance. We could not test all the employees due to their work commitments, however, of the 302 employees that we did test, we could report 21 new Covid cases. These are fully vaccinated employees. Some of them did show symptoms like fatigue, dehydration and also cough with phlegm, however they assumed that it could have been because of change in climate or other reasons. Hence, we will now arrange a booster dose campaign for our employees on Wednesday and Thursday.” As more breakthrough infections continue to be reported, the demand for precautionary doses also goes up. On the second day since the central government announced that the third dose would be administered as a precautionary dose, Pune district saw over 14 thousand doses administered as the third dose to senior citizens with comorbidities, frontline workers and also healthcare workers in the last two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/raton-pune-zp-staff-shows-7-covid-positivity-rate-101641929976668.html
12-01-2022||Noida||8 cyber fraudsters held for duping retired NTCP Limited official of ₹1.42 crore||Noida: Police arrested eight people on Tuesday for allegedly impersonating as insurance agents and duping a retired general manager of a leading Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) in Noida of ₹1.42 crore for four years, officials said.The suspects used the money to buy properties in Dehradun and Ghaziabad, and high-end vehicles including a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, according to police. They have cheated nearly 300 people in the past five years, said police. The matter came to light after the victim -- Riyaz Hasan, 60, a resident of Noida Sector 62 -- filed a complaint about the same at the Sector 58 police station on April 13, 2021.Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Noida, said, “Hasan, who voluntarily retired from National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) Limited in 2019, got a lump sum amount as retirement benefits from his company.”Hasan said in the complaint that he got a call from a person, who identified himself as AK Tripathi, a representative of an insurance company, in 2017. “Tripathi allured me to purchase seven insurance policies with high returns... Soon, two other suspects called and convinced me to buy four more policies. So, I bought 11 policies in total between 2017 and 2021,” Hasan said. DCP Rajesh said that the “suspects perceived Hasan as a vulnerable target and started demanding more money”. “The suspects started calling Hasan and demanding ₹100,000 to ₹200,000 installments randomly, saying that the policies would be cancelled if he did not make the payments. Between 2017 and 2021, Hasan transferred ₹14,274,330 to the bank accounts of three of the suspects,” he said. In April 2021, Hasan visited the insurance company’s office in Noida to enquire about his insurance policies, but was informed by the officials that they had no policy in his name. That is when the victim realised that he fell prey to a fraud and filed a complaint, and an FIR was also registered at the Sector 58 police station on April 13 last year. Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), Noida, said the three suspects switched off their cellphones and went incommunicado around that time as they sensed something was wrong after the victim stopped giving anymore money.“Initially, it was difficult to trace them, however, we managed to join the dots and zero down the suspects during the investigation for months... We conducted a search at their hideouts in Ghaziabad’s Dasna on Tuesday and arrested all the eight suspects for their involvement in the fraud case,” ADCP Singh said. Police identified the mastermind as Niraj Kumar alias Nikhil Pradhan, 35, a resident of Meerut. He is an MBA. His accomplice Amar Pal alias Ram Pratap alias Atal (an MCA), 30, is a resident of Ghaziabad’s Masuri. Four other suspects -- Vikas Kumar alias AK Tripathi, 28, Sohan alias AK Gupta, 30, Sushil alias Sunil, 26, and Swati Sethia, alias Preeti Tyagi, 35 -- are all residents of Ghaziabad’s Loni. Two other suspects -- Shah Rukh Khan alias Rihan, 29, and Azharuddin alias Shambhu Nath, 30 -- are residents of Bulandshahr. All the eight suspects were arrested from Ghaziabad on Tuesday.“The suspects revealed during interrogation that they previously worked at different insurance companies in Noida, and they used the same data and knowledge to cheat Hasan,” ADCP Singh added. The police have recovered ₹4,755,000, a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, four cars, 16 smartphones, 85 Aadhaar cards, six laptops, and several other documents from the possession of the suspects. The suspects were produced before a court and sent to judicial custody on Tuesday. Police organised a press conference at the ADCP office in Noida Sector 14-A on Tuesday afternoon, where the suspects were also present. The main suspect -- Niraj Kumar -- denied all the charges against him and said, “I have been framed in the case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/8-cyber-fraudsters-held-for-duping-retired-ntcp-limited-official-of-1-42-crore-101641929857049.html
12-01-2022||Lucknow||Maurya’s switch to SP charges up political atmosphere in UP||LUCKNOW At 2.15pm on Tuesday, when Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav, while sitting at the party’s Janeshwar Mishra Trust premises, tweeted a picture of himself with the BJP government’s minister Swami Prasad Maurya, a group of SP workers at the party’s state headquarters nearby erupted in jubilation after reading the post. One in the group exulted: “BJP khatm” (BJP is wiped out), followed by others who chorused: “BJP khatm”.An hour later, Akhilesh tweeted a message that ended with “BJP khatm”.The crowd at the SP office saw a cold Tuesday turn into a “politically surcharged day” in the state.Earlier in the day, Akhilesh Yadav had been discussing ticket distribution with his uncle and party’s national general secretary Ramgopal Yadav at the party office. After that, he drove alone to the Janeshwar Mishra Trust just about 200 meters away. Maurya joined Akhilesh at the Trust premises, where they stayed together for about 35 minutes after 11am onwards. After Maurya left the place, a picture of the two together -- all smiles -- standing side by side went viral on social media.Maurya had sent his resignation to the Governor through one of the three BJP MLAs who had quit their seats during the day. Subsequently, a celebration of sorts happened outside the SP office, followed by speculations about who all were joining the SP and about some from the SP headed towards the BJP.Around 4pm, when SP founder and chief patron Mulayam Singh Yadav drove to the SP office, there were speculations that Shivpal may merge his Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-L (PSP-L) with the SP. However, Shivpal’s camp denied any such development “at this stage”, saying that Shivpal did not meet Ramgopal or Akhilesh since morning. A party source said Mulayam came to the party office in a sequence that was unrelated to Swami Prasad Maurya or related developments. “He just came here the way he came yesterday – to interact with party workers,” added the source.Though Akhilesh’s tweet made it clear that Maurya was in, the SP did not make any official announcement that Maurya or some other MLAs with Maurya had joined the party.“Perhaps on Makar Sankranti, there will be a big press conference by Akhilesh ji where Maurya, along with other MLAs, will join the SP,” a senior party leader said over the phone.Maurya is not the first leader from the rival camps (BJP, Congress, or BSP) shaking hands with Akhilesh. The trend is on since July 2019. But he is the first minister headed towards the SP ahead of the UP Assembly elections.Swami Prasad Maurya shook hands with the SP five years after the “first invitation” by Akhilesh Yadav ahead of the 2017 polls. At a press conference, Akhilesh had openly said that he would like Maurya to join the SP. In August 2016, Maurya had joined the BJP leaving behind the BSP. Akhilesh Yadav, at another press conference, had remarked: “Galat party mein chaley gaye hain (he has gone to the wrong party).”

12-01-2022||Chandigarh||NHAI puts ₹700-crore greenfield alignment project in Mohali on hold||Finding farmers’ demand for enhanced compensation for land acquisition financially unviable, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has put on hold the ambitious 32-kilometre greenfield project in Mohali.The ₹700-crore road was planned from IT Chowk (PR-7) near the Chandigarh International Airport to the Kurali-Chandigarh road to decongest Chandigarh and Zirakpur by providing an alternative route to traffic coming from Delhi and going to Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.The authority’s decision comes after it had already accorded approval for increasing the compensation for land acquisition in September last year, following protests by land owners, mostly farmers. While earlier NHAI was to pay between ₹24 lakh and ₹4.12 crore per acre, depending on the location, it had agreed to pay between ₹1 crore and ₹1.12 crore per acre to those who were to get ₹24 lakh per acre.It had also released ₹450 crore to acquire 450 acres in 28 villages to construct the 32-km road, but four months later, it now does not find it feasible to proceed with the project.A senior official of NHAI, privy to the developments, said the authority did not find the enhanced compensation workable and had stalled the project for now. Mohali district revenue officer (DRO) Gurdev Singh said they had written a letter to NHAI regarding proceeding with the project, but they had not received any response for the past three months.According to sources, NHAI has already written to authorities concerned for scrapping the project and approval is awaited.NHAI had come up with the greenfield project after scrapping the project to widen the 40-km Kharar-Banur-Tepla road in July 2019, owing to its high cost. Ashoka Buildcon Limited was finalised to carry out the project. A greenfield road is built in an area that has never been developed. In February 2020, member of Parliament Manish Tewari had also taken up the matter of an alternative route with Union minister Nitin Gadkari, following which the Centre in its letter had stated that NHAI was checking the feasibility of a greenfield section.
12-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Vegetable prices rise by 15-25% after rain||Having stabilised in December, vegetable prices have again started rising at apni mandis in Chandigarh this month, after the last week’s rain spells damaged the crop. Prices of most vegetables have gone up by 15-25%, and are likely to increase further in the coming days. However, tomatoes are available for the same price as last week ( ₹40 per kilogram) while brinjal prices doubled from ₹20 to ₹40.“Winds and heavy rains around this time of the year are unusual and bad for crops. Crops like potatoes, cauliflower, spinach and peas have been affected the most, as they grow at the ground level,” said Satbir Singh, mandi supervisor, Punjab Mandi Board, adding that supply shortage in the coming days is expected to hike the vegetable prices even further. Amid a surge in Covid-19 cases, apni mandis have been directed to close by 5pm. Although mandi officials welcomed the administration’s decision to at least allow them to operate, unlike during previous lockdowns, they said it leads to crowding around 4:30pm. Meanwhile, the entry of general public has been stopped at the wholesale market in Sector 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhvegetable-prices-rise-by-15-25-after-rain-101641929567686.html

Not only from the Covid-19 ward or emergency ward, but staffers of almost all departments are found infected,” said PGIMER officiating director Dr Surjit Singh.Dr Singh most of the admitted healthcare workers include resident doctors and only a few are faculty members. “They have mild symptoms but are hospitalised because we could not isolate them at the hostel, as it could increase transmissibility of the infection among other resident doctors,” he said.“We are taking all measures to control infection spread in the institute. Walk-in OPDs have already been suspended. All hostel messes have been turned into ‘take away’ eateries. All sport events and tournaments have been cancelled and indoor courts closed,” said the officiating director.82% reserved oxygen beds occupiedMeanwhile, the bed occupancy went up to 180 on Tuesday evening. As present, the PGIMER has reserved 206 oxygenated beds for Covid-19 patients. As many as 169 of them have been occupied while 37 are vacant. Also, of the 24 ventilator beds reserved for Covid-19 patients, 11 are occupied. Dr Surjit Singh said: “The institute has the capacity to admit around 500 Covid-19 patients at a time. We will increase the number of reserved beds, as per the requirement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pgimer-own-staffers-account-for-50-admitted-covid-patients-101641929566370.html

12-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh health secretary says no quarantine leave if not Covid positive||In an order issued on Tuesday, Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) chief executive officer Yashpal Garg, who is also the UT health secretary, stated that just because a family member is in home isolation after testing positive for Covid-19 cannot be a reason for CHB officials to apply for quarantine leaves.The order states that an official is allowed quarantine leaves only in case they themselves have contracted the virus or their house is declared a micro-containment zone.The order comes even as the health department officials are advising quarantine period of three days and testing on the fourth day for persons whose family member(s) have tested positive. The CHB order does not stipulate any such guideline on quarantine or isolation period.In fact, the CHB order stresses immediate testing. “In such a situation the officer/official should immediately get himself tested for Covid. In case he is found negative, then the officer is required to attend the duties,” the order states.However, later, when asked when should the testing be done in such a case, Garg said, “Preferably on third or fourth day (after the family member tests positive). This gap of 3 or 4 days is an advisory to control the infection spread.”Garg further clarified that it is not mandatory for an official to isolate himself after a family member has tested positive, though it is advisable.What others sayMeanwhile, director, health services, Dr Suman Singh said: “The central government guidelines are silent on the quarantine period for a contact of Covid-19 positive patient. For containing the spread of the highly infectious Omicron variant, we are advising for a three-day quarantine period and testing on the fourth day.”Dr Sanjeev Palta, the nodal officer of ICU management at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, said, “As per new guidelines of the ICMR, asymptomatic family members of a Covid-19 positive person are not to be tested for virus. However, looking at the contagious behaviour of the virus, the family members are advised to stay isolated and not to venture out of the house for at least seven days. The positive patient is to be tested again on the eighth day.”Ashwani Kumar, convener, Joint Action Committee, UT administration and municipal corporation employee union, said: “Earlier, the quarantine leave was being given. It should be given now too. After a family member of an employee tests positive, the employee should go in isolation till being tested themselves to prevent spread of infection among their colleagues or general public.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-health-secretary-says-no-quarantine-leave-if-not-covid-positive-101641929563794.html

According to the institute, most have just mild symptoms and are hospitalised owing to lack of isolation facilities at hostels.Fatality rate at 0.08% in JanEven the number of fatalities has remained low, with just nine reported across the tricity this month. Mohali and Chandigarh account for four each, and Panchkula for one. When compared to 10,674 positive cases in this period (January 1-11), the case fatality rate is as low as 0.08%.

12-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh airport: Two months on, air cargo facility awaits customs, security approvals||Even though the Chandigarh International Airport inaugurated air cargo facility in November last year, it is yet to begin operations for the want of approvals from the authorities concerned. Rakesh Dembla, chief executive officer, Chandigarh International Airport Limited (CHAIL), said the cargo facility will be the biggest in the north region after Delhi’s. “Everything is finalised and we are just waiting for approvals from the customs and security. We are hopeful of launching the facility soon,” he said.The cargo facility was announced six years after the Chandigarh airport got the international tag. Air cargo or air freight allows speedy transportation of commercial goods through an air carrier. At present, CHAIL only provides a common screening facility for domestic cargo, while the airlines are handling the goods on their own.Constructed at a cost of ₹11.5 crore, the air cargo complex is spread over 14,127 square metres. With five cargo sheds being built, it will handle both domestic and international cargo, including perishable goods. Rates for consignments to be handled by the facility were approved ahead of the inauguration two months back.Yogesh Sagar, president of Mohali Industries Association, said: “We urge the authorities concerned to make the air cargo facility functional soon, as it will bring a boom in the local industry. At present, we have to send our consignments by road to the Delhi airport, where they are lined up for 24 to 48 hours before being loaded onto the aircraft, which takes a week’s time.”It was on September 11, 2015, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated the international airport. In February 2021, the Punjab government finally announced the air cargo facility. Presenting the budget, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal had said that the facility will give a boost to the industry and provide better access to international and domestic markets.
12-01-2022||Pune||State task force for paediatrics not in favour of schools resuming offline classes||Pune: Even as most teachers and education institutes have expressed that schools should resume offline classes, the state Covid task force members for paediatrics have opposed keeping the offline classes on by schools. As per government orders, schools will remain shut till February 15 while online education continues. However, some schools and teachers feel that in order to overcome the learning loss of students, offline schools should continue while at the same time many parents are unwilling to send their ward to school due to the rising cases of Covid and Omicron variant. Dr Aarti Kinikar, chairperson of the Pune division paediatric Covid task force, said that it is seen that if young kids get infected, they may in turn infect elderly persons in the family. “It is possible that with the rising cases if schools are open, we may see a rising number of children passing on the infections to the elderly in the family. To avoid this, it is crucial to continue with online classes as of now. As the cases subside, the government can take a decision based on the situation about reopening,” said Dr Kinikar. Dr Kinikar noted that many schools across the world are running only online classes. “Many parents are afraid that the learning ability of their child might get affected due to online classes. But it has to be noted that schools in other countries are also online. And the challenges they are facing are similar. But there is no other way to protect the children and the senior citizens in the family,” said Dr Kinikar. Parents from the city also said that sending the young ones to school is not advisable. Sharing her experience, Pragati Kulkarni, whose youngest son is in the primary section, said that it is difficult to keep the kids away from each other at school. “At younger ages, children don’t understand social distancing. With the rising cases, sending younger children to school is dangerous. Even though there is learning loss, their safety is more important. I feel the government should rethink about reopening after February 15 only if cases see a downward curve. Otherwise, as the academic year is almost over, we can wait a few more months before off-line classes are started,” said Kulkarni. Many schools feel that students may lose touch with studies if offline classes do not restart. Maharashtra English School Trustees Association (Mesta), on Tuesday wrote a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray claiming that Covid is not a communicable disease but a conspiracy by big business global giants to keep the world economy in their hands. “And so, schools should be given permission to start offline classes,” said Sanjayrao Tayde Patil, founder chairman, Mesta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-task-force-for-paediatrics-not-in-favour-of-schools-resuming-offline-classes-101641929558275.html

The top leaders of the BSP, including Mayawati, would be busy campaigning and drawing strategy of the party in the three states, he said.Mishra said the BSP would win the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh whereas the BSP- SAD alliance would form the government in Punjab.The BSP is likely to release the list of candidates for the first phase poll with the notification of the election by the ECI on January 14. To finalize the candidates, Mayawati held meetings with the party office -bearers and screened the candidates in Lucknow.Earlier, in a press statement Mayawati said the people had made up their minds to bring the BSP to power despite the report of the survey agencies showing the party out of the race. In 2007 too, they had predicted the defeat of the BSP. Again, the BSP would prove all surveys wrong to form a government in UP with majority, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mayawati-sc-mishra-to-not-contest-up-polls-101641929316608.html

12-01-2022||Pune||Pune housing societies implement ad hoc Covid rules, residents voice discontent||Pune: The rising Covid cases across the city have again led to various housing societies implementing ad hoc rules, which do not comply with the government guidelines. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has declared 31 micro-containment zones among which 28 are in housing societies. However, many other housing societies have implemented similar restrictions much to the dismay of several residents. The entry and exit of maids, pets, and medical staff who come to treat patients have been restricted. While the rules have been introduced by some members of the societies themselves, other residents have voiced their indignation. Some residents believe housing societies should follow rules issued by the local government. Shachin Bharadwaj, a resident of Marvel Fria, a housing society in Wagholi said, “The housing society authorities had implemented restrictions long before any government rules were issued in December and now with the rising cases, they have shut all facilities in the society.” While the Maharashtra government has revised its previous circular and relaxed some of the restrictions imposed previously, some housing societies have decided not to change their rules. “The government has allowed gyms to run in 50% capacity, but the management at my housing society has shut the gym down. While I had already paid for these amenities here, now I also have to subscribe to a gym membership elsewhere,” said Shachin, a software engineer. The maids working in different houses within the society have to bear the brunt of these ad hoc rules, as well. Certificate of double vaccination is often not enough and they are asked to produce negative RT-PCR test reports if any family member from the houses the maid works in tests positive for Covid-19. “Only double vaccinated people are permitted within the society and we have closed all facilities like gyms, table tennis court, tennis court, badminton court, and football ground from January 5,” said Rahul Dabhade, chairman of Marvel Fria. The facilities will be reopened on January 16, after the situation is assessed. The housing society authorities believe the ad hoc rules are for residents’ benefit. “We are implementing rules to reduce Covid cases in our society and we have seen a positive result,” said Dabhade. Some disgruntled residents, however, believe the authorities are in no position to decide rules that have not been issued by the government. Another resident from Padmavilas, a housing society in Baner, said, “After going through the same pandemic for one and a half years, people should now be more sensible in fighting against it. Rules by PMC or PCMC must be the only rules applied.” Few others took to Twitter to voice their concern over authorities asking residents to quarantine for more than seven days, despite no government guidelines mentioning it. Pune District Co-Operative Housing Societies and Apartments Federation has opposed the implementation of these ad hoc rules, as well. Suhas Patwardhan, the chairman of Pune District Co-operative Housing Federation said, “I have observed that there are various housing societies who implement their guidelines, but I appeal to them to only follow guidelines issued by the central, state, and local governments.” PMC mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “No housing society is allowed to implement their own rules. We have not come across any such societies till now, but if there are any we will look into the situation and, if needed, appropriate action will be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-housing-societies-implement-ad-hoc-covid-rules-residents-voice-discontent-101641929197006.html

The tenders for the 40-seater boats were recently floated by the Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Development Corporation (CITCO).Each boat will have a pantry, bio-toilet, proper lighting arrangements for operations in the night, air-conditioning and an open terrace.

12-01-2022||Delhi||In eight days, Covid cases go up from six to 108 in Delhi jails||In the last eight days, Covid-19 cases among inmates and jail guards have increased from six to 108 inside Delhi’s three prison complexes -- Tihar, Rohini, and Mandoli.On January 2, Delhi’s Tihar jail reported its first case after almost five months of the prison remaining free of the infection, prison authorities said. Between July 28, 2021, and January 2, 2002, not a single case of infection was reported in the three jails, they added.With the infection spreading quickly inside the three jails, the prison department has now designated all its dispensaries as Covid-19 care centres and restricted the movement of inmates within the jails. There is a small dispensary in each of the 16 sub-jails across Tihar, Rohini, and Mandoli in addition to the two hospitals in jail number 3 (Tihar) and jail number 13 (Mandoli), which have been designated as Covid health centres.“There are medical isolation cells in each jail. All new prisoners are first isolated and monitored for symptoms. They are sent to join other prisoners only if they do not show symptoms for over a week. Currently, we are conducting Rapid Antigen Tests in different jails. Most prisoners are asymptomatic,” said a senior jail officer.About 70-100 new prisoners arrive at the three jails every day. About the same number of prisoners are also released on bail or acquitted in their cases.The prison department has also installed a PSA oxygen plant at the central jail hospital. It is likely to become functional within a week. Authorities felt the prison needed its own oxygen plant during the second wave of the Covid-19 when most prisoners needed to be hospitalised because their oxygen levels dropped.“All elderly prisoners in each sub-jail have been lodged together. A committee of prisoners in each jail monitors their oxygen levels and checks for symptoms,” the senior jail officer added.Of the 108 cases, 66 are those of inmates while 48 jail officers have also tested positive for Covid-19. In the backdrop of the rising infections, the government and prison officers are on alert but are yet to call a high-powered committee meeting to discuss releasing prisoners to ensure social distancing in jail. Ensuring social distancing, which is the key to arresting the spread of Covid-19, is a major problem in Delhi jails because the jails hold nearly twice the number of prisoners against its sanctioned capacity. There are nearly 18,000 prisoners against a sanctioned capacity of 10,024 in the three prisons.A high-powered committee(HPC) comprising representatives of the judiciary, government, prison, and police have in the past released prisoners to ensure social distancing. The HPC has identified 11 categories of undertrial prisoners such as those arrested for non-heinous crimes among other categories.About 8,000 prisoners released by the HPC during the first two waves of Covid-19 infections are already out. Of the 8,000 prisoners, around 2,300 released to decongest the jail in April-May 2020 have not surrendered and have been declared as fugitives. Separately, 5,463 prisoners were released in April- May 2021. These 5,463 have not been asked to surrender because of a Supreme Court order. To be sure, these 5,463 prisoners are not fugitives.Prison officers said they are yet to be informed of the HPC meeting. “If the cases are under control and the positivity rate does not increase rapidly, the HPC meeting may not even take place. Also, only 10 prisoners have been admitted to hospitals outside, so the situation is under control. Most prisoners are also recovering at the jail’s Covid centres,” a second prison officer said.Since the pandemic broke out in March 2020, the three jails have collectively reported over 600 cases among prisoners and jail staff. Six prisoners have also died of the infection. One of the prisoners who died of Covid-19 was former gangster-turned-politician from Bihar Mohammed Shahabuddin.

12-01-2022||Chandigarh||Raids at Ludhiana Improvement Trust office after complaint of poll code violation||Following a complaint that the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) had allegedly issued work orders of around ₹10 crore after the model code of conduct came into force on January 8, a team from the district administration raided the office on Tuesday.The team is said to have gone through the office records and examined the closed-circuit television camera footage. The team is also said to have acquired footage of the ground-level inspections carried out by the LIT since January 6.As per the complaint received by the office of deputy commissioner-cum-district election officer (DEO) Varinder Sharma, LIT officials were present in the office on January 8 and 9 and they had allegedly approved work orders worth ₹10 crore, by making back date entries. Sharma has summoned the dispatch register of LIT and marked the inquiry to additional deputy commissioner (general) Rahul Chaba in the matter. It is learnt that an initial complaint in the case was made by a resident, Karamjit Dhariwal. However SAD leader and candidate from Ludhiana West Harish Rai Dhanda also filed a complaint in this regard and sought an FIR against LIT chairman.Dhanda said the dispatch clerk resides in Pathankot and was not in the city when the work orders were issued after imposition of poll code. “There were many other discrepancies. Development works were approved from the constituency of cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and MLA Sanjay Talwar to benefit them in the upcoming elections. I have sought an FIR against chairman, Ashu, Talwar and all other officials involved in this unlawful activity,” said Dhanda.LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam refuted the allegations and said misinformation is being floated by some “persons with vested interests”. He said, “The LIT staff was present in the office on January 8 to complete the formalities for the draw of lots of Atal Apartments scheme, which was scheduled to be held on January 10. After the model code was imposed on January 8, they also had to apprise the applicants about the postponement of the draw. The inquiry officer can check the record and footage, but nothing wrong has been done. As a similar complaint was also submitted with the local bodies department, a reply has also been submitted to the principal secretary of the local bodies department.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/raids-at-ludhiana-improvement-trust-office-after-complaint-of-poll-code-violation-101641928896701.html

They had to wait for hours in long queues. But later, the district administrations intervened and doctors reached hospitals.Had to implement ESMA: Vij“A group of doctors announced to go on strike when the whole country is fighting Covid. The strike will adversely affect the fight against the contagion. We had accepted their demands and forwarded them to the chief minister and other departments immediately,” said Haryana health minister Anil Vij.“After meeting with the chief minister on Monday, the demands were fulfilled and were given in-principle approval. The doctors still insisted to go on strike. I think there is someone who wants to disrupt the fight against Covid which is why we had to implement ESMA,” Vij added.‘Patients did not suffer’Protesting under the banner of the Haryana Civil Medical Services Association (HCMSA), the doctors alleged that the Haryana government has ignored their demands and backtracked on promises made by Haryana health minister Anil Vij.Karnal chief medical officer Yogesh Sharma said there was no impact on OPD and emergency services as alternate arrangements were made to ensure that patients do not face any problem due to the strike. As per officials, over 900 patients were examined at the OPD in the Karnal civil hospital.“For 14 years, I have been the only radiologist in Karnal. I even have to visit nearby districts. Incentives and specialist cadre will help increase the strength of radiologists in state,” Dr Sarita said.“We don’t want to cause any harm to the patients but we are left with no other way to get the government to address our issues,” a protesting doctor said at Karnal civil hospital.In Kaithal, doctors marked leave but remained on duty to ensure that the people did not face any problems. Kaithal deputy commissioner Pradeep Dahiya said health services remained normal and there was no impact of the strike in district.In Kurukshetra, deputy commissioner Mukul Kumar said OPD services at government hospitals by and large remained smooth except for a few places where alternate arrangements were made.Rohtak civil surgeon Dr JS Punia said 20 of the hospital’s 42 doctors worked and attended OPD services. “I had directed the doctors and other staff to ensure no patient goes home without treatment. I personally monitored the situation,” Dr Punia added.Jhajjar civil surgeon Dr Sanjay Dahiya also assured that patients did not suffer due to the strike.Doctors to go on strike from Jan 14On imposition of ESMA in state, HCMSA president Dr Jasbir Singh Parmar said they will go ahead with the strike called on January 14 when there will be a complete shutdown of all services including emergency, Covid and postmortem till the demands are met.“Our strike remained successful throughout the state except for a few places. We have already decided in our previous meetings that the strike called on Friday will take place whatever be the consequences,” he said.HCMSA general secretary Dr Rajesh Sheokhand said if the three key demands are accepted, it will benefit the aspiring doctors in state and improve the ailing health system of Haryana for the benefit of the public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-major-impact-of-doctors-strike-in-haryana-govt-makes-alternate-arrangements-101641928664747.html

Panchkula chief medical officer Dr Mukta Kumar said: “A few doctors went on strike, but OPD services continued as doctors on contract attended to the patients. Even some regular doctors were on duty but did not mark their attendance.”At the Ambala civil hospital, too, doctors were seen working throughout the day. Civil surgeon Dr Kuldeep Singh, who reached the hospital early morning to ensure smooth working, said: “All patients coming to the hospitals in Ambala were attended at the OPDs, though a few doctors were on casual leave and 25 are in isolation after testing positive for Covid-19.”At the sub-divisional hospital in Ambala Cantt, the assembly constituency of health minister Anil Vij, a few doctors protested in the morning, but attended to the patients thereafter, an official of the health department said.Doctors have been demanding the creation of a special cadre for specialist doctors in Haryana, restoration of 40% reservation policy and end to the process of direct recruitment of senior medical officers.Even as the government has enforced the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) in the state, banning health workers from resorting to such measures for six months, one of the protesting doctors at the Panchkula civil hospital warned of escalating the protest.The doctor, who did not wish to be named, said: “Our demands have not been met by the government for over two years now, forcing us to protest. Today, only OPD services were impacted, but if the government fails to listen to us within two days, we will go on a complete strike from January 14. Even emergency services will be impacted.”Even State Haryana Civil Medical Surgeons president Dr Jasbir Parmar confirmed they have decided to go ahead with the strike starting January 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-doctors-strike-gets-mixed-response-in-panchkula-ambala-101641928658207.html
12-01-2022||Other||HC restrains TN from prosecuting Isha Foundation in environment case||The Madras High Court on Tuesday offered a brief relief for Isha Foundation founded by Jaggi Vasudev by restraining the Tamil Nadu government from taking action against it. The charge against the foundation is that it had constructed buildings in Velliangiri hills in Coimbatore district without obtaining environmental clearance between 2006 and 2014. The first bench of acting chief justice MN Bhandari and Justice PD Audikesavulu passed the interim order on a writ petition by the foundation. The petition prays for an interim stay on a show cause notice issued by the Coimbatore district environmental engineer in November 2021 and to declare an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification of 2014 as illegal. The court on Tuesday granted the respondents in the case which includes departments of union and state governments two weeks’ time to file a counter to the writ petition and to seek instructions in the matter. “In the meanwhile, the respondents will not proceed further in reference to the show cause notice for prosecution, without permission of this Court,” the order of the bench read. The court posted the matter to February 1. According to the affidavit filed for the foundation by its authorised signatory CR Dinesh Raja, this is a volunteer-run registered public charitable trust founded in 1992. And from 1994, Isha Yoga Centre was established and buildings were built near Coimbatore. This was spread over 48.3 hectares which included educational institutions affiliated to the ICSE board spread over 1,25,849 square meters out of which 28,279 sq km was constructed even before the EIA 2006 notification came into effect. The foundation argues that the 2014 EIA notification is an extension of a similar notification of 2006 notification and therefore the exemption provided under 2014 for educational institutions must apply from 2006 onwards. The petition had stated that the balance of convenience is in their favour. “The petitioner has made out a prima facie case for grant of interim orders,” the writ said. “I submit that severe prejudice, hardship and loss of reputation would be caused to the Petitioner if the notice is not stayed. On the other hand, no prejudice would be caused to the Respondents if the interim order is granted.”The case hearing comes in the backdrop of a war of words between after the DMK formed the government in May and the state’s finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan had then called Vasudev a publicity hound for his ‘Free temples’ campaign which is backed by the BJP. The foundation had responded that the minister was trivialising the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-restrains-tn-from-prosecuting-isha-foundation-in-environment-case-101641928537841.html

The varsity also recorded a 100% increase in the patents granted.

The BSP has fielded candidates in Dadri (farmer leader Manvir Bhati) and Jewar (former journalist Narendra Dedha) assemblies but has not named anyone from Noida yet.“Political parties are unable to announce the names of their candidates because they fear internal fighting. We are the first party to name candidates from Dadri and Jewar, and our party will field a candidate from Noida on January 15, as well as other seats in the state,” said Lakhmi Singh, president of BSP in Gautam Budh Nagar.Congress leaders said they will announce the party’s candidates from all Gautam Budh Nagar seats on January 13, a day before the filing of the nominations.“The top leadership has finalised the list for three seats. The names will be announced on January 13 if all goes according to plan,” said a Congress worker, requesting anonymity.The SP’s national spokesperson Rajkumar Bhati said, “Our party will announce the names of candidates from all seats in a couple of days as the top leaders are working on the list.”The BJP, which won all three seats in the district in the 2017 assembly election, is yet to announce its candidates as well, and has not clarified whether the ruling MLAs will be asked to file their nominations again.“Ours is a disciplined party, where a hardworking ordinary party worker gets the opportunity to fight the election and then serve the general public. Thus, the central leadership will decide the candidates and soon announce their names,” said Chandra Mohan, BJP spokesperson for UP.The Election Commission of India (ECI) on January 8 announced that no political rallies, roadshows, or street corner meetings will be allowed in Uttar Pradesh till January 15.On Tuesday, Gautam Budh Nagar police commissioner Alok Singh and district magistrate Suhas LY inspected polling booths in the district as per the directions of the election commission.“We have directed the staff that it is their duty to make sure all Covid-19 protocols are followed during the polling process.

12-01-2022||Pune||Pune’s Covid positivity rate goes above 20%, CFR at 0.01% and less||Pune: Although the Covid cases are rising, pushing the city’s Covid-19 positivity rate at more than 20%, the case fatalities remain at 0.01% and less since the past one week as the reported fatalities remain in single digits. The number of new Covid cases in the city have risen by 10 times in the past one week as the count from 400 as of January 1 reaches close to 3,460 as of Tuesday (January 11). However, with the rate of hospitalisation rising slowly but steadily, it is believed that the bed count could also rise in the coming days. Although the rise in hospitalisations is not as drastic as the number of new cases, the number has witnessed a slight rise in admissions in the past one week. Since the past one week, as the number of new Covid cases are rising dramatically, the number of reported deaths due to the virus is still in single digits which has kept the case fatality rate of the city at 0.01%, and less. The number of patients who were critical or were on oxygen in the past 11 days since the beginning of the month has gone from 157 to 184. Dr Ashish Bharti, chief health officer at PMC, said, “As of Tuesday, Pune city has reported about 3,459 new Covid-19 cases of the close to 15,000 samples that have been tested in the last 24 hours. This means that the positivity rate in the city has gone up to 23%, however, we have reported only one death in the past 24 hours which means that the case fatality rate (CFR) due to Covid has been around 0.0% in the past one week. As of Tuesday, we have over 19,452 active cases in the city of which only 4.89% are admitted in hospitals in comparison with the total active cases.” As per the civic body, out of the over 19,000 active cases, 146 are on oxygen treatment, 16 are on non-invasive ventilators and 22 are on invasive ventilators. As of January 1, when the city had about 2,070 active cases, out of this, 92 were critical patients and 65 were on oxygen support. At the beginning of the month, the positivity rate of the city was around 5.2% and the CFR was 0.01%. A steady rise in the number of patients hospitalised could add load on the already exhausted health infrastructure, said Dr Bharti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-covid-positivity-rate-goes-above-20-cfr-at-0-01-and-less-101641928476597.html

As per reports, the Supreme Court in 2020 upheld the decision of the Punjab and Haryana high court quashing their appointment in schools.One of the protesting teachers said, “We had gone to remind the minister that we have given an ultimatum to the government to reinstate us as per their poll promise, or face a fierce agitation as the farmers did.”Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) termed it a security breach that allowed the protesters to reach near his residence, some even tried to sneak in.“The minister has cleared earlier that the court has cancelled their appointment, the government cannot do anything,” a statement read.Later in the evening, the protesters were removed from the agitation site in the presence of superintendent of police (SP) Kamaldeep Goyal and sub-divisional magistrate (Jagadhri) Sushil Kumar, after a warning to disperse. Police detained over a thousand teachers in buses and dislodged the arrangements on ground.The SP said, “They were detained at the site and later released for flouting the government’s ban on protests, rallies, etc in view of rise in Covid cases.”“In the morning incident, we have lodged an FIR at Jagadhri City police station against 17 named teachers and around 250 unknown ones for flouting the Covid norms,” Goyal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/yamunanagar-teachers-booked-removed-from-protest-site-for-flouting-covid-norms-101641928418171.html

Besides, the government also ordered that cinema theatres should have only 50 per cent occupancy with alternate seating arrangement and that there should not be more than 200 persons in outdoor public gatherings and 100 persons indoor, apart from other regular restrictions like compulsory wearing of masks and maintenance of physical distancing.Accordingly, a government order was issued by Anil Kumar Singhal, principal secretary, medical and health department, on Tuesday morning. However, within hours, the state government withdrew the order stating that it required some modifications and a fresh order would be issued later.Speaking to reporters, health minister Alla Nani said the government had decided to defer the night curfew plan in the wake of Sankranti festival. He said the night curfew would cause a lot of inconvenience to the people travelling to and from their native places in the state for Sankranti festival.“A large number of people would be travelling to their native villages for the festival and returning to their places of work after the festival is over. Imposition of night curfew would affect their travel plans. Hence, we have decided to defer the decision to January 18. It will be in force till January 31,” Nani said.In the last 24 hours, Andhra Pradesh reported as many as 1,831 fresh cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of active Covid-19 cases to 7,195.

Still, the daytime maximum was four degree Celsius below normal while the nighttime minimum was two degree below normal.The uptick in mercury notwithstanding, the weather remained cool, as it has for the past week. Data from the India Meteorological Department’s Santacruz observatory showed that Mumbai has recorded temperatures consistently below normal since January 6, including maximum and minimum temperatures.“This drop was brought on by a bout of unseasonal rain last week, caused by two consecutive western disturbances drawing moisture from the Arabian Sea and depositing it over parts of Konkan and madhya Maharashtra as they passed through Rajasthan in the north. The increase in temperature on Tuesday is because of this system’s diminished influence, but both maximum and minimum readings will remain below normal till at least January 14, after which conditions will get warmer,” said a meteorologist with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.The official pointed out that the direction of the wind over Mumbai and adjoining areas has been from the north-west over the past two days and this is cooler than easterly or westerly winds. With the directions expected to change later this week, the city will start receiving warmer air, and the onset of warmer conditions may be felt sharply after Friday, the official explained.As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for the city, temperatures will rise to a maximum of as much as 31 degree Celsius by January 17, and a minimum of as low as 18 degree Celsius, because mainly, clear skies are expected to prevail. Recent weather patterns have been favourable for the city’s air except for Tuesday’s air quality index (AQI) reading which settled at a ‘satisfactory’ 79, down from the ‘moderate’ 177 a day before.“This could be due to the sudden increase in temperatures. As the air warmed, it would have risen higher in the atmosphere away from the earth’s surface, carrying pollution with it. Wind velocity has also been favourable at about 10kmph, which would have helped to disperse aerosol pollutants on Tuesday,” said Gufran Beig, project director at SAFAR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/city-records-below-normal-temperatures-for-7th-day-on-the-trot-101641928356587.html

A cup of tea or coffee will be charged ₹10, according to the rate list. The item listed ranges from loudspeakers to different categories of tents and publicity related items such as generator sets, beds, chairs and publicity material such as banners and posters. “The list will be given to candidates and the rates have been finalised for each and every item that could be used during campaigning.

Depending upon the items used during campaigning, candidates will be required to maintain an expense sheet as per the list provided by the election officer. They will also have to open a new bank account and make payments for different expenditures from that account only. “The candidates will be required to note down details of expenditure and the same should be submitted before the expenditure committee. Apart from submission by the candidate, our surveillance teams will also assess the items used by the candidate during campaigning. These teams will also maintain records for every candidate and expenditure will be cross verified. In case the details of expenditure are not submitted by the candidate, (s)he may be declared incompetent for future elections,” said Ritu Suhas, additional district magistrate.

Police said the suspect sold over 5,000 SIM cards in the past two years to several gangs involved in cyber frauds in states such as Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. According to police, the suspect, Ravinder Singh alias Sameer who was residing in a rented room in Wazirabad village since 2005, had been running a mobile phone shop opposite a private hospital for the past four years. As many as 66 SIM cards (14 of them were activated), 20 mobile phones, one motorcycle and ₹18,500 from Sameer’s possession, police said, adding that his two associates are at large. Inderjeet Yadav, deputy superintendent of police (DSP) with the CM’s flying squad, said that they acted on a tip-off and formed teams for conducting an investigation. “Our teams visited the shop several times in plain clothes posing as customers. Sameer was often found talking to unidentified men that he had activated SIMs and asking them to send someone new to pick up the packet,” he said. Yadav said people from Nuh (Haryana), Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Bihar bought SIM cards through him for anything between ₹600 and ₹1,000. Police said they scanned his mobile phones and found that he was in touch with people who had earlier been arrested and booked for cyber fraud cases and were currently on bail. Harish Budhiraja, an inspector with the CM flying squad, said that the suspect had two close aides identified as Zamir of Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh and Lalit of Gurugram. “The close aides used to deliver SIM cards to at least six language interpreters attached to a private hospital who used to sell each of these SIM cards for more than ₹3,000 to foreign nationals who visited Gurugram for their treatment. More than 300 SIM cards were sold to them illegally in the past two months,” he said. Budhiraja said that the Sameer’s aides used to arrange documents of people visiting photocopy shops or banks, and activate SIM cards using them without the knowledge of the persons. “We have also found messages on Sameer’s phone where people had demanded more than 20 activated SIM cards in different states for committing crimes. Most SIM cards were sold to people in Nuh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh,” he said. A case under sections 420 (cheating), 465 (punishment for forgery) and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the three suspects at Sector 53 police station on Monday night.Police said online frauds are mostly operated from Nuh and Bharatpur in Rajasthan, and they are suspecting that despite knowing that people were using these SIM cards for an illegal purpose, he used to sell to them. Yadav said Sameer also used to courier activated SIM cards to other states and receive online payments for the same. “His online transactions amounted to more than ₹60,000 a month. We are yet to identify the dealer who used to give the suspects the activated SIM cards. Once verified, he will also be arrested,” he said.

Rehman told the police he considered the green jacket his lucky charm.DCP Kalsi said, “He thought he would not be arrested for the crimes if he wore the green jacket. We recovered eight stolen phones from his possession. After stealing a phone, he would visit nearby railway stations and bus terminals to sell it. He would claim to be in financial trouble and tell his buyers that he had to sell the phone quickly.” Narrating the sequence of the incidents that led to his arrest, police said, that on January 2, an ambulance driver filed a complaint about a man on a scooter who snatched his phone near the Bhairon Baba Mandir in Civil lines. While police were probing this case, another snatching was reported on January 4. This time, a daily wager said that around 9.30am, when he was crossing St Stephens Road, a biker snatched his cell phone.“We formed a special team and started looking at CCTV cameras. After looking at footage from over 100 cameras, the trail of the suspect ended at Jama Masjid. We did not give up. The police team came to the conclusion that the same person was involved in both the snatching cases...Finally on January 7, we received a tip about the suspect.

Hearing the plea Justice P Gopinath ordered that no action will be taken against the accused till the court heard their bail pleas in detail.During the brief hearing the actor’s counsel Philip T Varghese contended that the new case was filed at the behest of the main investigating officer in the actor assault case as the officer did not want to be examined during trial. Deposition of Deputy Superintendent Bajiu Paulose was scheduled next week and the new FIR was intended to delay the case, he said adding the new FIR registered after a director came out with an imaginary story.But the prosecution opposed the bail pleas strongly saying custody interrogation was necessary in view of the latest disclosure by director Balachandra Kumar. It said allegations against the actor and others were serious and they were planning to target officials who investigated the case.The sensational case took a new turn after Kumar’s interview to a Malayalam TV channel in December last year in which he claimed that Dileep was in possession of tapes of the assault and he saw main accused Pulsar Suni at his house. He also released some audio tapes. In one of the tapes, one person allegedly identified as Anoop, Dileep’s brother, can be beard talking about a conspiracy to kill investigating officer Baiju Paulose. The conservation allegedly took place in November 2017 at the actor’s house in Aluva in Ernakulam district, the SIT said in its FIR.The accused were charged under Indian penal code sections 116 (abetment of offence), 118 (concealing design to commit an offence), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 506 (criminal intimidation). Crime branch Additional Director of Police S Sreejith is supervising the investigation. After Kumar’s revelations, the Kerala government approached the Supreme Court last week with a plea to extend the trial for six more months.New allegations against Dileep and prosecution’s demand for a fresh probe surfaced at a time when the trial court’s six-month extension given by the Supreme Court is set to expire on February 16. The case relates to an incident in 2017 in which a woman actor was waylaid, kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a gang in Kochi while she was returning home after a shooting assignment. Six months after the incident, Dileep was arrested and made an accused in the case. Prosecution alleged that the attack was planned at the behest of Dileep to settle an old score with the woman actor.After fresh disclosure the victim sent a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan seeking speedy justice to her. She also posted a touching note in social media describing the ordeal she had undergone in last four years. “This is not been an easy journey. The journey from being a victim to becoming a survivor. For five years now, my name and identity have been suppressed under the weight of the assault inflicted on me...” said the emotional post adding she is not alone in the fight for justice. Many actors and actresses have pledged support to her after the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-action-against-actor-dileep-till-jan-14-in-new-case-kerala-hc-101641928056540.html

Because of Covid-19 lockdowns, in 2020 the vehicular movement on the e-way drastically reduced. As a result, there were fewer accidents and deaths. As per information released by the state highway police, a total of 182 accidents and 75 deaths happened in 2021 on the Pune-Mumbai expressway. While in 2019, 306 accidents and 92 deaths took place in 2020, accidents were down to 160 and fatalities were 66 as only essential services’ vehicles were allowed to run on the expressway for most of the year. Over the last couple of years, several precautionary measures to reduce accidents were taken by the Highway Safety Patrol. Preetam Yavalkar, deputy superintendent of police, Highway Safety Patrol, Pune, said, “Despite the Covid pandemic and with the guidance of our senior officials various steps were taken to reduce accidents and deaths on the e-way. As compared to 2019, both accidents and deaths have reduced. Continuous action is being taken on speeding vehicles, and the MSRDC carried out several infrastructures works to improve highway safety. So, we mainly focused on our speed gun and seat- belt action on the e-way to curb accidents. Also, the response time of our team increased during this period, so we tried to reach accident spots as fast as possible.” Vipul Alekar, a regular traveller on the expressway said, “Now I feel safe while traveling by the expressway, as there is more vigilance and highway police are taking safety measures round the clock. There is still need to improve many things, but people should also realise their own safety do not speed in cars to extreme levels.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-curbs-keep-pune-mumbai-expressway-drive-safer-in-21-101641927999959.html
12-01-2022||Delhi||JNU’s academic council to discuss common university admission test||The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Academic Council (AC) will discuss a proposal to implement the Common University Entrance Test (CUET) from the academic session 2022-2023 on Wednesday even as over 100 faculty members want the matter to be deliberated upon further before it is taken up by the AC. The implementation of CUET was placed on the meeting agenda as an additional item and shared with faculty members on Monday. CUET, which is envisaged in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, was scheduled to start in the 2021-22 academic session, but was put on hold in view of the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. In a letter dated November 26 and addressed to the vice-chancellors of all 45 central universities, including JNU, Delhi University (DU), Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI), University Grants Commission (UGC) said CUET will be conducted from the academic session 2022-23. Currently, JNU holds its own entrance examination, which is conducted by the National Testing Agency.The additional agenda item shared by the university on Monday comprised two letters, one sent by the UGC earlier and another letter from the Education Ministry to the NTA outlining directions for implementation of CUET from 2022-23. “In view of the letters mentioned above it is submitted that Jawaharlal Nehru University Entrance Examination 2022-2023 for all programmes will be conducted as per the directions of MoE/UGC, as already passed in the 157th Academic Council meeting,” the item stated. Ahead of the meeting, 111 faculty members from the university issued a statement on Tuesday and sought that the agenda item on CUET be referred for further discussion since it required extensive deliberation. “The Additional Agenda with regards to the conduct of next year’s JNUEE was circulated to members of the Academic Council only on 10 January 2022. Since this is a matter that requires extensive deliberation given the interdisciplinary nature of JNU’s programmes of study, we request the Academic Council to refer the agenda item for discussion at the School (BOS) and Centre(Faculty Committee) level,” said the signatories. In a Facebook post, JNU professor Ayesha Kidwai, one of the signatories, said that while the meeting was scheduled for Wednesday, the agenda item had been circulated on Monday evening in a last-minute exercise. “A matter that should have been widely discussed at the Schools and Centres before making it to the AC will now, thanks to this last-minute introduction, is all set to be passed by it without any discussion whatsoever,” wrote Kidwai. She added that the university offered a number of interdisciplinary programmes that were unique, due to which a common entrance test for other central universities would not be fit as an entrance mechanism for JNU. “How are the requirements of these programmes to be met in the entrance test, which must test candidates for their knowledge in not one but several fields?” said Kidwai. Last month too, a section of JNU teachers wrote to the executive council of the university raising concerns against the university’s purported plans of implementing the common university entrance test. Moushumi Basu, associate professor at the School of International Studies and JNUTA secretary, said that a free and fair discussion on important academic matters, such as the CUET proposal, was not taking place. JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Aishe Ghosh said that the vice-chancellor was making an attempt to bulldoze through a decision-making process during the pandemic. “The JNU vice-chancellor has yet again chosen the period of the pandemic to put an additional agenda to the Academic Council meeting for passing CUCET, without any deliberation and discussion with the student community,” said Ghosh. She added that JNUSU representatives had not been invited to the AC meeting and the move was aimed at changing the nature of JNU as a public university. JNU V-C Jagadesh Kumar and rector I Chintamani Mahapatra did not respond to calls and text messages seeking a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jnus-academic-council-to-discuss-common-university-admission-test-101641927876808.html
12-01-2022||Mumbai||BJP leader accuses mayor of fraudulently awarding BMC contract to own firm||Mumbai Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kirit Somaiya on Tuesday alleged that Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar bagged the contract of Worli Covid-19 centre from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), for the firm owned by her and her relatives, by using her political position. He alleged that the contract was given without floating a tender or following the set of norms and has demanded a forensic audit of the allotment. The BJP leader also accused Shiv Sena leader and standing committee chairman Yashwant Jadhav of indulging in money laundering with the help of a shell company. While Pednekar denied the allegations, Jadhav was not available for his comments. While addressing the media, Somaiya said that the BMC, headed by Pednekar, gave the contract to her own company in August 2020. “The company, founded just four years ago, had the turnover of just ₹1.5 crore to ₹1.88 crore initial four years until 2020-21, but it shot up to over ₹15 crore after the contract was allotted to Kris Corporation Services Ltd, owned by Pednekar with two other relatives. It was given without floating tenders or the pre-qualification bidding. How can the Mayor allot a contract to her own company,” he questioned.Somaiya said that the BMC should clarify how many contracts were given to the company owned by the mayor. “A high-level forensic audit needs to be conducted in the entire allotment. The BMC commissioner should tell the people of Mumbai about the procedure followed while allocating the contract. The commissioner has also directed offices concerned to not give out the documents related to the contract under RTI,” he alleged. Somaiya said that he was soon going to reveal the facts related to a contract given to a very close aid of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. He said that it would lead to a major embarrassment to the CM.Countering the allegations, Pednekar said that Somaiya has been levelling baseless allegations without any proof. “Somaiya has been entrusted by his party to make allegations against opponents. He has been doing it for years, without proving any of them. Even people have realised it. If he has any proof against me of any misdeeds, he is free to prove that it was done by manipulating the set system. The allegations are nothing but an attempt to defame us ahead of the civic polls. We will keep working in the interest of the people of Mumbai,” she said.Somaiya also accused Yashawant Jadhav of indulging in hawala transactions to transfer the unaccounted money through a shell company. “The unaccounted money worth ₹15 crore was given by Jadhav to a person who transferred it in the accounts of Jadhav and his relatives. The transfer was done by parking the money in a shell company by purchasing its shares at an inflated price,” he said.Somaiya has demanded an inquiry into the transaction by the enforcement directorate and income tax.Jadhav did not respond to the calls and messages sent by HT for his quote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-leader-accuses-mayor-of-fraudulently-awarding-bmc-contract-to-own-firm-101641927818098.html

According to the official records, Ghaziabad recorded its highest single-day spike of 1,788 cases on April 30 last year, during the peak of the second wave of Covid. “We are taking several measures to track and treat Covid patients, and we have also ramped up the daily testing in the district with 7,400 tests being done per day (as set by the state government). This will be further increased to 10,000 tests per day. Since the district has a large population base, the number of cases is also high at present,” said RK Singh, district magistrate. The district on Tuesday achieved a high rate of daily sample positivity at 14.82%, as the same for January so far stood at 8.33%. It is higher than the positivity rate of 7.41% recorded in May last year, and 9.12% in April 2021.Positivity rate refers to the percentage of people who test positive for the virus compared to those who have been tested for it.The 1,679 cases reported on Tuesday turned positive out of the total 8,969 samples tested the same day.With the fresh spike, the active Covid cases in the district have gone up to 6,125, with 6,228 of the total 62,142 infections reported in January 2022 alone.The district has conducted 59,681 tests in the past one week, recording 5,823 positive cases with a sample positivity of 9.75%, said the officials.Meanwhile, the state government on Tuesday released a list of hospitals that are being taken over as dedicated L1, L2 and L3 Covid facilities across the state. Dr Sunil Tyagi, additional chief medical officer, said, “The list includes two medical colleges, one district hospital and four community health centres, which will be notified as L1, L2 or L3 facilities upon a notice of three days. Till these hospitals get notified, they will admit regular patients as well... In wake of the rising Covid cases, we have already put 58 hospitals, including private hospitals, on standby, and they have a total of 3,459 Covid beds -- 796 ICU beds, 228 ventilator beds and 105 beds equipped with oxygen concentrators -- altogether.” The list of hospitals to be notified includes Santosh Medical College (L3), Rama Medical College at Pilkhuwa (L2), Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital (L2) and four CHCs of Loni, Muradnagar, Modinagar and Dasna (all in the L1 category). These facilities have a total of 1,064 beds, which could be used for Covid patients in case of emergency.The Uttar Pradesh government has also kept other hospitals in the state in the “to be notified” zone, and together these account for 42,383 beds. The L1 facilities are for patients having mild symptoms, L2 for patients with moderate symptoms, and L3 for tertiary care. The government has also authorised the district magistrate and the chief medical officer to notify private hospitals to be turned into Covid care facilities.

Another girl, who was injured at the site, was reported stable on Tuesday, officials from the district administration said.On Tuesday, Nuh deputy commissioner Shakti Singh sought a detailed report from mining officials about the incident. “As soon as we received the information, a team of officials from district administration and police was sent to the spot. The four bodies were recovered by the villagers. Another injured girl’s condition was stable on Tuesday,” said Singh, who also visited the bereaved families. Singh said that after the incident he sent a team of mining officers to the village to check if there were more such areas where the villagers dug mud to use for their personal use. “I have asked them to meet the village sarpanch and to ask the villagers not to send minors to the site during rains as such incidents might occur again,” he said. Varun Singla, superintendent of police, Nuh, said that the last rites were conducted after the post mortem on Tuesday. “The victims had started digging at the base of the mound, which caused the entire heap to collapse on them in the wake of recent downpour in the village. It was an accident and the family members refused to file any complaint. We have initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and have recorded statements of the family members,” he said. On Monday around 5pm, two women and three girls, all members of an extended family, had left home to collect dry soil from an earth mound for household use. Within half an hour, one of the villagers passing by heard their cries and raised an alarm following which other villagers rushed to the spot and managed to extricate five of them, but four died on the spot, police said. The deceased have been identified as Wakeela (19), Janista (18), Taslima (10) and Gulafsha (9). Nine-year-old Sofiya, who suffered injuries, recorded her statement on Tuesday, said police. Abdul Sattar, sarpanch of the village, said that the five victims had gone together to get soil for their houses from the mound which was around 15 feet high. “Due to rain, the area had become wet that led to the accident,” he said. He further added that they were digging from the bottom without realising that it could fall on them. Within minutes the mound collapsed on them, he said. Sher Mohammad, father of the deceased girl, said that they were in shock. “We wish we had not sent them alone,” he said. The district administration is preparing data on similar accidents in the district and have decided to call a meeting this week of all sarpanchs to apprise them of the situation and not to allow minors to visit any spots to get soil. Hameed , father of Gulafsha and a security guard working in Bhiwadi, said that he received a call from one of the relatives that his daughter has been buried under soil. “ I boarded a cab for my village which is 16km from Nuh. My daughter had gone to the site with her cousins for the first time and was excited to get soil to help her mother make an oven,” he said.Faisal, one of the relatives of the deceased, said that there was a wedding in the village on Monday, and when the girls did not return in half an hour, the family thought they had gone to see the wedding function. “Had the family known that mound has caved in, they would have gone there in search of them and the girls would have survived. The victims couldn’t get timely help due to which four of them died on the spot,” he said.
12-01-2022||Other||Positivity rate down in state for 2nd day||Mumbai: Maharashtra recorded a decline in the daily test positivity rate for the second day in a row, even as the caseload saw a marginal increase with 34,424 new Covid-19 infections on Tuesday compared to 33,470 cases recorded the previous day. By comparison, the number of tests conducted on Tuesday were 210,043 compared to 173,806 tests conducted on Monday. In effect, the test positivity rate — the number of positive cases per 100 tests conducted — on Tuesday was 16.38%, down by a little over three percentage points from Monday. Tuesday’s TPR is also the lowest in the past six days. Last Thursday, the TPR was as high as 21.27%, when the state recorded 36,265 fresh cases with 170,429 tests conducted. Mumbai, which accounts for a majority of the cases in the state also saw a decline in fresh cases reported for the fourth consecutive day on Tuesday, with 11,647 Covid-19 cases reported. The state’s case count now stands at 221,477, while Mumbai’s active cases stand at 100,523, down by 3,339 from Monday.Indeed, in the last five days, cases reported from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) have been declining. On January 7, Mumbai and MMR contributed 81.2% of the state’s total cases. The share dropped to 64.38% on Tuesday. Mumbai alone contributed to 51.24% of the total cases reported in Maharashtra on January 7. On Tuesday, its share was 33.83% of the state’s caseload. Health department officials however, are circumspect about calling this a dip in the wave for Mumbai and MMR, as this could also be a result of an increased reliance on home test kits, as a result of which the state cannot track the number of positive cases unless the person self reports. Whether it is a trend or lower reporting due to home test kits is still unclear. However, if one looks at Mumbai’s test positivity rate it is a positive sign as it has dropped from 30% to 18%,” a health department official, who did not wish to be named, said. He said that these are early days in the third wave. “We could see a similar surge in other centres in the coming days.”Pune (6,161), Nashik (1,414) and Nagpur (806) districts have also been reporting higher numbers. Health minister Rajesh Tope said that the expert pointed out that the third wave could peak by January end. However, these are estimates, he added. “The third wave has started and it has to be seen when it will peak. In the second wave, the peak was 65,000 [cases in a day] and then it started declining. It is difficult to estimate when this wave will peak, but experts opine that it could peak around January end,” said Tope.The minister added that the overall situation is better in the state compared to the second wave. He said that the oxygen requirement had not increased, while the hospital bed occupancy also remained low. “Today our oxygen requirement is about 250 tonnes daily. This includes both, Covid and non-Covid. If we segregate, the non-Covid demand, the need for oxygen has not risen a great deal. The bed occupancy has not shot up at a concerning level,” said Tope. He further added, “Out of the active cases, only 2% are on oxygen support and 1% is in ICU in the state. The numbers are not such that would burden the medical infrastructure.”

12-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi traders seek exemptions from WFH for small businesses||The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) on Tuesday urged lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, who is also the chairman of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), to reconsider the authority’s order directing private offices in the Capital to shut and shift to work-from-home mode. CAIT secretary general Praveen Khandelwal, in a letter to the DDMA, said there are more than three lakh private offices in Delhi where lakhs of people are employed. The DDMA decision to shut these offices will adversely affect traders as well as employees, it said. Khandelwal suggested that private offices having more than 10 employees be asked to shift to work from home while offices having fewer than 10 employees are exempted from the rule. There are a large number of offices run by small businessmen and professionals that employ a very limited number of people -- usually less than 10 -- and such offices should be exempted from this directive, Khandelwal appealed. “Traders fully agree with the government’s concern regarding the increase in Covid infections and all business associations of Delhi want to cooperate with the government in its fight against Covid. It would be better if the government holds discussions with traders before imposing restrictions so that a balanced approach towards Covid management and livelihood protection can be taken,” said Khandelwal. CAIT has also sought an appointment with L-G to discuss the issue. Brijesh Goyal, chairman, Chamber of Trade and Industry, said while large corporates can shift to work from home without any inconvenience or disruption, small traders find the shift quite difficult. “Many small traders are not digitally equipped for work from home. In many offices, employees still have to refer to physical files and records while preparing bills, work orders, etc. We will write to the DDMA seeking exemption for small traders,” said Goyal. Spokesperson of an automobile major said offices of the company located in Delhi were already working at 50% capacity, in compliance of the DDMA order. “As per the latest DDMA order, all employees are to be told to shift to work from home. For us, the health and well being of the employees is the priority,” the spokesperson, who did not want to be named, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/deli-traders-seek-exemptions-from-wfh-for-small-businesses-101641927222475.html
12-01-2022||Mumbai||Number of discharged patients rises in the state with revised policy||Mumbai: The revised policy concerning discharge of Covid-19 patients has led to over 48,000 patients, including over 42,000 from Mumbai alone, being discharged from Covid hospitals and health care facilities across Maharashtra since Monday.The Centre issued the guidelines on January 9, days after it revised its guidelines regarding home isolation. According to the new discharge policy, Covid-19 facilities and hospitals may discharge patients seven days after testing positive provided they have had no fever for three consecutive days. There is no requirement to repeat the test before discharge. According to the new guidelines, moderate patients too can be discharged after seven days of a positive report, if their oxygen saturation is above 93% for three consecutive days and they have not needed any oxygen support during this period. The discharge criteria for severe patients should depend on the clinical recovery and discretion of the treating doctors, according to the revised guidelines. The basis of the guidelines seems to be to ensure that hospital beds are not taken up by non-serious patients.Experts said that since little is known about how infectious a person is even if they don’t exhibit symptoms such as a fever for three consecutive days after seven days of treatment, people must continue to wear masks when they step out.On Monday, 29,671 patients, including 27,214 from Mumbai were discharged from public and private in the state. On Tuesday, 18,967 patients, including 14,980 in Mumbai, were discharged. In all, 48, 638 patients — 42,194 from Mumbai alone — have been discharged in the state over the past two days.State Covid task force member Shashank Joshi said that the new policy was similar to the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American nodal public health agency. “Once patients turn asymptomatic, they should strictly follow Covid appropriate behaviour and use double masking. For instance, a healthcare worker who has recovered from a recent infection can resume work with proper masking. If patients follow strict masking protocol after turning asymptomatic, they can simply resume their activities and not worry about passing on the infection to others,” said Dr Joshi.Doctors said that little is known about how long a person can be infectious, however, when patients don’t have symptoms, they don’t expectorate the virus as much as compared to a symptomatic person. “Before this policy came in, we were discharging patients only after their repeat tests came negative,” said Dr Rajesh Dere, dean of the jumbo Covid-19 facility at Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC). Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of the NESCO jumbo Covid-19 facility in Goregaon said that the new policy will open up beds sooner. “Previously, we used to take the samples of admitted patients on the fourth day. If they tested negative, we discharged them immediately and if they tested positive, we kept them under treatment for longer. Now, we can send them home after being symptom-free for three days.” According to Andrade, the new policy will reduce the burden on testing machinery as patients no longer have to undergo repeat tests before discharge. The policy signals the changing course of the pandemic where experts are saying that the focus no longer should be on every positive case, but rather on hospitalisations and people in need of prolonged oxygen support. The current occupancy rate of oxygen beds in Mumbai is 26% — a week ago, it was 13%.On the ground, the decision to discharge a patient has depended on the doctor treating them. However, the policy will largely be applicable to government Covid facilities that stick to rules mandated on paper. “When to discharge a patient is a decision that has to be made on clinical judgement,” said Dr N Santhanam, chief executive officer of Breach Candy Hospital. “It good to have a policy but ultimately, we have gone by the clinician’s decision always when it comes to discharge,” he said. Joshi added that the nature of the Omicron wave is such that 80% of the people are going to be asymptomatic with invisible infections. “The 20% patients with symptoms should be our focus, and we have to red-flag those patients who might progress to severe disease,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/number-of-discharged-patients-rises-in-the-state-with-revised-policy-101641927221193.html
12-01-2022||Delhi||Self-test kits could lead to unreported cases, warn officials||A surge in the demand for Covid-19 self-testing kits has raised concerns about underreporting of cases even as health officials termed these kits “a boon” as they have taken a significant load off the traditional Covid-19 testing infrastructure amid the fifth wave of the pandemic in the city. On the other hand, they also said the actual number of active cases in Delhi is likely to be higher than what is being reported in the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin.“The self-test kits are being widely used now, which is a good thing as people start solating themselves almost immediately without infecting more people. One does not even have to step out for the test. Those who test positive on these kits are mostly consulting private practitioners and family doctors over phone for treatment since the Omicron variant is presenting only mild symptoms. So, this time we are seeing more self restraint among people compared to the previous waves,” said a senior health official, on condition of anonymity. Chemist associations in the city said the demand for self-test kits has increased in the past one week due to a spike in Covid cases. The self-test kits, chemists say, cost around ₹250-275 and are easy to use. The associations are also taking measures to ensure that there is no shortage of essential medicines required for the treatment of Covid.Sandeep Nangia, president of Retail Distribution Chemist Alliance in Delhi, said, “Around 5,000 plus self-test kits are being sold daily. The demand has increased in the past one week. Till end-December, we hardly got any request for these kits.”He said the demand is more from upscale and middle-class neighbourhoods. “In south Delhi, we are providing around 3,000 kits daily,” said Nangia, who is also the organising secretary of All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists.But on the flip side, it has also led to a section of Covid-19 positive cases being counted in the government records, at least four chief district medical officers (CDMOs) that HT spoke to said on Tuesday. “In my district, so far, I have not yet received input of even one person who tested positive on the at-home kit. So, such people are getting treated on their own. In fact, in some cases these days, when we visit close contacts of someone who tested positive through RT-PCR testing, they say they’ll get tested on their own at home. Many such families have bought these kits in bulk to keep testing themselves in case symptoms develop,” said a CDMO on condition of anonymity. All four CDMOs and other state healthcare workers said only those who are being tested through RT-PCR and rapid antigen modes are being entered into the government records. “RT-PCR is being recorded 100% in Delhi, even if it is being at a private facility. Even cases turning positive in rapid antigen tests are fully recorded by the administration because these tests are conducted only by government entities through camps and other such set-ups. But, there’s no administrative SOP for recording cases that test positive on at-home tests. That is also because it is almost impossible to track every such person unless they are responsible enough to inform the administration on their own,” a second CDMO said, asking not to be named. According to the advisory issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), each of the at-home testing kit has a unique QR code to ensure traceability and genuineness. A user is instructed to log into the app of the respective brand, such as Mylab CoviSelf, CoviFind, etc., through their mobile phones. The user then has to click a picture of the test strip after completing the test with the same phone on which the app was downloaded. Data in the app will be centrally captured in a secure server which is connected with the ICMR Covid-19 testing portal, where all data will be eventually stored,” the advisory said.Delhi on Tuesday reported 21,259 fresh Covid-19 cases and 23 deaths, as the positivity rate -- rate of samples that return positive from among the total tested -- also climbed to 25.65%. With the fresh cases and fatalities, the cumulative number of infections has risen to 1,590,155 and the death toll to 25,200. A total of 19,166 cases and 17 deaths were recorded in the national capital on Monday.“Till 10 days ago, we used to keep just five to seven kits in stock. But now we are selling 50-60 kits daily. These kits are much cheaper than the RT-PCR test and very easy to use,” said Robin Sharma, who has a chemist store in Dwarka and is the president of the Dwarka Traders Association.In Bhagirath Palace, Delhi’s biggest wholesale market for medicines, traders said more and more chemists inquiring about these kits. Ashish Grover, secretary of Delhi Drugs Traders Association, Bhagirath Palace, said, “We are now getting a lot of enquiries about the availability of these kits. The sales have also started, but there is no significant jump as such so far.”Dr Nikhil Modi, Consultant Pulmonology/ Respiratory Medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, said for admissions RT-PCR tests are mandatory. “But, getting an RT-PCR test is gradually taking longer due to high demand, most doctors are now recommending at-home tests to patients who complain of mild symptoms. It’s an effective tool for quick detection and isolation. But for admissions, RT-PCR is mandatory. most doctors are now the number of. In the hospitals, so far the situation is pretty manageable. But, it is not the case that admissions are not happening. The numbers (admissions) are slowly surging because the daily cases are also increasing. But, they are all mostly the ones who are sick or have severe disease. Fortunately, we have not had any deaths in our hospital so far in this wave. There is no Long Covid in the Omicron variant. People are recovering even in three days this time,” he said.

Health-care workers in various hospitals are also testing positive for the disease in increased numbers, leading to manpower shortages at various levels, officials said. Apart from nurses and support staff, doctors too are testing Covid-19 positive and are in isolation. “The CMO and an ACMO have tested positive, but they are continuing to work from home isolation. Several healthcare workers are testing positive, but we have the necessary backup to handle patients. The good news is that most of the doctors who have tested positive are doing fine and are in home isolation,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate.At least 45 doctors in Sharda, 30 in Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) and five in Noda District hospital have tested positive for Covid. Several other private hospitals also have doctors and nursing staff who have tested positive. “We have made alternative arrangements at the hospital to fill in for the doctors who are out of action. The flu clinic and RT-PCR testing has been shifted out to screen all patients coming to the hospital as we have noticed that many try to hide symptoms. Initially, 32 doctors and 48 support staff are being put on Covid duty and the shift will be changed after a few days. Most of our 1,200 beds have oxygen supply,” said Ajit Kumar, director (PR), Sharda hospital. At GIMS, medical students have also tested Covid positive and are helping out inside the Covid wards. “Our staff who tested positive are making the rounds of Covid wards. We have several first year MBBS students who tested positive and had to attend an examination today while one of our Covid-positive doctors was an invigilator for the exam,” said brigadier (retired) Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida. Meanwhile, the state government on Tuesday released a list of hospitals that are being taken over as dedicated L1, L2 and L3 Covid facilities across the state. In Gautam Budh Nagar, 1,960 beds at nine hospitals have been reserved for Covid and in Ghaziabad 1,064 beds at eight hospitals have been reserved for these patients. Sharda Hospital is the only L3 facility in Gautam Budh Nagar -- to treat critical Covid cases -- with 800 beds while Santosh medical college is the only L3 facility in Ghaziabad where 400 beds have been reserved for Covid cases. In Gautam Budh Nagar 450 beds at GIMS, 240 beds at Noida Covid Hospital, 150 beds at the Child PGI and 200 beds at the ESIC hospital have been reserved as L2 facilities (centres for mildly critical cases). Additionally, 30 beds each at Community Health Centres (CHCs) in Bhangel, Bisrakh, Dadri and Jewar have been reserved as L1 facilities (to handle the mild cases). In Ghaziabad, the L2 infrastructure includes 352 beds at Rama Medical College, 82 beds at ESIC hospital and 110 beds at DCH Sanjaynagar. Additionally, 30 beds each at CHCs in Loni, Muradnagar, Dasna and Modinagar have been reserved as L1 facilities. Apart from these, various private hospitals have also been allowed to start Covid treatment facilities if they have the relevant infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/cmo-100-doctors-infected-in-noida-state-to-add-hospitals-for-covid-treatment-101641926676506.html
12-01-2022||Delhi||In a first, Delhi civic body to lease out heritage properties for commercial use||To protect heritage buildings and properties in its jurisdiction, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Tuesday decided to grant licences to interested parties to use these buildings for commercial activities for a period of 20 years, with the stipulation that the licensee bear the entire expenditure on account of renovation, modifications, maintenance and upkeep of the property for the duration of the licence period, officials in the know of the matter said. This is the first time that the SDMC is exploring the possibility of auctioning these heritage properties and buildings -- some of which are as old as 400 years -- to private parties for upkeep and maintenance. SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan said there are a number of heritage buildings and properties in his jurisdiction and some of them date back centuries. “With the passage of time, these structures have weakened and they require immediate repairs and maintenance. These properties cannot be demolished and can only be conserved and restored and periodically maintained,” he said. He further said the corporation will not incur any expenditure on this account. “On the other hand, the SDMC will generate revenue from the grant of licence to use these heritage properties. The license will be granted for running retail shops, pharmaceuticals, commercial offices, clinics, banks, ATMs, guest houses, coaching centres, restaurants or any other permitted establishments,” he said. He further said before taking the heritage property on lease, the licensee will have to submit the necessary drawings and design modifications to be made, along with a structural stability certificate, from a registered architect. “Initially, we are auctioning the 100-year-old house tax office building in Mehrauli, for upkeep and maintenance. The licensee will also have to submit these documents to the civic body’s heritage conservation committee for approval,” he said. When contacted, a senior official of the heritage conservation committee said the SDMC has a total of 475 heritage properties under its control, of which some are as old as 400 years. “Some important sites include the 250-year-old Hauz e Shamsi (water reservoir), 100-year-old house tax building, 150-year-old St Thomas Church and 350-year-old malaria office near Lodi mosque in Mehrauli. Besides these, the Dilli Darwaja of Najafgarh, Purana Darwaja of Badarpur, Shroff hospital and Zeenat-ul Masjid in Daryaganj and the Hauz Khas pond in the Deer Park are more than 100 years old,” he said, asking not to be named.According to the SDMC sources, the first property to be leased out on Tuesday was a 282.4 square metre plot in Mehrauli, on which stands the 100-year-old house tax building. The earnest money deposit (EMD), which is the minimum financial guarantee by the bidder, was set at ₹5 lakh for this property. The name of the highest bidder has not yet been disclosed by the SDMC.The main opposition party in the three civic bodies, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAM), has condemned the SDMC’s decision to lease out heritage properties. Senior AAP leader and party’s MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak said after selling off valuable properties, the civic body is now leasing out heritage properties, which are the pride of residents. “The BJP-ruled MCDs have no other business but to sell or lease out valuable assets. By allowing this auctioning, they are playing with the pride of Delhi residents and we will now see restaurants and guest houses in these historic places,” he said. The south corporation’s plan has also elicited mixed reactions from Delhi historians and activists. Heritage activist Sohail Hashmi said with this move, the every essence of heritage buildings will disappear. “Imagine if a restaurant runs out of the century-old house tax building. Who will know that the building is a heritage property? It is always better that the civic body ask corporate houses for funds from their corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative for repair and maintenance of heritage sites. And, which archaeologist have they consulted in this connection? This is just a money minting exercise,” he said. However, Swapna Liddle, another city historian, welcomed the move. “I don’t find anything wrong in leasing out these properties to private players, provided they don’t play with the heritage status of these properties,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-a-first-delhi-civic-body-to-lease-out-heritage-properties-for-commercial-use-101641926377297.html
12-01-2022||Other||Gurugram: Wait for Covid-19 test reports gets longer as cases rise||As the Covid-19 cases continue to increase in Gurugram, residents complain that they are having to wait for up to 48 hours for getting their test results. Officials from the district health department said that with increased testing, there is a slight delay in giving out the results due to logistical issues.It usually takes around 9-12 hours to declare results of an RT-PCR test for Covid-19.According to the data from the district health department, in the past 24 hours, 11,444 tests -- 9,131 RT-PCR tests and 2,313 rapid antigen tests -- were conducted. As of Tuesday, results of 5,645 samples were awaited, the data shows. Naresh Kumar, a resident of Sector 17, said, “My cousin and I gave our samples for testing last Sunday (January 2), and we received the reports after 48 hours. This was when the city was reporting less than 1,000 cases a day.” In the district, 12 private labs are authorised to conduct Covid-19 tests. In government set-ups, the polyclinic in Sector 31 conducts Covid-19 testing from 8am to 8pm, while 24-hour testing facility is available at the Civil Hospital in Sector 10. Besides, separate testing camps are also set up in different localities by the health department. Sanjay Kaushal, another resident who had given his sample at a government testing centre, took to social media on Tuesday and said, “I gave my samples for testing at a centre in Chauma on January 9, but till date the report is not available. I tried contacting the hospital also, but there is no response.” Rahul, a resident of Sohna Road, also shared similar ordeal who had given his sample on Sunday morning at a private hospital and said that he got his test results after almost 48 hours. During the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April-May last year, a similar situation was faced when sample collection slots were available for 48 hours later from the time of booking and results were being declared after 72 hours. On Tuesday, Gurugram reported 2,385 fresh cases of Covid-19, taking the tally of active cases to 11,955 in the district, according to the data. The test positivity rate on Tuesday was 20%, said officials from the district health department. As cases continue to rise, daily testing has also been increased in the district. In the last week of December, about 5,000 samples daily were being sent for testing. On January 1, total 5,962 samples were tested, and the daily testing figures now increased to over 11,000 on Tuesday. The health officials said that results are being released at the earliest, but with increased testing, there is a slight delay due to logistical issues. “When the positivity rate is less, pool testing is done and if the pool tests negative, then all samples are declared negative. But as the positivity rate increases, pooling is not done and samples are checked individually, due to which it takes time. But still most results are being declared within 24 hours. We also have to keep in mind that at all centres, samples are collected throughout the day and sent for testing in one go,” said Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer. A senior official from a private lab in the city said, “The wait time for Covid-19 reports has increased to 48 hours since last week as the number of home sample collections has increased.” Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the district also saw seven fresh cases of Omicron variant of Covid-19, taking the tally of Omicron cases to 64, of which one is active case. The district also recorded 590 recoveries on Tuesday. Besides, the Gurugram administration has added one more residential area to containment zone list. The district now has 26 containment zones. On Tuesday, a total of 32,208 doses of Covid-19 vaccine were administered, including 16,539 first doses, 12,804 second doses and 2,865 precautionary doses. With this, over 4.55 million doses have been administered in the Gurugram district till now. On Tuesday, 7,265 children in the 15-18 age group were vaccinated in the district. The district administration on Tuesday also issued an order stating that all current restrictions under the pandemic alert will continue till 5am on January 19. In the district, government and private offices, except for emergency/essential services, have been advised to function with 50% attendance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-wait-for-covid-19-test-reports-gets-longer-as-cases-rise-101641926256406.html
12-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi govt to administer booster shots at home to those with limited mobility||The Delhi government will administer at home the Covid-19 booster shot to senior citizens and the differently abled with limited or restricted mobility, senior officials of the health department said on Tuesday. A senior health official said that if any eligible person above the age of 60 years, is either bedridden because of illness or disability, they will be administered the third precautionary dose at their homes. “It is unlikely that there will be many such persons who have already completed nine months after their second dose. Any bedridden 60-plus individual who by nature of his/her illness or disability is rendered eligible for the precautionary dose by their doctor shall be administered the dose at home,” the official said, asking not to be named. The official also added that while the Delhi government began at-home vaccinations for senior citizens and the differently abled last year itself, on the directions of the central government, they were unable to extend this service to as many people as they would have liked. In August 2021, the Delhi high court issued notices to the Centre and the Delhi government, based on a petition filed by an 84-year-old senior citizen who informed the court that she was unable to visit a vaccination centre to get her jabs as she was suffering from severe arthritis. The petition also pointed out that several senior and bedridden citizens, who were vulnerable to Covid-19, did not have private transport to reach a vaccination centre or even a family member to help them with the registration process. In September, the Centre issued directives to state governments to make arrangements to vaccinate “those with restricted mobility, who cannot step out of their house to get vaccinated, such as the differently abled, elderly or those with special needs” at their homes. A senior official of the east Delhi district said all district officials have been reaching out to senior citizens who have completed nine months since their second dose to come and get their precautionary shot. For all of those who are eligible under this category, but are unable to reach their nearest vaccination centre, a facility of at-home vaccination has been extended. “Apart from sending text messages to those senior citizens who have completed nine months since their second dose, we are also reaching out to the eligible people on phone and asking them whether they have the means to reach the vaccination centre. The vaccination process is taken care of by trained vaccinators, following the requisite standard operating procedures,” the district official said, asking not to be named. Delhi started vaccinating senior citizens, healthcare and frontline workers with a third precautionary dose from January 10 and they are being administered the same vaccine as their first and second dose. On Day One of the drive on Monday, 18,835 precautionary doses were administered in Delhi, according to the Co-WIN data, of which 8,040 were given to senior citizens. On Tuesday, 22,265 precautionary doses were administered, with 6,083 beneficiaries being above the age of 60 years, the government data showed.

Gogi has been at loggerheads with Ashu since he (Gogi) was allegedly sidelined in the race for mayor in 2018 and Balkar Sandhu was elected the mayor with Ashu’s support.Councillor (ward number 76) Gogi alleged Ashu has belittled Congress workers and even misbehaved with the voters. “Ashu is the reason the Congress has lost its ground in the city. He is also allegedly involved in multiple scams,” said Gogi. “I have been associated with Congress since 1996 and been forced to leave the party only due to Ashu’s misconduct. I have joined AAP to bring change and work for the betterment of the people,” said Gogi.When asked if he will contest against minister Ashu, Gogi stated the decision has to be taken by the party high command.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gurpreet-gogi-joins-aap-blames-bharat-bhushan-ashu-for-congress-losing-ground-in-ludhiana-101641925836377.html
12-01-2022||Chandigarh||Haryana imposes ESMA for six months||The Haryana government on Tuesday invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act, prohibiting any strike by doctors or other categories of the health department employees in the next six months.The state government decided to clamp down as the doctors, under the banner of the Haryana Civil Medical Services Association (HCMSA), went ahead with their strike call on Tuesday. The protesting doctors are seeking incentives for specialised doctors and that 40% in-service candidates should be given benefits in postgraduate services. They are also opposing the government’s decision to directly recruit senior medical officers (SMOs).The state government’s order also stops other categories of employees of the health department such as those engaged on contract, daily wagers, honorarium basis staff, etc working in various entities including the National Health Mission, the Food and Drug Administration, AYUSH, etc from going on strike.“Haryana is satisfied that an emergent public health situation has arisen due to surge in Covid cases and any strike by employees of the health department at this time will gravely affect the health essential services required to safeguard the life of the community,” chief secretary Sanjeev Kaushal said in his order.“ESMA has been implemented in Haryana, now health workers will not be able to go on strike for six months. This step has been taken after a group of doctors went on strike to obstruct the prevention of Covid,” Haryana health minister Anil Vij tweeted.Nod for specialist-cadre postMeanwhile, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has given in-principle approval to create specialist-cadre post for MD/MS doctors. The doctors will not be given any administrative work. The government will create a special sub-cadre for specialists, who will be designated as consultant or senior consultants.Earlier, the doctors with MBBS degree alone or MD/MS used to be in the same cadre. “With the creation of the specialist-cadre post, these doctors will be able to focus on their work which will protect their interest,” the spokesperson said.The specialist-cadre doctors will now be posted in big and renowned hospitals rather than in primary health centres (PHCs).“The chief minister said doctors have a pivotal role to play in the society, especially in the present crisis situation and the government is committed towards their welfare,” the spokesperson said, adding that with this, a long standing demand of the doctors has been fulfilled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-imposes-esma-for-six-months-101641915035089.html
12-01-2022||Lucknow||Takeaways, direct orders the only hope for restaurants!||The restaurants and bars in Lucknow are already operating with 50% capacity. The 10 pm curfew already in place and with dine-ins being restricted in Delhi, food joints back here see the writing on the wall. They feel direct orders to restaurants and takeaways will be the best way to survive in the current pandemic wave scenario. “Dine-in footfall has decreased and deliveries are more in focus so we are reassessing our staff by diverting them towards home deliveries and encouraging takeaways. It’s a win-win situation for all as we can utilize our staff and customers to get better rates on direct orders as the high commission taken by aggregators is saved,” says Jatin Ahuja of Royal Café group adding they are contemplating discounts on direct order. During his visit to Lucknow, MasterChef Sanjeev Kapoor said, “Now buyers are supporting small food businesses that are struggling due to the pandemic and are ordering from them directly so they can save on the food aggregator’s commissions. In current scenario, this is a need of the business.” Chef Bhasker Mishra saw this scenario coming and has been working on this aggressively. “We know if dine-in is closed in Delhi so eventually it will here too. We have strengthened our direct delivery system at Sassy Canteen and as a result two-third of our delivery is direct to us which saves customer extra rates that restaurants inflate for commission and they get customized service,” he says. Rishi Mishra of cloud kitchen Vito’s Pizzeria informs that they have launched an app to encourage direct orders. “Customers can scan and order directly so we can offer customized services and best possible deliver. Plus, they are getting 25% discount and we too are happy as we don’t have to pay commission.” In the given situation food joints are banking on their loyal customer base to order to them directly to help them sustain and tide through these recurring waves, adds Chef Himani Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/takeaways-direct-orders-the-only-hope-for-restaurants-101641908556012.html

12-01-2022||Chandigarh||At home in the house with the yellow roses||How strange this life is; forever coming up with unexpected situations and springing surprises! Howsoever good a planner, one may be, life is bound to lead you up an unknown path, sooner or later. Let us settle for the fact that a human being’s range has limitations. Disarmed, one pronounces, “I salute you, dear life; you are the supreme.” About three decades ago when we got our house constructed, we never imagined that we will ever think of shifting from this place. But then things came to such a pass that going somewhere else at the earliest became our priority. I was so much attached to the plants, bushes and flowers in my garden. The ones that were planted in pots were brought to the new house. Among them there were the bottle brush, the jasmine, the yellow rose bush and the seasonal flower-laden plants of phlox, marigold, chrysanthemums and dog flowers. All these filled the new house with their exquisite fragrance besides giving it a heavenly look. They played a momentous role in making the shifting relatively easier. I had reminded myself about change, being the law of nature as well. And compromising with the changed circumstances happily, too has its own significance. I started counting the plus points of the new place beforehand so much so that when we really shifted, I felt so much at home already. But I missed my small tree-like hibiscus bush, which had been with us for about three decades. I had penned so many writings while sitting under this bush. It had even suggested quite a few innovative themes and always made me feel as if it knew me better than even myself. Basically, it seemed to talk to me! I owe so much to the hibiscus that I will never be able to thank it enough. Even the daily visitors like birds, butterflies and bees shared a sublime association with me. I am compelled to presume that they too must be missing me, just as they dominate all my thoughts and conversations. After a couple of days, one of the neighbours, looking depressed, observed, “It’s more than a year since we came here, but still, I don’t feel at home.” Another resident asked me, “Aren’t you missing your earlier place?” “To tell you the fact, I love my new home.” My words, uttered in a convincing manner brought an amicable smile on the neighbour’s face. Then one morning the gate bell rang. It was the newspaper boy. “Aunty, is yours the house with yellow roses?” Surprised I said, “Yes!” “Okay, then please check the newspapers in your balcony.” Upon being told that they were there, he said, “Fine; now onwards, I’ll deliver your papers there only.” The boy departed soon, but not before giving me a new high. After all our present home had already earned a name for itself: The house with yellow roses! parambirkaur@gmail.com The writer is a Ludhiana-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/at-home-in-the-house-with-the-yellow-roses-101641988547402.html
12-01-2022||Chandigarh||Himachal: Former Dharamshala mayor booked for cheating||Himachal Pradesh state vigilance and anti-corruption bureau on Tuesday booked former Dharamshala mayor Devinder Singh Jaggi for cheating and criminal conspiracy.Jaggi is a state secretary of the Congress and also a sitting councillor of MC.The bureau has also booked Mahesh Dutt Sharma, the then executive officer of Dharamshala MC, for cheating, criminal conspiracy and under the Prevention of Corruption Act for causing wrongful loss to the exchequer.Additional SP (vigilance) Balbir Singh Jaswal said that the councillors of Dharamshala MC had lodged a complaint alleging that Jaggi had taken a building of the civic body on lease for ₹20,111 per month, whereas he was receiving rent in lakhs. Jaswal said that on inquiry, it was found that the building in question was initially constructed as a rest house for employees. In 2005, this under-construction building was leased out to Jaggi without mentioning the security amount and rent in the tender notice, he added. In the initial resolution passed by the House, a security amounting ₹30 lakh was fixed besides a monthly rent of ₹30, 000 with the lease period of 25 years. It was revealed that then executive officer bent rules for the auction of this building to ‘benefit’ Jaggi. Jaswal said after the building was handed over to Jaggi, the then executive officer without prior approval of the house authorised him to mortgage the building with any bank for loan purpose up to the lease period and also issued a NOC for the same.“Up to March 2019, Jaggi had collected over ₹ 1.6 crore as rent by mortgaging and subletting the building while he himself paid only ₹18.38 lakh to the civic body,” said the vigilance officer.After approval from vigilance headquarters, a case under sections 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC has been registered against Jaggi and Mahesh Dutt Sharma. Also, Sharma has been booked under section 13 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Meanwhile, Jaggi said that the case was politically motivated and he had all documents to prove his innocence.

The padyatra covered a distance of about 14.3 km from Kanakapura to Chikkenahalli, with participation of hundreds of Congress workers and supporters. The padayatra spanning a distance of nearly 139 km is scheduled to conclude at Basavanagudi in Bengaluru on January 19.On Tuesday, a video of senior Congress leader Shivakumar sneezing several times while walking without a mask was posted by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on its official Twitter handle, with a caption saying “visible symptoms of Covid-19”. It also termed the Shivaumar’s action as a “super spreader” and said the march was “politically motivated” and not being done for the welfare of the state.HT cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video.Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, meanwhile, slammed Shivakumar, who reportedly refused to take a Covid-19 test after the padayatra. A video of Shivakumar refusing to give his sample to a health official, who came to collect it on Sunday night, was also circulated on social media. The official who visited Shivakumar has reportedly tested positive for Covid-19. Soon after, Shivakumar accused the government of trying to “infect” him with Covid-19 by exposing him to an official who tested positive for coronavirus.“Additional District Commissioner who came to test me last night has tested COVID-19 positive. He was sent to make sure that I get infected and test positive. The Government wants to make me a primary contact of the COVID positive person and that is why the official had been sent,” Shivakumar alleged on Monday.“This may not be the idea of Chief Minister. But the Health Minister (K. Sudhakar) is capable of doing it,” he further alleged.Shivakumar’s brother and Bengaluru Rural MP D K Suresh, former Ministers Krishna Byre Gowda, H Anjaneya, and party leaders like- Narayanaswamy, Motamma, P T Parameshwara Naik, Dhruvanarayana, are among those mentioned in the second FIR.They have been booked for violation of guidelines, gathering in huge numbers, without wearing masks and maintaining social distance, under the Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Act and sections of IPC, the FIR said.The Karnataka government has imposed a curfew on weekends and restricted public gatherings amid surge in cases of Covid-19. It has also imposed a night curfew and prohibited all rallies and protests.The Mekedatu balancing reservoir-cum drinking water project, to be constructed across the Cauvery river basin, has been at the centre of controversy between the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Earlier too on July 12, 2021, Bommai had said that the Centre will have to give clearance to the project as per law and there is no reason the state government will stop the project.

12-01-2022||World||Voting rights in US: Joe Biden bats for change in Senate rules||Declaring that the very basis and future of American democracy and its global reputation was at stake, the US President Joe Biden made his most forceful push yet for the passage of two laws related to voting rights, and threw his weight behind changing Senate rules to overcome opposition by the Republicans.Speaking in Atlanta on Tuesday, soon after meeting Martin Luther King Jr’s family, in the presence of vice-president Kamala Harris, voting rights advocates and prominent Black leaders of the Democratic Party, Biden said that the “the right to vote and to have that vote counted is democracy’s threshold liberty”.Arguably the most contentious political issue in American politics at the moment, the debate on voting rights relates to who gets to vote, how, where, who counts the votes, and who certifies the election. The dispute between Republicans and Democrats on all these questions has intensified over the past decade.Joe Biden said that in response to the hard work that was done to enhance voter registration, expand voter access, and deepen civil rights, the Republicans have chosen “wrong way, the undemocratic way”. “To them, too many people voting in a democracy is a problem. So they’re putting up obstacles.” He then cited specific examples of steps taken by Republicans to restrict voter access - by seeking to make it harder to vote by mail; limiting the number of drop boxes where one could drop your ballots off and reducing the number of hours one could do so; restricting provision of food and water to those standing in voting queues on election day (as a Georgia law does); making it easier to remove election officials who had abided by the law in 2020 and appoint partisan cronies to influence the counting and certification process.“Last year alone, 19 states not proposed but enacted 34 laws attacking voting rights…Jim Crow 2.0 is about two insidious things: voter suppression and election subversion. It’s no longer about who gets to vote; it’s about making it harder to vote. It’s about who gets to count the vote and whether your vote counts at all,” Joe Biden added. Claiming that the goal of the “former president” - Biden does not refer to Donald Trump by name - and his allies were to “disenfranchise” anyone who voted against them, he said, “The facts won’t matter; your vote won’t matter. That’s the kind of power you see in totalitarian states, not in democracies.”The US president said that the world was watching, and cited the example of a G-7 meeting where, in response to his claim that America was back, allies asked him, “For how long?” “As someone who’s worked in foreign policy my whole life, I never thought I would ever hear our allies say something like that.”It was in this backdrop that Joe Biden made a pitch to the Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act - which, he claimed, would ensure full access to voting by mail, enough drop boxes during enough hours, provision of food and water to people waiting in line, protection of non-partisan election officials from intimidation and interference, get dark money out of politics, create fairer district maps and ending partisan gerrymandering - and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The latter would restore federal supervision over changes in election laws in states with a history of racial discrimination, a key provision of the Voting Rights Act which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013.The Senate is split equally, with 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans. With vice-president Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote, the Democrats have a simple majority, on paper to push through the two laws. But the Senate’s tradition of filibuster effectively makes it contingent on Democrats to have 60 votes to be able to pass the legislation. It is this clause that Biden argued against in Atlanta for the first time.“The United States Senate - designed to be the world’s greatest deliberative body - has been rendered a shell of its former self. It gives me no satisfaction in saying that, as an institutionalist, as a man who was honoured to serve in the Senate. The threat to our democracy is so grave that we must find a way to pass these voting rights bills, debate them and vote. Let the majority prevail. And if that bare minimum is blocked, we have no option but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster for this.”The next act in US’s saga over voting rights will now play out back in Washington DC, where the Democrats hope to push for a change in Senate rules on January 17 - the birth anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/voting-rights-in-us-joe-biden-bats-for-change-in-senate-rules-101642007750019.html

12-01-2022||World||British PM Boris Johnson apologises in Parliament for attending lockdown party||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday extended a “heartfelt apology” in the House of Commons in response to growing anger around reports of a “bring-your-own-booze” (BYOB) party in the 10 Downing Street garden during Covid-19 lockdown in May 2020.Johnson has been under intense pressure from the Opposition Labour Party as well as members of his own Conservative Party since an email invitation for the event on May 20, 2020 emerged in the media.He expressed “regret” as he admitted for the first time that he did attend the event, which he said he believed fell within the scope of a work event.“I want to apologise. I know that millions of people across this country have made extraordinary sacrifices over the last 18 months,” Johnson said in his statement to the Commons ahead of the weekly Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) session.Also read | ‘Absolutely wrong, counterproductive, mumbo jumbo’: UK's Johnson on anti-vaxxers"I know the things they feel with me and at the government I lead when they think that in Downing Street itself the rules are not being properly followed by the people who make the rules. And although I cannot anticipate the conclusions of the current inquiry, I have learned enough to know there are things we simply did not get right and I must take responsibility,” he said.He went on to lay out the details of his presence at the garden party "to thank groups of staff before going into my office 25 minutes later to continue waiting"."I believed it was a work event. With hindsight, I should have sent everyone back inside, I should have found some other way to thank them and I should have recognised that even if it could be said to be technically within the guidance, there would be millions and millions of people who simply would not see it that way," he said, calling on Parliament to wait for the findings of an ongoing investigation into lockdown breaches within government ranks.However, he faced a blistering attack from the Opposition benches, with Labour Leader Keir Starmer leading the charge to demand his resignation."Well, there we have it. After months of deceit and deception, the pathetic spectacle of a man who's run out of rope. His defence that he didn't realise he was at a party is so ridiculous that it's actually offensive to the British public,” said Starmer."When the whole country was locked down, he was holding boozy parties in Downing Street. Is he now going to do the decent thing and resign," he questioned.The session was dominated by questions over the lockdown party, with members of Parliament terming the apology as “too little too late” and “worthless”, forcing the UK prime minister to keep repeating his apology and regret."I want to repeat that I thought it was a work event, and I regret very much that we did not do things differently that evening," Johnson said."I take responsibility and I apologise. But as for his (Starmer) political point, I don't think that he should pre-empt the outcome of the inquiry," he said.The inquiry is being conducted by senior UK civil servant Sue Gray, who is investigating all such alleged lockdown breaches within government quarters including at Downing Street.The latest gathering first came to light last week after a string of other revelations around gatherings held during the lockdown in 2020. Previously, a photograph had emerged from May 15, 2020 – five days before the so-called BYOB drinks party – showing Johnson, his wife Carrie and 17 staff members, also in the Downing Street garden. The UK prime minister had dismissed this as "people at work, talking about work" rather than a gathering.He has since maintained that it was for the ongoing internal investigation to conclude if laws were broken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-pm-boris-johnson-apologises-in-parliament-for-attending-lockdown-party-101641993667256.html

12-01-2022||World||German president calls for debate over Covid vaccine mandate||Germany's president called Wednesday for a thorough debate over plans for compulsory coronavirus vaccinations in the country, saying such a drastic measure needs to be comprehensively justified.Chancellor Olaf Scholz has backed calls for a vaccine mandate and lawmakers are expected to begin debating a bill later this month. Polls show a majority of people in Germany back compulsory vaccination against Covid-19, but a vocal minority opposes the idea.“The exceptional situation of a pandemic increases the pressure for the state to act, but it doesn't replace the requirement to weigh up arguments and balance interests,” German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said at the beginning of a roundtable debate with citizens on the issue.“A vaccine mandate means a debate mandate,” he added.Steinmeier, whose role is largely ceremonial, said he wouldn't take sides in the debate but urged those involved to have “respect for other positions, but also respect for facts and reason that must be and remain our common currency.”He dismissed as “complete nonsense claims that the coronavirus pandemic has turned Germany into a dictatorship,” saying such allegations betray contempt for our democratic institutions and the rule of law.“Among friends, at work, in schools, in daycare centers, in clinics and nursing homes, in city halls, health offices and parliaments, people everywhere are trying to figure out together what needs to be done” to fight the pandemic, Steinmeier said. “And that’s exactly what this democratic struggle is about, also for us here today in this debate.”Among the people debating was a nurse from Cologne and the head of a nursing home in Berlin who both stressed how essential it is to be vaccinated so that especially the most vulnerable of society — those who are ill and old — can be protected from the virus.A professor for health communication pointed out that a lot of the people who refuse to get vaccinated are simply afraid of the vaccines. Cornelia Betsch criticized authorities for initially missing many opportunities to better explain how safe and important the vaccines are.“Many people are simply afraid of getting vaccinated and a mandate can create counter feelings,” she said adding that there need to be more efforts to inform those who are hesitant about the advantages of vaccinations.Around 72.2% of Germans are considered “fully vaccinated,” while at least 44.2 % have received an additional booster shot.Germany's disease control agency reported 80,430 newly confirmed cases of Covid-19 in a single day, a new record since the start of the pandemic. The country saw 384 additional deaths linked to the coronavirus in the past 24 hours.Among those who oppose a vaccine mandate are some members of the Free Democrats, who are part of the ruling coalition, and Germany’s former health minister who pledged last summer not to introduce a general vaccine mandate. Political leaders have agreed to let lawmakers vote according to their own conscience rather than along party lines on the issue.The looming mandate has also been a rallying point for vocal anti-vaccine campaigners who have taken part in protests against Germany’s pandemic restrictions. Some recent demonstrations have turned violent, with protesters attacking police officers after being ordered to disperse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-president-calls-for-debate-over-covid-vaccine-mandate-101641991407286.html
12-01-2022||World||Covid-19 in China: Second round of tests for Tianjin as cases go up||The northern Chinese city of Tianjin ordered a second of Covid-19 tests for its 14 million residents on Wednesday, the second round in three days, after 33 new local cases were reported for Tuesday, up from 10 for the day before.Official media said 77 cases of Covid-19 including the Omicron variant have been detected in Tianjin, considered a “gateway” to Beijing and located a 40-minute high-speed train journey away from the capital since last weekend.The municipal government said in a notice that the second round of mass testing would start on Wednesday afternoon, urging all residents to stay put while awaiting the results of their nucleic acid tests.The news agency, Xinhua, said authorities have carried out almost 12 million tests so far, with 7.8 million samples returned. Infections were first reported on Saturday.High-speed rail service and other forms of transportation between Tianjin and Beijing have been suspended, leading to some disruptions in supply chains, including for packaged food items sold in convenience stores, an agency report said.The Chinese mainland on Wednesday reported 166 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases for Tuesday, the national health commission (NHC) said in its daily report on Wednesday.Of the new local cases, 118 were reported in Henan, 33 in Tianjin, eight in Shaanxi, and seven in Guangdong, the commission said.China, which has stuck to what is effectively a “zero-Covid” policy, is scrambling to prevent the spread of the highly infectious Omicron variant ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday beginning at the end of January and as Beijing prepares to stage the Winter Olympics from February 4.In the central province of Henan, the city of Anyang, where Omicron has also been detected in the community linked to the Tianjin outbreak, reported 65 local symptomatic cases on Tuesday, a surge from just two a day earlier.Vice-premier, Sun Chunlan, visited the province and said Omicron presented a challenge to the city’s virus control efforts.Officials should “further increase the efficiency of testing and epidemiological investigation and adopt strict community-level control measures,” the official Xinhua news agency quoted her as saying in a report late on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-china-second-round-of-tests-for-tianjin-as-cases-go-up-101641991547631.html
12-01-2022||World||Singapore bans book on political cartoons due to its ‘offensive’ religious content: Minister||Singapore has banned a book on political cartoons due to its “offensive content”, with the government on Wednesday defending its move saying the publication contained material that denigrated several religions and religious figures.Social and Family Development minister Masagos Zulkifli, who is also the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, told Parliament on Wednesday that pictures in the book titled 'Red Lines: Political Cartoons And The Struggle Against Censorship' are offensive to Muslims even if they are published in the name of free speech, academia or otherwise.He added that the book contained material that denigrated several religions and religious figures."The book also included images insulting to other religions. The authors may say that they do not intend for the publication to be insulting or demeaning, and their intention is to educate, but the government rejects that," the minister was quoted as saying by The Straits Times newspaper.The book, by Hong Kong Baptist University's professor of media studies Cherian George and graphic novelist Sonny Liew, has already been distributed in other countries like the US.The book by Prof. George, an Indian-origin media expert, examines political cartoons from all over the world and explains the various motivations for and methods of cartoon censorship.The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) said in November that the book, published in August, will not be allowed to be sold or distributed in Singapore, as it has been classified as objectionable under the Undesirable Publications Act for containing content that denigrates religions.This includes reproductions of French magazine Charlie Hebdo's cartoons, which led to protests and violence overseas, as well as denigratory references pertaining to Hinduism and Christianity.The demeaning and insulting images have led to rioting and deaths in several parts of the world, the minister said, adding that major publications have refrained from publishing them.Singapore's harmonious race and religious relations require constant care and attention of the government and the society at large, and it is vital that every faith is treated with respect, Masagos said."We don't want to risk anything that will begin unravelling the peace and harmony we enjoy from the due respect and consideration everyone gives to others."We remain committed to working closely with all our religious communities to preserve and strengthen our racial and religious harmony, which is a bedrock of our cohesive society," Masagos said.On Wednesday, Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo stressed that the government does not allow any religious group to be insulted or attacked, as hate speech and offensive content can easily be normalised and lead to deep social divides if left unchecked."To preserve racial and religious harmony in Singapore, we take a firm stance on such content regardless of their purpose of publication," she said responding to questions in Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-bans-book-on-political-cartoons-due-to-its-offensive-religious-content-minister-101641983111989.html
12-01-2022||World||Quebec seeks to tax the unvaccinated as Omicron hits||As the fifth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic continues in Canada, the province of Quebec on Tuesday proposed a monetary penalty on those who refuse to get vaccinated against the virus.While vaccine certificates have been used to prevent the unvaccinated from accessing facilities like gyms, nightclubs, sports events, theatres, or even airports, this is the first time that a “vax tax” has been taken into serious consideration by any jurisdiction.The idea was introduced by Quebec Premier (equivalent of a Chief Minister) François Legault while addressing a press conference on the Covid-19 situation. He called it a “health contribution” that could be introduced in the coming weeks on adults in the province who continued to refuse to get vaccinated.Legault said that while just 10% of the eligible population in the province remained unvaccinated, they account for half of those occupying beds in intensive care units (ICUs) during current wave of the pandemic.“All Quebec adults who refuse in the coming weeks to at least get a first dose will be getting a bill,” he said Global News reported.Quebec has been among the worst-hit regions of Canada during the fifth wave, with cases nearing 20,000 per day at one point. Though numbers have dropped since, large-scale absenteeism among health care workers due to infections have placed a strain on the system.Legault accused the unvaccinated of imposing a “burden” on the health care network, and wanted there to be “consequence” for their actions. Quebec has an overnight curfew in place, and from January 18 will bar those without vaccine passports from accessing alcohol or cannabis outlets.Legault did not expand on what form the punitive measures will take, but Canadians have to file their annual tax returns by the end of April each year, and the fine on the unvaccinated could be extracted at that time.The announcement has already attracted criticism from the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. “Allowing the government to levy fines on those who do not agree with the government’s recommended medical treatment is a deeply troubling proposition,” the organisation’s general counsel Cara Zwibel said, adding, “To justify this kind of restriction on constitutionally protected rights, the government must provide clear and compelling evidence and demonstrate that there were no other reasonable alternatives.”Last week Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadians were “angry” and “frustrated” with those that refused to get jabbed. He was followed by Canada’s health minister Jean-Yves Duclos who said that vaccine mandates may become necessary to counter such reluctance.

12-01-2022||World||In China, snowmaking wraps up ahead of approaching Winter Olympics||With the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics fast approaching, in about a week’s time, many of the 354 snowmaking machines deployed across the three clusters of venues will be gradually switched off.“We are still making (snow), but only topping up at certain spots. It’s pretty much done,” said Austrian engineer Manuel Schoepf, an expert at Italian company TechnoAlpin.What’s been done for the Games is “crazy”, Schoepf, who is among a handful of foreign experts helping China to make snow for the event, told HT in Yanqing, a Beijing suburb, late December.More than five million cubic metres of snow have been made for the Games in the last few months across three venue , said Schoepf, who has also worked for the last two Games in South Korea’s Pyeongchang and Russia’s Sochi.The venues for the Beijing Winter Games have been divided into three zones, or clusters: Beijing, Yanqing - a hilly, suburban district in the capital, and Zhangjiakou in the neighbouring Hebei province.At least seven of the snowmaking machines have been deployed in Beijing.Making snow, however, is not unique to the Beijing Games, which will run from February 4 to February 20 followed by the Paralympics from March 4 to March 13.Artificial snow has been used to varying degrees since the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. In Sochi, for example, which has a subtropical climate with a long, cold winter, snow was made and stored in piles inside insulated storage facilities.Schoepf said for Winter Olympics, snow of a different consistency is needed – it needs to be hard.“With natural snow, it’s just too soft and too dry,” he said.“So here is it is too dry for us, actually. We have to make purposely wet snow so that it sticks, and also so that it freezes to the ground, because the ground actually doesn’t freeze here. Because there’s no moisture in the ground, it can’t freeze,” he said.“What we did here, for example, in Yanqing, is that we covered all those access roads from the top down...first to make sure we don’t get the dust problem on the slopes,” Schoepf says, explaining that dust getting on the snow was a major problem for them. The essentials to manufacture snow are water and compressed air, which are mixed and then sprayed through hi-tech nozzles, called “nucleation nozzles”.Several factors like the nozzle configurations, temperature and humidity play critical roles in manufacturing snow.At government-organised media tour in December, Jia Maoting, general manager of Olympic Sports Construction Development Company agreed about the need to make snow for snow sports at the Olympics level.“The natural hardness of snow cannot meet the requirements for major Winter Olympics competitions. Therefore, the venues have artificial snow with higher hardness. The two major stadiums, the National Ski Jumping Centre and the National Cross-Country Ski Centre (in Chongli district of Zhangjiakou), require a total of about 250,000 cubic metres of water to meet snowmaking needs,” Jia told reporters.Making snow from water is divided into four categories, namely reservoir diversion, rainwater recovery, surface runoff, and melting, Jia said, adding that the organisers are using water cautiously, and ensuring that there is no damage to groundwater levels.“We are not mining (the water), and will not cause damage to the groundwater,” he said.Jia, asked about water waster in an area that is arid, said that as for the snow water that melted this year, all the snow water will be collected, and will continue to be recycled next year, without a drop being wasted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-china-snowmaking-wraps-up-ahead-of-approaching-winter-olympics-101641979000169.html

Instead, countries should leave more time between booster programs and tie them to the onset of the cold season in each hemisphere, following the blueprint set out by influenza vaccination strategies, the agency said. The advice comes as some countries consider the possibility of offering people second booster shots in a bid to provide further protection against surging omicron infections. Earlier this month Israel became the first nation to start administering a second booster, or fourth shot, to those over 60. The UK has said that boosters are providing good levels of protection and there is no need for a second booster shot at the moment, but will review data as it evolves. Boosters “can be done once, or maybe twice, but it’s not something that we can think should be repeated constantly,” Marco Cavaleri, the EMA head of biological health threats and vaccines strategy, said at a press briefing on Tuesday. “We need to think about how we can transition from the current pandemic setting to a more endemic setting.”The EU regulator also said at the briefing that oral and intravenous antivirals, such as Paxlovid and Remdesivir, maintain their efficacy against omicron. The agency said that April is the soonest it could approve a new vaccine targeting a specific variant, as the process  takes about three to four months. Some of the world’s largest vaccine-makers have said they are looking at producing vaccines that could target new variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/repeat-booster-shots-have-immune-system-risks-european-medicines-agency-101641977391044.html
12-01-2022||World||NATO, Russia in high-level talks as Ukraine tensions simmer||Senior NATO and Russian officials are meeting Wednesday to try to bridge seemingly irreconcilable differences over the future of Ukraine, amid deep skepticism that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s security proposals for easing tensions are genuine.The meeting comes during a week of high-stakes diplomacy and a U.S.-led effort to prevent preparations for what Washington believes could be a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Moscow denies it is planning an attack. Still, its history of military action in Ukraine and Georgia worries NATO.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko and Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin will lead Moscow’s delegation at the NATO-Russia Council, the first time it’s convened in over two years. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman will also be at NATO headquarters in Brussels.The meeting is due to run for about three hours. The NATO-Russia Council, their chief forum for talks, was set up two decades ago but full meetings paused when Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. It has met only sporadically since, the last time in July 2019.With around 100,000 combat-ready Russian troops backed by tanks, artillery and heavy equipment massed just across Ukraine’s eastern border, Wednesday’s gathering has taken on great significance, yet it still seems destined to fail.“These are completely unacceptable proposals,” Estonian Defense Minister Kalle Laanet told public broadcaster ERR on the eve of the talks.Estonia, like its Baltic neighbors Latvia and Lithuania, relies on U.S. security guarantees provided by its membership in NATO. The three Baltic nations were once ruled by the Soviet Union but are now part of the European Union and NATO.Putin says Russia’s demands are simple, but key parts of the proposals contained in the documents that Moscow has made public — a draft agreement with NATO countries and the offer of a treaty between Russia and the United States — won’t pass muster at the 30-country military organization.NATO would have to agree to halt all membership plans, not just with Ukraine, and scale down its presence in countries like Estonia close to Russia’s borders. In exchange, Russia would pledge to limit its war games, as well as end aircraft buzzing incidents and other low-level hostilities.Endorsing such an agreement would require NATO to reject a key part of its founding treaty. Under Article 10 of the 1949 Washington Treaty, the organization can invite in any willing European country that can contribute to security in the North Atlantic area and fulfill the obligations of membership.“It has become crystal clear that not a single ally inside the NATO alliance is willing to budge or negotiate anything as it relates to NATO’s open door policy,” Julianne Smith, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said Tuesday. “I cannot imagine any scenario where that is up for discussion.”Maksim Samorukov, a fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank, says the lack of any real Russian concessions in Putin's draft agreement probably means that “Russia is ready to tolerate a failure of these negotiations.”The idea, Samorukov said, is to “demonstrate to the West that we are serious, we mean business. That Russia is really ready to take drastic steps to impose these concessions” on the U.S.-led military organization.Still, NATO can't afford to ignore Russia’s offer. Some members fear that Putin may be seeking a pretext to launch an invasion — like the failure of the West to engage — and any talks that would ease tensions over border forces, missile deployments or war games would be welcome.For the Kremlin, though, time is of the essence.Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that this week's talks have, so far, provided little reason for optimism. He said the outcome of Wednesday’s meeting, and one at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on Thursday, could determine whether it makes sense to continue talking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-russia-in-high-level-talks-as-ukraine-tensions-simmer-101641975473590.html

12-01-2022||World||Omicron quickly overtaking Delta globally in terms of circulation, says WHO||Omicron is quickly overtaking the Delta variant of Covid-19 and becoming dominant around the world, a senior WHO official has warned, with the global health agency cautioning that there is "increasing evidence" Omicron is able to evade immunity but has less disease severity as compared to other variants.It could take some time for Omicron to overtake Delta in some countries, because it depends on the level of circulation of the Delta variant in those countries, Infectious Disease Epidemiologist and Covid-19 Technical Lead at the World Health Organisation (WHO) Maria Van Kerkhove said on Tuesday.“Omicron has been detected in all countries where we have good sequencing and it's likely to be in all countries around the world. It is quickly, in terms of its circulation, overtaking Delta. And so Omicron is becoming the dominant variant that is being detected,” Kerkhove said during a virtual questions and answers session.She further cautioned that even though there is some information that Omicron causes less severe disease than Delta, “it's not a mild disease” because “people are still being hospitalized for Omicron.”The Covid-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update, released by the WHO, said that over 15 million new Covid-19 cases were reported globally in the week of January 3-9, a 55 per cent increase as compared to the previous week when about 9.5 million cases were reported.Over 43,000 new deaths were reported in the past week. As of 9 January, over 304 million confirmed Covid-19 cases and over 5.4 million deaths have been reported.The highest numbers of new cases were reported from the US (4,610,359 new cases; a 73 per cent increase), France (1,597,203 new cases; a 46 per cent increase), the UK (1,217,258 new cases; a 10 per cent increase), Italy (1,014,358 new cases; a 57 per cent increase) and India (638,872 new cases; a 524 per cent increase), the update said.Kerkhove said the 15 million cases reported in the last seven days are a “record high in this pandemic” and are an “underestimate” given the challenges in surveillance around the world and COVID-19 self-tests at home that are not registered.The WHO update said that the Omicron variant has a substantial growth advantage and is rapidly replacing other variants.“This variant has been shown to have a shorter doubling time as compared to previous variants, with transmission occurring even amongst those vaccinated or with a history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection; there is increasing evidence that this variant is able to evade immunity,” the update said.It said that in terms of disease severity, there is growing evidence that the Omicron variant is less severe as compared to other variants.Citing a non-peer-reviewed retrospective cohort study from the US, the update said the findings suggest that while the absolute number of cases and hospitalisations among children are currently increasing in the US, the risk of hospitalisation still remains lower compared to other age groups during the period when Omicron is circulating as compared to the period when the Delta variant was dominant.The update also noted that since December, six studies have provided evidence of reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) of Covid-19 vaccines against the Omicron variant."While early VE estimates against the Omicron variant should be interpreted with caution due to potential biases, these preliminary results provide evidence of reduced overall effectiveness of vaccines against the Omicron variant, with greater declines in effectiveness with increasing time since vaccination, relative to Delta... While a booster vaccination appears to improve VE against infection and hospitalisation due to the Omicron variant, more data are needed to assess both the magnitude and duration of the protection,” the update said.The WHO Technical Advisory Group on Covid-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) said that as coronavirus evolves, the composition of current Covid-19 vaccines may need to be updated, to ensure that “Covid-19 vaccines continue to provide WHO-recommended levels of protection against infection and disease by VOCs, including Omicron and future variants.”Kerkhove added that as Omicron enters and circulates among vulnerable populations, “we will see increase in hospitalisations and deaths. So please treat this virus as seriously as it needs to be treated. The narrative that it's the common cold is not true. The narrative that it is just mild is not true. So we have to really fight against it. It’s not the time to give up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-quickly-overtaking-delta-globally-in-terms-of-circulation-says-who-101641965843677.html

Many of these include pregnant women and children, the report further said.The Mail report was based on videos posted on social media, which it said have been widely circulated. These videos talk about the situation in Xi’an, Anyang and Yuzhou, where people have been quarantined after a few cases of Omicron were reported.Also Read | China locks down second city amid Omicron threatIn all, 20 million people - including 13 million in Xi’an – have been quarantined in these cities and are living in tiny cells, said the Daily Mail. These people are given wooden boxes and a toilet and are forced to remain in the metal boxes for as long as two weeks, the videos posted on Chinese social media platforms showed, according to the Mail.The videos also showed workers in hazmat suits providing food to these people. Some of them have complained that very little food is left in the freezing metal boxes, the Mail said in its report.A few residents of locked-down cities told the BBC that they were part of a 'big transfer' of thousands of people to the camps."There is nothing here, just basic necessities... Nobody has come to check up on us, what kind of quarantine is this?” a user said in one of the comments posted on social media.As soon as a Covid-19 positive case surfaces in a city, the authorities ask people living in the entire area to leave their homes and board buses, which then take them to the quarantine centres - the metal boxes. The Daily Mail quoted a witness to report that some of the residents were asked to leave just after midnight.The measures are part of China’s strict Covid-zero policy, under which Beijing is aiming to eliminate the outbreak before Lunar New Year and the Winter Olympics next month.Also Read | Beijing on alert as partly-locked down Tianjin’s cases jumpChina even sent three people to prison for more than four years over breaches of rules that led to Covid-19 outbreak in port city Dalian, in one of the harshest punishments for lapses in enforcing the government’s strict Covid-zero policy. The oversight allowed four people to infect 83 others, local media reported.But the measures are not proving that effective. Apart from Dalian, fresh Covid-19 cases were reported in Tianjin, promoting the authorities to start a new round of sample testing among its 14 million residents.Tianjin reported 33 domestically transmitted coronavirus infections with confirmed symptoms for Tuesday, up from 10 a day earlier, national data showed.Including infections in Tianjin, mainland China reported a total of 166 local symptomatic cases for Tuesday, more than 110 a day earlier.There were no new deaths, leaving the death toll at 4,636. As of January 11, mainland China had 104,189 confirmed symptomatic cases, including both local ones and those arriving from overseas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/midnight-evacuation-quarantine-in-metal-boxes-china-enforces-zero-covid-policy-101641960198787.html
12-01-2022||World||Ahead of crucial talks in Brussels, US tells Russia: NATO’s doors won’t shut||WASHINGTON: Ahead of a crucial meeting between the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and Russia on Wednesday, the US stepped up its engagement with European allies.Washington made it clear that Moscow’s proposal seeking a curtailment of the NATO’s engagement, activities and expansion in the east was a non-starter; and it reiterated its warning that any Russian aggression in Ukraine will result in “severe costs”.Wednesday’s meeting is the second in a series of three dialogues between the US and Russia in different settings this week, even as tensions between the two countries have intensified in recent days over Russia’s military build-up along the border with Ukraine.On Monday, US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman met her Russian counterpart, Sergei Ryabkov, in Geneva as a part of a strategic stability dialogue, focused on bilateral issues between the two countries. On Wednesday, Brussels will host the NATO-Russia council. And on Thursday, permanent representatives to the 57-member Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), of which both the US and Russia are members, will meet in Vienna to discuss European security.On Tuesday, Sherman met the NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and then ambassadors from the European Union (EU)’s political and security committee in Brussels. US state department spokesperson Ned Price said, “The meeting underscored the US commitment to work closely with the EU and its member states to address this urgent challenge together. They affirmed the United States’ and the EU’s unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The deputy secretary thanked the committee for their work to ensure any further Russian military invasion of Ukraine would result in severe costs, including coordinated economic measures, for the Russian Federation.”From Geneva, after her meeting, Sherman had told reporters, “We were firm… in pushing back on security proposals that are simply non-starters for the United States. We will not allow anyone to slam closed the NATO’s open door policy, which has always been central to the NATO alliance. We will not forego bilateral cooperation with sovereign states that wish to work with the United States. And we will not make decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine, about Europe without Europe, or about the NATO without the NATO. As we say to our allies and partners, ‘nothing about you without you’.”Watch: ‘Where’s the proof?’: U.S calls out Russia’s no-invasion claim against UkraineThese meetings are taking place in the wake of a Russian proposal in mid-December, whereby it has floated two draft treaties, one with the US and the other with the NATO. In its proposal of a new treaty with the US on security guarantees, the Russian draft states that the US shall “undertake to prevent further eastward expansion” of the NATO and “deny accession to the alliance” to the states of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Its second draft treaty seeks to effectively restore the NATO’s boundaries to its pre-1997 status, by stating that Russia and all parties that were member states of the NATO as of May 27, 1997 “shall not deploy military forces and weaponry on the territory of any of the other states in Europe”. The draft also asks “all member states of the NATO to commit themselves to refrain from any further enlargement of the NATO, including the accession of Ukraine as well as other states.”In a separate briefing on Tuesday, US ambassador to the NATO, Julianne Smith, said that in all their prior consultations and meetings with allies, it had become “crystal clear” that not a single ally inside the NATO alliance was willing to budge or negotiate anything with regard to the NATO’s open door policy. When asked about Russia’s demand seeking a restoration of the 1997 status of the NATO, Smith said, “Well, I think when you talk to NATO allies, one thing becomes clear in terms of consensus at the table, and that is that this alliance is not going to be rolling back time and returning to a completely different era where we had a very different alliance that was smaller and a very different footprint. I think we’re operating in today’s world with the NATO as it stands today, and I don’t think anyone inside the NATO alliance is interested in going back in time to revisit an era when the NATO looked a lot different from it does today.”

The United States continue to report an exponential surge in infections and record-high Covid-19 hospitalisations, largely driven by the highly contagious Omicron variant.After the US reported a record 1.35 million new Covid cases, top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said the country is approaching the "threshold" of transitioning to living with the coronavirus as a manageable disease. Speaking to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Fauci said "Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody."Omicron may be headed for a rapid drop in US and BritainScientists, meanwhile, are seeing signals that the Omicron-driven Covid wave may have peaked in the United Kingdom, and the US is about to follow the suit. Britain reported 120,821 new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, a significant drop from 142,224 infections on Monday, according to government data. But the experts warn that there’s still much uncertainty over the course of the pandemic.“We are seeing a definite falling-off of cases in the UK, but I’d like to see them fall much further before we know if what happened in South Africa will happen here,” Dr Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain’s University of East Anglia, was quoted as saying by Associated Press.The World Health Organization (WHO) said in a technical briefing last week that the overall risk related to Omicron remains very high due to a number of reasons. The UN health agency warned that a rapid increase in cases will lead to an increase in hospitalisations which may pose an overwhelming strain on health systems and lead to significant morbidity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-britain-reports-drop-in-daily-covid-cases-amid-record-surge-in-us-101641955240916.html
12-01-2022||World||Omicron may be headed for a rapid drop in US and Britain||Scientists are seeing signals that Covid-19′s alarming omicron wave may have peaked in Britain and is about to do the same in the US, at which point cases may start dropping off dramatically.The reason: The variant has proved so wildly contagious that it may already be running out of people to infect, just a month and a half after it was first detected in South Africa.“It’s going to come down as fast as it went up,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle.At the same time, experts warn that much is still uncertain about how the next phase of the pandemic might unfold. The plateauing or ebbing in the two countries is not happening everywhere at the same time or at the same pace. And weeks or months of misery still lie ahead for patients and overwhelmed hospitals even if the drop-off comes to pass.“There are still a lot of people who will get infected as we descend the slope on the backside,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the University of Texas COVID-19 Modeling Consortium, which predicts that reported cases will peak within the week.The University of Washington's own highly influential model says the number of daily reported cases in the US will crest at 1.2 million by Jan. 19 and will then fall sharply “simply because everybody who could be infected will be infected,” according to Mokdad.In fact, he said, by the university's complex calculations, the true number of new daily infections in the US — an estimate that includes people who were never tested — has already peaked, hitting 6 million on Jan. 6.In Britain, meanwhile, new Covid-19 cases dropped to about 140,000 a day in the last week, after skyrocketing to more than 200,000 a day earlier this month, according to government data.Kevin McConway, a retired professor of applied statistics at Britain’s Open University, said that while cases are still rising in places such as southwest England and the West Midlands, the outbreak may have peaked in London.The figures have raised hopes that the two countries are about to witness what happened in South Africa, where the wave crested at record highs and then fell significantly about a month later.“We are seeing a definite falling-off of cases in the U.K., but I’d like to see them fall much further before we know if what happened in South Africa will happen here,” said Dr. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain’s University of East Anglia.Differences between Britain and South Africa, including Britain's older population and the tendency of its people to spend more time indoors in the winter, could mean a bumpier outbreak for the country and other nations like it.On the other hand, British authorities' decision to adopt minimal restrictions against omicron could enable the virus to rip through the population and run its course much faster than it might in Western European countries that have imposed tougher Covid-19 controls, such as France, Spain and Italy.Shabir Mahdi, dean of health sciences at South Africa’s University of Witwatersrand, said European countries that impose lockdowns won't necessarily come through the omicron wave with fewer infections; the cases may just be spread out over a longer period of time.On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said there have been 7 million new Covid-19 cases across Europe in the past week, calling it a “tidal wave sweeping across the region.” WHO cited modeling from Mokdad's group that predicts half of Europe’s population will be infected with omicron within about eight weeks.By that time, however, Hunter and others expect the world to be past the omicron surge.“There will probably be some ups and downs along the way, but I would hope that by Easter, we will be out of this,” Hunter said.Still, the sheer numbers of people infected could prove overwhelming to fragile health systems, said Dr. Prabhat Jha of the Centre for Global Health Research at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto.“The next few weeks are going to be brutal because in absolute numbers, there are so many people being infected that it will spill over into ICUs,” Jha said.Mokdad likewise warned in the US: “It’s going to be a tough two or three weeks. We have to make hard decisions to let certain essential workers continue working, knowing they could be infectious.”Omicron could one day be seen as a turning point in the pandemic, said Meyers, at the University of Texas. Immunity from all the new infections, along with new drugs and continued vaccination, could render the coronavirus something with which we can more easily coexist.“At the end of this wave, far more people will have been infected by some variant of COVID,” Meyers said. “At some point, we’ll be able to draw a line — and omicron may be that point — where we transition from what is a catastrophic global threat to something that’s a much more manageable disease.”That's one plausible future, she said, but there is also the possibility of a new variant — one that is far worse than omicron — arising.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-may-be-headed-for-a-rapid-drop-in-us-and-britain-101641952130886.html

It is one of the key investors in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-south-korea-agree-to-resolve-issues-to-achieve-50bn-trade-by-30-101641952397325.html
12-01-2022||World||WHO body says COVID vaccines ‘may need to be updated’ for Omicron||A technical advisory group established by the World Health Organization said on Tuesday that current Covid-19 vaccines may need to be updated to ensure they are effective against new variants like Omicron.The statement comes after several real-world studies found the variant, highly resistant to antibodies from a past infection as well as those elicited by vaccination, reduced the efficacy of most used doses to under 40%.“The composition of current Covid-19 vaccines may need to be updated, to ensure that Covid-19 vaccines continue to provide WHO-recommended levels of protection against infection and disease by VOCs, including Omicron and future variants,” the body of independent experts said in a statement.The WHO set 50% efficacy as the minimum bar for coronavirus vaccines, which each of them met when tested against the variant that first spread in 2020, but has since been reduced by the Sars-CoV-2’s evolution.The WHO panel, called TAG-CO-VAC, asked vaccine makers to generate and provide data on the performance of Omicron-specific vaccines for now.Several companies, including Moderna and Pfizer, are testing Omicron-specific vaccines, while some others have begun testing pan-coronavirus vaccines in clinical trials. Pan-coronavirus vaccines are difficult to design.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-body-says-covid-vaccines-may-need-to-be-updated-for-omicron-101641952115973.html
12-01-2022||World||North Korea's Kim calls for more 'military muscle' after watching hypersonic missile test||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for boosting the country's strategic military forces as he observed the test of a hypersonic missile, state media said on Wednesday, officially attending a missile launch for the first time in nearly two years.On Tuesday authorities in South Korea and Japan detected the suspected launch, which drew condemnation by authorities around the world and prompted an expression of concern from the U.N. secretary-general.The second test of a "hypersonic missile" in less than a week underscored Kim's New Year's vow to bolster the military with cutting-edge technology at a time when talks with South Korea and the United States have stalled.After watching the test, Kim urged military scientists to "further accelerate the efforts to steadily build up the country's strategic military muscle both in quality and quantity and further modernize the army," KCNA news agency reported.It was the first time since March 2020 that Kim had officially attended a missile test."His presence here would suggest particular attention on this programme," Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, posted on Twitter.Unlike some other recent tests, ruling party newspaper Rodong Sinmun published photos of Kim attending the launch on its front page."While Kim probably unofficially attended other tests in the interim, this appearance and its Page One feature on Rodong Sinmun is important," said Chad O'Carroll, chief executive of Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea. "It means Kim is not concerned about being personally associated (with) tests of major new tech. And doesn't care how the U.S. sees this."U.N. Security Council resolutions ban all North Korean ballistic missile and nuclear tests and have imposed sanctions over the programs.Talks aimed at persuading North Korea to surrender or limit its arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles have stalled, with Pyongyang saying it is open to diplomacy but only if the United States and its allies stop "hostile policies" such as sanctions or military drills.U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland called the launches dangerous and destabilising."It obviously takes us in the wrong direction," she said at a regular briefing in Washington on Tuesday. "As you know, the United States has been saying since this administration came in that we are open to dialogue with North Korea, that we are open to talking about COVID and humanitarian support, and instead they're firing off missiles."The European Union on Tuesday condemned the latest North Korean missile launch as a "threat to international peace and security" and called on Pyongyang to resume diplomacy.'SUPERIOR MANOEUVERABILITY'Despite their name, analysts say the main feature of hypersonic weapons is not speed - which can sometimes be matched or exceeded by traditional ballistic missile warheads - but their manoeuvrability, which makes them an acute threat to missile defence systems.Photos released by state media appeared to show the same type of missile and warhead that was first tested last week, analysts said."The test-fire was aimed at the final verification of overall technical specifications of the developed hypersonic weapon system," KCNA reported.After its release from the rocket booster, a hypersonic glide vehicle made a 600 km (375 mile) "glide jump flight" and then 240 km of "corkscrew manoeuvering" before hitting a target in the sea 1,000 km away, the report said.South Korean officials had questioned the capabilities of the missile after the first test last week, saying it did not appear to demonstrate the range and manoeuverability claimed in a state media report and featured a manoeuverable warhead rather than an actual glide vehicle.On Tuesday, however, South Korea said the second test appeared to show improved performance, with the missile reaching top speeds up to 10 times the speed of sound (12,348 km per hour / 7,673 miles per hour), although they did not comment on its manoeuverability."The superior manoeuverability of the hypersonic glide vehicle was more strikingly verified through the final test-fire," KCNA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-calls-for-more-military-muscle-after-watching-hypersonic-missile-test-101641950683929.html
12-01-2022||World||‘Omicron will find everybody’: Fauci as US on 'threshold' of living with Covid||Despite soaring cases and record-high Covid-19 hospitalizations, the United States is approaching the "threshold" of transitioning to living with the coronavirus as a manageable disease, Anthony Fauci said Tuesday.Speaking to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the top US scientist said eliminating Covid was unrealistic and that "Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody.""There's no way we're going to eradicate this" virus, he said, given its contagiousness, its propensity to mutate into new variants and the large pool of unvaccinated people.Those up to date with their vaccines remain well protected against severe outcomes, but vaccine efficacy against infection has fallen.But "as Omicron goes up and down," the country will hopefully enter a new phase "where there'll be enough protection in (the) community, enough drugs available so that when someone does get infected and is in a high risk group, it will be very easy to treat that person," said Fauci."When we get there, there's that transition, and we may be on the threshold of that right now," he said, while also stressing that with the country currently recording almost a million infections a day, nearly 150,000 people in hospital and more than 1,200 daily deaths, "we're not at that point."Official data showed there are currently 145,982 Covid hospitalizations, even though a significant percent are thought to be hospitalized "with" the disease rather than because of it.Earlier, the 81-year-old director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases slammed vaccine skeptic Republican Senator Rand Paul for unleashing "crazies" who were threatening his life and harassing his family, in unusually emotional congressional testimony.President Joe Biden's top officials, including his chief medical advisor Fauci, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Rochelle Walenksy and acting Food and Drug Administration (FDA) head Janet Woodcock were summoned to testify before the Senate about the pandemic.While many fellow lawmakers focused their questions on the lack of adequate testing and confusing new guidelines on how infected people should end their isolation, Paul, who has railed against vaccine mandates and refused to get vaccinated, said Fauci was personally to blame for people's deaths.Paul faulted Fauci for hundreds of thousands of deaths that occurred since Biden took office -- although the vast majority of those fatalities were unvaccinated and health officials, including Fauci, have consistently advocated for vaccines.'Kindles the crazies'"You personally attack me and with absolutely not a shred of evidence of anything you say," Fauci responded."All of a sudden that kindles the crazies out there and I have life threats upon my life, harassment of my family and my children with obscene phone calls."Fauci recalled that in late December, a man was arrested on his way from California to the capital Washington armed with an AR-15 assault weapon and multiple rounds of ammunition.The man said he wanted to kill Fauci, because of what he said was blood on the scientists' hands.Fauci then brandished a printout from Paul's website that showed the banner "Fire Dr Fauci" next to an invitation to donate to the Republican's campaign.Though Omicron causes severe cases at a lower rate than Delta, it is reaching more people because of its extreme infectiousness.By December 27, the age-adjusted vaccine efficacy against hospitalization was 92 percent, according to data from New York state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-will-find-everybody-fauci-as-us-on-threshold-of-living-with-covid-101641944196234.html

A Vatican spokesman said Francis had gone there to bless the shop because it had been recently renovated.Martinez-Brocal told Reuters the shop's owners told him that they had become friends with the pope years ago when he was Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, archbishop of Buenos Aires.He would visit their shop to buy classical music records and CDs when he was in Rome on Church business and stayed at a nearby residence for visiting clerics.They said they gave the pope a CD of classical music but declined to be more specific. Francis is known to like Beethoven, Mozart and Bach -- and even tango music from his native Argentina.The video showed the pope, who shuns bulletproof cars leaving the shop and getting into a simple white Fiat 500 with Vatican number plates.It was not the first time the pope has visited a Rome shop. In 2015, two years after his election, he ordered a new pair of eyeglasses from a Rome optician.They were to have been delivered to the Vatican but he decided to go pick them up himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-makes-surprise-visit-to-rome-record-store-gets-classical-cd-101641944210812.html
12-01-2022||World||North Korea says Kim Jong Un oversaw latest hypersonic missile test||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un personally oversaw his regime’s latest hypersonic missile test on Tuesday, official media reported, as he pushes to develop weapons to counter U.S. defenses. The Korean Central News Agency said the hypersonic glide vehicle made a 240-kilometer (150-mile) “corkscrew” maneuver during flight to hit a target in waters 1,000 kilometers away. It called the launch “a great success in the field of developing hypersonic weapon, which is of the most important strategic significance.”“The superior maneuverability of the hypersonic glide vehicle was more strikingly verified through the final test-fire,” KCNA said on Wednesday. Kim congratulated the scientists involved, the report said, and stressed “the need to further accelerate the efforts to steadily build up the country’s strategic military muscle both in quality and quantity.” The missile, which flew at almost 10 times the speed of sound, has further stoked tensions with the U.S. and its allies as Kim ignores calls for a return to stalled nuclear talks. Shares of South Korea’s so-called “peace stocks,” which tend to benefit from talks between Seoul and Pyongyang, slipped Tuesday.The missile test took place at daybreak, KCNA said in its report, describing how Kim witnessed the advanced missile “brightening the dawning sky and leaving behind it a column of fire.” North Korea last week claimed a successful test of a “hypersonic gliding warhead” that turned 120 kilometers from its original flight path, potentially showing its ability to get around U.S. anti-missile systems deployed in South Korea.The fact that Kim’s presence at the launch was noted by official media is significant, according to Ankit Panda, a senior fellow in the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.“His presence here would suggest particular attention on this program,” Panda, author of the book “Kim Jong Un and the Bomb: Survival and Deterrence in North Korea,” wrote on Twitter. “Everything about this test is a reminder that North Korea is all-in on a new military modernization campaign.”Nuclear talks between the U.S. and North Korea broke down about two years ago after a brief revival under former President Donald Trump. The Biden administration has said the door is open for talks and indicated it would be willing to consider economic incentives to reward North Korea for taking steps to wind down its nuclear arsenal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-says-kim-jong-un-oversaw-latest-hypersonic-missile-test-101641942053911.html
12-01-2022||World||Omicron may be slowing down in US and Britain: Report||Scientists are seeing signals that COVID-19′s alarming omicron wave may have peaked in Britain and is about to do the same in the U.S., at which point cases may start dropping off dramatically.The reason: The variant has proved so wildly contagious that it may already be running out of people to infect, just a month and a half after it was first detected in South Africa.“It’s going to come down as fast as it went up,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle.At the same time, experts warn that much is still uncertain about how the next phase of the pandemic might unfold. The plateauing or ebbing in the two countries is not happening everywhere at the same time or at the same pace. And weeks or months of misery still lie ahead for patients and overwhelmed hospitals even if the drop-off comes to pass.“There are still a lot of people who will get infected as we descend the slope on the backside,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the University of Texas COVID-19 Modeling Consortium, which predicts that reported cases will peak within the week.The University of Washington's own highly influential model projects that the number of daily reported cases in the U.S. will crest at 1.2 million by Jan. 19 and will then fall sharply “simply because everybody who could be infected will be infected,” according to Mokdad.In fact, he said, by the university's complex calculations, the true number of new daily infections in the U.S. — an estimate that includes people who were never tested — has already peaked, hitting 6 million on Jan. 6.In Britain, meanwhile, new COVID-19 cases dropped to about 140,000 a day in the last week, after skyrocketing to more than 200,000 a day earlier this month, according to government data.Kevin McConway, a retired professor of applied statistics at Britain’s Open University, said that while cases are still rising in places such as southwest England and the West Midlands, the outbreak may have peaked in London.The figures have raised hopes that the two countries are about to undergo something similar to what happened in South Africa, where in the span of about a month the wave crested at record highs and then fell significantly.“We are seeing a definite falling-off of cases in the U.K., but I’d like to see them fall much further before we know if what happened in South Africa will happen here,” said Dr. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain’s University of East Anglia.Differences between Britain and South Africa, including Britain's older population and the tendency of its people to spend more time indoors in the winter, could mean a bumpier outbreak for the country and other nations like it.On the other hand, British authorities' decision to adopt minimal restrictions against omicron could enable the virus to rip through the population and run its course much faster than it might in Western European countries that have imposed tougher COVID-19 controls, such as France, Spain and Italy.Shabir Mahdi, dean of health sciences at South Africa’s University of Witwatersrand, said European countries that impose lockdowns won't necessarily come through the omicron wave with fewer infections; the cases may just be spread out over a longer period of time.On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said there have been 7 million new COVID-19 cases across Europe in the past week, calling it a “tidal wave sweeping across the region.” WHO cited modeling from Mokdad's group that predicts half of Europe’s population will be infected with omicron within about eight weeks. By that time, however, Hunter and others expect the world to be past the omicron surge. “There will probably be some ups and downs along the way, but I would hope that by Easter, we will be out of this,” Hunter said. Still, the sheer numbers of people infected could prove overwhelming to fragile health systems, said Dr. Prabhat Jha of the Centre for Global Health Research at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto. “The next few weeks are going to be brutal because in absolute numbers, there are so many people being infected that it will spill over into ICUs,” Jha said.Mokdad likewise warned in the U.S.: “It’s going to be a tough two or three weeks. We have to make hard decisions to let certain essential workers continue working, knowing they could be infectious.”Omicron could one day be seen as a turning point in the pandemic, said Meyers, at the University of Texas. Immunity gained from all the new infections, along with new drugs and continued vaccination, could render the coronavirus something with which we can more easily coexist.“At the end of this wave, far more people will have been infected by some variant of COVID,” Meyers said. “At some point, we’ll be able to draw a line — and omicron may be that point — where we transition from what is a catastrophic global threat to something that’s a much more manageable disease.”That's one plausible future, she said, but there is also the possibility of a new variant — one that is far worse than omicron — arising.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

12-01-2022||World||US sees record 1.48mn new virus cases||The United States reported at least more one million new coronavirus infections on Monday, the highest daily total of any country in the world as the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant showed no signs of slowing.The US saw 1,481,375 new Covid-19 infections for Monday, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The previous record was 1.17 million cases on January 3.A large number of cases are reported each Monday due to many states not reporting over the weekend. The seven-day average for new cases has tripled in two weeks to over 700,000 new infections a day, Reuters reported.The record in new cases came the same day as the nation saw the number of hospitalised also hit an all-time high, having doubled in three weeks, according to a Reuters tally.There were more than 141,000 people hospitalised with Covid as of Monday, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services, surpassing the record of 132,051 set in January last year.Deaths are averaging 1,700 per day, up from about 1,400 in recent days but within levels seen earlier this winter.The presence of the Delta variant of Covid, which has previously ravaged the country, would explain why deaths and hospitalisations are still rising, since data suggest that Omicron infections are less severe.Hospitals letting Covid+ staff stay on the jobHospitals around the US are increasingly taking the extraordinary step of allowing nurses and other workers infected with the coronavirus to stay on the job if they have mild symptoms or none at all.The move is a reaction to the severe hospital staffing shortages and crushing caseloads that the omicron variant is causing.California health authorities announced over the weekend that hospital staff members who test positive but are symptom-free can continue working. Some hospitals in Rhode Island and Arizona have likewise told employees they can stay on the job if they have no symptoms or just mild ones.Many hospitals are not only swamped with cases but severely shorthanded because of so many employees out with Covid-19.President Joe Biden said on Tuesday he was confident the US was on the right track in the fight against the pandemic. White House officials have said the situation is different from previous stages of the pandemic because more people are getting protection from vaccinations and booster shots.Mexican prez says he has Covid for second timeMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday that he had Covid-19 for a second time and was experiencing mild symptoms.“I inform you that I am infected with Covid-19 and although the symptoms are mild, I will remain in isolation and will only do office work and communicate virtually until I get through it,” he tweeted.

The accused gangraped the girl on January 5 and were taken into custody on Tuesday based on a complaint by the victim’s family members, Kalburgi commissioner of police, Y S Ravikumar said. All the accused are 15-16 years old, officials said. “The girl had dementia... On January 5, they took her to a desolate area ...where she was raped,” said a police officer. The parents of the girl filed a complaint in Gulbarga university police station on January 10. They said the girl suffered from dementia due to which the incident came to light very late. “The girl complained of stomach pain and later parents realised that she was raped. Following the complaint, we have conducted a medical test and rape was confirmed in the test,” Ravikumar said. Based on the complaint, police were able to zero in on suspects by Tuesday afternoon. “Since they (accused) were minors, we had to follow some regulations, such as not keeping them in custody etc. We have transferred them to a juvenile justice home. However, they have been booked under the IPC section 376 D (gang rape). We will see that the accused get maximum punishment,” the officer said. The girl was under treatment at a hospital, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-minors-held-for-gangraping-13-year-old-dementia-patient-in-karnataka-101642011831929.html

Police suspect the girl was raped because off the nature of her wounds. According to a senior police officer who was familiar with the case, the girl was reported missing from her house on Tuesday afternoon and was spotted lying on a road near the Tijara railway crossing late in the evening the same day.She was bleeding profusely and was taken to the district government hospital, the officer said, adding that she was then referred to the J K Lone hospital in Jaipur.Police are waiting for the medical report to confirm whether the girl was sexually abused.Dr Arvind Shukla, superintendent of the JK Lone hospital, said, “The minor was admitted at around 2 am, was under shock and bleeding profusely. Blood transfusion was done. She is stable and has undergone a surgery, where plastic surgeons and gynecologists were called. Her blood pressure has come back to normal.” He said that a preliminary investigation had revealed that the wounds could have been caused by a sharp object. Health minister Parsadi Lal Meena, industries minister Shakuntla Rawat and women and child welfare minister Mamta Bhupesh visited the girl at the hospital and spoke to the officials treating her.Speaking to reporters, Meena said the girl’s life was out of danger. “The entire treatment of the girl will be free and arrangements for stay and food for family members have also been made,” he said.Alwar superintendent of police, Tejaswani Gautam, said different teams have been formed to investigate the case. “Over 150 CCTV cameras in the area were examined and probable suspects are being interrogated. The girl is mentally weak and unable to speak properly,” she said.The SP said the girl is a resident of a village under Malakheda police station of Alwar and her family members noticed at around 4 pm on Tuesday that she was missing. On failing to locate the girl till late evening, they approached the police.Dr Rakesh, who is heading the forensic science laboratory team sent from Jaipur, said that according to initial investigations, it appeared the girl was brought in a vehicle from Tijara.Former chief minister Vasundhara Raje targeted the state government over the incident.“In the state, daughters are falling prey to the lust day by day, but the government has become zero. The atrocities on daughters cannot be tolerated,” she tweeted. Raje said that Rajasthan had reached the top spot in the country when it came to crimes against women and demanded strong action from the government. Constituting a four-member team to meet the family of the victim, state BJP president Satish Poonia expressed shock at the incident. “The minor is deaf by birth, but the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan is deaf and dumb with its policy and intentions, who is not hearing the screams of the victim and culprits are out of reach of the police,” he said. 
12-01-2022||India||Govt warns against overuse, misuse of Covid medicines||Warning against overuse and misuse of Covid-19 medicines, the government on Wednesday asked people to adopt a rational approach to the drugs used for treatment of coronavirus.Addressing a press conference, NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr V K Paul expressed concern over the "overuse and misuse" of drugs."There is a concern that whichever medicines we give it should be rationally used, there should not be any overuse. Last time, we saw a very scary situation when the contribution of medicine was to a very large extent responsible for mucormycosis," he said."The use of steroids can increase the chances of mucormycosis. Steroids are very potent life saving drugs but they are also have side effects and they disturb the immunological protection, they disturb many biochemical pathways so it was a very big lesson...we were learning at that time but now we know it so this is an appeal that general public should be aware that there is a set of rational treatments that are listed under the national protocols -ayush and mainstream protocol and we must be confined to that," he added.Paul said these protocols have been developed by best experts and we have a true concern of overuse misuse of medicines in Covid treatment."For fever, paracetamol is given, and for cough, Ayush syrup can be used. This is what we have prescribed in the home care module too. If cough continues for more than three days, there is an inhaler called Budesonide these are the only three things that need to be done," he said.Other than that do gargle, take rest not overdo it has a cost, he added."When we go to the hospital too and there is a need for oxygen then based on clinical judgment there is medicine - methylprednisolone or dexamethasone. Heparin is also given by the doctors inside hospitals...there are clear cut guidelines for remdesivir too there is no point of giving it at home - it led to overuse, panic and misuse," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-warns-against-overuse-misuse-of-covid-medicines-101642010470445.html

The health department made this projection during a presentation before the state cabinet and the cabinet expressed concern over the projection, a statement issued by the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) said, as reported by PTI.The daily requirement of medical oxygen in the state has witnessed a rise, it said, adding that the present demand is 400 metric tonnes. "If the oxygen demand rises to 700 metric tonnes, then stricter curbs will be required. Considering this fact, the district administration should expedite vaccination and take necessary steps," Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said during the meeting. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said that the coronavirus curve in the state is not flattening despite a dip in the number of daily infections. However, the plus point is that out of the 2.25 lakh active cases, only 14 per cent are under hospitalisation. Saying that he does not see the situation stabilise by January end or by early February, the health minister urged those who have not undergone vaccination to take jabs, besides strictly adhering to the mask rules. "The cases have seen a decline in the last two days, but this does not mean that the curve is flattening. There are 46,000 cases today. So there is no flattening of the curve," Tope said.On Wednesday, Maharashtra reported over 46,000 fresh Covid-19 cases and Mumbai reported 16,420 cases. Earlier in the day, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said the numbers of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai are coming down.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-may-see-a-rise-in-covid-hospitalisation-health-department-101642008432799.html
12-01-2022||India||Lateral flow tests can detect Covid from day 3 to day 8, for RT-PCR it's up to 20 days: ICMR DG||The Centre on Wednesday said lateral flow tests, which includes rapid-antigen and home-antigen tests, can detect Covid from the third day after exposure to the virus today eight while the RT-PCR test can diagnose the infection for up to 20 days.At a press conference, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Director-General Dr Balram Bhargava said on the first day one will test negative whatever tests they undertake."It takes time for the virus to grow in your system and that is known as the latent period. From day three it will be detectable in the Lateral Flow Tests and up to day eight which is the infectious period."That is why, the discharge policy and home isolation policy are focusing on the seven-day period," Bhargava explained.He said that RT-PCR test results will continue to be positive even after day eight because certain RNA particles which are non-infective will continue to be shed and  will continue to cause test results to be positive."The ICMR director-general said that for Omicron, lateral flow tests have become the backbone.Bhargava said that according to government advisory, high-risk contacts of confirmed Covid cases, identified based on age or comorbidities, those undertaking inter-state travel do not need to get tested.Also, asymptomatic individuals in community settings, patients who stand discharged according to home-isolation guidelines and those being discharged from a Covid-19 facility under the revised discharge policy do not need to get tested, he said.However, Bhargava stressed on seven-day home quarantine for all contacts of any positive case according to the guidelines and added that they should continue to wear a mask.Referring to the Advisory on Purposive Testing Strategy for Covid-19 in India issued by ICMR recently, he said symptomatic individuals, even if they test negative on a home test or rapid-antigen test should go for RT-PCR test.According to the advisory, testing can be undertaken either through RT-PCR, TrueNat, CBNAAT, CRISPR, RT-LAMP, Rapid Molecular Testing Systems or through the rapid-antigen test.A positive point-of-care test and molecular test is to be considered confirmatory, without any repeat testing. Symptomatic individuals, testing negative on home/self-test or rapid-antigen test should undertake RT-PCR test, the advisory stated.In community settings, symptomatic individuals, at-risk contacts (elderly and individuals with comorbidity) of laboratory-confirmed cases may be tested.Also, individuals undertaking international travel may be tested.In hospital settings, testing may be undertaken as per the discretion of the doctor with considerations such as no emergency procedure should be delayed for lack of a test and patients should not be referred to other facilities for lack of a testing facility, the advisory stated.All arrangements should be made to collect and transfer samples to testing facilities, mapped to the health facility.There are 3,128 testing laboratories and India's daily RT-PCR testing capacity is over 20 lakh, Bhargava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lateral-flow-tests-can-detect-covid-from-day-3-to-day-8-for-rt-pcr-it-s-up-to-20-days-icmr-dg-101642007598846.html
12-01-2022||India||'Now, we have Indian experience of Omicron': What Centre says on Covid surge||The Centre on Wednesday flagged the Covid-19 positivity rate across the country as phenomenally high and said that there is no reason to take Omicron lightly, just because it is causing, at this moment, fewer hospitalisation, in comparison with Delta. Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said as the World Health Organization has rightly alerted, Omicron should not be taken as a common cold.Here are 10 points about Omicron and India's overall Covid-19 situation1. The present surge in the daily number of Covid-19 cases is led by Omicron, which is proved by the uniform surge across the country. On earlier occasions, the surge used to take place first in the western states. But this time, the surge all across the country has been fast.2. Dr Paul said now India has its own experience of Omicron, which shows that the hospitalisation might be lower, but the transmission is alarmingly high. "If one in the family gets it, the others are also getting it," Dr Paul said.Covid: Maharashtra, Delhi, 6 others emerging as states of concern, says Centre3. Omicron is not the common cold and should not be taken lightly, Dr Paul said. This variant has led to the collapse of the health system of some countries and it is this variant for which health workers at some places had to take leave leading to increased pressure, Dr Paul said.4. Vaccines do protect from severe diseases and hospitalisation and that is a fact, experts of the health ministry asserted.5. Though Omicron is the dominant variant, it can't be said that Delta has become ineffective in India. Many districts still may have Delta cases, the experts said. It is a mixed picture in many districts but will soon change with the rapid advent of Omicron. "Data from metro cities 10 days back showed 80 per cent cases were because of Omicron. But we can't say that Delta is not there. There is a mixed picture... it will also change," Dr Paul said.6. Experts on Wednesday explained why they have not recommended Molnupiravir in the treatment protocol of Covid-19.

12-01-2022||India||Not early harvest package, looking at CEPA upgrade: South Korean minister Yeo||NEW DELHI: South Korea is hoping to conclude negotiations with India within 2022 to upgrade the bilateral Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) finalised more than a decade ago without going in for an early harvest package, South Korean trade minister Yeo Han-koo said on Wednesday.Yeo, who held wide-ranging talks with his Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal in New Delhi on Tuesday, told Hindustan Times in an interview that South Korea and India have great potential to forge stronger partnerships for the post-pandemic era in key areas such as supply chains, emerging technologies, climate change, digital, vaccines and public health cooperation. Edited excerpts:Q. Looking ahead at 2022, what are the priorities for India and South Korea and how are you going to work together on recovering from Covid-19?A: I think 2022 will be a very important year in the sense that we are bracing for this post-pandemic era, and now, the whole world, especially in terms of the global trading environment, we are going through a really big paradigm change. I would say the traditional scope of trade policy is expanding to [cope with] not just this market opening, but also supply chains, emerging technologies, climate change, digital and even vaccines and public health cooperation. In many ways, many countries are preparing for what to do in the near future. In this sense, I think Korea and India have great potential to forge stronger partnerships in this rapidly changing era, for example, in supply chains. Now, this is the buzzword around the world, and we have been so used to global supply chains that were developed decades ago. And now we realise that disruptions or even small and unexpected hiccups along the value chain can really have serious implications for global trading. Korea has its New Southern Policy, which puts Asean and India at the centre of our diplomatic, economic and industrial cooperation. India has its Make in India and [Atmanirbhar Bharat initiatives]. I think there’s a big potential for both countries to forge stronger ties. A lot of investments have been made by Korean companies into India, in critical areas such as automobiles, electric cars, mobile phones and displays. I think that is really the big proof that the supply chains between the two countries are getting interconnected and becoming more important.Q. India has been working jointly with several partners, such as France, Japan and Australia, on supply chains. Are you also looking at working with India and other third countries on supply chains?A: Yes, the thing is Korea and India are supplementary to each other. For example, Korean companies are very strong and world leaders in critical supply chains [for products] such as semiconductors, batteries, electric vehicles and displays. In India, you guys are very strong in bio-pharma, ICT and software...We value India as an important partner for complementing our supply chains. And in this sense, the CEPA could really bolster supply chains, this connectivity and cooperation.Q. Two focus areas of South Korea’s New Southern Policy (NSP) are Asean and India. Despite the disruption caused by Covid-19, has this policy had the kind of impact you were looking for? A: It has worked. Before I was appointed as trade minister, I was a secretary to the [South Korean] president on the New Southern Policy. I was deeply involved in developing the NSP-plus that we rolled out in 2020. Despite Covid-19, trade and investment are really picking up very rapidly, especially in NSP countries like India and Asean. I think in the case of India, our trade volume increased 50% compared to before the NSP. What happened during Covid-19 was the paradigm change in terms of rapid digitalisation. I visited Singapore in December to conclude a digital partnership agreement that was the first of its kind for [South] Korea, and the fourth one for Singapore. I think that is one example of how in this era of digitalisation, Korea and the NSP countries can forge stronger partnerships. India is a leader in ICT and software, and Korea is well-known for digital infrastructure, 5G, 6G, and hi-tech in those areas. I think if we forge more people-to-people contacts and business-to-business contacts in those areas, it could be mutually beneficial. Q. Upgrading the CEPA was one of the focus areas of your discussions with your Indian counterpart. What is the progress in this regard? I believe the Indian side raised the issue of an early harvest package finalised some time ago that needs to be notified.A: Yes, [commerce] minister [Piyush] Goyal and I had a very intensive, very constructive and fruitful discussion. We met for four hours. I think it was worth it for me to travel all the way to India. I think CEPA unleashed great potential [but] despite all this potential, I think CEPA could be sort of the framework to build on and then expand. The CEPA took effect in 2010, which was forever ago, and now the world is completely changed. We still rely on the framework that we negotiated like 15 years ago, and then came into effect about 11 years ago. We need an upgrade to jumpstart our bilateral cooperation. We launched these upgrade negotiations in 2016, but I think the progress has been sort of on and off. I think what we agreed on between the two ministers is that we really need to renew this momentum and then bring a new spirit into this process so that in 2022, we could really conclude a more upgraded and better CEPA. Q. Are you looking at concluding the process within this year? A: Yeah, absolutely within this year. Q. And the early harvest package? A: I think there was some misunderstanding on both sides. I think we cleared that misunderstanding [on Tuesday]. I think what I understand is that India took it as, okay, we agreed on the early harvest package, and [it came] into effect right away, and then the rest of the negotiations will continue. But at that time, what Korea thought we got into was that, okay, this is an early harvest package that we agreed on and this is sort of a first stage, but [it has] not [taken] effect. I mean, we create this momentum in stage one, and building on it, we continue to accelerate. And when we conclude, we take into effect all of this. In our system, the ratification process in the National Assembly is quite stringent and very, very intensive. We’ve never done [things] just partially, you know, partially concluded an early harvest [package], and then ratify it in the National Assembly, and then continue on with the rest of it. We never did it, our system doesn’t allow that. Q. So what you’re looking at is the full upgrade of CEPA? A: Yeah, exactly. Q. One of the things South Korean officials and companies mention, especially in the context of South Korean firms leaving China and wanting to come to India, is that it’s not easy for them to access the Indian market. Has this changed or are there things that can be done to ease their entry? A: I think there has been improvement in the meantime, but obviously, I think there could be room for improvement to really position India as a sort of a new centre of the supply chain competition in this changing world. A lot of really key, strategic Korean companies are flooding into India, but I think [with] an easier regulatory framework and more attention to induce good Korean companies, there could be many more Korean companies willing to come and invest and work with India. I think these are some of issues that Korean businesses are raising, for example, the BIS certification process, some customs issues, [such as] when the HS code was changed into a new system. I think there are some sort of hiccups [but] it’s not something that we don’t have common ground on. I mean we are in the process of trying to understand each other and trying to find an amicable solution. Q. I believe the Indian side also raised the issue of access for certain commodities such as steel, meat, agricultural products and organic products. Is this something that you’re looking at now? A: Yeah, I think this is mutual. You had a question about the Korean complaints and these [are] Indian complaints. I think in any healthy relationship, especially this trade relationship worth $20 billion, it’s natural that we have some sort of irritants, small or big on both sides. I think what matters is not those irritants, but how to bring this to attention and how to resolve them in a transparent, mutually trusted manner. I think that’s what CEPA is all about. We had a very intensive discussion on what Indian companies have issues with and also what Korean companies have issues with. I’m more confident that both authorities can keep the communication channels open and find a reasonable, win-win solution for those issues. During my interactions with the business communities of both countries – I met with the CII and also Korean businesses here – what I could observe is that maybe we need to understand each other better. Maybe there aren’t enough people-to-people or business-to-business contacts to really understand each other’s systems, how things work, and things like that. I think that could be one of the problems [behind these] issues. I feel we need to encourage more exchanges at the top level or medium level in business, as well as in the government. I think that could be our starting point for really strengthening our cooperation. Q. India’s Make in India Atmanirbhar Bharat [self-reliant India] initiatives have been described by some countries as protectionist. How does South Korea perceive these initiatives? A: I don’t know all the details about this specific policy element, but I think basically, around the world, one of the paradigm changes is the renaissance of industrial policy. Normally, East Asian countries were known for a very meticulous, articulate industrial policy, but now, in the US and in Europe, they are eager to compete with industrial policy. I think each country needs to judge what would be the ideal industrial policy that it wants to introduce. But I think what matters is that we need to use industrial policy in a way that complies with international trade norms and WTO rules, and not in a way to really close down, and then really just to be monopolies, but in a way to encourage investment flows in both ways, and keep things open. Q. The shortage of semiconductors is causing problems everywhere. Is that something that came up in the meeting with the Indian side? A: We didn’t discuss the semiconductor issue. But [South] Korea is a key player in semiconductors and I’m not surprised to go anywhere and get this question about semiconductors. I think basically this is [for] the private sector, they need to make a business decision based on business principles, but it’s also true that governments around the world are really concerned about this shortage of semiconductors. In this sense, I think government-to-government dialogue and exchanges could help. So we are open-minded. 
12-01-2022||India||HT This Day: Jan 13, 1966 - SHASTRI CREMATED NEAR SHANTI VANA||New Delhi- Thousands sobbed, many stood with heads bowed, others raised folded hands in respectful tribute as the body of the late Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, was consigned to fire on the banks of the Jumna here today. As the flames leapt from the sandalwood pile, enveloping the mortal remains of the late Prime Minister, there were anguished cries of "Lal Bahadur amar rahe." At 12-32 Mr Shastri's eldest son, Mr Hari Kishan, lit the funeral pyre as the small arms fired three volleys in salute. Officers and men of the three Services, headed by the Chiefs of Staff, stood to attention and the army buglers sounded the Last Post. Priests chanted hymns from ancient scriptures. Under a nearby shamiana world leaders looked sadly on as the last rites were performed. President Radhakrishnan led the mourners. Earlier, it had taken three hours to bring the gun-carriage carrying the late Prime Minister's body from his official residence to the cremation ground. It was a sad, solemn journey-his last. Over a million had thronged the ground around the cremation site near Shanti Vana, while another million had lined the six-mile route of the funeral procession from No. 10 Jan Path. Touching moment About noon, the gun-carriage halted a few yards from the cremation platform. The bier was gently taken off by senior army officers and carried reverentially to the sandalwood pyre. The bearer party saluted and withdrew. It was a touching moment. Close relatives broke down and some of them had to be taken away by consoling friends. According to the ancient Hindu custom, Mrs Lalita Shastri was not present at the time of cremation, but Mr Shastri's daughters and daughter-in-law were there. The religious rites were conducted by the family head priest, Shri Raja Ram from Allahabad, assisted by Goswami  Girdharilal of the Lakshmi Narain Temple, Delhi. Mr Hari Kishan, with folded hands and bowed head, went round the pyre thrice. Prime Minister Nanda was among those who saluted the departed leader for the last time. At 10 Janpath, 40 officers drawn from the three Services had kept vigil over the body of Mr Shastri as it lay in state all night with heaps of wreaths and flowers on it. Shortly before 9-15 a.m. the gun-carriage was drawn up near the portico. The family priest performed religious rites. The pallbearers, drawn from the three wings of the Armed Forces, lifted the body draped in the national flag and placed it on the gun-carriage. An armed detachment presented and reversed arms and drummers beat muffled drums. Within minutes the procession started. It was headed by a military column, led by Maj.-Gen. D. G. R. Rajwade, General Officer Commanding, Delhi and Rajasthan Area. Immediately behind the gun-carriage were the chief vallbearers, the three Services Chiefs, foreign dignitaries and VIPs, two army platoons, an IAF band, two naval and IAF platoons followed by the motorcade. The eight-mile route was lined by the troops at the "order arms." When the funeral procession came into View, they stood to attention and presented arms as the carriage passed by them. Then they rested on reversed arms till the rear escort had passed. Huge crowds had collected all along the route since early morning, braving the cold weather for the "darshan" of the late Prime Minister. The local police had a tough time in controlling the crowd as it surged forward at many points. Near India Gate, in the Connaught Circus area and from Rajghat onward the procession virtually pierced through a solid mass of humanity. People showered garlands and flowers at Mr Shastrit body. A continuous shower of flowers was also maintained by a helicopter which hovered over the cortege most of the time. The roofs of buildings along the route, tree-tops and the Tilak Bridge were all packed by crowds anxious to pay their last tribute to the departed leader.Mr Shastri's funeral was attended by dignitaries from many lands. Soviet Premier Kosygin led his country's delegation, which included Mrs Y. S. Nasiruddinova, Chairman of the Uzbek Supreme Soviet, and Deputy Foreign Minister Firyubin. The U.S. sent a strong 7-man delegation, led by Vice-President Hubert Humphrey and consisting of Secretary of State Dean Rusk, two former ambassadors to India, Mr John Sherman Cooper and Mr John Kenneth Galbraith, the Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. Mr James Greenfield, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near-East and South Asia. Mr William Handley, and the Special Assistant to the Secretary of State for Food for Peace, Mr Richard Reuter. Afghanistan was represented by its Prime Minister, Mr Maiwandwal; UAR by its Vice-President, Mr Hussain el Shafi, and two other delegates; Yugoslavia by its Vice-President, Mr Jakov Blazevic and Secretary of the Foreign Ministry; Iran by Foreign Minister Aram and Canada by its Labour Minister. Queen Elizabeth was represented by Lord Mountbatten, while First Secretary of State George Brown represented the British Government. Other members of the party included Sir Paul Gore-Booth, Permanent Under-Secretary for Commonwealth Relations and a former British High Commissioner in India, and Lady Pamela Hicks, daughter of Lord Mountbatten. The British Opposition party leader Mr Edward Heath, accompanied by a team of 14 British officials, also attended the funeral. Pakistan Commerce Minister Ghulam Faruque and High Commissioner to India Arshad Hussain, who flew to New Delhi in the Soviet plane which carried Mr Shastri's body, represented their country. The Commonwealth Secretariat was represented by Mr N. C. Sen Gupta, head of the economic division of the Commonwealth Secretariat. France sent a four-man delegation, headed by Mr Louis Joxe, President de Gaulle's special envoy and Vice-Chairman of the French Council of Ministers. Other dignitaries included West German Co-operation Minister Walter Scheel; the personal representative of the King of Morocco, Mr Balafrej; Singapore Education Minister Ong Pang Boon; Thai Foreign Minister Khoman; leader of the Japanese ruling party Fu Nada and four others; Mr Rajasombash from Laos; Philippines President Marcos's brother-in-law; and Burmese Foreign Minister Thai Han and three officials. Hours after the funeral, hundreds of people---men, women and children-were still visiting the spot on the Jumna banks where the cremation took place. Among them were many foreigners. They went round the samadhi and offered flowers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-jan-13-1966-shastri-cremated-near-shanti-vana-101642003430645.html

Congress should apologize to country: UP CM Yogi Adityanath pic.twitter.com/T6PwSM0tKUModi, who landed in Bathinda in Punjab on January 5 and had to take the road route to Hussainiwala in Ferozepur because of inclement weather on Wednesday, was stuck on a flyover for 15-20 minutes due to a blockade by some farmers, an incident the Union home ministry described as a “major lapse” in his security.Chief ministers of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states have been ramping up their attacks on the Congress-led Punjab government over the recent security breach incident, alleging that the state authorities intentionally put Prime Minister Narendra Modi's safety at risk.In a similar vein, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma also claimed that Prime Minister Modi's security breach incident was part of a “conspiracy”, the evidence of which was recorded in a sting operation that captured the conversation between two senior Punjab Police officials.Sarma, the chief minister of Assam, said that Punjab CID Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Sukhdev Singh's voice was recorded in a sting operation in which he was telling a Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) about the conspiracy as early as January 2.“When the incident took place on January 5, the CID provided all details over it to the higher officials,” said the Assam chief minister.Elaborating on the ‘sting operation’, Sarma added, “In the sting operation, he (Punjab CID DSP Sukhdev Singh) is also saying that the entire protest was organised by Khalistani supporters, they were not farmers.”Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, too, cited facts that have emerged from the sting operation conducted by a private news channel and said, “On their basis, it can be said that the breach in the Prime Minister's security in Punjab was not spontaneous but a big, premeditated conspiracy to harm him.”The sting operation raises serious questions about the manner in which the Prime Minister's security was handled by the Congress government in Punjab, Dhami said at a press conference in Dehradun. “The Congress must answer to the country on what happened in Punjab during the Prime Minister's visit,” he said.Notably, the Supreme Court has set up a five-member committee headed by retired SC judge Justice Indu Malhotra to probe the security lapse matter. The other members of the committee are the Director-General of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) or his nominee not below the rank of IG, DGP Union territory of Chandigarh, ADGP of Punjab (Security), and Registrar General of Punjab and Haryana High Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/preplanned-conspiracy-yogi-adityanath-on-pm-modi-s-security-breach-in-punjab-101641992723974.html
12-01-2022||India||Covid case positivity rate phenomenally high; Omicron not common cold: Centre||As India's Covid positivity rate on Wednesday stands at 11.05%, the Centre said the rise in the positivity rate in the last 12 days have been sharp and concerning. On December 30, the case positivity rate was 1.1 per cent. "It shows how fast the infection is spreading. Generally, the spread is seen moving from the west to the east of the country. But given that pattern, it would have taken longer for the surge. This did not happen, which shows that Omicron is rapidly replacing Delta," Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said during the weekly press conference of the health ministry.Echoing the recent concerns expressed by the World Health Organization that people are considering Omicron as mild and which is not right, Dr Paul said, "Omicron is not a common cold. It is not so simple and neither should it be taken so lightly. And even if Omicron appears less severe, it is because of the extensive vaccination coverage that we have achieved. The same Omicron has challenged the health infrastructure of many countries."“It is not possible to genome-sequence all Covid samples,” Dr Paul said, adding that still, it is clear that Omicron is fast replacing Delta in the country. "Data from metro cities at least 10 days back showed 80% cases were because of Omicron. But we can't say that Delta is not there. There is a mixed picture of Delta and Omicron which will also change," Dr Paul said.Giving an overall picture of the country's present Covid-19 situation, the ministry said a total of 300 districts in India are reporting a weekly Covid case positivity rate of more than 5%. Maharashtra West Bengal, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Gujarat are states of concern, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-case-positivity-rate-phenomenally-high-omicron-not-common-cold-centre-101641989666466.html

The weekly cases in the state are at 257,000. In West Bengal, the positivity rate has gone up from 1.52% on December 22 to 32.18% today and cases are increasing rapidly. Similar trends are seen in Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Gujarat,” Agarwal said.Across India, Maharashtra has the highest number of active cases, followed by West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Karnataka, the health ministry's joint secretary also added.None of these eight states is going for a full lockdown and has imposed night curfew, weekend curfew and several restrictions to ward off the spread of Covid-19, fueled by the fast-spreading Omicron variant.Of the 4,868 cases of Omicron reported in India till now, Maharashtra has the highest at 1,281. Delhi, on the other hand, is the third-worst hit state in the country with 546 cases, followed by Karnataka at 479, Kerala at 350, West Bengal at 294, Uttar Pradesh at 275, Gujarat at 236 and Tamil Nadu 185.Among these, Tamil Nadu is the only state where all Omicron patients have recovered.During Wednesday's briefing, Lav Agarwal also said that there has been a high surge in Covid-19 infections in the country with an average of 150,000 people getting infected on a daily basis.Nearly 200,000 cases were reported in a fresh spike on Wednesday, which pushed the caseload to 36,070,510.

The inquiry is in its final stages, and the report may be submitted in a day or two. Appropriate action will be taken. The law of the land is paramount, we will do whatever is necessary to uphold it,” General Naravane, the senior most military officer in the country post the untimely demise of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat whom he also succeeded as army chief, said.Further corrections in the standard operating procedure (SOP) will be made upon the completion of the probe, he further said, as he addressed the annual army chief's press conference.On December 4, 2021, commandos of an elite unit shot dead six coal miners, in what the force and the Union government later described as a case of ‘mistaken identity.’ Immediately following the killings, the troops were confronted by furious villagers; in the subsequent melee, seven more villagers and a commando, too, lost their lives.A day later, as protests broke out, another civilian was killed as protesters stormed a local Assam Rifles camp, prompting soldiers to open fire.The killings triggered massive outrage, as well as calls to repeal the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (Afspa) from across the northeast. The legislation grants troops operating in regions designated as ‘disturbed areas’ powers to search, arrest and even shoot people, if necessary' for maintenance of public order.In such cases, under Afspa, soldiers can only be prosecuted on sanction from the central government.At least two chief ministers in the northeast, Nagaland's Neiphiuo Rio, and his Meghalaya counterpart Conrad Sangma, have publicly called for the act to be repealed.The Centre, on December 26, set up a high-level home ministry panel to review to look into the possibility of the withdrawal of Afspa. However, on December 30, it extended the act for a further six months in Nagaland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-expresses-regret-on-nagaland-killings-says-report-to-be-submitted-in-day-or-two-101641978772271.html

This is a 100 per cent administrative failure. The Prime Minister of this country survived a horrific attack,” Bedi said.The former officer of the Indian Police Service (IPS) also highlighted that Punjab is near the Pakistan border. “There could have been a bomb under the bridge. I think this country narrowly escaped the murder of its number one executive,” Bedi told news agency ANI.Also Read| SC appoints panel headed by ex-judge to probe PM Modi's security lapseHitting out at the Congress-led Punjab government, she said that chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa are accountable for the incident, and demanded the dismissal of the state's chief secretary and the DGP.“It is criminal negligence. They (chief secretary, DGP) have to be dismissed out of the service... no pension, nothing. A criminal case should be registered against them,” she added.On January 5, PM Modi was on his way to Ferozpur in poll-bound Punjab to lay the foundation stone of several developmental projects when his convoy was stuck on a flyover for 15-20 minutes as a group of farmers blocked the route, which was around 30 km away from the National Martyrs Memorial in Hussainiwala.The Punjab government has already formed a high-level committee to investigate the lapses in Modi's security.

12-01-2022||India||When will Covid surge in India decline? IISc-ISI model projects 3 scenarios||The latest projection by researchers at the Indian Institute of Science and the Indian Statistical Institute claims the present surge of India will begin to decline from February, though it will vary from state to state, and the present curve will be flattened by March-April. The peak might see over 8 lakh daily cases in India, the latest projection said. The latest projections take into account the rising Covid graph of India till January 10 and Omicron transmissibility rates in South Africa. For this projection, the scientists have provided three scenarios: 100% susceptible population, 60% susceptible population and 30% susceptible population. In all three scenarios, the curve will be flattened by April. In case of 30% and 60% susceptibility, the surge will decline in February, in case of 100% susceptibility, it will take some more time, the graph shows.Worried you may have Omicron? Here are the symptoms you should watch out for Here are the main takeaways from the latest projections1. India's estimated hospital requirement can go beyond 4 lakh per day in the worst-case scenario i.e. if 100% population is susceptible to the virus now.2. Considering 60% population susceptible, the hospital requirement can go a little above 3 lakh per day.Is the third wave finally starting to ebb in Mumbai and Delhi?ISI-IISC-Team provides new projections. More optimistic scenario than @IHME_UW, They also have a model from INDSCI SIM for states of India (@MenonBioPhysics et al)https://t.co/62MCbQkuER pic.twitter.com/anC4xDC00O3. The requirement of ICU beds can go beyond 20,000 in the worst-case scenario. Otherwise, it will remain between 10,000 to 15,000. 4. The wave will begin to decline in February and by March 1, the curve will start to flatten. In April 2022, the third wave will end in India. However, the exact timing will be different for different states5. Giving statewise predictions, the model shows that Delhi at present is reporting over 20,000 cases. If Delhi has a 60% susceptible population, then daily cases will rise over 40,000. In case of 100% susceptibility, daily cases may rise above 60,000.6. Puducherry, Lakshadweep, Punjab will see a delayed surge, the projection show, which means when cases in other states begin to decline, these states and UTs may see the surge.7. Maharashtra in the worst-case scenario will report over 1.75 lakh cases per day. In a60% susceptible situation, the state will report over 1 lakh cases per day at the peak.8. Karnataka in the worst-case scenario will report over 1.20 lakh daily cases, but in that case, the peak will come in February first week. In a 60% susceptible situation, Karnataka's peak will see a little over 80,000 cases daily.9. West Bengal may see between 30,000 and 40,000 daily cases considering 60% susceptible scenario. In the worst scenario, West Bengal will see over 50,000 daily cases.10. Kerala's daily cases could reach way above 1 lakh in a 100% susceptible situation. In the 60% susceptible situation, the daily cases could reach between 60,000 and 80,000.India on Wednesday reported 1.94 lakhCovid cases, taking the daily positivity rate to 11.05%. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said the hospital admission rate has not risen in the past four-five days which is good news amid the third wave. "Fewer people are getting admitted to hospitals. It seems that the cases are going down. If they go down, then the restrictions will be reduced," the minister said.Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said the numbers of Covid-19 cases and its fast-spreading variant Omircon were slowing coming down in the city and urged people to get vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-will-covid-surge-in-india-decline-iisc-isi-model-projects-3-scenarios-101641979068364.html
12-01-2022||India||How is India's military situation along the borders? What Army chief said||Indian Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Wednesday addressed the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Annual Press Conference 2022, where he provided brief updates about the country's military developments and its present status along the various border points. Talking in light of the recent clashes in multiple conflict-ridden areas, Naravane said that there are positive developments on India's northern and western borders although a rise in terrorist concentrations has been noted in a few regions, the armed forces remain alert as ever.Here's what COAS General MM Naravane said today in his brief to the media as part of the annual press conference:On the northern border: The Indian Army chief said that since January last year, there have been positive developments along India's northern and western borders. “On the northern borders, we have continued to maintain the highest level of operational preparedness while at the same time engaging with the PLA [People's Liberation Army; Chinese armed forces] through dialogue,” he said.On the western front: Highlighting his point that there has been some positive development on this front since last year, Naravane added that a rise in infiltration attempts by terrorists has also been noted. “On the western front, there is an increase in the concentration of terrorists at various launch pads and there have been repeated attempts of infiltration across the Line of Control (LoC),” he said. “This once exposes the nefarious designs of our western neighbour.”On Nagaland civilian killings: COAS General MM Naravane said that “the regrettable incident” that occurred in Nagaland's Oting on December 4, 2021, is being thoroughly investigated. “We remain committed to the security of our countrymen, even during the conduct of operations,” he said, adding that further corrections will be done in the standard operating procedures (SOPs) post-completion of inquiry into the Nagaland civilian killing incident.On situation along Indo-Myanmar border: Assuring that the situation in the northeastern part of India is under control, General Naravane said that with several Army battalions already deducted, the plan is to increase Assam Rifles battalions along the Indo-Myanmar border.On China's new border law: “Any law, which is not binding on other countries, is not legally tenable, and is not in keeping with the agreements that we have had in the past, obviously cannot be binding on us.”-Finally, acknowledging the role that media organisations are playing in 21st-century India, Naravane said that both the military and the media have a significant role to play along with the other pillars of the state in building a strong nation.“I look forward to a very strong and continuous partnership between the two of us – the media and the military – in the future,” the Army chief said, adding that with better intel and military capabilities, the Indian Army and all wings of the armed forces are now much better prepared to meet any challenge that is thrown at their direction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-is-india-s-military-situation-along-the-borders-what-army-chief-said-101641977441006.html

The security breach sparked a war of words between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress government in Punjab. Both the Union and Punjab governments later set up their inquiry panels to probe the incident.Reports claimed that Punjab police personnel briefed their seniors and the state administration about the presence of protesters along the route that Modi’s cavalcade was to take during his visit.Irani cited the reports and said that it was “disconcerting” that Punjab Police officials in it have highlighted how they continuously engaged with the Congress government and administration in Punjab to bring to light the threat to the security of the Prime Minister and his entourage.“The question is, who in the Punjab Congress-led government continued to deliberately ignore these threats to the Prime Minister’s security?” she asked at a press conference.She slammed Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi for briefing Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra about the breach. “Priyanka Gandhi said she was briefed by the Punjab chief minister about the prime minister’s security breach. The question is, what security clearance does a citizen have that the chief minister is keeping her apprised about the prime minister‘s security. The details should be given only to the security agencies... why is it being given to a private citizen?”There was no immediate response from the Congress party or the Punjab government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-in-punjab-govt-ignored-threats-to-pm-security-asks-smriti-irani-101641977500438.html

12-01-2022||India||India's Omicron tally inches closer to 5,000, Maharashtra and Rajasthan top chart||India's Omicron tally reached closer to 5,000-mark on Wednesday after the morning update by the Union ministry of health and family welfare showed that the country has so far logged as many as 4,868 cases of the new Covid-19 variant.All states and Union territories (UTs) of the country have confirmed cases of the Omicron variant. Maharashtra and Rajasthan lead the chart with 1,281 and 645 infections, respectively. Delhi, which was for a longer period of time in the second slot of the countrywide tally, has retained its third position with 546 cases of the new ‘variant of concern’. On January 10, Rajasthan overthrew the national capital as the second most-hit state in India by Omicron.Other states and UTs in the top 10 worst-affected regions include Karnataka (479), Kerala (350), West Bengal (294), Uttar Pradesh (275), Gujarat (236), Tamil Nadu (185), and Haryana (162).Of the total 4,868 Omicron cases that the country has detected so far, as many as 1,805 have recovered. This means, there are 3,063 active infections of the Covid-19 variant in India, according to the Union health ministry update.This comes on a day India witnessed a spike in single-day Covid-19 cases yet again with a total of 194,720 fresh infections. The death toll of the country also rose to 484,655 after new fatalities witnessed a jump to 442 from Tuesday's 277.The latest surge in India, which is considered as a third coronavirus wave, is primarily due to the Omicron outbreak. It has triggered a majority of states and UTs to impose strict restrictions, including night curfew, shutting of schools and colleges, closure or curbs on restaurants and bars, among others.On Tuesday, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to all states and UTs, directing them to ensure that optimal availability of medical oxygen is ensured at all health facilities amid the increasing coronavirus cases. He stated that all health facilities across the country must ensure that they have a buffer stock of medical oxygen adequate for "at least 48 hours."

12-01-2022||India||US F-18 fighter op-demo in Goa for INS Vikrant in April-May||US defence major Boeing is planning an operational demonstration of F-18 Super Hornet carrier-based fighter at the shore-based test facility (SBTF) at INS Hansa in Goa in April-May this year as a possible contender for Indian Navy’s sole aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya and soon to be commissioned INS Vikrant. Both the Indian aircraft carriers use ski-jump to launch the fighters with arrested recovery through the net.According to officials in knowledge of the matter in Washington and in New Delhi, the US Navy conducted ski-jump trials of F-18 fighter at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland in US or Pax river in December 2020 but the Indian Navy team could not attend the demonstration due to travel restrictions on account of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the US Navy shared extensive data of the ski jump trials with the Indian Navy. A year later in December 2021, both the US Navy and the aircraft manufacturer did a site inspection of SBTF at INS Hansa in the presence of Indian Navy officials.While presently the operational demonstration of Rafale-Marine is on at the INS Hansa as the other option for Indian aircraft carriers, both the twin engine aircraft are virtually of the same later 1990s vintage and of the same 4.5 generation.Even as the Indian Navy will be evaluating both the aircraft, the F-18 is a two seater fighter, which is more suitable to carrier based operations for better orientation at sea. Rafale-M is a single seater fighter, while it has a two seater trainer but that can only be operated from the shore.The other important factor that weighs in favour of the F-18 is that it can fit the INS Vikramaditya or INS Vikrant lift with folded wings without compromising on its operational readiness.In case of Rafale-M the fighter will only fit to carrier lift after the wing tips of the aircraft are removed as the wings cannot be folded and the span is more than that of a folded F-18 fighter.Aviation experts says that an adapter platform will have to be fitted for F-18 Super Hornet as it allows faster movement of jets from lower deck to deck under combat and high seas condition.Although both France and US are close allies of India, the Modi government will also take into account the license, maintenance and spare parts issues as it cannot afford to be caught on the wrong foot in a rapidly changing security environment.Under no circumstances, the Modi government will allow India's strategic autonomy and operational readiness to be compromised.

Symptoms generally start with body ache, generalised weakness, fatigue, headache and fever in the initial days.(2.) Eventually, people will develop a cough, which is likely to be dry. They are also likely to develop cold, leading to water from the nose, sneezing etc.(3.) In at least 80 per cent cases, fever goes away in the first three days itself. However, if it persists, then that is a sign of moderate to severe infection which requires close monitoring.How to mitigate its effect: According to Dr Solanki, isolating at the right time and preventing the infection's spread is the key. Taking RTPCR test will assure no symptom of the Omicron variant is missed.Also Read | Omicron: Britain reports drop in daily Covid cases amid record surge in US“Since Omicron is more infectious than the other mutant, it is important o be very cautious.

12-01-2022||India||Swami Vivekananda: Know about one of India's greatest philosophers||India is celebrating National Youth Day today, to honour the life and teachings of one of the greatest philosophers, Swami Vivekananda. The day celebrates Vivekananda’s “inspirational” ideas and how the youth will benefit from them.Chief disciple of the 19th-century mystic Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Vivekananda introduced the world to the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga.On January 12, 1863, Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta in an aristocratic family of North Calcutta. He is seen as a major force behind the revival of Hinduism in India and is credited with creating interfaith awareness as well.In 1881, he first met Ramakrishna Paramhansa, following which he journeyed down the path of spirituality. Vivekananda, who founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission, is also credited with instilling a sense of nationalism in people in a colonial India.Both these became important centres for the teaching of the philosophy and principles associated with Vedanta.Vivekananda wrote four classics - Jnana-Yoga, Bhakti-Yoga, Karma-Yoga, and Raja-Yoga - which are his treatises on Hindu philosophy and the teachings of Vedanta. In addition, his ideas and philosophy come through in the many lectures he delivered, the letters he wrote to friends and disciples, poems and songs composed by him.Vivekananda is best known for his famous 1893 speech where he introduced Hinduism to the Western world in Chicago.He had also warned against the dangers of sectarianism and bigotry. Here’s an excerpt from the same:Sectarianism, bigotry and its horrible descendant, fanaticism, have long possessed this beautiful earth. They have filled the earth with violence, drenched it often and often with human blood, destroyed civilisation and sent whole nations to despair. Had it not been for these horrible demons, human society would be far more advanced than it is now.Swami Vivekananda died on July 4, 1902. He was meditating at Belur math when a ruptured blood vessel in his brain led to his death. His followers believe that the rupture was due to brahmarandhra (an opening in the crown of his head) being pierced when he attained mahasamādhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swami-vivekananda-know-about-one-of-india-s-greatest-philosophers-101641947454076.html

The matter will be heard by a three-judge bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli.The petition has been filed by journalist Qurban Ali and former Patna High Court judge Anjana Prakash seeking direction for an "independent, credible and impartial investigation" by a Special Investigation Team (SIT). On Monday, the apex court agreed to hear the plea after the matter was mentioned before CJI Ramana by senior advocate Kapil Sibal."I have moved this PIL in respect of what happened in Dharam Sansad in Haridwar on December 17 and 19 (last year). We are living in difficult times where slogan in country has changed from 'Satyamev Jayate' to 'Shastramev Jayate'," Sibal said.The senior advocate told CJI that FIR has been registered but no arrests have been made so far.“No action will be taken without the court’s intervention,” he said.The petition specifically mentions the hate speeches delivered between December 17-19 at Haridwar and Delhi organised by Yati Narsinghanand 'Hindu Yuva Vahini' respectively. In the video shared widely on social media, the speakers at the “Dharma Sansad” were heard calling for the genocide of members of a community.The Uttarakhand Police initially filed the FIR under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code against Sant Dharamdas Maharaj, Sadhvi Annapoorna alias Pooja Shakun Pandey, Wasim Rizvi aka Jitendra Tyagi, and some others associated with the Dharma Sansad. The police later added the names of Yati Narsinghanand and Sagar Sindhu Maharaj.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-plea-seeking-probe-into-haridwar-hate-speech-case-today-101641946762158.html

On Sunday, 8-10 people were stumped after they received SMS intimation of being negative, but found their real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) test report to be positive. The special Covid-19 sample collection camp was held at Patna’s Budh Marg locality on January 6 and results were declared on January 9. Rama Shankar Lall, 58, Devanand Rai, 45, and Shiv Shankar Prasad, 30, were among the 10 people who tested positive for Covid-19, but received SMS of being negative. “On Sunday, I received an SMS stating that my Covid-19 test was negative. However, when I checked the RT PCR report on the link provided to me, it was positive. I then went for a rapid antigen detection (RAD) test on Monday and it was negative. It’s all too confusing,” said Lall. Rai and Prasad, however, tested positive even on the RAD kit on Monday and were advised home isolation. Most of the samples were tested at the Rajendra Memorial Institute of Medical Sciences Institute, a bio-safety level 2-plus laboratory and research institute of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) at Patna’s Agamkuan. There were similar complaints last year too during the second wave of the pandemic. Such was the load on government laboratories then that in a few cases, the RT-PCR test report and SMS notification arrived after the death of a patient. “We found there was one centre in Patna where the data entry operator was making incorrect entry on our Covid-19 health portal, the data of which is automatically integrated on the ICMR website. This led to people getting contradictory results through SMS and their actual test report. We have done the correction and issued last warning to the data entry operator concerned,” said Sanjay Kumar Singh, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar. Meanwhile, Bihar reported five Covid-19 deaths and added 5,908 new cases, taking the count of active cases to 25,051. Five Covid-19 patients, all males with pre-existing diseases, died during the last 24 hours on Tuesday. The deaths were reported from the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), Sai hospital and one from Bhagalpur, said Singh. Younger people getting infected People in the younger age group were getting infected by the virus more this time as compared to the second wave, said Pratyaya Amrit, Bihar’s additional chief secretary, health, on Tuesday. Giving a breakup of the age-wise distribution of the people infected by SARS CoV-2 between January 1 and 10, he said 28% were in the 20-29 years age bracket, 23.9% in 30-39 years age group, 15.2% between 40 and 49 years of age, 12.5% in 50-59 years age group, 10% in 10-19 years of age, 8.6% above 60 years of age and 1.9% in 0-9 years of age. With Covid-19 cases increasing rapidly in Bihar, up from 352 on January 1 to 5,908 on January 10, the state’s test positivity rate also moved up from 0.37% to 3.14% during the corresponding period, he said. Patna, which had the state’s highest test positivity rate of 20.65%, added 2,202 new Covid-19 cases on Monday followed by Muzaffarpur (264 cases), Samastipur (249), Darbhanga (232), Bhagalpur (210), Jamui (180) and Gaya (160).

The senior Baghel also said he should be permitted “euthanasia” on January 25 if his demand isn’t accepted.“All the constitutional rights of the citizens of the country are being violated on a large scale. The three pillars of democracy- Legislature, Judiciary and Executive, are being destroyed. The media is also working at the behest of the three pillars of democracy. No one is paying heed to the citizens of the country. There is a sense of fear among citizens,” Nand Kumar Baghel’s letter on Monday said.The Nand Kumar heads a local outfit that seeks to create awareness about voting.“The right to vote is the supreme right of democracy which is being executed through EVMs. No nationally or internally recognized institutions or governments have certified the EVMs as a cent per cent accurate…There is no guarantee whether my vote is cast in favour of whom I pressed the button through the EVM machine,” he said. Many developed countries in the world have adopted ballot paper and box system of elections, he claimed. “In such circumstances, when all my rights are being violated, then the very purpose of my life is getting lost and being a citizen of India, my conscience is not allowing me to live any longer. Honourable President Ji, you have taken an oath to protect the Constitution, but my constitutional rights are not being protected, due to which I have no option but to die,” he said. He urged the President to issue an order to conduct elections using ballot papers in place of EVMs in the larger interest of healthy democracy and said, “if voting with ballot paper is not possible, then he (President) should allow me euthanasia on National Voters’ Day on January 25 this year”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-use-evms-else-chhattisgarh-cm-s-father-s-bizarre-appeal-to-prez-101641933277988.html

12-01-2022||India||In Karnataka, all healthcare roads lead to private hospitals||Bengaluru: Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday visited Manipal Hospital, one of Bengaluru’s biggest private medical establishments, for a checkup after testing positive for Covid-19 a day before.Bommai is not the first Karnataka chief minister to get treatment at a private centre. Former chief ministers BS Yediyurappa, Siddaramaiah and HD Kumaraswamy also received treatment at a private healthcare centre earlier when they had tested positive for Covid-19 or for other treatments.“He had just gone there for a check-up after he tested (Covid) positive on Monday,” said an official from the chief minister’s office (CMO), requesting anonymity.At a time when the state is witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases, activists and experts pointed out that the head of government’s visit to a private hospital does not help in gaining people’s trust in the public health care facilities. To be sure, Karnataka’s gross allocation (total demand +IEBR ( Internal & Extra Budgetary Resources) ) for health and family welfare is 4% of the total budget or ₹11,908 crore, according to the 2021-22 budget presented by former chief minister BS Yediyurappa in March last year.“This points to the fact that private hospitals are ubiquitous in cities while government hospitals are difficult to find,” said Adithya Pradyumna, faculty at the Azim Premji University (AZU), who also works in the areas of environment and health, public health and health impact assessment.He added that there is some sense of confidence that private hospitals will do a “better job” than government facilities.Experts also pointed at the declining real expenditure on public health.A 2021 study by AZU, ‘Urban Healthcare at Crossroads: Assessing Healthcare Vulnerabilities for Urban Poor in India’, highlighted those complexities in defining urban boundaries in the urbanisation process and the multiplicity of health care providers both within and outside the government are challenges to urban health governance. It added that overlapping administrative jurisdictions and lack of coordination result in chaos in urban health.“Our evidence from Bengaluru shows that 30% of even the poorest quintile seeks delivery care from private sources. Since there is a 10-fold difference in cost between public and private facilities, this significantly adds to their financial burden,” the report added.Treatment for covid-19 is free in public hospitals while private medical establishments were capped prices for treatment in covid-19 hospitals at ₹5200- ₹11500 depending on the type of ward and if on ventilator. Private hospitals also protested that 50% of their total capacities were asked to be set aside for free treatment for government-allocated patients while it had very little room to treat their walk-in patients as well as those with other ailments.This has been done away with as the number of cases came down in the later half of 2021.Prasanna Saligram, a public health and community health researcher with Jana Swasthya Abhiyan Karnataka, pointed to a deep “class system” within the society, saying inequality is a big determinant of health.“Evidence globally shows that if you invest in public health systems, then you have better health outcomes,” Saligram said, adding, “Glorification of the private sector in Karnataka is phenomenal.”He added, “Because of inequalities, the ruling, upper and elite class get what they want and naturally the have-nots or poorer sections have to make do with the poorer services.”There were allegations that people in public hospitals or those patients allocated by the government to private hospitals were made to find life-saving drugs like Remdesivir on their own while keeping their stocks for higher paying walk-in patients. Even when most public hospitals ran out of vaccines, large private hospitals with direct agreements with vaccine makers, had steady supply of doses which was paid for.Private or paid inoculation accounted for more than half of all inoculations in Bengaluru alone, according to senior government officials, leaving those dependent on public medical establishments in a state of despair.Interestingly, the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government brought in the Karnataka Private Medical Establishments (Amendment) Bill, 2017 to regulate the cost of treatment in private establishments. However, the bill hit a stone wall after doctors from private hospitals protested for several days. More than 22,000 doctors in Bengaluru participated in the protests. Later, a diluted version of the same bill in November 2017 that sought to ensure that elected representatives and government employees, who are eligible for medical treatment reimbursement, get treated in government hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-karnataka-all-healthcare-roads-lead-to-private-hospitals-101641930336709.html
12-01-2022||India||SC-appointed committee proposes tree conservation authority in every state||NEW DELHI: The seven-member expert committee set up by the Supreme Court to assess the value of trees cut for development projects on non-forest land has recommended a tree conservation authority to be set up at the state and local levels for overseeing compensatory afforestation and to act as custodians of public-owned trees on non-forest land (PTNFL). Submitting a 184-page report to the top court last week, the Committee assigned the task of assessing the value of PTNFL said, “Though this Committee favours a cost-based approach, it agrees that a benefit-based approach based on net present value (NPV) criteria is a better way of assessing the value and making developers pay, as is proposed for land-use change. However, a paucity of studies providing information and data impedes its application in the Indian context.” The Committee recommended a large-scale national research project to conduct a species-specific tree ecosystem service valuation to arrive at their NPV, considering the same as functions of age, girth-at-breast height, etc. “This may well be a long-term project given the number of species and the biogeographic diversity of the country.” said the Committee headed by former chairman of Wildlife Trust of India MK Ranjitsinh Jhala. The Committee proposed the criteria for assessing the value by two methods – transplantation cost method and substitution cost method. It said, “While valuing public trees using the transplantation-cost method, a user agency (project proponent) would bear the cost of transplanting trees including pre-conditioning, hardening, rootstock consolidation, refuge site preparation, transportation, transplanting at a refuge site, and aftercare.” After preparation of a site tree report, the Committee said, “For all 15 transplanted trees that do not survive, indigenous tree species of 4.5 meters (15 feet) height and at least 15 cm diameter need to be planted, at a ratio of 1:5, by the user agency.” Under the substitution-cost method, the Committee said, “The appraisal method using the trunk formula can be used to assess the value of trees to be felled based on the four parameters of girth, species rating, condition rating and location rating.” The expert committee proposed state tree conservation authority (STCA) in each state be formed that should assess the nursery gate price and the planting cost once in three years and fix a uniform unit price to be made applicable across the state. “In no case shall this unit price be less than ₹200 per square cm. As the tree is standing on public land, it is the property of the state and hence standard practices prevalent in the state regarding the felling of trees, their disposal and crediting the proceeds to government revenue shall apply in this case as well.” Following this, the Committee said, “The user agency shall transfer this tree compensatory levy (TCL) to the STCA before approval for felling is accorded. The STCA can fix a numerical threshold based on the number of trees to be felled, beyond which all felling proposals must be routed to it by the local tree conservation authority (LTCA) for approval. Below this threshold, the LTCA can dispose of a proposal at the local level itself.” The Committee felt the need for a national model Act that will codify the functions, powers and composition of the tree conservation authority at various levels, mainstream tree conservation aspects in developmental planning, and articulate the mitigation hierarchy to govern decision making, enable public participation, prevent abuse of trees, lay down the monitoring protocol and other ancillary aspects to be adopted by the state governments in a time-bound manner. The Committee was constituted by the Supreme Court in March 2021, and in December the top court directed the Committee to submit its report in four weeks. The task of the committee was to fix the value of trees taking into account the intrinsic and instrumental value of trees based not on their timber worth but their age, girth and environmental contribution. This remaining members of the committee include Jigmet Thapka, joint secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) as member secretary, Arun Singh Rawat, DG, Indian Council for Forestry Research, Sandeep Tambe, professor of forestry at the Indian Institute of Forest Management, Bhopal, Gopal Singh Rawat, former dean and director, Wildlife Institute of India, Nilanjan Ghosh, director, Observer Research Foundation, Kolkata, considered an expert in ecological economics, and environmentalist Pradeep Krishen. The order constituting the committee was passed while considering a petition filed by Association for Protection of Democratic Rights which opposed felling of primitive trees for construction of five road over bridges (ROB) as part of a road widening project undertaken by West Bengal government. In considering this matter, the Court took opinion from a group of experts on valuing ornamental trees. These experts opined that a tree’s worth can be calculated by setting a multiplier of ₹74,500 to the age of the tree. A heritage tree with a lifespan of over 100 years can even be worth over ₹one crore, it submitted in a report given to the Court. The matter related to chopping of over 300 trees. The bench in its March 25 order said, “The guidelines shall prescribe a mechanism for assessment of both intrinsic and instrumental value of the trees, based not only on the value of timber, but also the ecosystem services rendered by the trees and its special relevance, if any, to the habitat of other living organisms, soil, flowing and underground water.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scappointed-committee-proposes-tree-conservation-authority-in-every-state-101641929742556.html

The export of Indian mangoes has been restricted by the US since 2020 as USDA inspectors were unable to visit India to inspection irradiation facilities due restrictions imposed on international travel because of Covid-19 pandemic.“A revised work plan has been worked out, including phase-wise transfer of oversight of pre-clearance of irradiation treatment to India as agreed upon between both the countries,” the commerce ministry statement said.While the pomegranate exports will start from April 2022, exports of alfalfa hay and cherries from the US will begin in April 2022, it said.There is a huge acceptance and consumer preference of Indian mangoes in the US as India exported 800 metric tonnes (MTs) of mangoes to the US in 2017-18 and the export value of the fruit was $2.75 million, it added.Similarly, in 2018-19, 951 MT of mangoes worth $3.63 Million were exported to US and 1,095 MT worth $4.35 million were exported to the country in 2019-20.“As per estimates received from the exporters, the export of mangoes in 2022, may surpass the figures of 2019-20,” the statement said.The USDA approval will pave the way for exports from traditional mango production belts such as Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

Though 27% reservation existed for OBCs in government jobs and higher education, it was not offered at the school level until them.According to the JNV annual report 2020-21, Uttar Pradesh witnessed maximum OBC enrolments at 16,368, followed by Madhya Pradesh (10,010), Bihar (9,525), Karnataka (7,973) and Rajasthan (7,552).A senior official at the education ministry said that the number was likely to further increase in the ongoing 2021-22 academic session. “The government is committed to the proper implementation of OBC reservation. The data for the academic session 2021-22 is yet to be compiled by the ministry,” the official added, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/98507-obc-students-enrol-in-navodaya-schools-101641929079590.html
12-01-2022||India||Central vista project work delayed by 1-2 days due to heavy rain: Puri||The redevelopment of the central vista avenue in New Delhi, where the Republic Day parade is scheduled to be held, has been delayed by a couple of days due to heavy rain earlier in the month, housing minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Tuesday.Speaking at an event to release the plan for the ‘Smart Cities, Smart Urbanisation’ showcase in Surat, Puri said, “The highest amount of rainfall in January has been witnessed, for any day, in many years…  [but] the central vista avenue work probably lost a day or two, not more.”Construction work where the parade will be held is complete, ministry officials said.Overall work had indeed been hampered due to the rainfall, an official of the Central Public works Department said. “The manholes were filled with water. The space of work got affected. But we are trying to finish the work in the next few days,” he said, requesting anonymity.HT had recently reported that the Rajpath, adjacent paths, lawns, canals and parking lots were ready. “Currently, arrangements for the Republic Day parade are being made. The canals have been repaired, but water will be filled later on,” a senior ministry official had told HT.The redevelopment of the central vista avenue, part of the Centre’s ₹13,500 crore redevelopment project, started in February last year. The project was to be completed by end of December.While large parts of the ₹608 crore project have been completed ahead of the parade, pedestrian underpasses at Janpath and India Gate and amenity blocks will be completed after January 26, said a ministry official.Meanwhile, the ‘Smart Cities, Smart Urbanisation’ event will see a range of events such as workshops, foot races, panel discussions on important issues such as slum-free cities, etc.“The ministry’s Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav initiatives, covering the whole of government approach, are built around large-scale people’s participation,” Puri said. “They highlight not only the country’s rich cultural heritage, but also its future aspirations and spirit of innovation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-vista-project-work-delayed-by-1-2-days-due-to-heavy-rain-puri-101641928716682.html
12-01-2022||India||SFI leader’s murder triggers clashes at many places in Kerala||Thiruvananthapuram:A day after a Students Federation of India (SFI) activist was allegedly killed by Youth Congress workers in an engineering college in Idukki district, clashes broke out at many places in Kerala on Tuesday as both the Congress and ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) engaged in a war of words. Offices of the Congress were attacked at Thiruvalla (Pathanamthitta), Thaliparamba (Kannur), Perambra (Kozhikode) and Malappuram, police said. The SFI observed bandh at educational institutions across the state and carried out protest rallies. At many places, the rallies turned violent, police said. In Malappuram, the situation turned tense on Monday night after a group of CPI(M) workers marched to the venue of a meeting presided over by state Congress president K Sudhakaran. A clash was averted after timely intervention of leaders and police. In Kollam, Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) member of Lok Sabha NK Premachandran’s vehicle was allegedly attacked by a group of CPI(M) workers. “It was a deliberate attack. It seems the CPI(M) is waiting for a chance to settle old scores,” said Premachandran. The MP was earlier with the Left camp and later crossed over to the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF). On Monday, 21-year-old SFI activist Dheeraj Rajendan, a resident of Kannur, was allegedly stabbed to death by Youth Congress workers at around 1 pm at the Idukki Engineering College, police said. Condoling the death, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had said attempts to create violence in campuses cannot be accepted. “The murder of Dheeraj Rajendran, a student of Idukki Painavu Government Engineering College and an SFI activist, is extremely sad and highly condemnable. Attempts to create violence in college campuses will not be allowed under any circumstances. Police have been directed to bring Dheeraj’s killers to justice as soon as possible,” Vijayan said soon after the incident. In a complaint filed on Monday, police have cited political rivalry behind the murder. So far, four persons, including main accused Nikhil Pyly, a Youth Congress worker, have been arrested in the case, police said. Kerala Youth Congress president Shafi Parambhil said the party will take strict action against the accused.On Tuesday, a dozen workers of the Kerala Students Union (Congress student wing), including a few women, were hospitalised at Maharaja’s College in Ernakulam after an alleged attack by SFI workers on Monday night, police said. While the ruling CPI(M) blamed new PCC chief K Sudhakaran for increased violence, the latter asked the ruling party to shed its “politics of violence” to ensure peace in the state. “After Sudhakaran took over the reins, Congress workers are in a belligerent mood. He gives free licence (to party workers) to attack political opponents,” said CPI(M) leader MV Jayarajan. Sudhakaran, however, said, “The party is against violence and we condemned the killing. But the CPI(M) is using this unfortunate incident to target party offices and workers. You take out the list, maximum political murders were committed in the state by CPI (M).” He added that if the attack continued like this, party workers will be forced to retaliate. According to the police, the body of Rajendran was taken to his native place in Kannur on Tuesday by road after conducting post-mortem. “We are keeping a strict vigil in politically volatile north Kerala district,” said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sfi-leader-s-murder-triggers-clashes-at-many-places-in-kerala-101641928656638.html
12-01-2022||India||Supreme Court to hear Haridwar hate speech case today||The Supreme Court will on Wednesday hear a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a former Patna high court judge and a journalist, demanding stringent action against those involved in making hate speeches at a religious events held in Haridwar last month. A bench, headed by chief justice of India NV Ramana, will take up the petition filed by former HC judge Anjana Prakash and journalist Qurban Ali. The other judges on the bench are justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli.On Monday, the bench had agreed to urgently list for hearing the petition after senior advocate Kapil Sibal mentioned the plea.“I have moved this PIL in respect of what happened in Dharam Sansad in Haridwar on 17 and 19 December. We are living in different times where slogans in the country have changed from Satyamev Jayate (truth alone wins) to Shashtramev Jayate (those with arms only win),” Sibal submitted before the bench.The event in Haridwar, held from December 17-19 last year, was organised by Yati Narasimhanand, a religious leader who has been accused in the past of inciting violence with his incendiary speeches.After several controversial videos from the event that were circulated on social media triggered outrage, the Uttarakhand police registered a first information report (FIR) against Jitendra Narayan Singh Tyagi, formerly known as Waseem Rizvi, and others for allegedly giving a “provocative speech” against “a particular religion” at the Dharm Sansad. Some speakers at the event allegedly called for violence against Muslims and Christians.Former Patna HC judge and senior advocate Prakash, and journalist Qurban Ali, approached the Supreme Court complaining of inaction against those who made hate speeches at the Haridwar Dharm Sansad and in Delhi.It said that the speeches made at the Sansad posed a grave threat not just to the unity and integrity of the country but also endangered the lives of millions of Muslim citizens.The plea cited some viral videos of the incident, reportedly showing proclamations made by various religious leaders at the event while contending that the police authorities are hand in glove with the perpetrators of communal hate.The petition has urged the court to set up a special investigation team to probe the incident and bring guilty to book.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-hardiwar-hate-speech-case-today-101641928478155.html

12-01-2022||India||Foxconn to resume ops with nearly 500 workers today||Chennai: Operations at Apple’s contract manufacturing firm, Foxconn, will re-open in a staggered manner from Wednesday, after being shut since December 18 last year following protests by employees demanding better living conditions, quality food and more water in their hostels. Government officials, who are overseeing the changes, said that less than 500 people will be brought back to the hostels before Wednesday. Among the new norms to be followed at hostels include providing bedding to all employees, lodging fewer people inside each room, providing four liters of drinking water per day to each employee and allowing workers to go home when they request for leave, the officials added. On December 29 last year, Apple Inc put the site of the Taiwanese electronics major Foxconn on probation, following which all employees were sent back home to various districts across Tamil Nadu. Salaries for the probation period have been paid to employees. Production at the manufacturing firm at Sriperumbudur, 42 km from Chennai, where iPhones are assembled, has been shut since December 18 last year following protests by thousands of workers demanding safe food following a major food poisoning episode. About 159 employees were hospitalisedafter eating a meal at the hostel’s eatery, managed by the company. Women employees at the firm had complaint about crammed hostel rooms forcing them to sleep on the floor, besides a time limit on water usage in toilets and not enough water and food for them. The state government stepped in with a few recommendations, to which Foxconn’s management agreed. Kancheepuram district collector M Arathi said that Foxconn had outsourced the manpower management to a third-party vendor, which had led to the issues. “Now they will directly monitor everything and they are going to take feedback from the employees on a weekly basis,” the collector said. “Earlier if they made six people stay in a room, it has been brought down to four. Previously they were given a mat and a pillow to sleep. Now they will have bunk beds.” The state government has also suggested that a single, centralised kitchen be decentralised so that employees could be served warm, if not hot, food. “They work eight hours a day and then they are idle in their hostels. So, the Foxconn management is bringing in some sports activities and skill development for them,” the collector added. A top government official involved in talks with Foxconn, who did not wish to be identified, said that officials from various departments, including labour welfare and health, are coordinating the efforts to reopen the factory and ensure that basic facilities made for employees at hostels will meet the required standards. “It will re-start with a minimum workforce and step by step production will increase,” the official said. “There is no doubt that employees will be brought back only after corrective steps have been taken,” the official added. HT reached out to the spokespersons of Apple Inc and Foxconn, but they were yet to respond till the time of going to press. However, they had released independent statements on Monday. “For the past several weeks teams from Apple, along with independent auditors, have been working with Foxconn to ensure a comprehensive set of corrective actions are implemented in the off-site accommodations and dining rooms at Sriperumbudur. Workers will start to return gradually as soon as we are certain our standards are being met in every dormitory and dining area,” Apple’s statement read. Hon Hai Technology Group (Foxconn) said, “We have implemented a range of corrective actions to ensure this cannot happen again and a rigorous monitoring system to ensure workers can raise any concerns they may have, including anonymously. We will gradually begin to welcome back team members as each offsite dormitory becomes ready and is approved.” This was the first such protest at the company that employs 15,000 people, of which over 10,000 are women. Thousands of workers sat in protest for more than eight hours on the busy Chennai-Bengaluru highway, demanding the health status of their colleagues. The workers are not unionised and their protest was supported by members of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) wing in Kancheepuram district. In a statement released on Tuesday, the CITU said there is no clarity on when the remaining employees will be brought back. “CITU will continue its struggle for the basic rights of the workers. The administrations should engage in the best interest of the workers,” the statement read.

The development came weeks ahead of the assembly elections in the state. “If Goa is to be taken forward, the way forward for the people of Goa is only Congress. We have seen the work of Digambar Kamat from 2007 to 2012. In this coming election, Goa needs to go in the right direction. We will ensure that the party wins 22 seats (in the 40-member Goa Assembly),” he said. On Monday, Lobo said he was upset with the functioning of the party, especially the manner in which the grassroots-level workers are treated.A vocal member of chief minister Pramod Sawant’s cabinet, Lobo is the third Christian lawmaker after Alina Saldanha and Carlos Almeida to have left the BJP citing changes in the party’s functioning following former chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s death in 2019. Christians account for a little over 25% of the state’s population.Welcoming Lobo to the party, Kamat said: “Let us work hand in hand to bring back a people-friendly Congress government in Goa and remain committed to protect the identity of Goa.” With Lobo’s resignation, the number of BJP legislators who changed sides since the 2017 assembly elections has risen to 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-bjp-minister-michael-lobo-joins-congress-ahead-of-goa-elections-101641927696533.html
12-01-2022||India||80-year-old gets jail term over cruelty to daughter-in-law||An 80-year-old woman convicted of cruelty to her daughter-in-law was sent to prison for three months on Tuesday despite her advanced age by the Supreme Court, who took a serious note of the matter. Mira, a resident of Chennai, was convicted and sentenced by a trial court under section 498A (relative causing cruelty to women) of the Indian penal code, which was later upheld by the Madras high court. Her daughter-in-law committed suicide in 2006 and it was established that Mira frequently taunted her daughter-in-law.“When an offence has been committed by a woman by meting out cruelty to another woman, i.e., the daughter-in-law, it becomes a more serious offence. If a lady, i.e., the mother-in-law herein does not protect another lady, the other lady, i.e., daughter-in-law would become vulnerable,” a bench of justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna said on Tuesday.The court reduced the sentence from one year to three months and directed the woman, currently on bail, to surrender and undergo the punishment.The mother of the victim had filed a case against her daughter’s husband, mother-in-law and father-in-law under Section 498A and Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the penal code. The victim was staying with her in-laws as her husband used to work in Saudi Arabia.The lawyer appearing for Mira had pleaded to the Court for a lenient view, considering her advanced age and the fact that the High Court had already acquitted her of the charge under Section 306. It was submitted that the victim did not want her husband to go back to Saudi Arabia and for that she quarrelled with her husband and other family members. This, according to Mira’s lawyer, was the root cause that led to her committing suicide.The bench, however, said, “It is to be noted that the appellant – mother-in-law is held to be guilty for the offence under Section 498A of IPC. Being a lady, the appellant, ought to have been more sensitive vis-à-vis her daughter-in-law….In the present case, even the husband of the victim was staying abroad. The victim was staying all alone with her in-laws. Therefore, it was the duty of the appellant, being the mother-in-law and her family to take care of her daughter-in-law, rather than harassing or torturing and meting out cruelty to her daughter-in-law regarding jewels or on other issues. Therefore, as such, no leniency is required to be shown to the appellant in this case.”The high court had passed the order against Mira in April 2019, refusing to interfere with the finding of guilt recorded by the trial court against the mother-in-law alone. The husband and father-in-law were absolved of both charges.The top court went through the material on record and noted the statements recorded by the mother and father of the victim establishing the acts of cruelty by the appellant. “Mother of the victim in her evidence has clearly stated that her daughter was frequently subjected to harassment by her mother-in-law for not adorning jewels…At the time when the incident occurred, the appellant was approximately between 60-65 years. The incident is of the year 2006. Therefore, merely because long time has passed in concluding the trial and deciding the appeal by the High Court, is no ground not to impose the punishment or to impose a sentence of period already undergone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/80yearold-gets-jail-term-over-cruelty-to-daughterinlaw-101641927401216.html
12-01-2022||India||BSF constable killed by cattle smugglers near Indo-Bangladesh border||KOLKATA: A Border Security Force (BSF) constable was allegedly killed by cattle smugglers at Malda in north Bengal in the early hours of Monday, officials said. According to senior BSF officials, Vivek Tiwari, 30, a constable with the 59 Battalion, was overpowered and drowned in a canal by cattle smugglers close to the Indo-Bangladesh border. “We have lodged a complaint with the Bamangola police station in Malda. A case has been initiated,” said SS Guleria, DIG BSF (South Bengal Frontier). According to BSF officials, Tiwari was on patrolling duty in the early hours of January 10 when he spotted cattle being smuggled across a canal located close to the international border. “He challenged the smugglers by firing from his rifle and alerted his colleague who was around 80 metres away. He then chased the smugglers in the dense fog without waiting for his colleagues to arrive. He was intercepted, overpowered and drowned by the cattle smugglers,” said Guleria. Tiwari, who hails from Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh is survived by his wife, who is pregnant, and a one-year-old daughter. He joined the BSF in May 2017. Among all states West Bengal has the longest and one of the most porous international boundaries. The state shares 2216 km international border with Bangladesh. It also shares around 100km border with Nepal and 183 km border with Bhutan. Data placed by the union ministry of home affairs in parliament in March 2020 shows that in 2017, 2018 and 2019 security agencies arrested 1175, 1118 and 1351 people respectively along the entire stretch of the Indo-Bangla border in India. The Union government has recently amended the BSF Act to authorise the force to undertake search, seizure and arrest within a larger 50 km stretch, instead of the existing 15 kms, from the international border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. Following the decision, a political row erupted in the state with the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal hitting out at the Centre alleging that it was an infringement on state land through the back door. The Congress echoed the TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsf-constable-killed-by-cattle-smugglers-near-indo-bangladesh-border-101641927398025.html
12-01-2022||India||927k third vaccine jabs administered on day 2||Nearly 1.9 million (18,52,611) third doses of Covid-19 vaccines were administered since Monday, when India started giving third vaccine doses, according to data from the government’s Co-WIN dashboard. On Tuesday, 927,970 precautionary doses were administered across the country, of which 241,600 were given to the people aged 60 years and above with comorbidities. A total of nearly 7.6 million Covid-19 vaccine doses were administered on Tuesday in all, including to those in the 15-18 age group and all other adults taking their first or second doses, the provisional vaccination data released by the government showed. People above the age of 60 with certain illnesses and those working in high-risk sectors such as healthcare and front-line jobs have been allowed to take what the government has classified as precaution doses, as long as their second shots were taken more than nine months ago. On December 25, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced expanding Covid vaccination coverage under its national immunisation programme to high-risk population group from January 10 onwards, and among children aged 15-18 years from January 3. During his review with certain states on Monday, health minister, Mansukh Mandaviya emphasised on administration of precaution dose for the identified categories commencing from Monday, January 10, and urged the states to ensure full coverage of the vulnerable population as soon as possible. For the convenience of beneficiaries, the health ministry also wrote to states asking to keep running hours flexible at the Covid vaccination centres in their states. “...it is to reiterate that no time limit has been set for the operationalisation of the Covid vaccination centres... The session timings are subject to the demand and the requirement at a particular Covid vaccination centre In case of an increased demand, it is advised that multiple teams may be arranged at each Covid vaccination centre to cater to the need. It is again reiterated that the timings of the covid vaccination centres is flexible and can be up to 10 pm in the night based on availability of HR and infrastructure,” additional health secretary Manohar Agnani wrote in a letter to states. The third dose will be the same as the previous two, the government has mandated. It offers full portability that means even if the third dose is taken at a different centre, it will be the same vaccine taken before. There is no option of mixing doses. Health and front line workers vaccinated earlier in the general category can upload their employment certificate on CoWIN and get tagged in the appropriate category to avail of the precautionary dose facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/927k-third-vaccine-jabs-administered-on-day-2-101641927156825.html
12-01-2022||India||Odisha panchayat polls from February 16: SEC||The three-tier panchayat elections in Odisha will be held in five phases from February 16 to 24 amid strict adherence to Covid-19 protocols, the state election commission (SEC) announced on Tuesday. While no political rallies and victory processions will be permitted, door-to-door campaigns with the participation of maximum five people, including the candidate, will be allowed, it added. The state poll body’s announcement came even as a few political parties sought to halt the forthcoming panchayat elections if reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) is not ensured. The Odisha high court had last month directed that there must be no reservation for backward classes in the panchayat elections — in compliance with recent Supreme Court orders.Addressing reporters here, SEC Aditya Prasad Padhi said voting for 853 zilla parishad seats, 91,916 wards and 6,794 gram panchayats will be held on February 17, 18, 20, 22 and 24 between 7 am and 1 pm. The counting of votes, which will be carried out at the block sardar level, will be held on February 26, 27 and 28. “In view of the Covid cases, only door-to-door campaigning with not more than five people including the candidate would be allowed. No physical rally of political parties or probable candidates or any other group related to election would be allowed,” he said.The model code of conduct has come into effect from Tuesday and will be in place till February 28, he added. “Only fully-vaccinated persons after a negative RT-PCR report will be allowed into the counting centres,” Padhi said.With the high court last month ruling out reservations for OBC, the state, perhaps for the first time, is going to witness an election on the basis of caste as political parties rush to give more representation to the community. The OBCs constitute at least 54% of the total population. While the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) had initially said it would give 27% of the tickets to the OBCs, last month, it raised the figure to 40%. While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress are yet to make announcements in this regard, they are likely to match or surpass BJD’s allocation for the community.The BJP said it would challenge the high court order on OBC reservation in the top court. “We will challenge the HC order on OBC reservation before the Supreme Court in the next couple of days. Let the poll process go on. We are determined to get at least 27 per cent reservation for the OBCs in the panchayat polls,” Surath Biswal, head of BJP’s OBC morcha, said. Congress leader and MLA Suresh Routray said: “It’s good that panchayat polls are happening on schedule. We will win 40 per cent of the seats in the zilla parishad.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-panchayat-polls-from-february-16-sec-101641927036618.html

We are not contesting assembly election,” he said in a statement. The party leader’s statement came three days ahead of the release of the notification for the first phase of assembly elections. Mishra said the party will contest the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh on its own and in alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in Punjab. Top BSP leaders, including Mayawati, will chalk out the poll strategy as well as campaign in the three states, he added. He expressed confidence that the BSP would win the polls in Uttar Pradesh, whereas the BSP-SAD alliance would form the government in Punjab. In an earlier statement, Mayawati said that people had made up their minds to bring the BSP to power in Uttar Pradesh despite a few poll surveys claiming that the party was out of the race. “In 2007 too, they had predicted the defeat of the BSP. Again, the BSP would prove all surveys wrong to form a government in UP with a majority,” she said. The party is likely to release the names of candidates for the first phase of polls along with the Election Commission of India’s notification on January 14. Mayawati has already held meetings with party office bearers over the list of candidates in Lucknow, people familiar with the developments said. On Mayawati’s decision to not contest the polls, SP state unit spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said: “It’s for the BSP to decide who will contest the assembly election.

The special medical exam will be held at one of the Indian Air Force boarding centres after complete clinical recovery, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said in a circular posted on its website on Monday. “Such pilots can be considered for unrestricted flying provided their clinical examination and laboratory investigations reveal no finding that can cause a functional deficit,” the circular said. “Once declared ‘fit for flying’ at the IAF Boarding Centre, the aircrew can commence flying only after DGCA Medical Assessment is issued.”If the isolation of a crew member was more than 14 days, he or she will be examined by DGCA-certified class 1 medical examiner, who will have to issue a cure certificate, the regulator said. “The aircrew can commence flying only after DGCA medical assessment is issued.”Aircrew members who experience mild symptoms can remain in home quarantine for seven days after onset of symptoms and no fever for three days. “There is no need for testing after the home isolation period is over” in such cases, the circular said.Asymptomatic aircrew will undergo home isolation, and on completion of seven isolated days, the aircrew can be declared fit for unrestricted flying by his or her company doctor, provided their clinical parameters are normal. “The cure certificate issued by the company doctor or concerned specialist will have to be sent to DGCA medical cell for inclusion in the crew’s previous medical record,” the circular stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-issues-guidelines-for-covid-positive-air-crew-101641926918331.html
12-01-2022||India||Comorbidity rider may be lifted for boosters for above 60: Officials||The government is likely to formally do away with “comorbid conditions” as a pre-requisite for people above the age of 60 to be eligible for their third doses of a coronavirus vaccine, officials aware of discussions said, while adding that the rider was put in to ensure the most vulnerable get doses first without triggering a demand surge.At present, people above 60 with certain illnesses and those in healthcare and front-line jobs who completed their primary vaccination course more than nine months ago are eligible for what the government refers to a “precaution dose” since January 10.On January 3, the government opened vaccinations for children in the 15-18 age group.An official involved in the process said the decisions on each age group as part of the drive expansion was carefully considered. “The expert standing group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) recommended expanding the coverage in a phased manner for both precaution dose and for children aged 15-18 years if vaccine supplies were a constraint,” said this person, asking not to be named.“Even though vaccine supplies are no longer an issue for the government, it was decided to begin administering the third dose in a phased manner for 60 and above [age group] as compared to children, since it is a bigger cohort,” this person added.To be sure, at present, the government does not require a verification of health certificates to prevent any person above the age of 60 from taking a jab if they can’t show the existence of the illnesses. The only rider is a 39-week gap interval since the second dose.The cohort of the entire 60-plus age group includes over 137 million people, which was why the government decided to break it up by on the status of comorbid conditions, this person said. “That is a bigger chunk so we were careful even though we have not asked for any medical certificates etc., and it was kept purely based on the advice of their medical practitioner. It began with those who were at most risk and gradually it will be expanded to all in this population group. We expect more supplies in coming months as more vaccines have received emergency use authorisation,” added the official.The expert committee had been deliberating on expanding the coverage since November 1, 2021; with the members having held multiple meetings on the issue, at one point also considering allowing only children with comorbid conditions to be eligible first.“[But] since supplies have been adequate for a while now, we decided to do away with the comorbidity criteria for children,” said the official.Experts said it is reasonable to protect the vulnerable first. “It makes sense to protect those who are immmunocompromised, elderly, co-morbidites etc. as much as possible and as early as possible,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, a top vaccine expert, and a senior faculty at the Christian Medical College, Vellore (Tamil Nadu).
12-01-2022||India||Death, live on FB: How mob justice drove three of a family to suicide||On the morning of January 9, at 10:35am, a 25-year- old man went live on Facebook from a coastal village in West Bengal’s South 24 Parganas district. His hair was unkempt, eyes haggard, and voice shaking. In Bengali, he launched into a defence of his “didi” (elder sister).“My sister is innocent. She has not stolen any money. They have locked up our home. We are homeless. We have no option but to die. We have met many people and the police. Nobody helped us. They said we have to settle the accounts with the bank.... Police will recover my mobile phone. All documents, audio calls and voice records are saved in it,” the man in the video said. His voice grew ever more frantic, and the allegations starker. “Why didn’t the people of Sultanpur lodge a police complaint earlier? They should be punished for this. They are wrongly suspecting a woman and torturing her…They tortured my sister by shoving a stick in her private parts. Please save her and my brother-in-law. Share this video,” the man said. In the video, as the man spoke, a phone rang intermittently in the background, but he refused to pay heed. At 11am, 25 minutes after he had started the Facebook live, he placed his handset on the ground, as his father, aged 63, and his mother, in her late forties, walked into the frame. The three then embraced, breaking down in tears. Minutes later, one after another, they climbed onto the branch of the tree behind them, and hanged themselves. His last words in the video were, “We are dying, but let them (sister and brother-in-law) have justice.” When the police found the bodies, his phone was found resting against the stump of a tree. The family had captured their own deaths by suicide. What happened beforeThe family of three lived in South 24 Paraganas, and left early on Sunday morning for a spot on the Bakkhali beach where they committed the act, police said. But their pain and humiliation stemmed from a series of events months in the making, culminating in a mob beating, at the centre of which was the 25-year-old’s sister. The family belonged to a lower caste community which was dominant in the village. The man and his father did odd jobs to run the family, police officers said. For several months, police said, people in the village where the man’s sister and husband stay, also in the South 24 Paraganas district, have been accusing her of siphoning off around ₹10 lakh raised by members of a self-help group, (SHG) run by local women. Her husband works as a labourer at construction sites.The SHG has 12 members and is involved in raising funds for business projects for local women through a micro-financing scheme. The man’s sister, who heads the SHG, was accused by her colleagues of stealing the money they gave to her as a corpus fund. These allegations started in November 2021. The 28-year-old woman has consistently denied these charges, claiming that she deposited the money in the bank account that the SHG holds with the local branch of the Indian Bank. Puja Das, one of the members of the SHG, told HT, “When we charged the man’s sister with stealing our money she said she would return it. She was part of other SHGs as well.” The district has several SHGs, which, also encouraged by the government, have been set up to provide employment to local women and develop skills in making handicrafts and food items, among other things. The groups also help these groups market their products.Goutam Mitra, the officer-in-charge of Diamond Harbour police station, told HT that a preliminary probe by his officers has revealed that money from the bank account is missing. “The man’s sister claimed that she has receipts issued by the bank, but the bank says that those receipts are forged. The local community block development officer (BDO) initiated a probe into this a couple of months ago since SHGs are under his jurisdiction,” Mitra said. The ‘instant justice’On the afternoon of January 8, the day before the mass suicide, another video did the rounds of the area, shot by residents of the village where the 28-year-old woman and her husband live. The video showed the two tied with ropes and being paraded on the streets. Locals have also alleged that the couple were tied to a lamp post and beaten with a stick, after which they were paraded to her parental home in another village a kilometre away. “These women stormed the family’s home on Saturday. It is alleged that they tortured the youth’s sister although she pleaded for mercy. A police team reached the spot and dispersed the mob,” said a district police officer. Locals said that an angry mob went to the house of the woman, and dragged the couple out. They were assaulted, tied up and paraded. Threats were issued that if they did not return the money, their home would be forcibly “taken over”. One of the women and her husband, who allegedly led the assault, were arrested on Tuesday. Police officials said that the investigation had already started before the family died by suicide. But even as arrests were being made, the authorities received word, that the 28-year-old’s brother and parents killed themselves. Mitra said that though the woman’s brother had alleged sexual assault in the live video, this has not been borne out by investigation thus far. “A medical test was done on the woman. It did not show any such evidence,” Mitra said on Tuesday afternoon. Puja Das, the member of the SHG group maintained that while people did go to the woman’s home on Saturday to confront her, there was no assault. Police investigationThe police have arrested seven people, including six women, in the case, based on a complaint of Saturday’s events by the 28-year-old woman. “All the accused have been remanded to police custody. The accused have been charged under several sections of the Indian Penal Code including Section 307 (attempt to murder). Though the young man’s sister has been accused of defalcating funds, the police have not filed any case against her because the BDO is probing the complaint. The BDO will decide whether charges should be brought against the bank or the woman,” Mitra said. Diamond Harbour’s superintendent of police, Avijit Banerjee, said that some more people are under the scanner for alleged financial irregularities. “The man’s sister has also named an officer of the bank as a suspect. We will question everyone,” Banerjee said. On Monday, Bhaskar Mukherjee, superintendent of police, Sunderbans police district, in whose jurisdictional area the suicides took place, told HT that his department is conducting a parallel probe and a case of abetment to suicide has been registered. “The five women arrested by Diamond Harbour police station have been named in the case filed by us. There are several other suspects. The fact that probes are being conducted by two police districts will not hinder the judicial outcome of any of these cases,” said Mukherjee. The block development officer, Milan Tirtha Samanta, could not be contacted despite several efforts.The incident has led a controversy on social media. Rajya Sabha member Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said, “These suicides should be seen a planned social murders. The incident shows how the state government’s loan-dependent policies have also made people dependent on loans.”
12-01-2022||India||Variant watch: Omicron likely evolved in mice, say Chinese researchers||The Omicron variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus may have evolved within mice and jumped back into humans, according to new research by scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.The origins of the variant is among the key questions of research into the coronavirus right now, with implications for the future of the pandemic. Scientists have till now considered three possibilities – that it evolved in a population with sparse genome testing over a period, or it kept mutating in an immuno-compromised patient with a prolonged infection, or it is the product of reverse zoonosis, that is, it jumped to infect an animal and jumped back into humans.At present, several scientists have leaned towards the second scenario, since at least one variant of concern (VOC), Alpha, is very likely to have had such an origin.The report by the Chinese scientists, published in the Journal of Genetics and Genomics, finds the third scenario to be likely because of three reasons. First, they calculated that the coronavirus naturally evolved at a rate 0.45 mutations a month, including all the other VOCs. The number of mutations in the Omicron variant, however, meant that it would have had to evolve at three times the speed, at 1.5 mutations a month, which did not appear to be the natural rate of evolution within human hosts.Second, and most crucially, they found that the molecular nature of mutations in the Omicron variant when it first was detected in humans was not the same as when the coronavirus evolved within humans. The mutations, however, were consistent evolution in animals, in particular mice. Third, they found the closest relative of the Omicron variant, two B.1.1 family viruses, where last seen in May 2020. Till that time, the mutations in those two viruses were on expected lines.In essence, then, it meant that Sars-CoV-2 took a remarkable evolutionary leap by being able to infect mice, and continued to evolve within the rodent for over a year, before picking up traits to be able to infect humans, the scientists said.They wrote that their findings suggest Omicron’s progenitor “experienced a reverse zoonotic event from humans to mice sometime during the pandemic (most likely in mid-2020) and accumulated mutations in a mouse host for more than one year before jumping back to humans in late 2021”. This is a scenario that has long been talked about by molecular biologists. Previously, scientists have found that minks in a farm in Denmark were infected with Sars-CoV-2 by humans, and they passed the virus back to some humans.The Chinese scientists also say that the virus could have come to be through another mechanism, by a recombination of the human variant with that of an animal variant, possibly in an animal host.The findings are consistent with some of the other studies that have been published recently. On January 6, this column reported two studies, one by researchers from University of Amsterdam who found that Omicron had landed so far from the evolutionary tree of the coronavirus that it created almost a distinct “antigenic cluster”, and another by the Imperial College of London, where researchers found the variant now was able to infect domestic poultry, horseshoe bats, and mice.It also fits in with what we are seeing globally – the Omicron variant loses a very significant trait of the Sars-CoV-2: the ability to thrive in the lungs. Without it, the virus is significantly less dangerous, even though it has picked up traits that make spread faster than any other variant.These findings reinforce the big uncertainty that now lies ahead: the variant can now evolve in any direction, and it seems to have become better at infecting even more animals, thereby expanding the reservoir of hosts where it can keep taking evolutionary short-cuts. The Chinese scientists allude to this. “Humans represent the largest known reservoir of Sars-CoV-2, and frequently come in contact with other animals, including livestock animals, pets, or wild animals that invade homes searching for food and shelter,” they said in their conclusion. “Given the ability of Sars-CoV-2 to jump across various species, it appears likely that global populations will face additional animal-derived variants until the pandemic is well under control. Our study thus emphasises the need for viral surveillance and sequencing in animals, especially those in close contact with humans”.
12-01-2022||India||Parliament gears up for session amid Covid spike||Top officials of the two houses of Indian parliament are exploring options including a staggered timetable for the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha and a highly dispersed seating arrangement for the MPs for the upcoming budget session scheduled to start on January 31 amidst an Omicron-led surge in fresh Covid-19 cases.“We are looking at various options. But the final decision will depend on the Covid situation towards the end of this month. The Lok Sabha Speaker and the Rajya Sabha chairman will meet around January 25 or 26 to decide how to run the session,” said a top-ranking functionary.The budget session is perhaps the most important sitting of Parliament, and also its longest. The Union Budget is presented at the beginning of the session.The functionary cited above said it is not clear whether the session will run its normal course in the shadow of the third wave of the coronavirus disease pandemic, one that has affected several lawmakers, key leaders and officials of both houses. A top official of Parliament said that elections in five states including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab are another key factor that might result in a curtailed session.On Monday, Vice President and Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu spoke to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to take stock of the situation and also directed both secretary generals accordingly. The two of them wanted to review the adequacy of Covid-safetly protocols followed during the last winter session in the context of the third wave.“Our main target is to ensure lawmakers and other people who come to Parliament remain safe. So, to minimize the crowd and keeping in mind social distancing, we might have to opt for two different timetables for the two houses. One will start in the morning and the other in the afternoon,” said a second functionary involved in the discussions.This would also allow prevent all lawmakers from gathering in the chamber. “In the monsoon session of 2020, we decided that the Rajya Sabha sits in the morning and the Lok Sabha in the afternoon. So, MPs from one House could occupy a seat in the chamber, the galleries and in the other House as well,” added this person.The same arrangement may be followed in the budget session.A high-ranking Lok Sabha functionary said, “Indian Parliament has run during the Covid pandemic and we have shown our ability to adhere to parliamentary norms even during a major health crisis.”On Tuesday, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla inspected the Parliament House Complex to take stock of health safety related measures and other preparations put in place in light of the recent spike in Covid-19 cases in the country.
12-01-2022||India||Is the third wave finally starting to ebb in Mumbai and Delhi?||The earliest urban hot spots of India’s third wave of Covid-19 – Mumbai and Delhi, which were among the first regions in the country to reflect a rising trend in infections – appear to be exhibiting early signs that their infections curves may be flattening, data shows.While key data indicators in Mumbai suggest that numbers in the city have already started peaking, Delhi is experiencing what could be the first indication that the rise of cases has slowed down.In Mumbai, the positivity rate has started dropping. Positivity rate (the proportion of daily tests returning positive for Covid-19) is one of the first statistical measures that indicate a reversal in trend. This number has now fallen for five days in a row – the figure was 29.9% last Thursday, 29% on Friday, 28.6% on Saturday, 28.5% on Sunday, 23% on Monday, and touched 18.8% on Tuesday.As expected, this trend was closely followed by a drop in daily infections, which have now fallen for four consecutive days – there were 20,971 cases on Friday, 20,318 on Saturday, 19,474 on Sunday, 13,648 on Monday, and finally 11,647 on Tuesday.In Delhi, while cases and positivity rate have not yet started declining, the rapid rise seen over the past two weeks appears to have slowed , hinting that the peak may be approaching – a factor that has been pointed out by several health experts, both government and independent.While daily cases in the Capital more than doubled in four days from 10,665 on Wednesday to 22,751 on Sunday, cases have stayed below Sunday’s level over the two following days – there were 19,166 new cases on Monday (when fewer tests were conducted), and 21,259 on Tuesday. The rapid rise in positivity rate in Delhi has also slowed . While daily positivity rate jumped more than 11 percentage points between Wednesday (11.9%) and Sunday (23.5%), it has only increased two percentage points between Sunday and Tuesday (25.6%).If this trend continues, these numbers may be headed to a peak in a few days, something that Delhi health officials have suspected may happen based on an analysis by a team of medical experts along with an assessment of Sutra – a mathematical model developed by scientists at IIT-Kanpur and IIT-Hyderabad to assess the peak in Covid-19 cases in India – that says that Delhi could see a peak in Covid-19 infections around January 15.“We are expecting a peak in cases in the next day or two. But we are prepared to handle the spike in cases,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Tuesday.To be sure, doctors and health experts said that numbers on the ground may be higher as a lot of people have resorted to using home test kits due to milder symptoms occurring with the Omicron variant, and do not necessarily follow up with a RT-PCR test if they are positive, thereby staying off the radar.There is, however, no way to map these cases since most mild patients are recovering in home isolation.Infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who is also a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, said that the wide use of self-testing kits is a matter of convenience but when looked at from a public health perspective, it could present a skewed picture of the spread of infection. “The authorities should consider devising a mechanism through which reports of all self-tests are recorded,” he said.Experts, however, said that so far the waves in Mumbai and Delhi appear to be following trends seen in Omicron waves the world over – a very rapid rise in infections that peaks just as fast, coupled with a relatively higher share of mild cases, causing fewer hospitalisations.To be sure, they also warned that the marginal improvement in numbers witnessed over the past few days needs to become a sustained trend, and that keeping in mind the high transmissibility of the Omicron variant, the focus remains on keeping hospitalisations low.In Mumbai, authorities said they were optimistic, but wanted to remain cautious. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said, “It looks like the cases are stabilising but we will have to wait for this week before commenting on whether we have reached the peak .”Experts also expressed optimism about the reduced number of hospitalisations and comparatively fewer deaths so far.Delhi government numbers show that as of Tuesday, despite a consistent rise in the cases, less than 15% of hospital beds designated for Covid-19 patients were occupied. In Mumbai, this number was under 20%. A tally of data compiled by HT from 16 regions in India showed that fewer 15% of hospital beds are occupied across the country as of Tuesday night.And even among those hospitalised and those dying, the numbers are dominated by those who are unvaccinated. On Monday, HT reported a Delhi government analysis of deaths among Covid-19 patients in Delhi between January 5 and 9 that showed that 35 out of 46, or 76%, of the fatalities were in unvaccinated people.“We are in comfortable situation during the third wave and are handling all symptomatic patients or those from high-risk groups. This time the demand for oxygen and ICU beds is low due to which we are in a much better situation. However, we are on alert if cases increase drastically we will have to further ensure every patient gets a bed,” BMC’s Kakani said.Maharashtra’s health minister Rajesh Tope said that so far Oxygen requirement has not been an issue like it was in the country’s brutal second wave. “The need for oxygen has not risen a great deal. The bed occupancy has not shot up to a concerning level. However, we need to remain cautious and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour... Out of the active cases, only 2% are on oxygen support and 1% are in ICU in the state. The numbers are not such that would burden the medical infrastructure,” he said.And like in Delhi, an overwhelming majority of medical resources such as Oxygen beds in Mumbai were currently deployed towards the unvaccinated. On Saturday, HT reported that 96% of Covid-19 patients requiring oxygen support in Mumbai’s hospitals are unvaccinated.Doctors and health experts have repeatedly said that considering the high transmissibility of the Omicron variant, it would be better to look beyond reported infections and towards hospitalisations instead.“Infection-wise the on-ground reality could be 10-100 times also because a lot of people are taking home tests. But what is important is to see the hospitalisations, the requirement of oxygen and ventilators because that is a very small percentage. There is no point now looking at just case numbers because a majority of the infections are mild. If we see the trends in other countries, the rise in cases is steep because this variant is definitely more transmissible but since the infection period is also shorter, the fall is also equally fast. But we will have to wait and watch how the trends are here because taking a definitive stand,” said Dr Sumit Ray, head (department of critical care), Holy Family Hospital.With inputs from Soumya Pillai in Delhi, and Swapnil Rawal, Mehul Thakkar and Jyoti Shelar in Mumbai

It is the TMC’s third ‘major’ promise in Goa ahead of the polls. Announcing the scheme, the party said it will ensure that within 250 days of forming the government, all the Goan families residing in the state since 1976, or before, will be provided with title and ownership rights of land under possession while 50,000 homeless families will be given subsidised homes. Party member Kiran Kandolkar said that the TMC will amend Goa’s Mundkar (tenant) Act to enable the grant of full title to the persons residing before 1976 or they will be paid a compensation. He also promised the cessation of long pending cases once the laws planned by the TMC are enforced. Deepak Dhavalikar, the president of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, which has allied with the TMC for a pre-poll alliance, said that Goa’s land to the tiller Act and the Mundkar (homestead) Act were diluted by subsequent governments rendering them ineffective, something the party was keen to change once elected to power. The TMC has already announced a scheme to provide ₹5,000 per month to one woman per family styled as the Griha Laxmi scheme, as well as a Yuva Shakti scheme in which the party promises loans at low interest rates for youth to begin their own businesses. “It is time to bring an era of pro-people legislation which seeks to protect the lives and livelihoods of Goenkars (Goans),” the party said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-promises-land-titles-homes-for-homeless-in-goa-if-voted-to-power-101641925896530.html

As he joined the Congress on Tuesday with his wife Delilah , Lobo pledged to work to get the Congress 22 plus seats in the 40-member Goa assembly. Goa votes on February 14.“If Goa is to be taken forward, the way forward for the people of Goa is only Congress. We have seen the work of Digambar Kamat from 2007 to 2012. In this coming election, Goa needs to go in the right direction. We will ensure that the party wins 22 seats,” he said.As he urged people to bring the Congress back to power with a clear majority, Lobo also took a shot at parties such as the Trinamool Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party that are trying to find a toehold in the state politics.“Many new parties have come to Goa and are trying to fool Goans. Goa needs to move forward in the right direction, hence I have resigned from the government and joined the Congress”, the 45-year-old politician said.I request the people of Goa to bring Congress party back to power with clear majority. Many new parties have come to Goa and are trying to fool Goans. Goa needs to move forward in the right direction, hence I have resigned from the govet & joined the Congress: Shri Michael Lobo pic.twitter.com/WqPgdeIA2S“Let us work hand in hand to bring back a people-friendly Congress government in Goa and remain committed to protecting the identity of Goa,” Congress leader Digambar Kamat said.One of the vocal members of chief minister Pramod Sawant’s Cabinet, Lobo was the third Christian lawmaker after Alina Saldanha and Carlos Almeida to have quit the BJP. While Saldanha joined the AAP. Carlos and Lobo have both joined the Congress. The three have said the party has taken “a different turn” since the death of former chief minister Manohar Parrikar in 2019. Christians account for 25% of the state’s population.Lobo’s departure from the BJP is seen to indicate the unease among the BJP’s Christian MLAs especially in the light of attacks on Christians in neighbouring Karnataka that have not gone unnoticed among the state’s minority population. Clergymen have referred to the attacks that took place over Christmas during religious gatherings in Goa.Congress, which emerged as the single-largest party in the state in 2017 with 17 seats, was unable to form the government as the BJP, which won 13 seats, formed an alliance with the help of the Goa Forward Party and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party. With Lobo quitting the BJP, the number of legislators who have changed sides since the 2017 assembly election touches 25.62% of the legislators now find themselves in a party different from the one they were elected on back in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-parties-come-to-fool-goans-michael-lobo-joins-congress-takes-on-tmc-too-101641931358012.html
