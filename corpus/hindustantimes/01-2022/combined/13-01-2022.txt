The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) will conduct offline exams for class 12 and class 10. Last year, 25 per cent of syllabus was slashed for all standards after the Covid outbreak. Harishchandra Gaikwad, president, Pune district principals’ association, said that basics of subjects taught in class 9 and class 11 are not part of class 10 and class 12 reduced syllabus respectively. “So, teachers of class 10 and class 12 have to teach the basic subjects of class 9 and class 11 to the students,” said Gaikwad. Sharad Gosavi, chairman, MSBSHSE, said that the decision to reduce syllabus is taken by the Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT). “We have reduced the syllabus to help students. Many students have lost the habit of writing after classes resumed post Covid lockdowns. Hence, we have given students half and an hour more in offline examination scheduled from March. We are firm on the decision of taking offline exam as online format is not feasible in Maharashtra due to the varied geography of the state and the fact that not all students can have access to mobile or laptop to appear for the test,” said Gosavi. He urged students of 15-18 age group to get vaccinated at the earliest. “Vaccination of students will ensure that they are safe. All teaching and non-teaching staff are already getting fully vaccinated,” said Gosavi. Though the state board officials have decided to conduct examination offline, the final decision will be taken by the state government depending on the prevailing Covid situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maha-education-board-firm-on-offline-exams-this-year-101642098481525.html

13-01-2022||Pune||Count OTC self-kit Covid test customers: FDA to Pune chemists||Pune: A day after the state public health department directed civic bodies about using self-testing kits by people, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued notification asking chemists and pharmacists in Pune to keep a record of customers who buy these kits. FDA joint commissioner (Pune division), SB Patil, issued a notification on Thursday asking retail as well as wholesale chemists and pharmacists in Pune to keep a record of customers who buy the home test kits. “It is important to keep all details such as name, phone number, address of the customer who buys a kit and also the particulars of the kit. All such records will be checked by the drug inspectors,” the FDA notification said Earlier on Wednesday, the Maharashtra health department expressed concern about the large number of non-reporting of coronavirus positive cases diagnosed using self-testing kits by people and wrote to the district and civic officials to monitor the sale of such kits and ensure that patients report about their infection to the authorities Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary of the state public health department, gave these directions to all the municipal and divisional commissioners, district collectors and chief executive officers of zilla parishads (ZPs) in a letter written on Wednesday. In the letter, Vyas also asked FDA to sensitise chemists and pharmacists so that they can educate customers buying the Covid-19 self-testing kits to report about their infection to the authorities. “It is expected that all Covid positive tests conducted through rapid antigen test kits or home test kits are reported to the authorities. But it seems that there is a large number of coronavirus positive cases diagnosed through these kits that have not been reported to the authorities and such persons appear to be in home isolation,” he said in the letter. People should report positive test results found using the home kits to the district or civic authorities so that their health can be monitored, he added. The letter said that as per the genome sequencing results, about 70 per cent of the cases are of Delta strain. “Rapid antigen tests generally do not distinguish between the Delta and Omicron variants. So, it may so happen that many of these home isolated Covid patients may need hospital care (particularly those with Delta strain and comorbidities) and suddenly there may be a stress on our health infrastructure,” Dr Vyas said in the letter. He asked officials to take help of FDA and monitor the sale of such self-testing kits to know the geographical areas where these kits are being used on a large scale. “Chemists can also be educated so that they can inform the people purchasing such kits to report about the positive test results to authorities,” the letter added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/count-otc-self-kit-covid-test-customers-fda-to-pune-chemists-101642097944838.html
13-01-2022||Lucknow||UP assembly polls: Saini becomes third minister to resign in three days||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continued to suffer setbacks ahead of the Uttar Pradesh (UP) assembly polls with Dharam Singh Saini becoming the third minister belonging to the Other Backward Castes (OBCs) to resign from the council of ministers in as many days. The development came even as the ruling party’s top leaders in Delhi mulled over names for the assembly seats that will go to polls in the first phase on February 10. Eleven lawmakers, including three OBC ministers, have resigned from the BJP since the schedule for the UP assembly polls was announced on January 8. The trend of resignations, primarily of OBC lawmakers from across the state, gained strength after labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya quit the Uttar Pradesh cabinet on January 11. The next day, environment minister Dara Singh Chauhan also resigned.Ayush minister Dharam Singh Saini, a Swami Prasad Maurya loyalist and lawmaker from Nakur assembly seat in Saharanpur in western UP, was also spotted at the main opposition Samajwadi Party office, a stone’s throw away from Swami Prasad Maurya’s Kalidas Marg residence, currently the hub of all rebel activity in the BJP. Like Swami Prasad Maurya and Dara Singh Chauhan, Saini, too, sent his resignation to governor Anandiben Patel. “I came to meet Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on his invitation and assurance that backwards and dalits would get justice in the Samajwadi Party. I told him that I will consult Swami Prasad ji and will soon take a collective decision,” Saini said. After initially reaching out to them, the BJP has begun to hit out at the rebels. While UP minister Sidharth Nath Singh described the resignations as a case of “vinash kaley viprit buddhi (pride comes before the fall)”, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev, an OBC leader himself, was more direct. “Those who failed to get a ticket of the double engine BJP train are now being given ticket in black for the rickety van by Tipu Sultan,” the UP BJP chief tweeted. Along with chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Swatantra Dev and party’s OBC face in UP, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya are in Delhi to mull over the names of candidates. The BJP, along with its pre-poll allies Apna Dal (Sonelal) and Nishad Party, could hold a joint press conference to declare the names of over 150 candidates on Friday, the day when Swami Prasad Maurya is expected to declare his next political strategy.In Delhi, Keshav Prasad Mauarya said the BJP’s central election committee discussed the names of candidates for 172 seats and exuded confidence of the party winning the UP assembly elections. But the rebels appeared unfazed, with Swami Prasad Maurya terming the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh) and the BJP as “saanp’ and naag (snakes)”, while warning of more defections. “Dekhte jaiye (keep watching),” said Dara Singh Chauhan, who in 2017 had won the Madhuban in east UP for the first time for the BJP. He was earlier with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).“At least 100 lawmakers would quit,” said Mukesh Verma, the BJP lawmaker from Shikohabad assembly constituency of Firozabad as he along with Bidhuna MLA Vinay Shakya joined the growing list of rebels on Thursday.While quitting the party, Mukesh Verma expressed solidarity with Swami Prasad Maurya. Mentioning the neglect of backwards, Dalits and minorities as the reason for his resignation from the BJP, Verma said he would follow Maurya to decide his future course of action.“Swami Prasad Maurya is our leader and we will decide the future course of action under his leadership,” Mukesh Verma said.Shikohabad in Firozabad district of western Uttar Pradesh goes to polls on February 10 in the first phase of the seven-round state assembly elections.Mukesh Verma had joined the BJP in 2017 and won as the party candidate. In 2012, he had contested as the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidate and was the runner-up. For his part, Dara Singh Chauhan, who had quit the cabinet on Wednesday, refuted the BJP charge that only those who were sure of missing out on the BJP ticket are looking elsewhere.“I never have begged for a ticket. In fact, I never wanted to contest but was made to,” he said, adding that he won the Madhuban seat for the first time for the BJP in 2017 UP polls.Apart from them, yet another BJP lawmaker Bala Krishna Awasthi from Dhaurahara, a Brahmin dominated assembly constituency in Lakhimpur Kheri district, was also spotted at the Samajwadi Party office.Later on Thursday evening, Awasthi, speaking to the media in Lucknow, made it clear about his leaving the BJP and joining the Samajwadi Party.Awasthi mentioned neglect of his community, party workers and farmers, dominance of bureaucracy at the cost of elected MLA as the reasons for him switching sides. At the same time, he heaped praise on the SP chief.Awasthi’s eldest son Rajiv Awasthi, speaking over the phone, said his father would contest from Dhaurahra. Bala Prasad Awasthi’s move comes when the BJP is out to placate Brahmins, the key upper caste group for whom the party had recently set up a committee to connect with the community. Amid the exodus, came a few denials too. Three BJP lawmakers and a minister have denied the buzz about them joining the rebel ranks with two of them even registering a police complaint against the “canard” of them leaving the party. They include BJP MLA from Bhadohi Ravindra Tripathi and Bareilly lawmaker from Bithri Chainpur Rajesh Mishra. Both of them have approached the police seeking action against those spreading rumours about their quitting the party. A third, UP’s cooperatives minister Mukut Bihari Verma also denied rumours about him being on the list of rebels.“I am a die-hard RSS man who joined the BJP as part of the Sangh’s advice and will remain in the party till I live,” he said. Political experts cautioned against reading too much into the pre-poll desertions. “These aren’t good optics, but how these play out in the election campaign is yet to be seen. Perception wise, it could be comforting for the opposition, though,” said Irshad Ilmi, a political observer.On Wednesday, the BJP inducted Naresh Saini, the Congress’s OBC lawmaker from Saharanpur in western UP, who hails from the same community as Swami Prasad Maurya, three-time SP MLA Hari Om Yadav, and former SP lawmaker Dharampal Singh into the party.The BJP lawmakers who have quit since model code came into effect on January 8 are: Dharam Singh Saini (OBC, minister) , Dara Singh Chauhan (OBC, minister), Swami Prasad Maurya (OBC, minister), Roshan Lal Verma (OBC), Bhagwati Sagar (OBC), Brijendra Prajapati (OBC), Vinay Shakya (OBC), Mukesh Verma (OBC), Avtar Singh Bhadana (OBC), Radha Krishna Sharma (Brahmin) and Bala Prasad Awasthi (Brahmin).(With inputs from Hemendra Chaturvedi in Agra and Deo Kant Pandey in Lakhimpur Kheri)

Kohli was inducted into the party by AAP’s state unit president and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann at a programme held in Chandigarh. Mann said that with the joining of Kohli and his family, AAP would gain more strength. Kohli, while expressing gratitude to Mann, said that his father Surjit Singh Kohli and grandfather Sardara Singh Kohli had served the Panth and Punjab in the SAD. Kohli’s father was council president from Patiala city and his grandfather was a minister in the Akali regime. Lashing out at the SAD, Kohli said the party was no longer the same. “The Akali leaders have no road map or policy for the youth of Punjab,” he said, calling (AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister) Arvind Kejriwal a role model. Significantly, the AAP is yet to announce its candidate for the Patiala urban segment. “Though our party has declared candidates from 109 segments of 117, it has adopted a wait-and-watch policy for Patiala urban seat. Both Congress and former Captain Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress are yet to declare their candidates,” a senior AAP leader add.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/former-patiala-mayor-joins-aap-101642096983478.html

Aman works as a contractor of readymade school clothes and runs a factory in Balram Nagar, Loni, UP. He was known to the woman’s family through their business. We conducted raids Aman’s residence and factory but he was not there. On the basis of technical surveillance, the names of three men who were constantly in touch with Aman surfaced.

The bench comprising Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Sadhna Rani refused to quash the FIR.As per the petitioner, earlier he had filed a contempt petition against some police officers and therefore, the investigating officer was bent upon keeping the petitioner behind bars and the current FIR was an act of revenge on the part of the investigating officer and the FIR was registered when petitioner was in jail and could not have been involved in any criminal activity.

13-01-2022||Lucknow||BJP tasks UP unit chief, deputy CM to undertake firefighting operation||LUCKNOW The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in UP, jolted by exodus, fielded its state unit chief Swatantra Dev, an OBC leader, to highlight various initiatives undertaken by the party for the poor and the backwards and counter the narrative about the BJP government not doing anything for the backwards. Swatantra Dev is a Kurmi, the second biggest OBC sub-caste after Yadavs. Kurmis and Mauryas, the other OBC subcaste to which deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya belongs to, are the dominant non-Yadav OBC castes. This is the reason why the party has tasked both these leaders to undertake a firefighting operation essentially aimed at checking further dissension within the ruling party. While Maurya has been appealing to the rebels to reconsider their decision, the UP BJP chief listed various initiatives of the party. “The UP government has done a lot for all sections of society and so the BJP will emerge victorious in the polls,” said Maurya.“From giving constitutional status to the backward classes commission to including 27 OBCs in the union government and 23 in the UP government, providing scholarships of ₹762.49 crore to 37.74 lakh students, double rations, e-shram card, power connections, Ujjawala gas connections, free health insurance cover, toilets, Kisan Samman Nidhi – the total number of initiatives that the BJP government took for the backwards are many and their impact is huge. Yet, the opposition has hatched a conspiracy to defame the government and the people will give a befitting reply,” said the UP BJP chief. “During the first and second wave of Covid too, the Narendra Modi government at the centre and the Yogi Adityanath government in UP always worked hard to help the poorest of the poor. When the opposition leaders were in quarantine, the BJP governments and its cadres were out to help the poor who stand firmly with the BJP,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-tasks-up-unit-chief-deputy-cm-to-undertake-firefighting-operation-101642095060734.html

The police have identified a fourth member of the gang who is yet to be arrested.The gang landed on police radar when two consecutive cases occurred in Wakad and Nigdi on January 4 when elderly people were targeted by the poser policemen. The accused would approach the victims and tell them that the area they are walking in is not safe for them to be wearing valuable jewellery. They would then advice the victim to keep the jewellery in their bags and steal it by sleight of hand.The police then formed three teams under senior police inspector Vivek Mugalikar of Wakad police station. The teams began sifting through all CCTV footage of multiple similar cases. The modus operandi of these cases was known to the police to be signature of the gang.“To gain information about the gangs functioning in Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune, the teams went to colonies in Patil Estate and Loni Kalbhor areas and found that the crimes were being committed by a Kalyan-based gang and not the ones in Pune,” read a statement by the police.After zeroing in on the names of the possible accused, the police tracked all their mobile phones and found them to be sitting behind a hotel in Baneli area of Thane. While two of them were caught, one tried to flee and hide in a dirt pit but was eventually found and arrested, according to the police.The men were in police custody till Wednesday and were found involved in seven other cases including one from Manpada police station in Thane.However, even as these men were in police custody, two cases were reported from Pune rural police jurisdiction of the exact same modus operandi. While one case was registered in Shirur police station for theft in Vadgaon Rasai village on January 10, the other was registered at Shikrapur police station for an incident in Talegaon Dhamdhere on January 11. In the Shirur case, the victim is a 71-year-old man while the Shikrapur case has a 55-year-old victim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/gang-of-poser-policemen-who-stole-jewellery-busted-101642094880916.html
13-01-2022||Lucknow||HC allows bail plea of man named in 49 narcotics cases||The Allahabad high court has allowed another bail application of a man, who was made accused in 49 narcotics cases in the last 23 years but was either acquitted later or his name was expunged from the case.Justice Krishan Pahal allowed the bail application filed by one Gaurav alias Gaura of Muzaffarnagar.According to the applicant, the police of Khatauli police station of Muzaffarnagar were registering false and frivolous cases against him after his father, on April 26, 2002, filed a complaint against some police officials.According to the applicant, he was falsely implicated in the present case and from his possession, 102.66-gram Alprazolam was not recovered as alleged in the FIR.Further, there was no chemical analysis report to prove that the recovered contraband is the Alprazolam powder or something else. The recovery was a sham.Additional advocate general representing state government, during the course of hearing, admitted that an investigation into the allegations levelled by the father of the applicant was also taken up by the CBCID against the police officials.The court without going into the merit of the case observed, “The object of grant of bail to an accused of an offence is neither punitive nor preventive in nature. The courts owe more than verbal respect to the principle that punishment begins after convictions and that every man is deemed to be innocent until duly tried and found guilty.”“From the earlier times, it was appreciated that detention in custody pending completion of trial could be a cause of great hardship. Apart from the question of prevention being the object of a refusal of bail, one must not lose sight of the fact that any imprisonment before conviction has a substantial punitive content, and it would be improper for any court to refuse bail as mark of disapproval of former conduct whether the accused has been convicted for it or not.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/hc-allows-bail-plea-of-man-named-in-49-narcotics-cases-101642094100642.html

A joint declaration with the SP will be made on January 14 (Friday). There is a tsunami against the BJP in Uttar Pradesh and it will be brought (down) to the 47-seat tally that it won in the 2012 assembly elections,” he said. Before the interaction with Akhilesh Yadav, Swami Prasad Maurya held a meeting at his official residence with his loyalists, including his ministers, MLAs and leaders loyal to him who have quit the BJP.The majority of these loyalists resigned from the BJP after Maurya quit the state cabinet on Tuesday (January 11). They include Ayush minister Dharam Singh Saini, MLAs Roshan Lal Verma, Brijesh Kumar Prajapati, Vinay Shakya, Mukesh Verma, Bala Prasad Awasthi and Bhagwati Prasad Sagar. They arrived at Maurya’s residence to express their allegiance. Later, they left with Swami Prasad Maurya to meet Akhilesh Yadav. Most of the ministers and MLAs who resigned from the BJP were with Swami Prasad Maurya in the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). After Maurya quit the BSP in June 2016 a few months before the 2017 assembly elections to join the BJP, his loyalist also switched sides and a majority of them contested the 2017 assembly elections on the BJP ticket. As the Modi wave swept Uttar Pradesh, they won their seats in 2017.Before leaving his official bungalow to meet the SP chief, Swami Prasad Maurya termed the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) and the BJP as snakes which are swallowing the rights of the backward community.“I will have to become a mongoose to fight the BJP as well as to protect the rights of the weaker sections,” he said. “I thank all the self-respecting ministers and MLAs who have resigned from the BJP that had neglected the backward and dalit community. All are coming under one umbrella (indicating Samajwadi Party) to restore the dignity and welfare of the backward and Dalit community,” Swami Prasad Maurya said.“My decision has triggered an earthquake in the BJP, there will a big tremor in the saffron brigade on Friday (January 14) with my announcement. I pleaded with the BJP leaders for the welfare of the dalits and backwards but they couldn’t care less. Now, the BJP leaders are using all the tricks to stop the MLAs from deserting the party, but the resignation of the ministers and MLAs from the BJP will continue even after January 14,” Swami Prasad Maurya said.“Uttar Pradesh is not a grazing ground for the BJP. The people have decided to give them a farewell in the assembly elections,” Swami Prasad Maurya said. Dara Singh Chauhan, who resigned from the cabinet on Wednesday, met Akhilesh Yadav again on Thursday. Chauhan had joined the BJP in February 2015 over a year before Swami Prasad Maurya switched sides from the BSP to the BJP in June 2016.“Swami Prasad Maurya is a senior OBC leader. We are unitedly fighting for social justice and welfare of the backward community. We decided to bid adieu to the BJP as its policies were anti-backward and dalit,” he said. Chauhan is an influential OBC leader of east UP with a hold on the Lonia-Chauhan community in Mau, Azamgarh, Gorakhpur, Ghazipur, Varanasi, Ballia, Jaunpur and Ambedkar Nagar districts.Chauhan met his supporters, who had arrived from east UP at his official bungalow in Lucknow’s Raj Bhavan colony.“I, along with Swami Prasad Maurya, will make a final announcement on January 14,” he said.

Neither candidates nor people are able to adapt to such methods,” said Patiala rural’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate Balbir Singh.Candidates and parties across the political spectrum second this opinion, adding virtual campaigning sessions are no match to the physical contact and bond that one forms with the voter. Balbir claimed that only political outfits like the BJP, which have proper logistics and a well-equipped IT cell could afford to go virtual.Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) candidate from Samana Surjit Singh Rakhra said it had become difficult for candidates to reach out to people at such crucial time. “The matter is being discussed at senior leadership level and the SAD is going to send a representation to the ECI, seeking relaxations in the campaigning process,” he said.Rakhra added that people in rural constituency cannot be reached through smartphones and online meetings. “These restrictions can be best implemented in metropolitan cities only. People in Punjab’s village have no internet data for their kids to attend online classes, and we are expecting them to attend online political rallies,” he said.AAP candidate from Amloh in Fatehgarh Sahib Gurinder Singh Garry Biring said it would take a month to arrange all logistics and permissions for online meetings, even if they start preparing for it, immediately. “We have a built team of volunteers, who are perfect in door-to-door campaigning,” he said.SAD candidate from Nabha, Kabir Dass, added that door-to-door campaigns and small group meetings in open spaces are effective. “Earlier, door-to-door contacts were carried out in last phase of campaigning. This time, however, it has been given prime importance,” he said.

Of them, seven were aged below 18, including three who had not even turned a year old.One of the babies was aged three months and the other seven months."We don't know how our little one contracted the infection. Neither me nor my wife had Covid," Kumar told PTI over phone.The names of the parents have been changed to protect the privacy of the families.Kumar is a resident of Wazirabad and had taken his daughter to Sant Parmanand Hospital for a check-up where she tested positive on January 7 and was admitted to LNJP Hospital the next day. She passed away on January 9."When she was born, doctors had told us that dirty water had gone inside her mouth. There was also pus and bleeding in her umbilical area but that was cured. The doctors told that her immunity was low which is why got Covid-19," he said.Kumar said that she was their first born."My wife is inconsolable. Maybe it was not in our baby's fate to live long," he said with a heavy voice.The seven-month-old boy was suffering from Thalassemia and was admitted to Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya on January 6 since he was unwell.On January 7, his father got himself tested after the hospital authorities told him that he couldn't enter the facility without a Covid negative report. "I tested positive on January 7. The same day my son also came out positive. I am an e-rickshaw driver and I would get myself tested every fortnight for the infection," the man said.His son was born during the second wave of coronavirus when the national capital was under a lockdown, recalled his father. According to the hospital diagnosis, the little one had Covid with severe anemia along with congestive heart failure and bilateral pneumonia. He passed away on January 11.The parents of the three-month-old boy had gone to GB Pant Hospital for his check-up on January 7 but decided to first go to LNJP since he was breathing fast.The little one was suffering from atrial septal defect or in simple terms, had a hole in heart. "Friday is the OPD day in GB Pant Hospital and we brought him. But since he was breathing fast, first we went to LNJP where he was seen by a pediatrician. We were given a list of infections and asked to return after consulting the doctor at GB Pant," his father, who works in a restaurant, said.At GB Pant, they were supposed to get a date for his operation but the doctor said that surgeries were not being conducted due to coronavirus."We requested the doctor to consider our case and he asked us to return on January 11 with the cardiac echo report," he said.Thereafter, the family went to LNJP,  where he was tested for coronavirus, but his report came negative."He was admitted and on January 10, we were told at 7 pm that he has tested positive for Covid-19 and his condition is critical. Within a couple of hours, he was no more," recalled his father. He alleged that his son was not given proper treatment and was not tended properly."My wife told them that he has fever on January 10 morning and they didn''t give him any medication.

Besides, the third phase of counselling for teachers’ recruitment scheduled from January 17 will also take place,” he said.The minister said the possibility of change in both programmes may arise only if the Covid-19 situation in the state gets grim.The Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) has scheduled Class 12 exams from February 1 to 14 and Class 10 exams from February 17 to 24.BSEB is already conducting practical exams for students of Class 12 from January 10 to 20.“The board is taking precautionary measures to conduct exams safely. A large number of students appearing are likely to be vaccinated before the commencement of the board exams. We have asked schools and colleges to keep track of the vaccination status of examinees. Besides, we are planning to increase the number of exam centres and invigilators to conduct the exams maintaining Covid-19 safety protocols”, said an official of BSEB.Students, however, have raised concern over writing the board exam amid a surge in Covid-19 cases.Deepak Kumar, a Class 12 student, said, “Even the chief minister Nitish Kumar has been tested Covid-19 positive along with other ministers. How can the government assure us the safety of our health? The board is risking the health of lakhs of students by conducting the exam amid rising Covid-19 cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bseb-will-conduct-board-exams-on-time-education-minister-101642092480510.html
13-01-2022||Patna||Row over Ashoka: Bihar BJP chief files case against writer, claims he is not a party member||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Bihar Thursday lodged an FIR (first information report) against Daya Prakash Sinha, a Padma Shree awardee and Sahitya Akademi award winning writer, who claims to be a BJP functionary and is at the centre of a raging row after allegedly showing legendary ancient king “Ashoka the Great” in a poor light in a book written by him. Earlier, BJP’s ally Janata Dal (United) had demanded that Sinha be stripped of his awards. BJP’s state unit president and Lok Sabha MP Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, who lodged an FIR at Kotwali police station in Patna, said Sinha was not a member of his party.In his book, Sinha, a retired bureaucrat, had compared Ashoka with Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, suggesting that both were “cruel” as rulers and had committed “sins”. He reiterated the point in some interviews later.In his complaint, Jaiswal said Sinha has got himself described on Wikipedia page as currently serving as the national convener of the BJP cultural wing. “This fact is wholly incorrect. He is in no manner connected with the BJP,” Jaiswal said in his complaint. He also accused Sinha of spreading hatred among different communities through his interviews.Meanwhile, JD (U), which first raised the matter, on Thursday found support from former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, who said the ancient king was being denigrated because of the “backward” origin of the Maurya dynasty he belonged to.“Asoka is being maligned because he belonged to a backward class. People with a feudal mindset cannot tolerate the rise to power of Dalits, tribals and OBCs,” Manjhi tweeted and urged President Ram Nath Kovind to “withdraw the Padma Shri” given Sinha. Asoka was the grandson of Maurya dynasty founder Chandragupta Maurya, who was born in a family of shepherds and usurped power by overthrowing the discredited but powerful Nanda dynasty. The capital of Maurya dynasty was Patliputra, which is today’s Patna.Sinha has been chosen for the Sahitya Akademi Award this year for a play based on the life of Ashoka, who is said to have shunned violence after a victorious battle against Kalinga which filled him with remorse for the large-scale bloodshed.

While Covid Care Centre (CCC) facilities have 14% occupancy, Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHCs) have 45% occupancy and Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH) have 38% occupancy.“There are around 61 facilities in Navi Mumbai for Covid including both private and corporation’s but the primary five of them being used by us are at CIDCO Exhibition Centre, Radha Swami Satsang Hall, Export House, Mayuresh Building and GD Pol,” Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said.During the second wave, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has been insisting on getting admitted to its facilities as soon as possible to avoid any further complications. But this time, with 90% of the population being double vaccinated, the focus is to get them home isolated and get only 60 years and above patients, and patients with very severe comorbidities to get admitted.“Looking at the trend of cases and the severity, the state government as well as the city task force are of the opinion to not get the patients admitted to the facility unnecessarily. During the second wave, we insisted that everyone above the age of 50 years irrespective of the severity get admitted as the spread was such that suddenly the oxygen level of the patient used to drop. During this time, even the isolation period and admission period is of seven days since the maximum number of patients is asymptomatic or with mild infection,” Bangar said.Patients with severe comorbidities like cancer, uncontrolled diabetes and severe kidney ailments are the only ones being insisted to get admitted. The oxygen demand, too, is around 2-3 tons per day while it was 18-20 tons during the peak of the second wave. In December 2021, the requirement was 1.5 tons to 2 tons. “There is no shortage of oxygen and there is hardly any increase in the demand as well,” Babasaheb Rajale, oxygen nodal officer, said.Of the 17 CCCs, eight have no admission. Of the nine DCHCs, two centres do not have patients in the isolation ward, five centres do not have any patient in need of oxygen, only two facilities have ICU patients admitted and none have any patient in the ventilator. Meanwhile, of the 35 DCHs, 11 facilities do not have any patient in the isolation ward, 16 facilities have no patient who requires oxygen support, 15 facilities have no patients in the ICU ward and around 20 patients in a total of eight facilities require ventilators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/28-beds-occupied-in-navi-mumbai-as-most-covid-positive-patients-in-home-isolation-101642086243665.html

Before assuming office of UP CM after the BJP’s victory in 2017 Assembly polls, he had represented Gorakhpur parliamentary constituency five times in a row from 1998. To discuss elections, VHP general secretary Champat Rai organised a ‘prabudh varg’ (intellectual class) meeting at the RSS office in Ayodhya where senior RSS leaders, those associated with its other frontal organisations and local BJP leaders were also present. Rai emphasized on increasing poll percentage, especially in posh localities of the Ayodhya (Sadar) assembly constituency where voters are reluctant to exercise their right to vote.

13-01-2022||Pune||CSIR-NCL signs licensing agreement with SKYi Innovations LLP||PUNE The CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL), Pune and SKYi Innovations LLP, Pune, signed a know-how licencing agreement for the ‘Process for the synthesis of hyperbranched polymers’ in Pune on Thursday. It is a solvent-free eco-friendly process and involves a metal-free catalyst. The technology is the outcome of research work done by Dr Ashootosh Ambade, principal scientist from the polymer science and engineering division of NCL. “The hyperbranched polymers have different applications. The synthesis process uses commercially available raw materials and generates the hyperbranched polymer in a single reaction step,” said Dr Ambade. “The CSIR-NCL know-how will be used to synthesise hyperbranched (HB) polymer for application as additives for improvement in properties of engineering plastics such as polyamides, polyesters, and other polymers like bioplastics. These polymers can be used in structural applications. The process will help SKYi Innovations to start indigenous production of HB polymer as a part of its ‘Make in India’ efforts since this product is currently imported,” he added. SKYi Innovations is one of the leading manufacturers of long fibre thermoplastics (LFT) globally, with a production facility in India. They have developed different products such as thermoplastics UD tapes for engineering applications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/csirncl-signs-licensing-agreement-with-skyi-innovations-llp-101642084739723.html

13-01-2022||Mumbai||No action against Ashish Shelar for now: State to HC||Mumbai The state government on Thursday assured the Bombay high court (HC) that it will not take any action pursuant to the First Information Report (FIR) registered against BJP MLA Ashish Shelar and would not file the chargesheet till the next hearing. Shelar has filed a petition seeking quashing of the FIR registered against him for allegedly making objectionable comments on Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar in light of a gas cylinder blast at Worli in a press conference on December 4. The court while issuing notice to the police and Pednekar made an oral suggestion that as both Pednekar and Shelar held responsible public offices, they should settle the issue amicably.The division bench of justice Prasanna Varale and justice Anil Kilor while hearing the petition of Shelar was informed by advocate Rizwan Merchant that his client was a sitting MLA representing Bandra (West) constituency and was actively involved in public life. Merchant submitted that if any action was initiated against Shelar pursuant to the report he would be subjected to serious prejudice and hence sought interim reliefs.In December 2021, while interacting with the media, in reference to the Worli gas cylinder blast, Shelar had slammed the mayor for her alleged delayed response in reaching out to the victims. He had asked if Pednekar had been sleeping for 72 hours. The mention of the word “sleeping” had invited sharp rebuke from ruling parties. Thereafter on December 8, Pednekar had filed a complaint against Shelar at the Marine Drive police station. Shelar was booked under sections 354 (A) (4) (sexual harassment) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code.While seeking interim reliefs on Thursday, Merchant said that his client had merely held a press conference pertaining to the unfortunate incident at Worli and said that it was unfortunate that his statement was misled to lodge an FIR. After hearing the submissions, the bench orally suggested, “Considering the factual scenario, the petitioner is MLA, the respondent is also holding a responsible position in these trying Covid times. She is also the first citizen of the city of Mumbai... Why do you not solve it amicably, it will not send a good picture (in public). Such incidents do occur in public life. Responsible persons are also expected to have a choice of words.”Thereafter, additional public prosecutor J P Yagnik for the state on instructions gave an assurance to the court that no steps would be taken pertaining to the FIR including the filing of the chargesheet after which the bench issued notice to the respondents and posted further hearing after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-action-against-ashish-shelar-for-now-state-to-hc-101642083839476.html

13-01-2022||Mumbai||College teachers question mandatory 50% attendance as many test positive for Covid-19||MUMBAI Despite undergraduate and postgraduate degree colleges having been conducting online classes for more than a week now, more and more lectures are getting cancelled because more and more teachers are being diagnosed with Covid-19. As a result over the past one week, an increasing number of teachers have been questioning the need for 50% physical attendance for higher education institutional staff only to eventually conduct lectures online. However, there is no consolidated data on the number of teachers who have tested positive and are currently undergoing treatment for Covid-19.The vice-principal of a south Mumbai college said, “Even though only 50% staff is present in college every day, we have to travel by local transport daily and that is proving to be a big problem. Several teaching and non-teaching staff members across colleges have reported ill and a growing number are testing positive for Covid.”Owing to a surge in Covid cases, the Maharashtra government on January 5 decided to shut down offline classes in state colleges and universities till February 15. State higher and technical education minister Uday Samant said that examinations scheduled till February 15 will either be postponed or conducted online, except for three universities — Gondwana, Jalgaon and Nanded — where power supply is an issue. The state government also decided to allow only 50% of teaching and non-teaching staff to attend colleges and universities on a rotational basis. The announcement was followed by a government resolution (GR) on January 7 as well as an official notification from the Mumbai University addressed to all affiliated colleges to clarify rules and regulations.On January 8, the state disaster management department released standard operating procedures (SOPs) to be followed by different sectors including schools and colleges, which mentioned that schools and colleges have to remain shut except for Classes 10 and 12 and other administrative activities.A senior professor at a suburban college said, “The Mumbai University is only following what the government notification of January 7 says, and insisting on 50% attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff whereas they have completely ignored the January 8 notification. This is putting the lives of several teachers and their families at risk as they are forced to travel by local transport.” He added that in his department alone, four out of seven teachers are currently down with Covid. “Instead of aiding the education sector, such harsh rules are leaving colleges with weaker manpower to run regular classes at present,” he said, adding that he and his colleagues have reached out to university authorities for urgent intervention in this matter but to no avail. While several teachers’ unions have received a series of complaints from teachers across the state, most of whom are facing the same dilemma, no official letter has reached the state government or universities as yet.“The situation is getting worse with every passing day as more and more teachers and college staff are testing positive, and we hope that the government is taking stock of the situation and should announce stricter rules soon,” said a member of the Bombay University and College Teachers’ Union (BUCTU).However, officials at the University of Mumbai said that colleges’ rules and regulations in both the January 7 and 8 notifications are similar. “The physical office has been kept running to ensure regular college and administrative work goes smoothly even though lectures are getting conducted online. If classes can be conducted online, the college can take a call and decide whether teachers need to be present on campus or not,” said an official from the MU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/college-teachers-question-mandatory-50-attendance-as-many-test-positive-for-covid19-101642081501252.html

The accused, identified as Dheeraj Mhatre (35), also a party worker himself, had provided the land to the accused for setting up a unit to manufacture the drug and also with the electricity connection to the land. With the arrest of Mhatre, police say there are people trying to give it a political angle to the whole case.“We have been randomly contacted by people who suggest that we arrest other people from the PWP. Some also name sons of renowned party workers as the accused without any basis. We ask them to provide some proof since none of the arrested accused would have named them. But the people contacting us themselves would not have any proof,” a police officer privy to the investigations said.On December 31, the Crime Branch Unit 3, Anti-Narcotics Cell and Human Trafficking Cell jointly set a trap and arrested Kalim Rafiq Khamkar (39) from Nere village of Panvel. He had come to supply drugs for parties being organised at farm houses. Following his arrest, Zaki Afroz Pittu (33) and Subhash Raghupati Patil (40) were also arrested. The trio was trying to sell MD (methaqualone powder) weighing 2.5kg worth ₹2.53Cr, which was seized by the police. The factory was started in Poynad by the accused for making MD powder. It was raided and sealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-crime-branch-arrests-2-more-for-providing-raw-materials-for-drugs-sold-in-new-year-parties-101642081439372.html
13-01-2022||Mumbai||Two traffic cops arrested for demanding monthly bribe||Mumbai The Anti-Corruption Bureau has arrested a police inspector and a police constable posted at Azad Maidan traffic division for allegedly demanding and accepting a monthly bribe of ₹3,000 from a tourist bus owner.The two police personnel had demanded a monthly bribe of ₹3,000 from the complainant, who has a tours and travels business, to not penalise him for illegal parking of his two buses in the area.According to the ACB officials, police inspector Sheetal Malte, 39, and constable Tushar Chavan, 35, were trapped on Wednesday night. The complainant’s two passenger buses are in daily pick-up and drop service to transport MMRDA employees from Chembur to Cuffe Parade and vice versa. The traffic police since the past two weeks have been penalising the drivers of these two buses for parking the vehicles in no parking zones. To sort out the matter, the complainant on Tuesday went to the traffic division office of Azad Maidan and spoke to Chavan who further instructed him to go and meet his superior, the ACB said.“When he went to meet police inspector Malte in her cabin, she demanded ₹4,000 per month for allowing him to park his two buses in a no-parking area in her jurisdiction,” said an ACB official. As the complainant did not want to pay the bribe, he lodged a complaint with the ACB. After verification of the complainant’s allegations, ACB officials decided to lay a trap. Meanwhile, Malte and Chavan contacted the complainant again and told him that they have reduced the amount from ₹4,000 to ₹3,000 and asked him to meet at the Azad Maidan traffic division office. “The ACB officials caught Chavan red-handed while accepting the bribe of ₹3,000 and as he was accepting the money on his superior’s instruction, Malte was arrested too,” said an ACB officer. Subsequent searches at Malte’s office at Azad Maidan traffic division led to the recovery of ten envelopes that contained cash of ₹4,81,500, the ACB said in a statement on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/two-traffic-cops-arrested-for-demanding-monthly-bribe-101642078558289.html
13-01-2022||Mumbai||Bed occupancy rate rises in Thane by nearly 8% in one week as Covid cases increase||With the increasing number of Covid cases in Thane city, the bed occupancy city has increased from 13.88% on January 6 to 21.47% on January 12.Out of the 20,703 active cases, only 968 are admitted while 19,735 people are in home isolation. The civic officials have claimed that more than 50% of those admitted, especially on oxygen and ICU beds, have not taken a single dose of Covid vaccination so far while the remaining are senior citizens or those with comorbidities.Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has two Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH) in the city – Parking Plaza and Voltas Company – with a capacity of 3,697 beds. Around 19% of these beds are occupied at present.At the four Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC), there are 810 beds, of which 32.6% are occupied, 15.9% of the ICU beds are filled, 12.8% ventilator beds and 6.3% oxygen beds are also occupied.The need for hospitalisation is less in the third wave compared to the first and second waves as most of the vaccinated population have mild symptoms and can be home isolated. However, as per the health department, most of those admitted in the ICU or on oxygen support are not vaccinated.An officer said, “As per the recent bed status, it is seen that there is a rise in admission of mild cases at the Covid Care Centres. A hike of 17% is seen in these admissions. Comparatively, there is a 3% increase in oxygen beds, 5.4% in DCHs, 7.2% in ventilator beds and 8.2% in ICU beds.”He added, “Fifty per cent of the total patients admitted in ICU have not taken a single dose while few have taken one dose. We also have two young patients in their late teens and early 20s who are not vaccinated and currently admitted to ICU. The other patients who have taken both the doses and are still in ICU are either senior citizens or those with heavy comorbidities. We appeal to the residents to get vaccinated, so as to avoid complications.”TMC has vaccinated around 25.36 lakh beneficiaries till date, out of which 14.40 lakh have taken the first dose and 10.95 lakh, the second. Over two lakh people still have not taken a single vaccine dose in the city.Dr. Santosh Kadam, president, IMA, Thane, said, “Most of the vaccinated people including doctors and medical professionals have tested positive in the third wave. However, the only relief is that the infection is mild and chances of complications are less. There are negligible patients who are fully vaccinated and critical in Thane as of now. Most of them in ICU or on ventilator support are those who are not vaccinated.”Meanwhile, TMC has intensified the drive against those not wearing masks at public places including near Thane railway station. The civic employees are also announcing on loudspeakers in market areas reminding people to wear masks. In the last five days, the corporation has fined 150 people in this market for not wearing masks and collected a fine of ₹75,000 from them. An officer from Naupada Kopri ward said, “We have also sealed five shops for violating the Covid protocols and a fine of ₹5,000 was collected from each shop and they were allowed to open.”
13-01-2022||Mumbai||HC to pronounce order on Nitesh Rane’s bail application on Monday||Mumbai The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday concluded the hearing of the anticipatory bail application (ABA) of MLA Nitesh Rane, who was booked in an attempt to murder case at Sindhudurg in December 2021. The court will pronounce its order on Monday.Opposing the application, the state government said that there was no political vendetta involved and it had evidence of a conspiracy wherein Rane’s involvement came to light after the arrest of another accused. Hence, the application should be rejected. After hearing all sides, the HC directed that the interim arrangement would continue till Monday.While hearing the arguments, the single-judge bench of the HC was informed by special public prosecutor Sudeep Pasbola that Rane’s claim that the FIR was an act of vendetta due to the catcalls incident of December 23 outside Vidhan Bhavan was not valid as the attempt to murder incident happened on December 18 and Rane was issued notice on December 21.Pasbola further submitted that the attempt to murder case is not the first and there are six such cases involving Rane as he is an influential person in the area. He said that the police had strong technical evidence to show the contact between the accused. He added that during interrogation Sachin Satpute, an arrested accused in the case said that Rane had contacted him through another accused. On being asked about the assailants and the Innova vehicle used by them, Pasbola informed the bench that though the entire conspiracy was in and around Kankavli, the assailants were hired in Pune along with the vehicle and brought to Kankavli and the police had the evidence to prove it. Pasbola stated that such a modus operandi was adopted by Rane in other instances too. In light of these submissions, Pasbola said that Rane’s custodial investigation was necessary to establish that it was a criminal conspiracy and who paid the money and if they have hired hitmen.Responding to the arguments by the state, senior advocate Niteen Pradhan for Rane said that the premise of the FIR and conspiracy for the alleged contract killing in light of the bank elections was nothing but a figment of imagination. He said that the claim of the police that the arrested accused had revealed that conspiracy was hatched in August was far-fetched as the date of the elections was not announced till then.He further added that as the bank election was hotly contested and Shiv Sena leader Satish Sawant was its chairman and his party was in power in the state. Due to political rivalry between Sena and BJP, many persons from outside came to Kankavli, but it did not mean that they were there as part of some conspiracy. In light of these submissions, he reiterated that Rane’s application should be allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-to-pronounce-order-on-nitesh-rane-s-bail-application-on-monday-101642078439723.html

13-01-2022||Lucknow||UP Police expose another criminal conspiracy for party ticket||LUCKNOW The UP Police claimed to have exposed a criminal conspiracy of a woman politician from Sultanpur, who was eyeing a ticket from Congress party from an assembly constituency of Sultanpur district. Cops said she was trying to gain sympathy to make her claim stronger for the party ticket. Reeta Yadav, 35, and her two accomplices – Mustakeem Ahmad and Dharmendra Yadav – were arrested on Thursday for scripting a false story on an attack on her near the Lucknow-Varanasi overbridge under Lambhua police station limits on January 3 evening, said CO of Lambhua police circle Satish Chandra Shukla, in a video byte shared on twitter. In a press note, the Sultanpur police stated that the woman had lodged an FIR under IPC Section 307 (attempt to murder) against two unidentified motorcycle-borne assailants for opening fire on her. Reeta Yadav had sustained bullet injury on the left leg and was under treatment at a local hospital. Police investigation, however, revealed that the “attack story” was self-scripted by the woman politician with the help of her driver Mustakeem, Dharmendra Yadav and two others, including one former village pradhan Madhav Yadav and Suraj Yadav, stated the press note.Subsequently, the police arrested three people, including the woman, and recovered an illegal firearm from Dharmendra Yadav that was used in causing bullet wound to her while efforts were on for the arrest of the other two accused in the case.

The police claimed that the trio hatched the murder conspiracy as Zeba was aiming for the SP ticket from Tulsipur Assembly constituency and Pappu was main the obstruction in it as he was also eyeing the same party ticket from the constituency. Pappu was the former chairman of Tulsipur Nagar Panchayat, a position currently held by his wife, Kahkasha Feroz.

13-01-2022||Chandigarh||‘Shocked and angered’, says Sikh cabbie attacked in US||New York: An Indian-origin Sikh taxi driver, whose turban was knocked off and told “turbaned people, go back to your country” by an unidentified man in the US, says he is “shocked and angered” to be assaulted and that no one should experience such hate.In a statement on January 3, community-based civil and human rights organisation The Sikh Coalition said that New York City resident Singh was physically attacked and berated near his cab at JFK International Airport.Singh had parked his cab at the Terminal 4 taxi stand when another driver blocked his vehicle. When Singh picked up a customer, he stepped out of his car to ask the other driver to move. The other driver attempted to hit Singh with his own car door; he then began repeatedly punching Singh in the head, chest, and arms, knocking off his turban, it said in a statement.The other driver called Singh “turbaned people” and shouted at him to “go back to your country,” according to the statement.“I was shocked and angered to be assaulted for doing nothing but minding my own business. While working, no one should experience such hate. I am hopeful that the police can identify, arrest, and charge the person who attacked me so that I can move forward,” the Sikh taxi driver, identified only as Mr Singh out of respect for his request for privacy, has told The Sikh Coalition.Singh filed a report with the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD) immediately after the incident. The Sikh Coalition said it is currently working to ensure that the report “paints an accurate picture of the attack given the language barrier during the initial conversations.” The organisation’s staff accompanied Singh to a meeting with a detective to provide language assistance and legal support.“We have every expectation that bias will be considered as a factor in this outrageous attack, given the evidence of what the other driver said and did to Mr Singh,” said Amrith Kaur Aakre, Sikh Coalition legal director.According to the most recent FBI data, Sikhs remain in the top three most frequently targeted groups for religiously-motivated hate crimes and bias incidents nationwide.In the Sikh Coalition’s experience, taxi and rideshare drivers in particular are at a heightened risk of these kinds of violent attacks, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shocked-and-angered-says-sikh-cabbie-attacked-in-us-101642077600549.html

13-01-2022||Mumbai||Not just Panje, there are no wetlands in entire Uran Taluka: Uran tehsildar||Even as environmentalists have been raising issues of mangroves destruction and debris dumping at Panje in Uran, which they call a wetland, Uran tehsildar Bhausaheb Andhare has vehemently denied the allegations and stated that not just Panje but the entire Uran Taluka has no wetlands.CIDCO has leased around 3,000 acres of land in Dronagiri node to Navi Mumbai SEZ in 2006-07 that includes 523 acres of land near village Panje, Funde and Dongri and 377 acres of land in Bokadvira commonly termed as “Panje Wetland” by NGOs.Panje land is the largest parcel of land leased to NMSEZ. This is one of the premium lands available with NMSEZ having a waterfront as well as the view of Mumbai skyline. Panje would be accessible from Gateway of India in about 30 minutes by speed boat once the facilities are created.There have been several complaints lately by the greens claiming violation of norms at Panje and attempts to destroy what they call the wetland.Refuting the claims, Andhare said, “Not a single area in the entire Uran Taluka has been notified as a wetland till date. No area of NMSEZ figures in the wetland list as well.“There were salt pans and paddy fields here in Uran previously. Raigad Collector has given an affidavit in the High Court giving a list of wetlands in Raigad District. There is no mention of any such wetland in Uran taluka. CIDCO, too, has repeatedly stated that Panje land is not a wetland.”Andhare claimed that flap gates have been installed in the area to ensure free flow of tidal water from the creek. Water comes in during high tide and then recedes. It has nothing to do with the presence of any wetland.According to Andhare, “The issue here is of the fishing community that wants water flow and also local villagers who want a cricket ground which often results in differences.”Commenting on the complaints by the greens, Andhare said, “Allegations should be based on facts. How can they term the area as wetland when there is no notification to the effect? Every time there is a complaint or allegation, I personally check on them. Blaming the authorities and hyping things will not help. We should all act responsibly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/not-just-panje-there-are-no-wetlands-in-entire-uran-taluka-uran-tehsildar-101642076459340.html
13-01-2022||Dehradun||FIR against BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj for birthday event in Rishikesh||HARIDWAR: A first information report (FIR) has been filed against Unnao parliamentarian Sakshi Maharaj, 66, for allegedly violating Covid-19 restrictions during a function organised in Rishikesh to celebrate his birthday in violation of Covid-19 guidelines.More than 100 people were present at the event held at Shri Bhagwan Bhawan ashram in Rishikesh, many of them without face masks and in violation of social distancing norms, officials said.Rishikesh city police station chief Ravi Saini said the case was registered against Sakshi Maharaj, ashram manager Mahesh Mishra, Amitesh Singh and 47 other people for violation of Covid guidelines under relevant sections of Disaster Management Act and Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).The FIR was filed on the directions of Rishikesh assembly returning officer Apurva Pandey. “We are further seeking details, video footage to identify the (other) people present at the function,” Ravi Saini said.After the cake cutting event at the ashram, Sakshi Maharaj spoke against the action being taken against seers who addressed last month’s Dharma Sansad.“Sanatan Dharma preaches communal and global harmony which seers adhere to. If some seer expresses concern over Sanatan Dharma being targeted, then it doesn’t mean they are against a certain religion or community,” Sakshi Maharaj said.He has not commented about the FIR filed against him and others for the birthday event.Shri Parshuram Akhada convenor Pandit Adheer Kaushik said the practice of filing cases against seers in recent times was a deliberate attempt to malign the image of seers and weaken the Sanatan Dharma. Referring to the case filed for the police for Sakhi Maharaj’s birthday celebrations, Kaushik insisted that it was a spiritual event and not a political gathering.“The election code of conduct is in effect but Sakshi Maharaj was observing his birthday function at an ashram and it was in no way a political event…. We warn that saints will take the agitational route if similar action is taken against seers,” Kaushik said.Uttarakhand Congress vice president Dhirendra Pratap said everyone including politicians should take utmost care to ensure that the model code of conduct is adhered to and comply with Covid guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/fir-against-bjp-mp-sakshi-maharaj-for-birthday-event-in-rishikesh-101642074300009.html
13-01-2022||Pune||Taste of Life: He was the solo toast to Poona brewing trial plan...||“Who, counting from his tale, Liv’d threescore years and ten, Such virtue was in ale, Ale was his meat, ale was his drink, Ale did his heart revive; And if he could have drunk his ale, He still had been alive.” wrote “Old John Randal” of Great Wolford. The men of The East India Company sought the golden sands of the East to repair their broken fortunes; to bury in oblivion a sullied name or to wring, with lawless hand, from the weak and unsuspecting, wealth which they had not the courage or capacity to obtain by honest industry at home. They cheated, they gambled, and they drank. While in those early days India was a sunny land for shady people, there were honest men among the English who desired peaceful trading. They quickly realized that the merchants, soldiers, and officers would find it very difficult to stay away from intoxicating drinks. And hence brewing of liquor on the native land was largely discouraged. The East India Company, eighteenth century onwards, started importing large consignments of malt liquor for their troops, and at very great loss to themselves, as large quantities were often landed from ships in bad condition. In the nineteenth century, after the British had settled themselves in India, a few realised that brewing beer in India would be much economical. The best English beer, Allsopp’s and Bass’s, was in 1850 selling at ₹6 per dozen, bottled in London, and the price per barrel ranged from ₹75 to ₹80. One of the first to lead the petition to let natives and Europeans make malt liquor in India was William Walker, who using the nom de plume Tom Cringle, wrote a letter in a Bombay newspaper, in November 1857, with an elaborate scheme to make beer and ale in Poona. This letter made “John Barleycorn”, a personification of barley and of the alcoholic beverages made from it: beer and whiskey, a popular name and inspired others to make a similar petition. “John Barleycorn is enthroned in our hearts: why not build him a place at Poona, and enthrone him there?..”, Cringle wrote. The East India Company had on one or two occasions made offers of assistance to European residents of Poona to establish a brewery there. One individual did make an attempt in 1838. The court had sent him out a ton and a half of hops free of the British and Indian duties and freight, besides pecuniary assistance; but the brewer knew nothing of “malting”. He got the temperatures all wrong, and the kiln overheated. Cringle thought that brewing could be successfully carried out in India only in vaulted chambers underground. There was a low hill composed of soft decomposed trap, and moorum, or indurated clay, with a scarped face, nearly abutting on the north side of Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy’s river-bund in Poona. In this hill, underground chambers could be made and arched with bricks made from the river clay in the vicinity. He opined that to people in England these underground vaults might be considered as involving great expense, but from the cheapness and abundance of labour, together with materials equally cheap and plentiful, that would not prove so, as the railway works then in progress would have ceased to monopolize labour and to enhance the price of building materials.“If our future brewer is satisfied with the site I have chosen for him, he will have directly in front of, and close to him, soft river – water, which, if it should not possess that full “body” which report says is so essential to the London brewers, let him not despair, as we have plenty of materials and a fitting temperature to give it any “body” required”, he wrote. Cringle believed that in those underground vaults proposed, an equable temperature might be secured for three or four months of the year, either by the natural temperature of the vaults or aided by artificial means well known to all residents in warm climates. The ventilation shaft would carry off all close or heated air caused by the several brewing processes, and through which air would be replaced from outside, admitted through wet “tatties” or not, as required. Unlike the climate of England which was very humid, especially in most brewing localities, the climate of Poona was particularly dry, which would prove highly suited to the brewing processes and could be carried out during the six months from September to the following February. Cringle’s letter tells us that he was well conversant with the climate, geographical conditions of Poona, and the “art” of brewing. He wrote about couching floors, steeping, and kilns in great detail. The barley required for brewing could be imported from Bassara in Iraq, or from Bhawalpore in Sindh; but better barley was grown in Khandesh, at 150 miles from Poona, and the same variety was also grown near Poona, he wrote. Hops pressed into cakes in England could be sent out in tin-lined cases to prevent any losses of aroma. He suggested that hops could be grown in some of “Deccan hill-stations like Sighur” (Sinhgad). Cringle recommended that a small but efficient brewing apparatus, malt in tin-lined casks, after being well dried before packing, be brought from England to Poona to conduct initial trials. When “trial brewing” of beer was ripening, the brewer might then employ himself in trying experiments in “malting” barley grown in Khandesh and Poona. The first brewing trial might be made in “a thick-walled old native palace, situated on the bank of the river at Poona”, he suggested. When Cringle wrote this letter, the Bombay – Poona railroad was nearing completion. Poona was soon going to be in railway communication over the great arterial lines of India. Hence, if a good brewery on a large scale should become practicable, the carriage for distributing ales in covered vans would be equal to anything of the sort in England, Cringle wrote. He ended his letter by making a passionate appeal to European and native men to brew malt liquor in Poona. The letter served as a blueprint for the first brewery in Poona. It is a fine example of how European civilians sometimes took an active interest in industrial reforms in India, albeit for their own benefit. But John Barleycorn could not get a permanent residence in Poona until a few years later. That story is for some other time. Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food enthusiast.

As per the health department data, 2,367 travellers remained untraced till date.The civic body has assigned a helpline number and email ID asking the societies in the first week of December to call or mail them in case there were international travellers in their societies. The corporation claimed that the mobile number has not received a single call while hardly a handful of e-mails were sent.Till January 7 this year, 9,852 international travellers coming into the city were registered with the TMC, out of which 7,485 were traced while 2,367 were not yet traced. The RT-PCR of 5,423 travellers was conducted, out of which the results of 1,105 are still pending and 75 tested positive. Forty eight of these tested positive with the Omicron variant till now while the report of the remaining samples is still awaited.A civic official requesting anonymity said, “We have not received a single call from any of the residential societies informing about any international passenger. In fact, we have sent over 4,000 emails to those who had left their email ID at the airport and could not be traced due to incorrect addresses. Merely 40-50 people have replied. Most people give their international numbers at the airport, due to which we cannot call them on their local numbers, so email is the only option.”He added that some of them stay in the city for two to three days and have already left by the time the officials get a list from the airport. The civic body has appealed to the societies to be more vigilant to curb the spread.
13-01-2022||Kolkata||Sunderbans losing dense mangrove cover, reveals key government report||KOLKATA: The Sunderbans, which is the world’s largest mangrove delta and home to the Royal Bengal Tiger, is gradually losing its very dense mangrove cover, data released by the Forest Survey of India (FSI) on Thursday revealed. Experts said rising salinity levels and the increasing number of cyclones in recent times are together taking a toll on the mangrove forest. It comes as a concern because the mangrove cover acts a barrier against cyclones while protecting West Bengal’s capital city of Kolkata from directly bearing the brunt of storms that originate in the Bay of Bengal. The State of Forest Report 2021 revealed that the very dense mangrove cover in the Sunderbans shrank by two square kilometres – from 996 sq km to 994 sq km - between 2019 and 2021. The delta had a dense mangrove cover of 999 sq km in 2017, which declined by 3 sq km in 2019. “We have to check exactly where the very dense forest cover has gone down. Progressive salinisation is one of the reasons behind the decline in the mangroves’ density. Also, the very severe cyclone Amphan, which hit the delta in 2020, has definitely taken a toll,” said Debal Roy, chief wildlife warden of West Bengal. The southern Bengal delta was hit by two very severe cyclones – Amphan in May 2020 and Yaas in May 2021 – which took a toll on the vegetation. Nearly one-third of the delta was severely damaged during Amphan. The FSI’s report also says that the total mangrove cover, which includes very dense mangrove, moderately dense mangrove and open mangrove, increased from 2,112 sq km to 2,114 sq km in 2021. But this rise has been driven only by an increase in the open mangrove cover, which primarily includes plantation. The moderately dense mangrove cover remained unchanged during the last couple of years. “The rising salinity level in the delta is taking a toll on several mangrove species such as Sonneratia apetala, Nypa fruticans and Bruguiera gymnorhiza, among others,” said Abhijit Mitra, former head of the marine science department at Calcutta University. “Their growth is becoming stunted as they can’t withstand salinity above 20 psu (practical salinity unit). The average salinity of sea water in Bay of Bengal is 33 psu, which is equal to 33 grams of salt in one litre of water. Due to reduced sweet water flow and intrusion of salt water from the sea, these trees are either dying or suffering from stunted growth.” Also Read: Around 8,000 trees to be axed for construction of Greenfield Shamli-Ambala highwayThe Sunderbans forest sprawls over 10,000 sq km covering India and neighbouring Bangladesh, of which 40% lies in India and is home to many rare and threatened wildlife species such as the Royal Bengal Tiger and the estuarine crocodile. In India, it is confined to the southern tip of West Bengal and spreads over two districts – South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas. Experts say the Sunderbans have been shrinking over the past few years and warn that if the trend continues, it could have a disastrous impact on Kolkata as well as on the livelihood of villagers in and around the delta. The very dense mangrove, which acts as the barrier against cyclones and storms, shrank from 1,038 sq km in 2011 to 999 sq km in 2017. In the last four years, it dropped further to 994 sq km. “The Sunderbans’ thick mangrove acts as a bio-shield and saves Kolkata from the direct onslaught of cyclones that originate in the Bay of Bengal. The mangrove also acts as spawning ground for several fish and other aquatic animals such as crabs and prawns on which the locals depend for their livelihood,” Tuhin Ghosh, director of School of Oceanographic Studies in Jadavpur University, had said in an earlier interview. Amphan hit the Sunderban on May 20, 2020 with a wind speed of up to 185kmph. By the time it crossed the mangroves and reached Kolkata, its wind speed was came down to around 130kmph. The state government planted around 50 million mangrove saplings after southern Bengal took a hit from Amphan. In May 2021, after cyclone Yaas struck the state, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said another 150 million saplings would be planted in Bengal’s three coastal districts. In India, West Bengal has the largest mangrove cover, followed by Gujarat, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

Shivakumar said that this was just a temporary break and not a permanent one, emphasising that the protest will resume from the same place. He did not specify when.The decision comes a day after the Basavaraj Bommai-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government finally decided to prohibit participation in the padayatra against the backdrop of a steep rise in Covid-19 infections across the state.

The party on Thursday rolled out its first list of 125 candidates for the polls, which includes as many as 50 women contestants.While announcing Asha Singh’s candidature, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, “Against the government which oppressed them and harassed them in various ways, may she take that power into her own hands and fight for her rights.”Assembly elections in the crucial state that is ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be held in seven phases from February 10 to March 7, it was announced during the weekend.Shortly after Priyanka Gandhi made the announcement on Thursday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “In Unnao, whose daughter was wronged by the BJP, now she will become the face of justice... she will fight, she will win!” The gang-rape of a 17-year-old girl in UP’s Unnao made headlines and sparked protests around the country five year ago. The long-drawn case saw the victim attempting suicide outside CM Yogi Adityanath’s residence. Much later, former BJP member Kuldeep Singh Sengar was convicted for the rape and sent to life imprisonment. He was also found guilty in the death of the rape victim’s father in judicial custody.Other Congress candidates for the coming polls announced on Thursday include Ramraj Gond, who once led the Gond tribals’ legal battle in Sonbhadra, and Congress leader Sadaf Jafar, who was arrested during protests in UP over the CAA-NRC controversy. Also Read: BJP core committee holds marathon meeting.

Cases are increasing but the hospital admission rate has not increased in the same proportion. The hospital admission rate when 27,000 cases are being reported is the same as the time when 10,000 cases were logged. Bed occupancy rate stands at 15%,” Jain said while speaking to reporters.He added that a stable hospitalisation rate indicates that the wave has plateaued in Delhi and pointed out that daily infections might see a decline soon.Jain said that around 27,500 cases will be recorded on Thursday.

13-01-2022||Delhi||Social media propels help for kin of late delivery executive||From businessmen to architects to filmmakers — social media has been abuzz with tweets by people from all walks of life offering monetary help to the family of late Delhi-based delivery executive Salil Tripathi. He was allegedly run over by a speeding vehicle while delivering food last week. The tragic story of Tripathi, who went from being a restaurant’s manager to a food delivery executive due to the Covid crisis also gained the sympathy of filmmaker Manish Mundra. And entrepreneur Tehseen Poonawala tweeted about helping with his son’s school fees. Mundra, who enquired about Tripathi’s family on Twitter, ended up donating ₹4 lakh and inspired many others to follow suit. “When I read the story, It just touched me. I felt bad about the state of things. My intention was not to start a social media campaign but a lot of people got inspired by my tweet and started contributing. Whenever I contribute, I tell the word that this is being done so that more people get motivated and inspired. A lot of people got inspired and started contributing in one way or the other. I was so elated to see that,” says Mundra. On hearing about the incident on news, Delhi-based architect Seetu Mahajan Kohli reached out to the family to extend help. She says: “His family told me how because of this job change, he had to remove his son from his old school. That broke my heart. We’ll get him back into his earlier school. A lot of people are coming forward to help. The wife needs a job as well. We will do whatever needs to be done to stabilise the family,” she says. For Jaipur resident Dr Manita V, who also contributed to the cause, seeing numerous tweets for help is “empowering”. “I saw tweets offering help to the family. It was really inspiring. People had to face a lot of issues during the lockdown. There are some stories that really stay with you and compel you to do something. I used go out and help people, especially in slum areas. But due to Covid-19, I’m unable to. So helping online is a good alternative,” she says. Author Tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter
13-01-2022||Kolkata||HC to hear PIL on conduct of civic polls in Bengal as Covid cases rise sharply||KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court is expected to hear a public interest litigation (PIL) later on Thursday seeking postponement of elections to four civic bodies in West Bengal amid a steady rise in Covid-19 cases. Daily Covd-19 cases shot up to 22,155 on Wednesday with Kolkata recording the maximum number of infections among all the districts. More than 7,000 fresh cases were detected in the Bengal capital. The division bench headed by Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava had on Tuesday asked Bengal’s state election commission (SEC) to brief the court on the latest pandemic situation and numbers. The bench had asked the Mamata Banerjee-led government to inform the court about the positivity rate and the situation of containment zones in the four municipalities where elections are scheduled to be held on January 22, apart from the percentage of the population affected in those areas. Figures released by the state government on Wednesday revealed that while 897 containment zones and micro-containment zones have been earmarked across the state, Bengal’s overall positivity rate was 30.8%. The state’s poll panel had earlier said that elections in four municipalities - Asansol, Bidhannagar, Siliguri and Chandannagar - would be held as scheduled on January 22 and counting would take place on January 25. But with Covid-19 cases rising alarmingly, a PIL was filed by an individual Bimal Bhattacharya, who argued that considering the escalating Covid-19 situation, the civic polls should be postponed. The poll panel has issued some fresh guidelines, which need to be followed during campaigns and on the polling day, to check the spread of the coronavirus. Political meetings can be attended by no more than 250 people at a time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/hc-to-hear-pil-on-conduct-of-civic-polls-in-bengal-as-covid-cases-rise-sharply-101642048555679.html
13-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi: To tackle dengue, MCDs explore an unlikely ally - bacteria||The key to fighting outbreaks of dengue – an annual public health problem for Delhi – may lie in a bacterium found in large swathes of the world’s insect population.With Delhi emerging from its second-worst dengue outbreak last year, the city’s municipal corporations are now planning to carry out a pilot project to deploy Walbochia bacteria to reduce the transmissibility of vector-borne diseases. Dismayed by the public health response to the outbreak, the Delhi high court last month ordered the constitution of a task force headed by commissioners of the city’s three civic bodies to take steps to prevent the Capital from “being infested by mosquitoes”. A senior public health official, who is part of deliberations in the task force, said the local bodies are now planning to deploy Wolbachia bacteria to reduce the spread of dengue during the next annual cycle. Wolbachia is a common bacterium that infects insect species, and in turn, in the case of mosquitoes, prevents them from being infected by (and hence spreading) dengue infections.“The studies on reducing the transmissibility of dengue and chikungunya from aedes aegypti mosquitoes by using the Wolbachia bacteria have shown positive results in countries like Indonesia and Brazil. Similar projects are being carried out in Puducherry’s Vector Control Research Centre (VCRC) from where we plan to seek help. In this method, the mosquitoes are infected by naturally occurring Wolbachia bacteria which results in reduction of dengue virus transmissibility,” the official said, asking not to be named.Delhi recorded 9,613 dengue cases and 23 fatalities due to the infection last year, the latest data from the three municipal corporations shows. The caseload and death toll in 2021 was the highest in the city since the 2015 outbreak that left nearly 16,000 infected and killed at least 60.Multiple research projects have shown that mosquitoes infected by the Wolbachia bacterium don’t transmit dengue, since the replication of the virus is halted. “If a sufficiently large population of mosquitoes is multiplied in the environment, dengue transmission in a given area can possibly be halted. Studies in Indonesia have indicated a 77% drop in cases,” the official quoted above added. The Wolbachia bacterium has been found to occur naturally in 60% of the world’s insect species. While the dengue-causing aedes aegypti mosquito is not one of these species, scientists have, over the years, been able to transfer it into the breed by injecting it into mosquito eggs. A 2020 study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal titled “Wolbachia, a bacterium fighting on our side” said risk have concluded that the bacteria is safe and does not cause any documented harm to human beings. The World Mosquito Program is overseeing disease control efforts using Wolbachia.The Lancet review states that the results have been encouraging. “In Vinh Luong in Vietnam where the releases were completed in 2018 over an area of 2.2 square kilometres, there has been a reduction in dengue incidence of 86%, compared to a neighbouring city with no release of mosquitoes. In Yogyakarta in Indonesia--the site of the first randomised controlled trial involving wolbachia-- a pilot study found that dengue incidence dropped by 76% in the areas where the infected mosquitoes were released,” the study highlights.The approach has been developed by Monash University in Australia while field trials have been carried out in multiple cities. Dr. C. Sadanandane, a consultant at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - Vector Control Research Centre in Puducherry said local strains have been developed by the centre’s researchers from the original strain from Australia. The next, he said, will be field trials to check its efficacy. “We will be able to know the efficacy of the method locally only after the field trials in India. We received the strain from Monash University, from which our own local strain has been developed. We are looking after the colony of Wolbachia laden mosquitoes and it may take some more time to carry out field trials,” he added. In 2017, ICMR signed an agreement with Monash University to work on this method in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhito-tackle-dengue-mcds-explore-an-unlikely-ally-bacteria-101642033477428.html

13-01-2022||Chandigarh||Over 5,000 cases added to J&K’s virus tally in just 11 days||Amid surging Covid cases, Jammu and Kashmir clocked highest monthly infections in first 11 days of January than the past five months. From January 1 to 11, the UT recorded 5,216 infections, logging more cases than the total of any month since August 2021. Of these, 2,909 came from Jammu division and 2,307 from Kashmir. The UT had witnessed 4,438 cases in December, 4,603 in November, 2,819 in October, 4,011 in September, 3,957 in August and 5,800 cases in July.Authorities have said 13 cases of highly infectious Omicron variant have also been found in J&K – five of them in Kashmir valley.Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) on Wednesday advised people to take precautions like wearing masks and avoiding crowds to protect themselves from the new variant.DAK general secretary Dr Arshad Ali said vaccine remains the single best tool against Covid and its variants, including Omicron.“Fully vaccinated people have significant protection against Omicron infection, serious illness and death,” he added. “Those who are unvaccinated should go and get it now. People who are eligible for boosters should take them as soon as possible to protect themselves, their families, loved ones and the community,” the doctor said.January also saw 18 people succumbing to the disease in the UT. The monthly test positivity rate (TPR) – the percentage of tests turning positive out of the total conducted during the period – increased by 220% in the first 11 days of January to reach 0.84% as against 0.26% in December. In the past one week alone, the test positivity rate reached 1.18%. J&K’s Covid task force met under the chairmanship of chief secretary Dr Arun Kumar Mehta on Wednesday in view of the surge in cases. According to a government spokesperson, the task force was told that Jammu and Kashmir has administered 1.94 crore jabs to vaccinate 107% and 101% eligible population with the first and second dose, respectively. “The UT is further speeding up its vaccination drive in the 15-18 age group and has already achieved 32% coverage,” the spokesperson said. Mehta emphasised that Omicron has a growth advantage over the Delta variant and as such requires ardent mitigation and containment measures from an early stage, preferably when the positivity rate breaks out the 10% benchmark. He urged people to remain vigilant since it has a high rate of transmission and can infect a larger group of people over shorter periods. “It remains the social and moral responsibility of every citizen to be responsible for themselves and those around them. They must exercise due diligence against any symptom of infection in the interest of their family members as well as that of society at large,” Mehta said. The UT has conducted 6.18 lakh tests in the 11 days of January at 56,188 average tests daily.The chief secretary directed ramping up of testing facilities in Jammu and Kashmir to conduct over two lakh daily tests in the coming days while maintaining the contact-tracing ratio at 1:15. “At present, the bed occupancy in Jammu and Kashmir is less than 10% and the medical facilities are maintaining a healthy and comfortable state,” he said.The UT is witnessing a steep rise in novel coronavirus cases for the past one week.As many as 1,148 cases were detected on Tuesday, 706 on Monday, 687 on Sunday, 655 cases on January 8, 542 on January 7, 349 on January 6 and 418 cases on January 5. The first four days of January had recorded daily cases ranging between 165 and 199 while in December the union territory had reported 143 average cases daily. ‘J&K figures among top-ranking UTs, states on vaccination front’Jammu and Kashmir has figured among the best-equipped states and Union territories in the fight against the pandemic. It is also the second state/UT in the country to achieve 100% vaccination target of eligible population. The statement has come from director health services, Jammu, Dr Saleem-ur-Rehman to allay the rising fears of the third Covid wave in the region.He has advised the public not to neglect Covid-appropriate behaviour. “We have started witnessing an exponential rise in cases and there is a need to avoid panic and adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he added. He attributed the achievement of record number of vaccinations to close monitoring from the highest level of UT administration led by Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha. “We have more than 84 functional oxygen plants, two 500-bed DRDO hospitals and over 250 ventilator-supported beds. ICUs are available at all district hospitals and sufficient number of beds for Covid patients are available up to the level of subdistrict hospitals,” he added. He said there are sufficient paediatric Covid care facilities as well, including specialised equipment and specially trained paediatricians.

I started picking them up thinking Bhargava may have dropped them. Within 20 seconds, the man opened the rear door, picked up two bags on the rear seat containing our pistols and fled. We realised that the pistols were stolen after several minutes,” he said. Rathee claimed that both pistols were Swiss-manufactured and worth at least ₹4 lakh, while the glasses cost around ₹50,000. Gurugram City police station SHO Ved Pal said it was inconclusive if the shooters were targeted by a thak-thak gang. “We are gathering CCTV camera footage to identify the suspect. An investigation is going on,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-air-pistols-stolen-from-vehicle-of-two-professional-shooters-101642022751955.html
13-01-2022||Kolkata||Constitutional lapse, says Bengal governor as DGP, chief secretary skip two meetings||The acrimonious relationship between West Bengal’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) government and governor Jagdeep Dhankhar witnessed a new low on Wednesday when the director general of police and the chief secretary did not visit Raj Bhawan to explain why the police stopped the leader of the opposition in the assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, during a district tour on January 7. The two officers were summoned to meet the governor at 11am on Wednesday after they skipped the first meeting on Monday.Pulling up chief secretary H K Dwivedi and director general of police Manoj Malaviya for skipping two meetings in three days on social media, Dhankhar on Wednesday called it a “constitutional lapse”. “CS @MamataOfficial DGP @WBPolice ‘boycott’ WB Guv meeting (Re:LOP @SuvenduWB Netai visit) for second time in 3 days - actionable incondonable constitutional lapse by top officials @IASassociation @IPS_Association bearing out observation @India_NHRC in WB ‘Law of Ruler not of Law’,” Dhankhar tweeted. The governor also uploaded a video showing him reading out a short speech on this issue and the chairs and sofas in his chamber lying empty. On January 9, Dhankhar said that an additional chief secretary and a police officer serving under the DGP must meet him with details of the incident since the chief secretary and DGP informed him that they were staying in isolation because of the Covid pandemic. After receiving a report on the incident from the Jhargram superintendent of police, the governor said on Tuesday that he wanted to see an updated written report. He alleged that his directions were not being followed. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Adhikari drew the governor’s attention after he was allegedly stopped by the police from visiting Netai in Jhargram district on January 7 to pay homage to the nine victims of a carnage that took place in 2011 during the Left Front rule. Adhikari was a TMC leader at that time. After his convoy was stopped on the highway, Adhikari accused the government of violating a Calcutta high court order that earlier said his movements cannot be restricted. On Wednesday, Dhankhar alleged that the DGP and chief secretary “damaged the reputation of top services” and violated the “essence of democracy” by not meeting him despite being called twice. “CS @MamataOfficial DGP @WBPolice conduct aggravated by lack of response and habitual defiance of directives from Guv. Rather than ‘uphold the supremacy of the Constitution and democratic values’ these officials @IASassociation @IPS_Association have violated essence of democracy,” the governor wrote in a second tweet. “Constitutionally ordained ‘to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law’ would now ensure that CS @MamataOfficial DGP @WBPolice get into constitutional groove. These officials @IASassociation @IPS_Association have spinally damaged the reputation of top services,” a third tweet said. No government official spoke on this issue on Wednesday. TMC leaders also refused to comment, saying it was a government matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/constitutional-lapse-says-bengal-governor-as-dgp-chief-secretary-skip-two-meetings-101642022452178.html

The department cleared 10 acres of land on which five illegal colonies were allegedly being developed without any permission or license from the government, officials said. They added that and despite repeated warnings, the construction had not been stopped.RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that six houses that were under construction, a property dealer’s office, 25 plinths and boundary walls were demolished. “These colonies were in the initial stage of development and were demolished by the enforcement team after we issued notices to the owners. We again appeal to the buyers to not invest in such colonies as they don’t have any permission and are liable to come under the hammer anytime,” he said.On Tuesday, the enforcement team had carried out a demolition drive in Farrukhnagar, during which it cleared 30 acres of land, on which six illegal colonies were coming up.In a separate development, the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran issued fines worth ₹5,000 each against 25 shopkeepers, who allegedly encroached upon open space in the market. HSVP officials said that if violators continue to encroach upon spaces then FIRs would be registered against them and occupation certificates cancelled.An HSVP official said that residents are filing repeated complaints regarding encroachments in the Sector 14 market and they also observed several violations during their inspection. “Some shopkeepers rented out the gallery and common area in front of their shops to vendors, which obstructs the market and leads to crowding. Action is being taken against violators and videography of the market is being conducted daily,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-town-planning-dept-carries-out-demolition-drive-in-sohna-101642022092072.html
13-01-2022||Gurugram||At 7.5°C, Gurugram witnesses fourth consecutive ‘cold day’||The district recorded a fourth consecutive “cold day” on Wednesday with a maximum temperature of 16 degrees Celsius. Gurugram also recorded a minimum temperature of 7.5 degrees Celsius (°C)--one degree above the normal for this time of the year. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), when the maximum temperature is less than or equal to 16°C in plains, it is considered a “cold day”. The IMD issued a yellow alert for Thursday, predicting cold wave conditions and dense fog in the south Haryana region, including in Gurugram and Faridabad districts. “Over the next three days, there will be no big change in the minimum temperature in the region. [There could be a] rise by two to three degrees after that. Cold day conditions in isolated pockets are very likely over the south Haryana region during the next two days and some parts may witness dense to very dense fog also in the night or morning hours. A fresh western disturbance is also likely to impact the region with scattered rain likely around the weekend,” said Manmohan Singh, director of Meteorological Centre, Chandigarh, a regional centre of IMD. On Sunday, Gurugram witnessed its coldest day of the season so far as the maximum temperature dropped to 14.4°C--six degrees below normal. Meanwhile, Gurugram recorded “moderate” air quality on Wednesday with an Air Quality Index reading of 138 according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4pm bulletin. On Tuesday, the city had reported an AQI reading of 175, also in the “moderate” category. An AQI reading between 101 and 200 is considered “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, and 301 and 400 “very poor”.According to the weather bulletin issued by the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi-NCR, over the next two days, the region’s air quality may deteriorate to the “poor” category as winds coming in from the northwest direction are likely to be relatively slow. The region’s air quality is likely to remain in the lower end of the “very poor” category on Friday, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/at-7-5-c-gurugram-witnesses-fourth-consecutive-cold-day-101642021853484.html
13-01-2022||Gurugram||Gurugram industries body to approach high court over reservation law||The Gurgaon Industrial Association (GIA) said it plans to move an interim application before the Punjab and Haryana high court, challenging the constitutionality of the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, which mandates that 75% jobs in the private sector, for which the monthly salary is ₹30,000 or less, be reserved for domiciles of the state. The GIA said it plans to move an interim application as the hearing in the matter, scheduled for Wednesday, was rescheduled to February 2 and the provisions of the Act, including the reservation, will come into effect on January 15.Vishal Sharma, the counsel for GIA, said they will submit an application in the high court for early hearing as this was a matter that concerns thousands of industries and lakhs of jobs across the state. “The job reservation act comes into force from January 15 and this makes it even more important that our petition is heard in a timely manner. The hearing on Wednesday was postponed to February 2,” he said, adding that the re-scheduling does not affect their petition as they have challenged the constitutionality of the act itself. In the petition filed by GIA last November, it had submitted that the act was against the provisions of the Indian Constitution and also against basic provisions of meritocracy, which was the basis for any industry or business to remain competitive. JN Mangla, president, GIA, said, “This job reservation will make it difficult for businesses and industries to remain competitive in Haryana. There is a shortage of skilled and trained manpower locally,” he said. The Gururgam labour department, which shall be implementing the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, said the guidelines for implementing the act were being framed and once they are released by the state government, the department shall start implementing it. “As soon as the guidelines are released, we will start implementing the reservation,” said Ajay Pal Dudi, deputy labour commissioner, Gurugram. As per the new job reservation law, 75% jobs in factories, industries, privately managed companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnerships, partnership firms situated on Haryana, employing 10 or more persons, have to be given to domiciles of Haryana. The reservation would be for jobs having a monthly salary of ₹30,000 or less. The act was passed by the state assembly on March 2, 2021, and was approved by Haryana governor subsequently. On November 6, it was notified by state labour department and the government said that it will come into force on January 15, 2022. 
13-01-2022||Gurugram||Administration asks migrant workers not to panic due to lockdown rumours||The district administration on Wednesday stated that the Covid-19 situation is under control and that there is no possibility of a lockdown in the city, putting rest to rumours that a large number of workers were leaving the city in anticipation of a lockdown amid the rise in Covid-19 cases. Deputy commissioner Yash Garg urged people, especially migrant workers, not to panic but take precautions.In 2020, thousands of workers had to go back in packed buses, trains or on foot to their hometowns in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and even after the imposition of a nationwide lockdown amid the surge in Covid-19 cases. On Wednesday, Garg said industrial units in the district were functioning normally and the information regarding migration of workers was baseless. “Workers are not going anywhere and there is no need to panic as Covid situation is under control with only 1-2% of the patients requiring hospitalization. The number of patients has increased but a majority of them are in home isolation. We are keeping a close watch on the situation,” said Garg adding that there is no need of a lockdown in the current situation. A visit to Rajiv Chowk, from where buses leave for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, showed there was no exodus like situation. A bus operator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that there was only a minor increase in the number of people leaving the city and it was mostly due to elections in Uttar Pradesh and the marriage season in the next couple of months in these states. “There is no doubt people are scared about Covid-19 but the industrial units and construction sites are open so people will not leave yet,” he said, cautioning that migrant workers are getting anxious. Industrial associations and unit owners in Manesar and Udyog Vihar also said the labour situation was presently normal and they had not witnessed any large scale migration of workers or absenteeism in their units, like what happened in 2020. J N Mangla, president of Gurgaon Industrial Association, said units were working normally. “There is no curb on functioning of industrial units, so the workers need not worry about their jobs. We are keeping a close watch on the situation,” he said. Praveen Yadav, president of Gurgaon Udyog Association, said there is no information of any worker leaving Gurugram from any industrial area. “These rumours are misleading,” he said. Pawan Yadav, president of IMT Manesar Industrial Association, said workers should not pay heed to rumours regarding the lockdown and instead focus on observing Covid-appropriate behaviour. In Udyog Vihar, the industrialists said workers were coming regularly to the factories and there was no trend of missing workers as was experienced in 2020. “We are focussing on Covid appropriate behaviour and social distancing so that units remain functional,” said Ashok Kohli, president of Chamber of Industries of Udyog Vihar. Rajender Saroha, joint secretary of Bhavan Nirman Kamgar Union, Gururgam, said workers are panicking due to the rising Covid cases and the bitter experience of the last lockdown. “They are staying put presently because neither they have money to move nor are there many job opportunities in their native state,” he said. Dileep Kumar, a worker at Rajiv Chowk, said he was going home because of a marriage in the family. “We are scared because of the current Covid-19 situation but will return to work,” he said. 
13-01-2022||Gurugram||Active cases cross 13,000 as Gurugram logs 2,704 fresh Covid-19 cases||As many as 2,704 fresh Covid-19 cases were reported on Wednesday, taking the active case tally in the district to 13,253. The city also reported the death of a Covid positive patient, the second such fatality to be reported this week. Officials said a 66-year-old man, who was fully vaccinated, was Covid-19 positive but died due to comorbidities. On Monday, a 67-year-old Covid patient also succumbed to the viral infection due to comorbidities. Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer, said, “The deceased (reported on Wednesday) was a 66-year-old man, who was suffering from congestive heart failure. The person had tested positive three days ago and was undergoing treatment for cardiac ailments at a private hospital in the city. He was fully vaccinated and had received his second dose in April last year.” According to the health bulletin, 929 people have died of Covid in Gurugram since the beginning of the pandemic. Of the 13,253 active cases (including one active case of Omicron variant), 101 patients are hospitalised while the remaining are in home isolation. According to official data, 1,405 people also recovered in the district. Officials from the district health department said according to the new guidelines from the Central government, a person is declared as recovered, seven days after they test positive, provided they are not hospitalised.On Wednesday, the health department collected 12,329 samples for testing. The district recorded a positivity rate of 21% on Wednesday. As cases continue to increase, health experts said that under-reporting of cases is likely with many people using self-testing kits and isolating themselves without informing the authorities. “There is always under-testing and under-reporting in these kind of cases. Even in the second wave, we were estimating that the actual number of cases was much higher than the numbers that were reported. The availability of self-testing kits leads to further under-reporting because patients, who are isolating at home, are not reporting their tests results to the authorities. So, we are assuming that the actual number of cases is much higher than what is coming to the fore,” said Dr Shuchin Bajaj, an internal medicine specialist director of Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, a total of 21,777 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine were administered, which includes 9,097 first doses, 10,654 second doses and 2,026 precautionary doses. With this, over 4.57 million doses have been administered in the district till now. On Wednesday, 1,809 children were also vaccinated in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/active-cases-cross-13-000-as-gurugram-logs-2-704-fresh-covid-19-cases-101642020831719.html

He was a resident of Uttam Nagar in Delhi.The owner of the bakery, Gurdeep Singh Tuli, registered a complaint against the unidentified truck driver. In the complaint, Singh stated Ali left the bakery around 7am with packets of chapatis to feed cows in a cowshed located in Vasant Kunj. According to police, the accident took place around 8am. The pickup truck driver had allegedly stationed his vehicle on the right-most lane of the carriageway, carrying traffic from Manesar towards Delhi, after one of the tyres of the vehicle punctured. The driver had placed a hydraulic jack below the truck to change the tyre. However, he had not put up any reflectors nor did he turn on the hazard lights, said police adding that the truck driver fled the spot after the accident. “The vehicle was so severely damaged that the body was completely stuck in the car. We had to use a crane to remove the body from the vehicle and then take it to the mortuary in Civil Lines. The bakery owner identified the driver’s body at the mortuary. We have seized the pickup car and investigations are underway to identify and arrest the accused,” said Jitender Singh, assistant sub-inspector (ASI), Gurugram police, who is the investigating officer (IO) in the case.Based on Tuli’s complaint, the police registered an FIR against the unidentified driver under sections 283 (causing danger, obstruction, injury to any person in public way), 304-A (causing death by negligence) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the IPC at the sector 17/18 police station.Following the accident, Gurugram police barricaded the accident spot with traffic cones, and a crane was also used to tow the hatchback.The car was removed around 9am, within an hour of the accident. The accident also resulted in an hour-long snarl between IFFCO Chowk and Shankar Chowk on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, due to which commuters faced a five to 10 minutes delay in their travel time.
13-01-2022||Gurugram||Haryana minister pulls up Gurugram civic staff for being late, absent from work||Newly appointed minister for urban local bodies (ULB) Kamal Gupta asked the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to ask the employees, who were either found absent or came late to office during a surprise inspection on Wednesday, to submit a written application explaining the same. Gupta conducted a surprise inspection at the MCG’s main office in Sector 34 on Wednesday morning and found at least 20 civic officials absent while around a dozen reported late to work. It was also Gupta’s first visit to Gurugram after assuming charge as the ULB minister.“Ever since taking charge, I have been conducting surprise inspections across civic bodies in the state to improve their services and facilities. I visited the MCG office on Wednesday morning and found that some MCG workers were absent, and a few were coming late to the office. After taking an explanation from each of them, we will accordingly take action,” said Gupta during an interaction with the press at the John Hall in Civil Lines.All the 11 municipal corporations in Haryana come under the ambit of the ULB. Though private companies are allowed to work with only 50% staff due to the rising Covid-19 cases, emergency or essential government offices, such as the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), are still operating with full capacity.Just two days after assuming charge as ULB minister, Gupta, on December 31 last year, conducted a surprise inspection at the Panchkula Municipal Corporation and found more than 80% of the workers absent. On the same day, Gupta held a meeting with the commissioner of all the 11 municipal corporations. Following this meeting, MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, on January 3, directed all the civic staff to report to their respective offices by 9am and maintain punctuality among other such directions. According to MCG officials, Gupta reached the MCG office at exactly 9am and checked the attendance registers of the accounts branch, audit, technical, planning branch as well as the offices of senior MCG officials located on the second and third floor of the building. Subsequently, he directed the officials to keep the attendance register and movement files updated.Each MCG wing has its own movement file, in which employees have to fill out the location and the scope of civic work they are covering if they leave office during work hours. Around 9.30am on Wednesday, additional municipal commissioner Rohtash Bishnoi and MCG joint commissioner Sumit Kumar also conducted surprise inspections at the municipal offices in Sector 34 and Civil Lines respectively. Bishnoi found at least 51 employees were not in office while Kumar found at least 10 such staff. Showcause notices have been issued to all the 61 employees. At both the offices, movement files were also not found. “The ULB minister conducted a surprise inspection at the MCG office and directed officials to come to office on time, expedite clearing of files, resolve the grievances of public with honesty and punctuality. An investigation against employees who were absent or came late to office has also been initiated,” said SS Rohilla, public relations officer (PRO), MCG.It is not the first time that a ULB minister has conducted a surprise inspection at the MCG office. In June last year,the then ULB minister, Anil Vij, had suspended two MCG sub-divisional officers (SDOs) for being absent among other such directions. 
13-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Damdami Taksal spokesperson, two former MLAs join BJP||Sikh seminary Damdami Taksal’s spokesperson-cum-media adviser Sarchand Singh Bhangu joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in the presence of Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in Jalandhar on Wednesday. Also, former MLAs Didar Singh Bhatti and Satwant Singh Mohi also joined the saffron fold. Union minister Som Parkash, Delhi MP Hans Raj Hans, state general secretary Jiwan Gupta and others were present. Sarchand said he joined the BJP in appreciation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to resolve the issues of the Sikh community, including ‘punishment’ to the accused of 1984 anti-Sikh riots and opening of the Kartarpur Corridor. Damdami Taksal chief Harnam Singh Dhumma had recently hailed the Prime Minister for announcing December 26 as ‘Veer Baal Diwas’ as a tribute to the martyrdom of Guru Gobind Singh’s younger sons Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh. In reply to a media query on the party’s chief ministerial face, Shekhawat said the party doesn’t have any such tradition. He also attacked Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. “Congress party itself can’t take Sidhu seriously because he can speak against anyone with the same words,” he said. On Enforcement Directorate’s probe against Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia, he said that let the agencies do their work. He said the BJP will soon declare its candidate as the selection process is underway.

The announcement was made by APP’s vice-president Jasbir Singh Dhaliwal at a meeting held in Sarabha Nagar. While Dhaliwal addressed the meeting virtually, APP workers and leaders, including Col DS Grewal (retd), HS Cheema, Kulwinder Singh Walia, Jagtar Singh among others were present during the meeting. BKU (Rajewal) general secretary Parminder Singh Chalaki welcomed the APP leaders into the SSM fold. APP executive member Col Grewal said Dhaliwal was the officiating president of the party after Chhotepur committed a “fraud” by joining the SAD. “Earlier we supported AAP but it also turned out to be the same as the other traditional parties. Chhotepur has also turned his back and now we believe that SSM can bring back the lost glory of the state. Youth is being forced to move out in absence of jobs and the drugs menace is continuously taking a toll on the youth. There are many other issues in the state and we will collectively fight for the betterment of the state,” said Grewal. Chalaki said APP’s merger will strengthen the SSM further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-aapna-punjab-party-merges-into-sanyukt-samaj-morcha-101642018431654.html

Sidhu, who has been propagating his own model, said that political tourist Arvind Kejriwal who was absent in Punjab for four-and-a-half years claims to have a Punjab model. “AAP’s campaign & agenda is a joke on people of Punjab. A list of 10 points written by people sitting in Delhi with zero knowledge of Punjab can never be Punjab Model,” he said in a series of tweets, hitting out at the Delhi chief minister. Kejriwal announced the agenda on his first visit to Punjab after the announcement of poll dates by the election commission. The Congress chief also posted, “Truth is Kejriwal’s model of functioning is ‘Copy-Cat Model’, ‘I am very insecure Model’, ‘Liquor Mafia Model’, ‘Ticket for Money Model’, ‘I am very sorry Majithia Ji: The Cowardice Model’, ‘Writing free cheques model’, ‘Electricity to Ambani’s Model’, ‘450 jobs in 5 yrs model’.” He said the resurrection of Punjab was a serious issue as the lives of three crore Punjabis are dependent on it. “People of Punjab will not fall for these hollow and non-serious agendas. A genuine roadmap which will bring back people’s resources from mafia pockets to people of Punjab is required,” he claimed in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kejriwals-10-point-agenda-is-copycat-model-navjot-sidhu-101642017951761.html
13-01-2022||Chandigarh||Gear up to connect with voters virtually, Sukhbir tells SAD candidates||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday asked the party candidates to gear up to connect with the voters through digital mode. He was addressing the party candidates at a meeting here on Wednesday. The directions came in the wake of the ECI restrictions on physical campaigning in view of the third wave of coronavirus. The Akali leadership apprehends that the restrictions might be extended beyond January 15, leaving little time for the mass-contact programmes. The polls in the state are scheduled for February 14. The party had taken a head-start by announcing candidates ahead of rival parties and started campaigning with the party’s ‘13-points’ and ‘Punjab di gal’ programmes, however, farmers’ agitation forced the party to postpone its scheduled events. The SAD is contesting on 97 seats while it has spared 20 segments for alliance partner Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) whose state president Jasvir Singh Garhi also attended the meeting. The SAD is yet to announce candidates for Mohali, Lambi, Baba Bakala and Amrtisar East. The party president asked the candidates to make arrangements for reaching out to the voters through the social media and take help from the party’s information technology (IT) cell. “We have decided to hold virtual rallies which party president and other senior leaders will address,” said party’s IT wing head Nashattar Singh Gill, adding that the plan and schedule of rallies will be announced this week. Sukhbir will address the electorate of the state at 7pm every evening and it will be streamed live on different platforms. The SAD has also tied up with different news channels to broadcast his speeches and plans are afoot to start conversation and discussions with the different sections of the society. Sukhbir also held discussions on the fast-changing political scenario and took feedback from the candidates on the repercussions of farmer bodies’ political plunge. 
13-01-2022||Delhi||Delhiwale: When Tintin hung out here||Delhi has been visited by many celebs. The Beatles bought a sitar in Connaught Place. Gabriel García Márquez browsed for books in Khan Market. Queen Elizabeth II spoke from Ramlila Maidan. Che Guevara stayed at the Ashoka. Ricky Martin performed at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. Margaret Atwood met fans at the Stein Auditorium in India Habitat Centre.And Tintin… yes! He, too, hung out in our city — his presence lingers across NCR. There’s a Tintin cake shop in Gurugram’s Sector 23A, a Tintin crockery store in Faridabad’s Jawahar Colony, a Tintin cosmetic shop in Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram, and a Tintin food delivery service in Delhi’s Gagan Vihar.Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, a.k.a. Hergé’s redheaded, globe-trotting reporter, accompanied by Snowy (his dog), first set foot in India in the days of the Raj, meeting and rescuing the Maharaja of Gaipajama in ‘Cigars of the Pharaoh’, and in its sequel ‘The Blue Lotus’, meeting Chang Chong-Chen.His first documented sojourn in New Delhi would come while on the way to rescue Chang, in ‘Tintin in Tibet’, when he would spend a full three hours in the company of the pipe-smoking, hard-drinking Captain Haddock. As Tintin celebrates the 92nd year of his debut this week, here’s his Delhi itinerary.Landing at PalamArriving at Palam, Tintin disembarks from a plane bearing the registration number VT DAO. A few years ago, BBC journalist and Tintin fan Soutik Biswas snooped around to discover that “the number belonged to a Seagull II hang glider owned by a sugar factory”. Whatever, Tintin obviously flew on Air India because his plane had our Tricolour painted on it.Destination WillingdonSoon after landing, Tintin is informed that the flight to Kathmandu (spelt ‘Katmandu’ in the comic) will take off from Delhi’s other airport — Willingdon. The Viceroy, who reigned from 1931 to 1936, was fond of commemorating his family and himself with a hospital (now ‘Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital’), ‘Lady Willingdon Garden’ (‘Lodi Garden’) and even ‘Rattendon Road’ (now ‘Amrita Shergill Marg’), named after his son. Willingdon ‘aerodrome’ was India’s second and Delhi’s first airport, and was home to the Delhi Flying Club. Sanjay Gandhi took off from there before plunging to his death in a crash in 1980. Closed for all flying activity since 9/11, Willingdon is now known as Safdarjung Airport.Tintin in MehrauliTintin visits the Qutub Minar in Mehrauli, and says aloud: “It’s 238 feet high.” That’s all!Tintin in ShahjahanabadTintin’s next stop is Red Fort, where he, Haddock and Snowy hobnob with smiling Dilliwalas. Tintin wants to visit Jama Masjid and Rajghat, but with their flight departing in 25 minutes, the group thinks it prudent to head to Willingdon. (21st-century commuters can only sigh wistfully at the thought of streets so uncrowded that one could drive from Lal Qila to Safdarjung in 25 minutes.) They then look for a taxi in a packed bazaar. No name is mentioned, but since they were at Red Fort moments earlier, it’s almost certainly Chandni Chowk. A gateway at the far end supports this premise as it seems to be the entrance to Fatehpuri Masjid.As any Dilliwala would have told them, it’s insane to look for an airport-bound taxi all the way from Chandni Chowk. Haddock tries to step over a cow blocking the way, and the annoyed bovine then runs off with him on her back. The runaway pair passes through crowded lanes, one of which certainly is Chawri Bazar — the western wall of the great Jama Masjid is easily visible.Eventually a Sikh cab driver drops them at Willingdon, where they get on the plane to Kathmandu, and via Patna, onwards to Tibet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-when-tintin-hung-out-here-101642017193124.html

13-01-2022||Noida||Noida: Six from private developer booked over misconduct with revenue officials||Noida: Police booked six officials of a private developer in Noida on Monday for allegedly holding a revenue officer and two other officials hostage in the lift of a building, which they were supposed to seal, for one hour on January 5 this year.Ram Krishna, naib tehsildar (deputy revenue officer) of Dadri, said in his complaint that he and the two officials of the revenue team went to Supertech Limited’s E Square project site in Noida Sector 96 on January 5, in connection with a recovery notice, police said on Wednesday.“Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UPRERA) issued a recovery notice of ₹112 crore against the developer last year. We went to seal the 24th and 25th floors of the building on January 5, as the developer had not cleared the dues. We were inside the lift on the 4th floor along with the security guard of the building, when the developer deliberately switched off the power supply, and we were stranded inside the lift for one hour,” Krishna said.He also said that they struggled to get out of the lift but could not. “We could have fainted inside the lift as there was no ventilation... We informed our seniors, who reached the spot and rescued us,” he added. The developer allegedly played the same trick twice in the past -- on September 17 and December 30 last year -- too, Krishna mentioned in the FIR.Officials of the revenue team sealed the premises later that day, and filed a complaint against six officials of the private developer who have been involved in the project, including the chairman of Supertech Limited, RK Arora, at the Sector 39 police station on January 5. A case has been registered against the six suspects under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 342 (wrongful consignment), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) on December 10, said Rajeev Kumar, station house officer (SHO) of Sector 39 police station. “We are investigating the matter and action will be taken soon,” Kumar said. A spokesperson of Supertech Limited, however, said, “The lift malfunctioned due to some technical issues. We called the technicians and rescued the people from the lift.”RK Arora was not available for a comment, despite several attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-six-from-private-developer-booked-over-misconduct-with-revenue-officials-101642016751026.html

Challa Sidhu, along with his aide Vicky, had come to the Lehra Khana village for the bhog ceremony of his relative. Unidentified persons opened fire at them at entrance of the gurdwara and fled from the spot. Sidhu and Vicky, who sustained bullet injuries, were rushed to a private hospital, where they were declared brought dead. Bathinda SSP Ajay Maluja said the police had started investigation and prima facie, the crime appeared to be part of a gang war. “Manpreet Singh, alias Challa Sidhu, was a close aide of gangster Kulbir Naruana, who was murdered last year. Vicky was also a member of Naruana’s group. Our preliminary investigation shows that there were three to four assailants, who came in a Skoda car. They fired 12 rounds at them with .30 pistols; both were killed on the spot. There was no crossfire as no weapons were recovered from the deceased,” he said. In July 2021, gangster Naruana and his accomplice, Chamkaur Singh, were shot dead at his house in the village by the same name in Bathinda. After Naruana’s murder, Challa Sidhu had taken over charge of the gang. SSP Maluja has formed 15 police teams, under his supervision, to trace the murderers. “Police are investigating all possible angles. We are checking all rival gangs, who could have done this, and if this has any link with Naruana’s murder as well,” he added. A case has been registered against unidentified persons under Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC and Sections of the Arms Act at Bhucho police station. 
13-01-2022||Chandigarh||Anganwadi workers, helpers court arrest in Karnal||A week after their show of strength, hundreds of anganwadi workers and helpers courted arrest in Karnal on Wednesday.Amid Covid-19 restrictions, the protesters from different districts of Haryana reached Karnal’s mini-secretariat and courted arrest after a brief protest march.The sloganeering women were taken into police vehicles and Haryana Roadways buses as heavy police deployment was made around the venue of their meeting.The protesters had accused Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar of backtracking on the promises made to them on several occasions.Anganwadi Workers and Helpers’ Federation president Usha Rani said thousands of anganwadi workers and helpers reached Karnal to court arrest as the government failed to fulfil the promise on their demands.The protesters alleged that Khattar had announced in 2018 during the assembly session to give skilled workers’ status to anganwadi workers and unskilled workers’ status to helpers.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also announced to raise the wages by ₹1,500 for workers and ₹750 for helpers in 2018 Diwali, but the promises have not been fulfilled even after three years,” they alleged.Last month, the state government had announced that representatives of anganwadi workers held a meeting with the chief minister and agreed to end the protest following an assurance on financial incentives for workers and helpers, including a retirement benefit of ₹1 lakh for the workers and ₹50,000 for the helpers.The CM had also announced a hike in the monthly honorarium and an additional Covid-19 incentive for the workers and a promotion policy. But the members of two other unions of the anganwadi workers and helpers refused to end their protest and have decided to continue it until their demands, including regularising their jobs, are accepted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/anganwadi-workers-helpers-court-arrest-in-karnal-101642016451612.html

The work of filling of soil is likely to start by April this year.However, farmers whose lands fall near the highway are complaining that this will divide their fields into two pieces and they will have to travel kilometres every day.“Earlier, we did not know much about the project but they have installed pillars in the width of around 60m. Now, we came to know that the government will construct a highway which will separate our fields and villages,” said farmer Manoj Kumar, of Radaur, whose three acre agriculture land is being acquired for the highway.Also, there are around 140 building structures to be demolished as they come between the highways but the officials associated with the project said most of these buildings are small tubewells and farm houses. There are no residential areas coming in the way of the highway.NHAI Ambala project director Virender Singh said, “The process of acquisition of this project of the Tarai belt is under process in Haryana. It will be completed by March whereas in UP, we are in advance stage as the initial ground work has been completed in both Shamli and Saharanpur districts.”On felling of nearly 8,000 trees, he said, “There are no forest trees. Most of the trees are located on link roads as there is no notified forest area being acquired for the highway and even the structures are small.”“We have already written for the public hearing for environmental clearance. The process for tendering will start soon after completion of the land acquisition,” he added.

13-01-2022||Noida||Spike in Covid infections may impact voter turnout in Noida, say psephologists||With the number of active Covid-19 cases continuing to rise rapidly, and with experts predicting the present infection wave to peak either in the last week of January or the first week of February, political analysts believe that the pandemic surge will affect the voter turnout in Noida assembly constituency, which is primarily an urban segment, as compared to the other two assembly segments of Dadri and Jewar in Gautam Budh Nagar district.However, officials engaged in election duty are more optimistic and said they are doing their best to make sure that the polling percentage remains high in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, for which voting will be held in seven phases, starting February 10. The districts of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad in the National Capital Region (NCR) will go to vote in the first phase on February 10, as per the schedule announced by the Election Commission of India.Poll officials said Covid-19 positive persons and senior citizens, who are 80 years of age or above, can vote via postal ballots from their homes. “We are making efforts to make sure that the polling percentage remains high amid the Covid-19 surge. Voters who are Covid-19 positive and the elderly may opt for postal ballots with the help of booth level officers (BLOs), who will facilitate the process. The BLOs will make a list by going door to door so that such people can cast their vote safely,” said Suhas LY, district election officer and district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar. District police chief Alok Singh said he has directed all staff to follow Covid-19 protocols during the poll process. “We have directed the staff to follow social distancing, wear masks and strictly adhere to all precautions. And the staff have a duty to make sure that all follow these norms for their own safety and that of others during the poll process,” he said.Gautam Budh Nagar on Wednesday reported 2,230 fresh cases of Covid-19, making it the highest single-day spike since the beginning of the pandemic nearly two years ago, according to the latest figures released by the district health department. The tally of active cases is now 9,267, the data showed. “And the number of Covid-19 cases may further increase manifold by February 10,” said a health official, requesting anonymity.In the 2017 assembly elections, the polling percentage in Noida constituency was 49%, the lowest in the three segments; Jewar saw 66% polling while Dadri recorded a polling percentage of 61%.“Being an urban seat, Noida traditionally witnesses lower levels of polling and that in itself is not encouraging. Urban voters should also actively participate in the polling process for a vibrant democracy. But as the election commission is making all efforts to increase the poll percentage, those efforts may result in increased polling this time,” said Rajiv Gupta, educationist and principal, Government Degree College, Noida.The administration said social distancing will be maintained at all 698 polling booths in Noida, but some voters are still apprehensive of crowding and long queues at polling booths. “If there is no crowding at the polling booths, then one can comfortably go and vote. We hope that discipline will be maintained this time. If there is a mob-like situation, with no social distancing, then I will not go to vote,” said Hansraj Singh, a resident of Sector 61. 
13-01-2022||Delhi||AAP, BJP spar over Delhi civic body move to lease out heritage property in Mehrauli||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) criticised South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s (SDMC) policy to lease out heritage properties or buildings which, the municipal corporation claims, have been deteriorating in the absence of repairs and maintenance. As part of the plan, SDMC decided to lease out one such 280sqm property located in Mehrauli area. AAP MLA Atishi on Wednesday alleged that BJP-led SDMC is “selling historic buildings of Delhi to the private mafia”. She said that the Delhi government can take care of all these buildings.SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan said that there is a house tax office in the Mehrauli municipal property. “AAP is lying to the people of Delhi by saying that we are selling the property. The said property is being rented out. It is being done through a transparent process of open tendering. There is no question of corruption or selling these properties. It has become a daily habit of AAP to make one baseless allegation and to move on the next allegation. Our house tax office is running from this property and there is no harm if we rent it out for generating more revenue for corporation,” he added.Atishi said, “If the BJP-led MCD cannot care for the heritage and legacy of Delhi then they should hand it over to the Delhi government. The government will not just take care of all the historical buildings but will also increase tourism in Delhi. The corporations want to sell all the properties of MCD before the April elections.” Prem Chauhan, leader of the Opposition from AAP in SDMC, said that the project is a scandal larger than corruption as it involves selling the history of Delhi. MLA Atishi said that the auction of this heritage building is now on the agenda of the South MCD standing committee. “BJP has now decided to sell every MCD property, asset, and the heritage of our city before April,” she added.The SDMC on Tuesday decided to grant licences to interested parties to use these buildings for commercial activities for a period of 20 years, with the stipulation that the licensee bear the entire expenditure on account of renovation, modifications, maintenance and upkeep of the property for the duration of the licence period, officials in the know of the matter said.This is the first time that the SDMC is exploring the possibility of auctioning these heritage properties and buildings -- some of which are as old as 400 years -- to private parties for upkeep and maintenance.A senior official of the heritage conservation committee said the SDMC has a total of 475 heritage properties under its control, of which some are as old as 400 years. “Some important sites include the 250-year-old Hauz e Shamsi (water reservoir), 100-year-old house tax building, 150-year-old St Thomas Church and 350-year-old malaria office near Lodi mosque in Mehrauli. Besides these, the Dilli Darwaja of Najafgarh, Purana Darwaja of Badarpur, Shroff hospital and Zeenat-ul Masjid in Daryaganj and the Hauz Khas pond in the Deer Park are more than 100 years old,” he said, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-bjp-spar-over-delhi-civic-body-move-to-lease-out-heritage-property-in-mehrauli-101642015550905.html

We found out that the cheated money was transferred by a man named Satish Kumar to the account of another person named Shubhan Khan,” said DCP Tayal.The officer said that on Tuesday, police received a tip off about the two men running a call centre in the area of Mehendra Park near Rohini after which they conducted a raid.“A total of 28 persons were working there. During interrogation, we found out that the gang lured people by claiming to offer loans under a Central government scheme. The gang has cheated more than 1,000 people in the last two years gaining huge amount by wrongful means. They used to change the address regularly to escape from legal action,” added DCP Tayal.Police said the four main leaders of the gang were Jahangirpuri residents Subhan Khan and Diku; Yogesh Mishra, who lives in Mukundpur; and Sunita Sharma, a Ghaziabad resident. Police said they have recovered 19 cell phones, 4 computers, one laptop and ₹83,000 cash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fake-call-centre-busted-in-outer-delhi-s-budh-vihar-28-arrested-101642015494572.html
13-01-2022||Other||BJP, PLC and SAD (Sanyukt) reach agreement on 65 seats||Chandigarh The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), former CM Captain Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa’s Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) on Wednesday reached an agreement on the allocation of 65 seats to contest among themselves in Punjab assembly polls. The decision was arrived at in a co-ordination committee meeting of the three parties held in Chandigarh on Wednesday. The assembly has 117 seats.Of 65 seats, the BJP will field its candidates on 41, the PLC will contest on 17 and Dhindsa’s party will fight on seven. Of 23 seats that, traditionally, the BJP used to contest, 20 are still with the saffron party, it is learnt. For all ex-MLAs that have joined the BJP recently, seats that they have contested as a convention, have also been finalised. The seats on which the PLC has staked strong claim include Amritsar North, from where former minister Anil Joshi has contested for the past three assembly polls. He has quit the BJP and will be contesting on a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) ticket this time. The meeting of the co-ordination committee was attended by Amarinder’s son Raninder Singh, BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma and Parminder Singh Dhindsa. PLC has successfully staked claim in at least five seats in Patiala, Capt Amarinder’s home district, where the party probables have already started campaigning. Seats like Dirba, Jaito and Khemkaran assembly seats have been given to Dhindsa’s party, sources said. A detailed discussion was held on fielding party candidates using each other’s symbols on some seats. The state BJP also held an exercise, in Jalandhar for now, to take feedback from local leaders on finalising the candidates. Local leaders were asked to give names of three probables of their choice from a particular seat. The BJP, it is learnt, is also ready to leave five seats for Ludhiana-based Bains Brother’s Lok Insaaf Party and according to a senior party functionary, there are strong chances of an alliance being formally announced over the next two days. The BJP’s first list of candidates is expected to released not before January 20, a senior party functionary at the helm of affairs said.
13-01-2022||Noida||Parties shortlist poll candidates as resume submission, interviews get over||As political parties gear up to release the final list of their contesting candidates, most say that the process to decide the names took about a year -- beginning with the submission of prospective candidates’ biodata and ending with the screening process, which is currently in the final stages.The Uttar Pradesh assembly election is scheduled to be held from February 10 to March 7 in seven phases. Ghaziabad will go to the polls in phase 1 on February 10. Under phase 1 of the election, candidates are to begin filing their nominations on January 14. The last date to file nominations is January 21; nominations will be scrutinised on January 24, and the last date of withdrawal of nominations is January 27.Ghaziabad has 2,899,484 eligible voters as per the latest electoral rolls, comprising 1,605,081 men, 1,294,214 women and 189 transgender persons.A member of the Samajwadi Party (SP) said they collected about 40 resumes of prospective candidates about 8-10 months ago and are likely to release the final list of candidates for the assembly seats of Ghaziabad district--Loni, Muradnagar, Sahibabad, Ghaziabad, Modinagar and part of Dhaulana, which is in Hapur district-- within a week.“These resumes were submitted by prospective candidates about 10 months ago. They sought candidates’ personal information and their contribution towards leading party activities, protests and the probable winning formula they think will make them stand out,” said Rahul Chaudhary, SP president, Ghaziabad.He said that the party is primarily banking on the agenda of development and also how developmental projects during their earlier regime were allegedly not taken forward.“In Ghaziabad, the Metro projects were taken up during our government and have not inched forward till now. Even overbridge at Hindon river could not be completed after five years. So, people have seen the development process. Our main fight is with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the development agenda,” he added.The BJP office bearers, however, said that there has been multifold development during their government’s tenure since 2017 and they will take their activities a step forward this time.BJP leaders said they received 52 resumes of prospective candidates.“The resumes include those of all sitting MLAs. For Sahibabad, we received resumes of 17 people, including one of the sitting MLA. Likewise, we received eight resumes, including that of the sitting MLA, for the Ghaziabad seat. The party has shortlisted about 3-4 names for each assembly segment. The list is likely to be out within a week and our main fight is with the SP,” said Sanjeev Sharma, city president of the BJP.There have been speculations that the party may replace some of its sitting MLAs with new candidates across the state.Sharma said that the central committee of the party is in charge of deciding the allotment of tickets to sitting MLAs.“The party’s central committee decides this in consultation with the state unit office bearers. We have a strong IT cell presence in UP and a wide outreach,” he added.Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) officer bearers said that they have already finalised three candidates from Loni, Sahibabad and Muradnagar while two candidates from Modinagar and Ghaziabad will be finalised soon.“We received about 20-25 applications for seats in Ghaziabad and called the prospective candidates to Lucknow for a detailed interview. Their applications were shortlisted and the prospective candidates were also called to Delhi for a screening. The process has been on for the past two months now. Our main criterion is to choose a candidate who has a strong presence and can carry forward policies of the party. We have already released the list of three candidates from Ghaziabad and the names of the other two will be finalised within a day or two,” said Tarunima Srivastava, state spokesperson of AAP.“We are working vigorously to select candidates for seats which go to polls during phase 1 and 2 in the state. After a lot of calculation and thought process, we have decided our promises for people of UP and most of the policies which were implemented in Delhi will also be rolled out here,” she added.She added that the party considers BJP its main opposition.Congress workers said that they received about 26 resumes initially, and more later on.“The party has planned to give 40% seats to women and--we plan to announce two women candidates in Ghaziabad. The list is likely to be released after January 14,” said Ashutosh Gupta, media coordinator for the party’s city unit.

In a press conference, held after the meeting of its core committee, the party’s top decision-making body, senior leadership of SAD alleged, “AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal is releasing anthems and even paid news to insult and demean Punjabis as well as project himself as the saviour of Punjab.”“Party tickets are being sold with a breakaway faction of the AAP giving proof of sale of 35 party tickets,” alleged SAD leader Prem Singh Chandumarja. He added that the Punjabis are a proud community and will never accept the imposition of outsiders like Raghav Chadha, in the same manner in which they rejected the duo of Durgesh Pathak and Sanjay Singh in 2017.Balwinder Singh Bhunder, Sikander Singh Maluka, Maheshinder Singh Grewal and Daljit Singh Cheema also addressed the press conference. “Previously too, Kejriwal had insulted Punjabi leaders like Suchha Singh Chhotepur, HS Phoolka and Sukhpal Khaira. Now, for the past six months, he has made Bhagwant Mann beg to be anointed the AAP’s CM face,” Grewal claimed. According to SAD leaders, Kejriwal had also insulted farmer organisations and their leaders, with Balbir Singh Rajewal the prime example. “AAP started negotiations with the farm bodies and even indicated that Rajewal would be its CM face. However, they withdrew saying that they had got two surveys done which had made it clear that Rajewal and farm organisations would draw a blank,” Cheema claimedChandumajra and Bhunder also pointed out how the AAP and Kejriwal have consistently taken anti-Punjab and anti-Sikh stance. “The application for setting free Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar, a 1993 bomb blast convict, was not being signed by Kejriwal. His government moved the Supreme Court for diversion of waters of Punjab to Haryana and Delhi. It also called for closing down the thermal plants of Punjab in the apex court besides calling for registering criminal cases against farmers for stubble burning,” added Grewal, asking voters to reject the AAP on February 14, the polling day.“Why is AAP leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema considered to be a misfit to be made the CM face? It is because he comes from a Scheduled Caste community,” Grewal claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kejriwal-insulting-punjabis-by-dubbing-himself-a-saviour-sad-101642014710873.html

13-01-2022||Mumbai||Goa polls: Sena prepared to go solo if talks with Congress fail: Raut||MUMBAI: With only a month to go for the Goa assembly polls, the pre-poll alliance talks between the Shiv Sena and Congress have not materialised and the Sena has chalked out plans to go solo if the talks fail. The Uddhav Thackeray-led party has prepared to contest 16 seats in Goa in a bid to increase its electoral presence outside its home state.On Monday evening, Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray helmed a virtual meeting of senior party leaders, including Sena MPs Sanjay Raut and Vinayak Raut, and minister Uday Samant to discuss the party’s plan for Goa which goes to polls on February 14.Last week, Sanjay Raut held a meeting with Congress leaders from Goa, including the leader of the opposition Digambar Kamat, AICC Goa-in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao, and state Congress president Girish Chodankar to forge an ‘MVA-like alliance’ in Goa. However, according to senior party leaders, the talks did not materialise owing to differences over seat-sharing.Raut however maintained that the talks between the two parties have not broken down yet. “With regards to seat-sharing, we had sought five seats from the Congress. They were ready to give about three seats, including Priol and Porvorim but we wanted Mapusa and Pernem which are close to the Maharashtra border. But it was not possible for them. They had already released the list (of candidates) on some of these seats,” said Raut.The Sena leader further added, “We are prepared to go solo, but I can firmly say that our talks have not ended with the Congress... We still feel that the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena must contest together to keep the BJP out of power. We are still trying. If not, we are ready to contest 16 seats.”A senior Sena leader said that the seats sought by the party were those where the Congress was weak and had never won. “We sought seats which the Congress never won in the last 50 years. The Congress will not win these seats in the upcoming elections as well. It was a good proposal (from us) not to waste those seats,” a Sena leader said.Sena leaders said that the local leadership of the Congress painted a very different picture about its strength and ability to win before the central leadership. “The local leaders of the Congress still think that they are in a better position in Goa. They still think that they can come to power on their own, so why divide the power. That is the sense I got through our discussions. But our discussions have not broken down,” Raut said.The Goa election is expected to be an interesting one as besides the traditional parties, Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) too have entered the fray. The Nationalist Congress Party, which has some presence in the state, will also be fielding candidates in the elections. Raut said that the main contest, however, will be between the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). AAP and TMC will ‘reduce’ the Congress’ chances in the upcoming election, he said.

13-01-2022||Chandigarh||AAP’s decision to give Sahnewal ticket to Congress turncoat Hardeep Mundian ruffles feathers||At a time when opposition parties are taking a dig at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for poaching their leaders and giving them tickets to fight the upcoming state assembly elections, it has now come to fore that this has led to resentment within the party as well. A section of the AAP leaders are up in arms against the party’s decision to give Hardeep Mundian a ticket from Sahnewal constituency. Mundian had recently joined the party fold after quitting the Congress,At least five others, including Pardeep Khalsa, Baljit Grewal, Rachhpal Singh, Gurcharan Singh and Parminder Singh, all holding offices in the state and district unit of the party, have objected to the party’s decision to give him a ticket. Terming Mundian a corrupt leader, the leaders are said to have registered their resentment with the party high command. Pardeep Khalsa said, “He (Mundian) had joined the party around 3-4 months ago and now he has been announced as the party candidate from Sahnewal constituency. He was initially with the Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) and had joined Congress after the party came to power in 2017 and now he has come to AAP.”“Five of us from the constituency have submitted our demand to the party high command to change the candidate. We are not demanding that the party ticket be given to any one of us, the high command can choose any other volunteer also. But Mundian is a corrupt leader and has been changing parties for his vested interests. He should not have been given the party ticket and we have urged the party to reconsider the decision,” said Khalsa while adding that if the party fails to change the candidate, then they will chalk out a further action plan.Meanwhile AAP state spokesperson Ahbaab Grewal said the decision to allot the party ticket is taken by the high command. Even if some workers and office bearers are against the decision, they should submit their objections at the party-level rather than opposing the high command’s decision and the candidate in public.Four of the five candidates announced in Ludhiana by AAP are turncoat leaders. These include Daljit Grewal from Ludhiana east, Madan Lal Bagga from North constituency, Kulwant Sidhu from Atam Nagar and Ashok Prashar Pappi from Ludhiana central. AAP worker Rajinderpal Kaur Chhina has been announced as candidate from South, while no candidate has been announced from Ludhiana West. Mundian was unavailable for comments despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aaps-decision-to-give-sahnewal-ticket-to-congress-turncoat-hardeep-mundian-ruffles-feathers-101642014355094.html
13-01-2022||Lucknow||Main parties in Uttar Pradesh yet to release manifestos||The main political parties in Uttar Pradesh are yet to release their manifestos for the seven-phase state assembly elections that will begin on February 10.However, the parties have already organised hundreds of public rallies and meetings to woo voters before they begin the digital campaign due to the Election Commission having banned physical rallies in view of Covid-19.The Rashtrya Lok Dal (RLD), a minor player in the state’s politics, is the only party to have come out with a manifesto apart from the Congress that has brought a manifesto only for women so far.In a democracy, political parties are supposed to fight elections rallying behind their manifesto, laying down policy priorities and positions to help voters make their informed choices before they go to cast their vote.The two major parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP), are still working on their manifestos while the Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP), the third most important player, has publicly announced that it does not believe in manifestos. SP spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said the party is preparing its manifesto and would publish the same very soon.“Otherwise also, our leader Akhilesh Yadav is already telling people about the plans the party will execute after coming to power,” he said.The BJP has a different argument for the delay in bringing out its manifesto or “Lok Sankalp Patra”.“Our seven-member committee set up for the purpose is working hard on the manifesto,” senior BJP leader Vijay Bahadur Pathak said.The party, according to him, put up drop boxes at 30,000 places across the state to get public feedback on what they wanted in the manifesto.“We will finalise our manifesto on the basis of public feedback even if it may take some more time,” Pathak added. Political observers say that electoral manifesto is an important document or a vision statement not only for the people to make choices, but also for academicians and journalists to make analysis and keep political parties reminding of promises they made to voters.“Publishing a manifesto in any election in a democratic country is a time-honoured activity that political parties are expected to undertake,” said Shashi Kant Pandey, professor and head of the department of political science, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University. “It is unfortunate that most political parties show a casual approach to manifesto and do not bring out the same well in time,” he added. The electoral manifestos, he further pointed out, had of late, lost much of their relevance too because of political parties often making unrealistic promises to people despite knowing that they have little chance to come to power or will not be able to keep those promises even if they form the government at all. The positive side of this, however, he added was that it helped change the political discourse in the larger public interest.“For example, every political party in UP started focusing on issues related to women after Congress leader Priynka Gandhi made a number of promises, some of them unrealistic too, to woo women,” he said. “But in any case, political parties must bring out manifestos much well in advance and not sit over the same till the polling begins,” he suggested
13-01-2022||Mumbai||BMC aims to track home test kit buyers||Mumbai: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday said that it will write to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asking them to give directives to all chemists in the city to compile and share data of people buying Covid-19 home test kits.The BMC said that it intended to contact individuals to ascertain the results after procuring this information from chemists. The decision was taken in the backdrop of concern that a large number of positive cases in the city are going unreported as many are not revealing their test status after testing positive in the home testing kit.According to BMC officials, around 300,000 to 350,000 home test kits for Covid-19 have been supplied to Mumbai in first 10 days of this month. However, the results of only around 98,000 individuals who have conducted home tests have been declared to the civic body.Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “We have got some rough figures and do not know how reliable they are but we are planning to develop a mechanism to ensure all those doing home testing for Covid-19 report to authorities. We will write to FDA on Thursday asking them to ensure all chemist owners in the city provide details of those purchasing home testing kits.”Kakani added, “After getting this data, we will have our 24 ward war rooms to contact those individuals whose results in unknown. We once again request all citizens testing positive in-home kits to report their status so that they can get timely medical assistance.”According to BMC officials, after purchasing the kits, individuals are asked to report their results status by using mobile app of manufacturer who in turn report to authorities. Those who do not update the app would be contacted specifically.By the end of the week, the civic body is likely to issue a detailed circular that would cover home test kit sales, even on e-commerce sites, officials said.As many as seven self-test kits have been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) including Coviself by Mylab, CoviFind by Meril Diagnostics, PanBio by Abbott among others. These kits are affordable for the middle class, and range anywhere between ₹250 to ₹350.“We have witnessed a jump of almost 700% sales of our self-test kit in Mumbai in the last one week. Self-test kit is turning out to be highly beneficial given the massive increase in cases because people can get tested quickly and immediately isolate themselves,” Hasmukh Rawal, managing director and co-founder of Mylab Discovery Solutions that manufactures Coviself, told HT on Sunday. According to reports, nearly 500,000 such kits were sold in Mumbai last week. Prasad Danave President of Retail and Dispensing Chemist Association in Mumbai said that many chemists are already tracking buyers. “We have already informed our members to take down the mobile number of buyers who are purchasing home testing kits for Covid-19. We do not have any problem in giving the data but those buyers who want to hide such details, will go online and buy from e-commerce websites. These e-commerce websites do not need FDA permission, so authorities will have to figure that out.”Meanwhile, experts point out that timely reporting of positive results to authorities from home testing kits become important to get registered and getting timely results. Dr Madhav Sathe, former microbiologist professor with Nair Hospital said, “The government should develop some mechanism to ensure that there is proper compliance of those getting tested using these home kits report their results with the government to ensure timely treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-aims-to-track-home-test-kit-buyers-101642014352314.html
13-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi govt to reimburse expenditure incurred by low-cost schools towards EWS students||The Delhi government on Wednesday allocated funds for the reimbursement of expenditure incurred by low-cost schools towards EWS students for the 2020-21 session. According to the Right to Education Act, private schools are required to reserve admissions for 25% of their seats in entry-level classes for students from the EWS/DG (disadvantaged group) category, for which they are reimbursed by the government. In a circular issued on Tuesday, the directorate of education’s planning branch outlined that it had allocated budget for reimbursement of child expenditure claims to private unaided recognised schools. The DoE also asked its Deputy director of education (DDEs) in various zones to expedite the process of reimbursements. The development was welcomed by stakeholders. Chandrakant Singh, general secretary of Private Land Public Schools Trust, an association of around 2,000 budget schools in the Capital, welcomed the order. Singh had lodged a complaint with the lieutenant governor (L-G)’s office to highlight the financial constraints that budget schools were facing due to the non-payment of reimbursement.“The DoE has allocated a huge amount to reimburse ours bills for the session 2020-21. Now, most of the bills will be cleared soon. We had written a letter to the L-G office in December last year in this regard,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-reimburse-expenditure-incurred-by-low-cost-schools-towards-ews-students-101642014235026.html
13-01-2022||Chandigarh||‘Drugs for vote’ in Punjab: HC asks EC to detail measures taken by it till Jan 20||Chandigarh: To check use of “drugs for vote” in Punjab state assembly elections, the Punjab and Haryana high court has asked Election Commission of India (ECI) to detail measures taken by it by January 20.The former chief election commissioner stated with respect to the 2012 elections that in one month alone, the recovery of around 55kg of heroin and around 430kg of poppy husk was made in the state and that almost every psychotropic substance was found in circulation during elections, justice Pankaj Jain observed, adding that in the background of the fact that the elections already stand notified and that there have been incidents of ‘drugs for vote’ in elections in Punjab, the court took suo motu note of the issue.Justice Jain took note of the issue while dealing with a bunch of drugs seizure-related matters with his senior judge Ajay Tewari. He also sought details from the Punjab government on steps being taken by it. The court sought information whether there was any scientific study on the menace; whether areas identified and whether state went into reasons for the same and time it may take for such an exercise.“Pictures showing gold smoked mustard fields with the proud prosperous farmer used to showcase this land of five rivers. Today, Punjab is related to a portrait of wailing mothers holding corpse of their sons who died of drug overdose as well,” justice Jain observed referring to the stats which came presented during the hearing of the case. It had come to light that 16,000 appeals related to drug-related matters are pending, mainly from Punjab, in the high court.More than the burden of these appeals what weighs in is that over the years, the number of cases has not shown any decline, the judge said, adding that on an average more than one appeal per day is coming before the court. “This makes out a case for state to look beyond deterrent measure in the form of NDPS Act and evolve reformative measures as well, Justice Jain underlined.The court also referred to a prologue “the case for a new economy” in David Korten book ‘Agenda for a New Economy’, wherein a man jumps into a stream and saves a baby coming down stream. He saves it but spots another. It goes on like this but the main totally focused on saving babies, never thoughts to look upstream to check where are the babies coming from.Justice Jain observed that it is a welfare state and it has a role bigger than mere policing. “State of Punjab apart from registering cases, needs to wake up to the challenge. The malady has gripped the society. It cannot afford to be in a state of inertia.. Time has come for the society and the State to look upstream,” justice Jain observed further stating that some individual efforts were being made by public spirited citizens, but the menace by now is beyond the individual efforts and these efforts now needs to be integrated to respond to this ailment.

The victim, a 40-year-old mother of three, had gone missing about 8pm on Tuesday, after being dropped at the bus stand in Maloya by her husband. Police have registered a case of murder, but has not ruled out sexual assault. The postmortem report is awaited.The two heinous crimes against women — Maloya woman’s murder and a Kolkata woman’s rape in an auto at Sector 17 — have surfaced at a time public movement is restricted in view of the Covid-19 surge and increased police presence is expected to enforce the night curfew and other curbs in the city.The police control room got a call around 9:25am on Wednesday, after a passerby spotted the Maloya woman’s body lying in the bushes. Sources said socks were stuffed in victim’s mouth to ensure she could not make any noise. The listless body was rushed to Government Multi Speciality Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, to confirm death. It has been kept in the mortuary, and the exact cause of death would be known after postmortem. Meanwhile, a case has been registered under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code at the police station in Maloya.

But when he returned after sometime, he could not find his wife. He along with his nephew searched for her, and about 10pm they approached police with a missing person complaint.“Police told us to wait for about an hour. After we could not find her, we again went to the police station and got a complaint lodged,” he said.Clothes found at a distance, no external injury Cops privy to the investigation said there was no major visible external injury on the woman’s body. However, looking at the condition of the body, they are not ruling out sexual assault. The clothes of the woman were found a few metres away from the body.“We are investigating all angles. The exact cause of death would be clear after postmortem,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh.

13-01-2022||Delhi||HC: How is husband-wife relation different from others in terms of trust?||The Delhi high court on Wednesday sought to know how a fiduciary (trust) relationship between a man and his wife is different from any other relationship involving trust where a person will face sexual assault charges for forcing himself on a woman. A bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar, while hearing a clutch of pleas seeking to criminalise marital rape, said in order to decide on striking down the exception to the rape law, Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the court has to come to a qualitative decision.Exception of Section 375 IPC decriminalizes marital rape and mandates that sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age, is not rape.“You went on the aspect of trust and fiduciary relationship. There are two points you have to answer. One, these words are used in law keeping in mind that the exception is in place…For example, trust in a case where chowkidar in school, teacher or student etc, -- these are one category of trust. Can you say that it is something which is similar to the trust existing between husband and wife in a sexual relationship?” justice Shankar asked amicus curiae, senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao.He further said, “We are concerned with whether this act should be punished as rape. It is not that the legislature was of the view that it shouldn’t be criminally punished. But legislature had taken a decision that it shouldn’t be treated as rape. If we are to strike it down, we have to come into a qualitative decision, that this act should additionally be categorised as rape.”The court is hearing PILs by NGOs RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association and two individuals who have sought the striking down of the exception in the rape law, saying that it discriminated against married women who were sexually assaulted by their husbands.In 2018, the central government, in its affidavit filed, said marital rape cannot be made a criminal offence as it could become a phenomenon that may destabilise the institution of marriage and an easy tool for harassing husbands.On Tuesday, the court observed that married or unmarried, every woman has the right to say “no” and just because a married woman has various civil and criminal remedies at hand, it cannot be a ground to not take marital rape seriously.On Wednesday, amicus curiae Rao criticised the existing rape laws and said, “The silver lining or the complete lack of it is that a woman is better off, as a matter of law, when she is assaulted by a stranger. But when her loved one assaults her, the law says, she is not entitled to call that act rape.” He said that in the context of rape, the question which needs to be asked is whether the court should sit by and watch a provision which aids in the possibility of a woman being dehumanised every day in such a situation.“…every day this act remains in the books, there is a section of the population which is denied the opportunity to call a rape as rape,” he said.Rao submitted that no amount of telling the woman that she can prosecute the husband under ten other provisions of law, can undo the inability that she faces because she is violated by the person who is supposed to be her companion, her husband, her partner, “a person who is in the fiduciary capacity”. He said that law places a premium on relationships and a greater responsibility on someone having a fiduciary relationship.The court also heard the submissions of two intervenors -- NGO Hridey and Men’s Welfare Trust -- opposing the pleas seeking to criminalise marital rape.Advocate Raj Kapoor appearing for the NGO, submitted that the Parliament through debates and considering overall view of Indian society, statutes and punishment, retained the exception to Section 375 of IPC. He also contended that if the exception is struck down, the husband would be in a worse position and may be subjected to harassment.The hearing will continue on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hchow-is-husband-wife-relation-different-from-others-in-terms-of-trust-101642014177963.html
13-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC proposes new project to clear Dadumajra landfill||The municipal corporation has decided to clean up more than 7.5 lakh metric ton (MT) legacy waste, which is not covered under the ongoing legacy mining work, to completely remove solid waste from the Dadumajra dumping site in Chandigarh.The project will cost ₹78 crore and will take at least three years to complete once it kicks off. The Union government will chip in, but whether it would be fully or partially funded by the Centre is yet to be finalised.At present, under a Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) project, nearly 5 lakh MT of legacy waste (pre-2005) is being removed from the site, which is less than half of the total legacy waste at the site. Now, under the new proposal, the rest of the legacy waste will be removed and the entire ground at the Dadumajra will be cleared.The failure to clear this legacy waste had dragged Chandigarh down to 66th position in the latest Swachh Survekshan, and was also a key issue that resonated among all parties and voters during the recently conducted municipal elections.In fact, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which had a majority in the previous MC House, lost all five wards around the dumping site. Its failure to resolve the issue during its five-year stint is being seen as the major reason for this poor showing.Immediately after taking over as the new mayor, BJP’s Sarabjit Kaur said that cleaning up the Dadumajra dumping site was one of her top priorities. Even UT adviser Dharam Pal has maintained that removal of legacy waste is one of his priorities.The dumping ground has led to not only environmental issues, but has also caused widespread health problems in the areas in its proximity. Also, about 40 lakh litres of water had to be dumped at the site to douse multiple fires at the dumping ground in the past six years.Who’ll foot the billFor starting the fresh legacy mining work, the MC is seeking financial support from the Union government. It has submitted a proposal for around ₹78 crore under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM)-2. “Under the SBM-2, for solid waste management, Chandigarh is to get around ₹28 crore from the Centre. We have sought additional ₹42 crore under the mission,” said a senior MC official, who did not wish to be named.On the timeline for the project, the MC official, said: “The project is likely to be started in another six months. It will take at least three years for the project to be completed. The project will also include cleaning up 500 tonne waste dumped at the dysfunctional solid waste processing plant near the landfill.”However, MC officials maintained that full funding might not be forthcoming from the Centre, yet even partial funding, expected to be over ₹40 crore, will help in taking up the project.Delayed clean-upThe ongoing ₹33-crore legacy mining project was launched with much fanfare in December 2019 by the then UT administrator VP Singh Badnore in the presence of MP Kirron Kher. Around 5 lakh MT garbage (pre-2005), which had been lying at the landfill for more than 20 years, was to be biomined and the entire land of about 25 acres was to be reclaimed by May 2021. As only around 2.7 lakh MT (55%) has been removed yet, the deadline has been extended to August 2023, though officials say it is likely to be achieved by December 2022. A number of reasons have been put forward by MC officials for the slow pace of work, but largely the pandemic has been blamed for the missed deadlines. The other major reason cited was monsoon showers.This project doesn’t cover another 7.5 lakh MT waste that was dumped at the site after 2005. The daily generation of solid waste in the city is around 550-600 MT, but with less than 20-40 MT being processed every day at the solid waste processing plant, most is being dumped at the site unprocessed.

We don’t want to disturb the normal life that might affect people’s livelihood.”According to the health department data, of 4,808 active cases in Chandigarh on Wednesday, only 109 people (2.2%) are hospitalised, while 4,610 are isolated at their homes and 89 at mini Covid care centers.Pal also said that instructions have been given to the health department to expand the bed capacity, particularly through opening of mini Covid care centres.Anganwadi centres closedOn Wednesday, the administration closed all anganwadi centres in Chandigarh with immediate effect. However, all anganwadi workers and helpers have been told to report to duty as usual to carry out their field activities.Last Thursday, the UT administration had imposed night curfew from 10pm to 5am and mandated that all bars, cinema halls, multiplexes, malls, restaurants, spas and museums operate at 50% capacity with fully vaccinated staff.Gatherings for any purpose have been restricted to 50 persons for indoor and 100 persons for outdoor events.

13-01-2022||Other||Amid Omicron threat: Elaborate health arrangements in place for Magh Mela-2022||PRAYAGRAJ: Within next 48 hours, the Sangam city will begin playing host to the 47-day annual religious fair--Magh Mela-2022, being seen as the toughest edition of the fair to be held till date due to the rising cases of Covid-19 and its new variant Omicron. The Mela area has already reported 39 positive cases by the night of January 12 which includes 37 policemen and security personnel. However, the officials have made elaborate health arrangements for the devotees, who are arriving here for the first official bathing of the fair on Makar Sankranti (January 14) on the banks of Sangam. “Latest RT-PCR tests declaring an individual to be free from the Covid-19 virus are a must for all including the pilgrims, saints and seers as well as visitors. Just on January 11 we removed 51 individuals from the mela area who did not have the RT-PCR reports with them. We have already informed all not to enter the mela area without an all-clear RT-PCR report,” said chief medical officer, Prayagraj, Dr Nanak Saran. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had chaired Magh Mela-2022 review meetings in run up to the fair—a development that has the officials doubly alert. “In view of the pandemic and the necessary precautions to be taken thereof, we have made proper arrangements of sampling centres and ambulances in adequate number for the fair. Each government staff in the mela is being deputed only after proper screening,” informed Magh Mela Adhikari Shesh, Mani Pandey. For proper hygiene and cleanliness, 15,000 toilets have been built in the mela area. Of these, there are around 1500 pre-fabricated steel toilets, 3,000 tent toilets, 300 urinals, 9,000 institutional toilets and 900 at camps of government institutions, he added. “For the devotees, we have also constructed 10 major ghats stretching from Nagvasuki to Quila Ghat near Sangam in order divert devotees to avoid overcrowding at one place,” he added. Magh Mela Covid-19 Nodal officer Dr Rishi Sahai said that taking note of the challenges, 30 ambulances including 28 with basic life support and two with advanced life support capability have been parked in the mela area, besides two ambulances each for Covid patients in each of the five sectors of the tent city. “A total of 12 static sampling centres will function daylong in the mela area besides 20 mobile testing teams that will be reporting at sites and camps after being alerted by the 82-member surveillance teams set up to identify potential cases and vulnerable points. The mela also has two hospitals of 20-bed capacity each and both have one bed ICU each also,” he shared. The mela area has 16 entry points and all have screening teams in place that are checking the RT-PCR reports of the pilgrims and saints arriving in the mela area. “Those having latest negative RT-PCR reports are only being granted entry into the mela area. At these points we also have thermal scanners. Five thermal cameras too have been installed to identify persons suffering from fever,” Dr Sahai said. Recognizing the challenge that kalpwasis (people who camp in the tents to perform various religious rituals over a month-long period) present, the Mela officials have developed a system where all kalpwasis would be tested for Covid-19 once every week in the camps where they are staying, besides administering Covid vaccines to those who are eligible for a second or a booster dose, he said. Permanent vaccination centres would operate in the Mela area at the two mela area hospitals, besides one in each of the five sectors of the tent city. A doctor would also be available at each of the first aid points (FAPs) that exist in every circle of each sector of the Mela area. Those found Covid-19 positive would be isolated away from the mela area and for which Level-1 facilities including the CHC of Kotwa and Prayagraj Unani Hospital have been identified, Dr Sahai said. 
13-01-2022||Noida||After achieving 100%, UP govt enhances Ghaziabad’s first dose vaccination target||The Uttar Pradesh government revised Ghaziabad’s first-dose target on Wednesday -- the district must now vaccinate 135,330 more beneficiaries against Covid-19.Ghaziabad, last Saturday, completed its target of vaccinating 2,708,975 beneficiaries.With the revised first-dose numbers, Ghaziabad has now achieved 96.29% of its target. According to official figures, the district, till January 11, vaccinated 2,738,860 beneficiaries with the first dose, which is about 96.29% of the revised target of 2,844,305.District officials said that according to new guidelines released by the UP government, all districts should vaccinate beneficiaries with the first dose at least 10 days before the scheduled date of assembly polls.The Uttar Pradesh assembly election is scheduled to be held from February 10 to March 7 in seven phases. Ghaziabad district goes to the polls on February 10 under phase 1. The district, according to the latest electoral roll, comprises 2,899,484 eligible voters.“The revised target for the first dose has been assigned on the basis of voters’ list as new voters have been added. During the past week, vaccination numbers have increased and we will try to vaccinate 100% of the revised figure of first-dose beneficiaries. Likewise, we will also try to vaccinate 100% of children by January 15 as directed by the government,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer.According to officials, there are about 150,000 persons in the district who are due for the second dose but have so far not turned up.“With the rise in cases, it is of utmost importance that more beneficiaries get vaccinated as quickly as possible. It is due to the vaccination that a majority of patients showed only mild symptoms during this present wave,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of the Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter).Vaccination for children in the 15-17 year category also started on January 3 in Ghaziabad. The district is supposed to vaccinate 234,488 children in the category, according to officials.“In case we miss the target, we will finish vaccinating the remaining children in the next couple of days after January 15,” the CMO said.Till January 11, Ghaziabad vaccinated 91,754 children with the first dose, which is about 39.13% of the target assigned to the district.
13-01-2022||Delhi||Of 188 Omicron patients sent to Delhi’s Lok Nayak hospital, 186 recovered: Data||New Delhi: Of the 710 Covid-19 patients admitted to Delhi government’s Lok Nayak Hospital since December, 188 were detected with the Omicron variant, with 186 already discharged, according to the data submitted by the hospital to the Delhi government. The report for Covid-19 preparedness submitted by the hospital on January 10shows that during the third Covid wave (fifth in Delhi) it admitted 710 patients so far, much lower than 15,699 during the first wave (March 2020 to February 2021) and 5,551 during the second wave (March 2021 to November 2021). The report also said that of the total 710 hospitalisations, 188 patients tested positive for the Omicron variant. The hospital added that 186 of these have already been discharged. It said no deaths of the Omicron variant were reported at the hospital. “The hospital stay for Omicron patients is also relatively lower compared to those infected with other variants,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of the hospital. Giving an account of the preparedness of the hospital --- the largest Covid hospital in the city --- the administration said that they have a total of 2,200 beds reserved for Covid patients, of which 900 are in the ICU (intensive care unit) and 1,610 of those with oxygen support. The hospital also had beds kept aside for paediatric cases. According to the report, of total 900 ICU beds, 150 are for children, and of the 1,610 beds with oxygen support, 210 are reserved for children. “To ensure proper care for patients, Lok Nayak Hospital has also filled up the positions of 625 doctors, including consultants, senior and junior residents and specialists, The hospital is also on the way to filling posts for 1,758 nursing staff, 450 paramedics, 1,115 nursing orderlies, 704 sanitation staff and 509 security staff,” the report said. 
13-01-2022||Mumbai||City reports 16,420 cases||Mumbai: The city on Wednesday reported 16,420 fresh Covid-19 cases pushing its daily test positivity rate by six percentage points over the previous day. On Tuesday, the city had reported 11,647 cases; it recorded 13,648 on Monday — a slump usually attributable to fewer tests over the weekend — after recording close to 20,000 cases starting January 6. However, the hospitalisation rate fell for the fifth continuous day on Wednesday to 18.8%. Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal attributed the rise in cases on Wednesday to the Centre’s advisory issued Monday stating that only symptomatic individuals need to undergo tests.“Due to the recent change in the national Covid testing guidelines two days ago, where it has been directed that only symptomatic cases will be tested, it is likely to create spike in positivity as most of the symptomatic cases would be almost confirmed positive cases,” the civic chief said.The test positivity rate (TPR) — a ratio of the confirmed Covid positive cases to every 100 tests conducted — was 28.94% on January 7, when Mumbai recorded 20,971 cases. Since then, it has been on the decline. On January 8, the TRP fell marginally, to 28.60%, and thereafter to 23.03% on January 10. However, in the past two days, it rose again to 18.75% on January 11 and 24.38% on Wednesday.By contrast, the hospitalisation rate on January 8 was 21.4% and since then, it has registered a decline to the current 18.8%. This number refers to the overall Covid beds available in the city, which is a dynamic number. It is important to note that the occupancy of Oxygen beds in the city has increased in the past week alone.According to a new benchmark set by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), bed occupancy rate will be the new criteria to impose restrictions instead of positivity rate. Owing to this, the BMC last week said that bed occupancy rate of 50% would call for thinking towards imposing additional restrictions.On the falling bed occupancy rate, Chahal on Wednesday said, “It is because Delta variant is fast disappearing and Omicron taking over in Mumbai.” According to the December 31 results of genomic sequencing declared by the BMC, 56% of the random positive samples of Covid-19 were confirmed to be Omicron variant. Chahal last week said that experts were of the opinion that 80% of the cases testing positive in Mumbai are the Omicron variant, and in the coming days it may become 100% of all cases tested.“Generally on Wednesday, the backlog is also cleared and this could be reason for increased cases, but we will wait till Friday before deciding the future course of action in city,” Suresh Kakani, Additional Municipal Commissioner of the BMC said.Meanwhile, Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar on Wednesday appealed to citizens to get vaccinated against Covid-19. “Since February 2021, 94% of Covid deaths have been among those who have not taken the vaccine shot. I appeal to all citizens to go out and get vaccinated considering the severity of Covid goes down with vaccination.”The recovery rate in the city is 87% with 832,933 recoveries. The mortality rate in the city is 1.72% and there are 102,282 active cases in the city. As many as 67,339 tests were conducted in the city. The total case tally in the city is 954,237 and the toll is 16,420. The daily positivity rate on Wednesday was 24.38% up from around 18% on Tuesday. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in its advisory dated January 10 had said that symptomatic individuals (cough, fever, sore throat, loss of taste and/or smell, breathlessness and/or other respiratory symptoms), at-risk contacts of laboratory confirmed cases followed by contacts that are elderly (above 60 years) and individuals with co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung or kidney disease, obesity among other things, should be tested. However, this advisory did not restrict self-testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/city-reports-16-420-cases-101642013810875.html

Visibility was around 40 metres at the Sector 39 IMD observatory at 5.30am. Three hours later, it increased to around 150 metres, which is still considered “dense fog” as per the IMD.An IMD official said the fog was the result of drop in night temperature and high humidity following the recent rain spells.Meanwhile, city’s maximum temperature went up from 15.7°C on Tuesday to 17.1°C on Wednesday, but was still four degrees below normal.

The decisions were taken on the recommendations of a varsity panel headed by dean university instruction (DUI) VR Sinha. The panel was constituted to make recommendations after the recent guidelines issued by the UT administration in the wake of the Covid-19 surge.The Student Centre, considered the heart of social activities of students, was earlier also closed after the pandemic broke out in March 2020 and had reopened on December 1. 50% students allowed in labs at a timeWhile the classes are already being held online, in the wake of UT administration’s directions, PU has also directed students to occupy laboratories at only 50% capacity at a time. The first- and third-floor reading halls of the AC Joshi library will also remain closed for the next four days. However, the outer reading hall will remain open, but only at 50% capacity.Heads of departments have been told to prohibit gathering of students and staff, and monitor strict compliance of the safety protocols.For this, university will also regulate the entry and exit points. Since Monday, varsity offices have already been functioning with only 50% staff strength.New restrictions Student Centre to remain closed from January 13 to 16 No student allowed in campus departments on January 13 and 14Only 50% students allowed in a laboratory at a timeReading halls on first and third floors of AC Joshi library closed from January 13 to 16. 
13-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Rise in testing demand leaves labs overburdened, reports delayed||The surging Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh have left testing laboratories in government health institutes overburdened and increased the waiting time for reports.The UT health department is dependent on Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32 and Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) for RT-PCR testing. But as both hospitals collect samples from their own patients as well, sample load has multiplied manifold and so has the waiting time for reports. “After I got symptoms for the virus, I voluntarily got tested at GMCH-32 on Sunday, but did not get my results till Wednesday morning. My testing registration number was also not generated timely, which further delayed my report,” said Vivek Singh, a resident of Sector 40. “We send 400 samples to GMCH-32 and 1,500 to PGIMER on an average daily for RT-PCR testing. Besides, the health department is conducting 30% of its daily Covid tests through the rapid antigen testing kits. Generally, the RTPCR report is available within 12 hours for early morning samples, but when the samples are collected in the evening, the reports are available the next day. Also, it takes time to collect samples, transport them to the lab and update results on the central government’s portals,” said Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh.“We are working hard to ensure that test reports are given in 24 hours. At present, there is no pendency in the testing labs,” she added.‘Glitches in govt portal delaying results’According to Dr Jasbinder Kaur, director-principal, GMCH-32, the hospital can conduct 2,000 RT-PCR tests per day. “But due to some technical glitches, the central government’s portal is taking more time for uploading the test results. As a result, people sometimes get the reports late. But we ensure that reports are given within 24-36 hours,” said, adding that they were working to increase the daily capacity to 2,500 tests.Dr Mini P Singh, nodal officer for Covid-19 testing at PGIMER, said, “The institute has a capacity to conduct 2,500 RT-PCR tests per day and we are conducting tests round the clock. But some staff members are also down with the virus, limiting the number of available hands. We are still managing to give the reports within 24 hours.”‘Adequate facility, GMSH-16 lab to be ready in 15 days’Meanwhile, UT health secretary Yashpal Garg said an RT-PCR lab will soon be set up at Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, so patients don’t need to turn to private laboratories.“The lab at GMSH-16 will be made functional in the next 15 days. PGIMER and GMCH-32 also have adequate testing capacity and there is no pendency. Results are mostly provided within 24 hours, but got delayed recently due to glitches in the government portal,” he said.During the peak of the first and second wave, the health department had to rope in private hospitals for testing after it found itself struggling to keep up with the testing targets fixed by the Union health ministry of Health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhrise-in-testing-demand-leaves-labs-overburdened-reports-delayed-101642013754035.html

13-01-2022||Chandigarh||Panjab University semester exams from January 24, proctoring unlikely||Panjab University (PU) will conduct the theory semester examinations for undergraduate and postgraduate courses from January 24, the varsity announced on Wednesday.The practical examinations will begin on January 17. Both examinations will be held online. This is the fourth time since the pandemic broke out in March 2020 that the semester exams are being held online at PU.The decision comes days after teachers suspended their strike over non-implementation of revised UGC pay scales by the Punjab government. As part of their protest, teachers had suspended all academic activities from December 1, prompting the varsity to postpone the semester examinations scheduled in December.PU controller of examinations Jagat Bhushan said, “The detailed instructions for the forthcoming exams will be issued in a day or two.”The decision to conduct the exams online was taken in December after the student bodies opposed the varsity’s plan to hold them offline. They had also submitted various representations in this regard.Proctoring may be skipped againWhile the university was considering the use of online proctoring during the exams to supervise students, sources said it may not go ahead with it during the forthcoming exams. PU had constituted a panel to deliberate on the technicalities of proctoring as well, but no announcement was made. Proctoring was skipped during the previous semester exams as well, leading to criticism over the sanctity of online exams.Changes in academic calendar plannedWith the examinations being delayed due to teachers’ strike, the varsity is also planning to make some changes in the academic calendar to minimise academic loss to students. Around 45 academic days have been lost and PU plans to minimise it to around 20 days.

The action was taken by senior officials against them after some lawyers sneaked in the court premises and reached near the court of chief justice. The lawyers also created ruckus. On January 2, the high court has issued orders regarding the virtual hearings in view of Covid threat. The security personnel were instructed not to allow entry of lawyers inside the court premises from January 3. However, the security personnel deployed at high court showed negligence following which, a group of lawyers entered inside and raised slogans against the decision of virtual hearings. They even reached near the court of chief justice in protest of restrictions on their entry. High court authorities reprimanded police officials over the negligence following which an investigation was ordered. The enquiry revealed that sub inspector Chhedi Ram and constable Israfil, who were on duty at gate No 3 have shown negligence in informing about the orders to their colleagues. Moreover, sub inspector Suryanarayan Pandey and other cops deployed on the HC premises also showed negligence in duty. Officials said that eight cops who were found guilty of negligence have been suspended. SSP Ajay Kumar said the investigation into the matter was carried out by SP City Dinesh Kumar Singh.

13-01-2022||Noida||Coronavirus test positivity at 11.7% in Ghaziabad, the highest in nine months||The Covid-19 positivity rate of 11.7%, for the week ending January 12, is the highest in Ghaziabad district since April 2021 -- it was 17.34% for the week ending April 30 -- with the district continuing to report cases in large numbers daily, including on Wednesday when another set of 1,581 infections were added, the district health records showed. The officials of the district health department said the upward trend indicates that the current wave of Covid-19 infections is fast approaching its peak and that may happen by the last week of January.According to health records, the overall Covid-19 case count in the district is now 63,723, with the tally of active cases at 7,518. A total of 7,809 cases were reported in the month of January. Of the active cases, 23 patients are admitted to hospitals while the rest are recovering in home isolation, officials said. According to the health department figures, during the week from December 23-29 last year, the district tested a total of 32,420 samples which returned 65 positive cases to give a positivity rate -- ratio of samples that test positive from among the total tested -- of about 0.2%. In the next week, from December 30 to January 5, 36,381 samples were tested of which 787 were positive for Covid-19. The positivity rate that week was 2.16%, the data showed. In the latest week, from January 6-12, a total of 61,124 samples were tested of which 7,149 were positive for Covid. The large number of positive cases has spiked the test positivity rate to 11.7%, the highest rate since April 2021. In the week ending April 30, 2021, the positivity rate was 17.34%.“The pattern of high positivity rate indicates that the cases are headed for a peak, which we estimate will happen by the end of January or the first week of February. Since cases have spiked suddenly, it is estimated that they will also decline sharply. Of the patients undergoing treatment in facilities, seven are requiring intermittent oxygen support,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer. The Ghaziabad district saw its first infection peak in mid-September 2020, during the first wave, followed by another peak in April 2021, during the second and the mostly Covid wave. The positivity rate for the month of April 2021 was 9.12%, with 13,668 total cases, health records showed.As a result of the current spike, the sample positivity rate for the month of January has already risen to 8.96%, the second highest monthly rate since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020. A district health official said they have conducted a total of 87,124 tests this January, which has resulted in 7,809 cases. The positivity rate of private labs is about 47.11%, while that of government labs is 3.31%, the official said, asking not to be named. The official also said they expect a rise in the number of positive cases in the coming days as about 13,000 reports are still pending at different labs, including the one in Lucknow and the results may arrive in bulk. “Since the spike in cases has led to more people coming in for testing, the influx has burdened our labs. So, we have sent samples to Lucknow for testing. The reports are pending and they will arrive soon. Despite the overload, we are trying to release results within 48 hours. Since the government has also revised the discharge criteria for home isolation patients from 10 days to seven days, we will be discharging about 480 patients soon, as per the new norms. So, our recovery rate will also improve,” said Dr RK Gupta, district surveillance officer. According to health department figures, the recovery rate stood at 98.97% on December 31, 2021, and at 87.48% on January 12. “The major advantage during this wave is that the severity of infection is low and it could be due to the high rate of sero prevalence and increased vaccination coverage. The present spike is more likely to be the result of the Omicron variant,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president, Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter).

13-01-2022||Delhi||Lohri 2022: Get gajjak, rewari, home delivered, support local vendors||What’s Lohri without rewari, moongphali or gur patti, gajjak, popcorn and all the other winter special Indian confectioneries? If you are wondering how safe it is to venture outdoors and buy your annual supply of these Lohri specific goodies, amid the rising Covid cases in the city, then fear not! You can refrain from being at any of the crowded place, and yet get your stash as quite a few local vendors are home delivering these.In fact, this might also do good to their businesses, since Covid has immensely impacted their livelihood. Some small yet famous shops tucked in the bylanes of Old Delhi’s Kinari Bazar will sure fulfil your gajjak cravings. One of them is Premchand Gupta from Subedar & Sons (Gajak and Rewari), who can be spotted busy packing orders, which are coming in from across NCR, ahead of the festival. “Hum order phone pe le rahe hain aur phir pack karke tayaar rakhte hain. Bahut saari log delivery app pe riders ko bhej ke saaman collect karwa lete hain. Hum khud bhi booking karke deliver karwa dete hain, aur online wallets se payment bhi easily ho paa rahi hai,” says Gupta, adding, “Har saal log 7-8 kilo ka saaman ek sath le lete the Lohri ke ek din pehle aur Lohri ke din bhi. Iss saal toh dukaan har dusre din khul rahi hai Covid ke chakkar mein toh hum kum maal bana paa rahe hain. Toh sale bhi pehle jaise nahi hui abhi tak.” Ram Sewak, who mans a popcorn cart in Ashok Vihar’s Deep Market, says, “Iss saal toh sale bahut hi kam hai, yeh Corona ki wajah se log bilkul baahar nahi nikalna chahte. Leken Lohri ke time pe kuch aisi cheezein hoti hain jo logo ko leni hi hoti hain sagan ya reet karne ke liye. Toh popcorn ki booking ke liye bahut log phone kar rahe hain. Koi agar humein 8-10 packet ka order de raha hai, to hum unke ghar par jaake deke ayenge usi din fresh. Pichle saal toh hum pura din busy the. Iss saal bhi ho jaye aisa toh badiya hojayega tyohar.” And Rajmani, who sells gajak and rewris on a push cart in the same area, adds: “Dus saal se kaam kar raha hun, par inta kum saaman kabhi bhi nai bika. Iss saal Lohri par hi kuch umeed hai sale hone ki. Online shopping toh sab karte hain, humse bhi shopping kar lein toh humare bachchon ki Lohri achchi man jayegi.”It’s safe to say that peanuts are as important to bring in the Lohri vibe as the peanut chikki/gur patti. Ram Narayan, who owns a peanut cart in Shalimar Bagh, shares, “Main saath saal se yahi par mungphali ki redi laga raha hun. Par pehli baar hai ki Lohri se pehle itni kum bikri hui hai. Itni kam toh pichle saal bhi nahi thi. Vaise toh ahcha hai ki log bahar nahi nikal rahe, Corona bimari ko bhagana zaruri hai. Par hum jaise logon ka kaam sardiyon ka hi hota hai. Isliye ek hi jagah khadhe rehne ki bajaye ab apna number WhatsApp pe bhejna churu kar diya hai logon ko, is umeed me ki shayad log ghar bulake khareed lein.” And amid other hopefuls is Ram Vir, who sells shakarkandi (sweet potato) chaat in Wazirpur. “Har saal Lohri ke time par jab log gajak wagehra lene nikalte hain toh humari banayi chaat ki khoob bikri hoti hai. Pichle saal tak kum se kum 10 kilo chaat har Lohri pe banani padhti thi, aur sab bik jati thi. Kayi log shaam ko Lohri ka function karte the aur humse chaat leke jate the. Par iss saal un sabka aana mushkil lag rha hai... Waise toh mein logon ke gharon tak nahi jaata tha, sab maal yahin bik jata tha, par is bar koi bulaye toh ghar pe garma garam chaat deke aane ko mai tyyar hun! Ab corona zyada hai toh log bhi kaise hi ayenge,” he says.Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lohri-2022-get-gajjak-rewari-home-delivered-support-local-vendors-101642013513045.html
13-01-2022||Other||{Drug seizure cases} Prolonged jail may invoke personal liberty deprivation clause: HC||Chandigarh The Punjab and Haryana high court has ruled that the provisions of deprivation of personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution can be invoked in drugs seizure cases over prolonged incarceration of a person. The bench of justice Ajay Tewari and justice Pankaj Jain was dealing with a bunch of bails and suspension of sentence matters in the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, (NDPS Act) cases of Punjab and Haryana. It had come to light before court that 16,000 appeals were pending in the HC and the conclusion of the same is going to take time. Hence, bails/suspension of sentence pleas be decided, pending final disposal of the appeals.Data shows pending appeals in 2021 as 1,080, up from 57 appeals in 2013 before the division benches. Before single benches, 14,827 appeals were pending in 2021, up from 1,433 in 2013. Then there was this period of almost two years, when due to Covid, hearings remained suspended most of the time.Section 37 of NDPS could not beonly consideration for bail: AppellantsThe appellants had argued that the requirement of Section 37 under the NDPS Act could not be the only consideration for the grant of bail or suspension of sentence. On the other hand, states had argued that as per latest decisions of the Supreme Court, both for bail and for suspension of sentence under the Act, strict parameters of Section 37 had to be met.Section 37 says every offence punishable under this Act shall be cognisable, no person accused of offences in commercial quantity seizures and under some other sections, the accused can’t be released on bail unless the public prosecutor has been given an opportunity of hearing. The court has to satisfy itself of reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty or won’t commit the offence again, before releasing him on bail.Article 21 gives a fundamental right on every person not to be deprived of his life or liberty except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law. Thus, speedy trial is a fundamental right.The court, after examining a plethora of judgments of the SC and various other courts, observed that in the 1994, the SC held that a person who had undergone five years of pre-convict custody was entitled to be released on bail, on the touchstone of Article 21 of the Constitution of India.Though this judgment related to under-trials and only one time directions were issued, however, the directions in no way can be said to be against the legislative intent but are in furtherance of the Constitution of Article 21.“Therefore, it will also not be inappropriate if similar principles are followed with some variations and modifications in cases relating to convicts who are languishing in jails for reasons that their appeals are not likely to be heard for a considerable period,” the court observed, adding that the stringent provisions of Section 37 of the Act have to be applied in the cases of the convict/accused, where their cases do not fall within the parameters of Article 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/drug-seizure-cases-prolonged-jail-may-invoke-personal-liberty-deprivation-clause-hc-101642013510619.html

The state government has removed the use of the drug for those with no-comorbidities although it is showing some positive results in the vulnerable population, said doctors and officials from administration. According to Saurabh Rao, Pune divisional Commissioner, Molnupiravir is being prescribed by treating doctors in Pune while the private hospitals are also making it available to patients. “Till now we have not come across any case of its side effects in Pune.” Rao said adding that so far as its stock is concerned, the FDA has informed the administration that there is no artificial shortage of the drug in Pune and Mumbai unlike what was witnessed about remdesivir during the second wave. Molnupiravir is being produced by over 13 manufacturers in India. According to Dr Amit Dravid from Noble hospital, Molnupiravir was used on about 26 patients and have seen a good result in them. “We used it on patients who are above 60 years of age and have co-morbidities, however not on diabetic patients as some studies suggest it has no real impact on those with diabetes or those who have a re-infection and that the impact could be only due to placebo. The immediate positive impact on the patients was drop in fever, headache and sneezing is also stopped although cough takes some time to go. We use it on patients who have mild symptoms like fever, cough, cold, extreme fatigue, headache but are vulnerable and so are at the risk of the symptoms progressing into moderate or severe. Regarding the side effect the drug does have a minor side effect like nausea and diarrhoea. We are strictly not using it on pregnant women and it is a five-day course and costs ₹500 per dose,” said Dravid. Dr Abrarali Dalal, chief executive officer at Sahyadri Hospital said, “We have used it on about 30 patients and have got good results. The benefits include relief from symptoms and also reduced replication of the virus. The patients we recommend have mild to moderate symptoms like cough and fever, sore throat, who otherwise could be recommended home isolation but due to the age and co-morbidity factor prefer to be admitted in the hospital. The patients are aged between 35 to 70 years of age, with few of them having comorbidity like diabetes and blood Pressure. Although it does have minor side effects like nausea.” Earlier last week, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director-general Dr Balram Bhargava said the antiviral Covid-19 pill is currently not included in the treatment guidelines of the Covid-19 national task force. However, Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) this month gave emergency approval to Molnupiravir as the country witnessed a spike in Covid-19 cases following the emergence of the highly contagious Omicron variant. In Pune, smaller hospitals too were using the drugs and are now reluctant to use it as the current state government recommendations allow using the drug with certain riders. Dr Sachin Yadav, medical director at Chintamani Hospitals in Bibwewadi said, “We has used it on about five Covid19 patients who had mild symptoms like fever, throat pain, cough, weakness and nasal congestion and the immediate impact of the drug is patient reporting as afebrile within 24 hours. There are some minor side effects also like nausea and diarrhoea. Although these patients with mild symptoms can be isolated at home the fear of Covid19 and their vulnerability brings them to the hospital. While private hospitals are using the drug, government hospitals in the district are yet to start the usage. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, Deputy director health services for Pune circle said, “None of the government hospitals in the entire Pune district including both the civic bodies are using the drug as we are in the process of procuring it. since it is only recently that the drug was recommended for the treatment of Covid19 patients with mild symptoms with certain riders. There are about 13 manufacturers in the country and we do not anticipate any shortage for the drug as of now.” Dr Pradeep Awate, State surveillance officer said, “The drug is allowed to be used on Covid19 patients with mild symptoms and those who could progress into severe diseases with certain riders including that it cannot be used on pregnant women, prospective pregnant women and those with non-comorbidity. It is up to the treating clinician’s discretion on whether or not to use the drug.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/molnupiravir-showing-promising-results-among-covid-patients-pune-docs-101642013452255.html
13-01-2022||Noida||Noida towers: Refund buyers or face jail, Supreme Court tells Supertech||The Supreme Court on Wednesday warned the realty major Supertech that its directors will be sent to jail for not complying with the court orders to demolish the 40-storey twin towers of its Emerald Court project in Noida, and defaulting on refunding the money to the affected homebuyers.The two towers were declared illegal by the Supreme Court on August 31, 2021, and the apex court had given three months to the company to demolish the two towers. The court also directed the Noida authority to take assistance from Central Building Research Institute (CBRI), Roorkee, in safely accomplishing this task.With more than four months having elapsed since the order and more than 250 homebuyers yet to get their refund with interest, the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna took a strict view against Supertech and said, “We are going to send your directors to jail. You are playing truant with the Supreme Court.”The homebuyers informed the court that the real estate firm was charging an interest over the refund which was not contemplated in the judgment. Further, the firm agreed to deposit the money in instalments after signing an agreement that would absolve Supertech of all future liabilities, and bar the homebuyers from seeking further remedy from the top court.“We find you (Supertech) are finding all kinds of ruses to avert compliance of our orders. Make sure the payments are made till Monday or else there will be serious consequences,” the bench said.Supertech’s counsel, senior advocate Parag Tripathi told the court that two firms – Edifice Engineering and Genesis Engineering -- were shortlisted for carrying out the demolition and clearing the debris. He said that the plans were forwarded to the Noida authority and the same had to be finalized by the CBRI.Supertech wanted to make CBRI a party in the Court proceedings but the request was turned down by the court after the Noida authority counsel Ravindra Kumar informed the court that the real estate firm was to be blamed for delaying the implementation of the court’s order. “Initially, Supertech submitted the proposal of Edifice Engineering and the firm made a presentation in which CBRI representative was present. For final approval, we sent it to CBRI. Then, Supertech submitted a second plan by Genesis Engineering on January 9 . We forwarded the same to CBRI on Tuesday.”The court told Kumar, “We will not hear CBRI. Let the Noida authority take a decision and make a statement on Monday.”Supertech said it was agreeable to either of the two agencies for carrying out the demolition.Homebuyers have also filed contempt petitions against Supertech for failing to abide by the court’s August 31 order.The August judgment said, “The appellant (Supertech) shall within a period of two months refund to all existing flat purchasers in Apex and Ceyane (Towers 16 and 17), other than those to whom refunds have already been made, all the amounts invested for the allotted flats together with interest at the rate of 12% per annum payable with effect from the date of the respective deposits until the date of refund.”Advocate Abraham C Mathews, representing some of the affected homebuyers said, “The judgment awarded interest to be paid till the date of actual payment by Supertech. However, they have made calculations on interest to be paid only till the date of judgment.”He added that Supertech has also made impermissible deductions in amounts calculated as payable to the homebuyers, by claiming interest on amounts paid as return of investment (ROI) previously. “The court has not permitted any such deduction,” he said.Earlier, the court resolved the difference in the amounts demanded by the homebuyers and Supertech by appointing advocate Gaurav Agrawal as amicus curiae who formulated a mutually acceptable figure that was approved by the court’s judgment.Abhishek A Rastogi, Partner at Khaitan & Co. said if the demolition is due to the fault of the builder, then certainly the home buyers deserve expedited refunds. “The proceedings against such defaults to expedite refund to homebuyers will certainly boost confidence of consumers and would help the genuine real estate businesses in the long run,” he said.The two towers facing demolition have 915 flats of which 633 were booked. Of them, only 252 flat buyers remained as 133 homebuyers re-invested in other Supertech projects while 248 took a refund.The order to demolish the towers came on a petition moved by the Emerald Court Owner Resident Welfare Association objecting to the construction of the two towers on an area marked as ‘green area’ in the brochure issued to them at the time of purchase. Also, the distance between the two towers was not in accordance with the minimum distance criteria under the relevant by-laws.Following the SC decision, Supertech made a last-ditch effort to save its towers by proposing to partially demolish 224 apartments in tower T-17 along with the community area at the ground floor without touching the other tower T-16.The top court dismissed this application on October 4, as it said that the only recourse available to Supertech was to file a review petition and not seek modification of its order through an application.Subsequently, Supertech filed a review petition which is yet to be considered by the top court. The UP government has also ordered a probe by a special investigation team (SIT) to examine the nexus between the builder and bureaucrats that led to approval for the two illegal towers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/noida-towers-refund-buyers-or-face-jail-supreme-court-tells-supertech-101642013450775.html
13-01-2022||Mumbai||Govt employees to work in shifts||Mumbai: Employees of the Maharashtra government have started working in two shifts to reduce footfall in the Mantralaya as part of the state’s efforts to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The state legislature has started staggering the hours of its 820 employees between two shifts, from 9 to 3pm and from 1 to 7pm.The General Administration Department (GAD) issued an order on Monday to stagger office hours to two shifts — from 9.45am to 5.45pm and from 10.15 am to 6.15 pm shift — and asked heads of departments to issue further orders on which shift their employees will be part of. More than 5,500 personnel work in various departments in the Mantralaya. Indra Malo, secretary, GAD said that the government departments were free to change the timing as per their requirement. “The GAD order is an advisory to other departments, which are free to make changes to reduce the attendance. Some of the departments have started doing it, while some have asked the employees to come to the office on alternate days. The order is open to the suggestions and changes in the future if the need be. We are minutely following the norms and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” she said.On January 8, the state government imposed curbs, including a night curfew, to prevent the spread of the pandemic. “The head of the department should ensure rationalising of the employees by promoting work from home and staggering working hours depending upon the requirement of the employees. The heads should consider the flexible working hours,” the GAD order stated.Rajendra Bhagwat, secretary, state legislature, said that the staggering of the office timing has been done to reduce attendance in the offices without hampering the office work. “We have also reduced the shift to 6 hours to ensure that the employees are not burden during the pandemic time. Instead of the calling them to work on alternate day we have reduce the shift duration. The order will be in place for next two weeks after which a review meeting will be held to take a call on its extension. The decision over the choice of the shift has to be taken at the department level amicably,” he said.Ends

13-01-2022||Delhi||Budget: North MCD holds off on fresh taxes, keeps provisions to increase parking||In view of the surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi, and the resultant restrictions, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, for the first time, discussed its budget proposals online on Wednesday.Standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain said the civic body will take measures to boost the public health infrastructure in light of the Covid pandemic, and added that no new taxes will be imposed. He also said that the civic body will create parking space for 13.500 cars in the next two years.None of the three civic bodies are expected to levy any new tax since Delhi is due for municipal polls in April this year.“The parking projects are in various stages of execution at places such as Shiva market, Pitampura, Gandhi Maidan, Qutub Road, Sant Nagar, Rani Bagh, Idgah Road, Shalimar Bagh and Karol Bagh. Work on most of the major projects has already been started,” Jain said.“We are also setting up stack parking lots at Hanuman Setu near Nigambodh Ghat and Fatehpuri,”he said.Explaining the proposals of the Budget to the House, Jain referred to the ongoing financial crisis being faced by the civic body and referred to the trifurcation of the MCD. “The financial assistance assured to the corporation at the time of trifurcation was never released. We cannot say if trifurcation led to additional burden for the Centre or the state government but it led to acute deterioration in the financial situation of three civic bodies,” he added.Jain also announced that one family member of all corporation employees who died during service amid the ongoing pandemic will be given a job on compassionate grounds. “An amount of ₹10 lakh will also be given to the family members of such employees. Also, additional insurance to the employees working on daily wage and contract basis will be implemented,” Jain added.He said to boost health infra the civic body was adding more than 500 oxygen support beds at its hospitals. He added that oxygen plants were being made functional at Hindu Rao, Rajan Babu, Maharishi Valmiki and Girdhari Lal hospitals. “At Hindu Rao hospital, ICU beds are being escalated to 50 from the current 10, and 20 additional ICU beds will be provided for children. At Rajan Babu TB hospital, 20 ICU beds and 10 high dependency unit beds are being added; and 60 oxygen beds will be provided for paediatric Covid care at Girdhari Lall hospital,” he added.The cash-strapped civic body has recycled several of its old projects in the budget for 2022-23. While no tax has been levied, the budget also proposes to remove the provision of 2% tax rebate for online filing for property tax. “Most of the tax return process has moved to online mode so this 2% rebate no longer makes sense,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/budget-north-mcd-holds-off-on-fresh-taxes-keeps-provisions-to-increase-parking-101642013152012.html

Trying to control the damage, BJP leader and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya in his tweet said, leaders leaving the BJP would themselves have to bear the losses of jumping into “a sinking boat”. He, however, asked Chauhan to reconsider his decision, and said, when a member of the family strays away it hurts him. However, UP civil aviation minister Nand Gopal ‘Nandi’, an MLA from Allahabad South seat of Prayagraj, in his tweet said that Dara Singh was part of the cabinet for five years and was not heard saying a word on neglect of the backwards and the Dalits. “Suddenly before the polls, his copy-pasting letter of Swami Prasad Maurya has made clear to all as to who is the script-writer of his resignation letter,” he said. Cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh in an apparent reaction, without naming Dara Singh, posted a state government poster on Twitter highlighting the various welfare initiatives for various sections of the society, including youth, women and farmers. The post says: “OBC and SC/ST have got maximum benefit of these schemes still they are considering to join SP. One thing is clear that citing OBC/SC/ST as a reason behind the move is a false pretense, what is the real reason?”. In his resignation letter, Dara Singh Chauhan had mentioned that he was quitting the ministry because of the government’s “neglectful attitude” towards the backward classes, the underprivileged, the Dalits, the farmers, and the unemployed youth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chauhans-resignation-keshav-nandi-tweet-reactions-sidharth-nath-questions-move-101642013150716.html
13-01-2022||Pune||Commuters cry for safe drive on Katraj ghat in Pune||Pune: Damaged barricades, inadequate signage boards and unattended garbage heaps on the Katraj ghat section pose risk to daily commuters. Following the accident of a tourist bus that veered off the road near Bhilarwadi on Tuesday, residents have demanded more road safety measures. “I daily travel from Katraj ghat to Kondhanpur for work. There are many spots where the side barricading built-in rock has broken. Also, the height of barricading wall is too short to stop speeding vehicles coming on the slope road. There have been several fatal accidents in the past in the Ghat section, still there is no proper safety measures taken by the government,” said Sagar Nimbalkar, a resident who lives near the area. Around 4 am on Tuesday, a tourist bus of Karnataka state transport carrying 19 passengers fell into a gorge 30 feet below the road level. Four passengers, including driver, were injured in the accident. “We have been demanding the height of barricading wall in the ghat section to be increased and have iron barricading over these walls. Dumping of garbage near the road is creating problems for commuters, as a gust of wind bring discarded plastic and other waste to the road posing grave danger to riders and motorists. The state public works department and local administration should take the issue seriously,” said Amit Gunjal, another resident. At the start of the Katraj Ghat there are some villages - Bhilarwadi, Gujawadi and Nimbalkarwadi — which are not merged into PMC jurisdiction. And daily thousands of commuters travel through the Ghat for jobs and other works. Despite the functioning of bypass highway from New Katraj tunnel via Dari Pul bridge, the vehicular movement on Ghat section has not decreased. Two leopards sighted, alert sounded The state forest department have taken steps to alert citizens after two leopards were sighted at the Katraj Ghat section a month ago. The department has placed a notice appealing to citizens not to halt their vehicles or venture into the forest area in the ghat section. However, despite these boards placed in the Ghat section, people were found entering the area and clicking pictures on the roadside in the ghat section. A forest officer said that patrolling has been increased in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/commuters-cry-for-safe-drive-on-katraj-ghat-in-pune-101642013030590.html

Recognising the need for seers and pilgrims in identifying important places in the vast mela area like police stations, toilets, lost and found center, the mela authorities have decided to provide special features to guide the people towards them. These include specially coloured balloons on police stations that will help in easy identification from afar, thus making it easy for anyone to locate them. These balloons have been so designed that the details of the place over which a given balloon would be floating in the air would be mentioned in large, bold letters. A similar arrangement has been made for the identification of lost and found centers and toilets. While balloons would also be used to guide people to the lost and found centres, colored lights will be in place for quick identification of toilets. “The details of the police stations and lost found centers will be written in the balloons flying over these places. With this, the devotees will be able to easily spot the direction and distance of lost and found centre or police station. The security of the goods was always an area of concern and the same would be reduced to a great extent by providing cloak rooms at the ghats,” said Magh Mela Adhikari Shesh Mani Pandey. Keeping their clothes and belongings safe while taking holy dip is another area of concern for devotees and with this in mind the mela authorities decided to provide free cloak room facility at the ghats itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/balloons-coloured-lights-for-easy-identification-of-facilities-at-magh-mela-in-prayagraj-101642012973098.html

A deputy superintendent of police, on the behalf of the Punjab Police, lodged the complain. The promotion orders were of constables, senior constables, sub-inspectors and assistant sub-inspectors, including the gunman of the former Punjab director general of Punjab (DGP). These letters were purportedly issued on January 8 in the name of former Punjab DGP S Chattopadhyaya, the day the model code of conduct was enforced in Punjab with the announcement of assembly elections. In reality, no such orders were issued, claim sources.A Chandigarh Police statement said a complaint was received from Punjab Police, Sector 9, Chandigarh against unidentified persons, alleging that forged promotion orders had been issued in favour of Punjab Police officials.

13-01-2022||Delhi||JNU academic council nod for common entrance test from next year||The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Academic Council (AC) on Wednesday approved a proposal to implement the Common Universities Entrance Test (CUET) for admission from the 2022-23 academic session, amid protests from teachers’ and students’ groups.Confirming the development, JNU vice-chancellor (VC) M Jagadesh Kumar posted on Twitter: “JNU Academic Council decides that JNU admissions for different academic programmes in 2022-2023 academic session will be through Common University Entrance Examination to be conducted by National Testing Agency (NTA).”In a written statement issued on Wednesday, Jayant K Tripathi, director of admissions, JNU, said that the university had “endorsed its earlier decision to hold the entrance examination through the Common Universities Entrance Test (CUET) for admission into various academic programmes for 2022-23.”Tripathi said that the decision taken on Wednesday is in conformity with an earlier decision taken at the 157th AC meeting in March last year, when it had decided to adopt and admit students through CUET whenever the NTA goes ahead with it.Recently, the Delhi University also decided to hold admissions from the next academic session through the CUET.The JNU AC decision comes a day after 111 faculty members from the university on Tuesday issued a statement, seeking further discussion on CUET, noting that it requires “extensive deliberations”. Many JNU faculty members are of the view that the one-size-fits-all approach espoused by the CUET is not suited for a university like JNU that offers a number of unique interdisciplinary programmes. The JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) had also opposed the proposal for the implementation of CUET.While the administration did not directly address the apprehensions raised by faculty members and JNUSU, it said that “misinformation spread by a few faculty members about CUET was noted by the Academic Council and deplored.”The university added that during the meeting on Wednesday, a large number of AC members pointed out that the CUET would provide a level-playing field to students from across the country, and reduce the hassle of taking multiple entrance examinations.While condemning the manner in which the proposal was rushed through, JNU Teachers Association (JNUTA) said that the VC did not allow some AC members to raise questions in the meeting. JNUTA also denied the university’s claim that the decision on the adoption of CUET had already been taken in the 157th meeting of the Academic Council. “A perusal of the minutes of the 157th AC meeting clearly shows that this was not even listed on the agenda of that meeting. It was only part of one of the several recommendations of the advisory committee on admissions which recommended that ‘in case of receiving any direction from MoE/UGC, the University will accordingly adapt and admit students through CUCET’,” said JNUTA president Milap Sharma and secretary Moushumi Basu in a joint statement on Wednesday. They said that the VC had acted in an authoritarian manner and muted speakers who wanted to question the proposal.An AC member who attended the meeting on Wednesday said that one admission test for all universities would lead to a dilution of the process that the university had followed so far. “Instead of holding a detailed discussion, the proposal was rushed through without understanding how the system of deprivation points (to assess eligibility based on an applicant’s socio-economic background) and other frameworks in place will work under a common entrance system. A detailed discussion was not undertaken to understand how a common entrance would work for JNU that offers unique programmes,” he said.JNUSU on Wednesday said that student representatives had not been involved in the decision process. Seeking that the proposal for the implementation of CUET be rejected, JNUSU said that there were fears that issues, such as discrepancies in question papers and delay in declaration of results, will surface.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jnu-academic-council-nod-for-common-entrance-test-from-next-year-101642012791915.html
13-01-2022||Mumbai||State govt to make double vaccination mandatory for accessing range of services||MUMBAI To overcome vaccine resistance and boost vaccination numbers amidst the onset of the third wave of Covid-19, the state government is working on making double vaccination mandatory for accessing a range of services. Maharashtra also reported 46,723 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, which is the highest tally during the ongoing third wave. Double vaccination is already mandatory for suburban train travel in Mumbai, entering malls and shopping complexes as well as attending work in government offices. It might be made mandatory to attend private offices and establishments and for accessing various government schemes. “People take various concessions, but do not get themselves vaccinated. This is very wrong… double vaccination is needed to travel by the railways and enter malls and government offices. Similarly, we must ask offices to insist on double vaccination. We cannot make vaccination legally mandatory, but the state must increase its vaccination numbers as this is in the interests of the people. District administrations must take necessary measures for this,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope while speaking to the press on Wednesday after the meeting of the state cabinet. “Vaccination is a national programme, and no one should create hurdles in it as it goes against the national interest,” he warned. Tope added that at present, 90% of the intended beneficiaries have been vaccinated with the first dose, and vaccination has been completed for 62%. However, this is marginally lower than the national average. Of the 6 million beneficiaries in the 15 to 18 years’ age group, 45% have been given their first dose. On Wednesday, 46,723 new cases and 32 mortalities were reported in Maharashtra. Mumbai accounted for 16,420 of these cases and seven deaths. Another 86 patients were detected with the Omicron variant, of which 53 were from Pune city, 21 from Mumbai, six from Pimpri-Chinchwad, three from Satara, two from Nashik, and one from Pune rural. Till date, a total of 1,367 patients infected with the Omicron variant have been reported and of these, 734 have been discharged following a negative RT-PCR test. With people opting to test themselves with home testing kits and cases which have tested positive through this route not reflecting in the official data, the public health department is asking the district and municipal authorities to ensure that this data is captured. Later, they will be allowed to home quarantine and be monitored regularly. Pharmacies selling these home testing kits will be asked to report any positive cases. Tope said that in chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s virtual conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, the public health department asked him to raise the issue of shortage of vaccine doses. Covaxin is being used as a precautionary dose for senior citizens and also to vaccinate those in the age group of 15 to 18 years’, leading to a shortage. The state will seek 50 lakh doses of Covishield and 40 lakh doses of Covaxin from the Centre. Schools are likely to shut for another 15 to 20 days and a decision will be taken after observing the caseload. The state government has decided that a lockdown will be imposed in auto mode if the demand for oxygen of Covid patients crosses 700 metric tonne (MT) per day. However at present, oxygen demand for Covid and non-Covid cases is 150 MT and 250 MT, respectively. “There is no need for panic considering this situation, but precautions are necessary,” Tope said, adding that the hospitalisation numbers and oxygen demand could rise with the increase in daily infections. Relaxations in existing curbs are unlikely till January-end or mid-February as the first priority for the government is preventing transmission of the virus. While the number of daily cases showed a decline over the last few days, Tope attributed this to a decline in testing and weekends. The positivity rate was 21.4% for Maharashtra and 27% in Mumbai. Of the 2.06 lakh active cases, 29,110 (14.13%) needed hospitalisation and of these, 1,875 needed ICU admissions (0.91%), 656 were on ventilator support (0.32%), and 1,219 occupied oxygen beds (0.59%) and 1.89% of these patients (3,900) were on oxygen support outside ICUs. A total of 86% cases were mild and 5,775 patients (2.80%) were critical. According to the health department data, while the state has an average of 309,117 cases so far in January, the death rate is 0.03% compared to 43,759 cases and 0.50% deaths in December 2021 and 26,361 cases and 1.73% mortalities in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-govt-to-make-double-vaccination-mandatory-for-accessing-range-of-services-101642012790601.html

Even during the peak of the second wave in April-May last year, the highest single day count was 1,822, reported on May 5 last year. The total cases reported throughout May last year were 18,729, the highest monthly total so far. But the 12 days of January has already contributed nearly 10,000 cases and the tally of active cases is now 9,267. A total of 73,246 cases have been reported so far in the district since the start of the pandemic and 805,336 tests have been conducted so far, district health records showed.

Of the 4,868 Omicron cases reported nationwide, 275 are from Uttar Pradesh, health department records showed. Although Gautam Budh Nagar has the highest number of daily as well as active cases in the state, district officials said only one case of the Omicron variant has been confirmed there. The overall positivity rate -- the ratio of samples that return positive from among the total tested -- in Noida was 29% on Wednesday, while the RT-PCR positivity rate was close to 40% , district health data showed. Of the total active cases, around 90 persons have been admitted to hospitals while the others are in home isolation. Officials said the condition of all those in home isolation is being monitored regularly. “Yes, cases are increasing rapidly, but the good news is that there are zero serious cases in the district. The rate of hospitalization is less than 1%, and even those in hospitals are not admitted because of Covid complications,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate. However, doctors said while cases are less severe and most people are in home isolation, this wave is likely to affect many more people than the previous one. Even a small percentage of such a large number can overburden the health-care system soon, experts said. “We are seeing that this time, cases are increasing rapidly and more people are testing positive for Covid-19, even if their symptoms are mild. So, it is extremely important for the health-care system to stay ready and prepared to handle the increasing patient load. Meanwhile, people should continue to keep track of symptoms, follow all Covid-appropriate behaviour and those in home isolation should stay disciplined,” said brigadier (retired) Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida. GIMS has reactivated its home isolation mobile app ‘UPCHAR’ that had last year helped over 800 patients recover at home. The application can be downloaded from the Apple store and Google play store and Covid patients can avail of free tele consultations round the clock, Gupta said. Doctors said cases are also increasing because of lack of isolation protocols at home this time. However, such behaviour may also lead to cases of serious infections, they warned. “We are seeing that since most people have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, they are not following Covid-appropriate behaviour or isolating properly at home. However, such people can infect larger numbers and if they infect children, the elderly or immuno compromised individuals, that may result in serious cases. It is, therefore, imperative for all those even without symptoms to keep their surroundings clean and to isolate properly at home,” said Dr DK Gupta, chairman, Felix hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-sees-2-230-new-cases-the-highest-single-day-tally-ever-101642012730571.html
13-01-2022||Pune||361 Pune cops test Covid positive||PUNE: A total of 361 police officials from Pune city police force have tested positive for Covid-19 as on Wednesday, including 48 who were found infected on January 12. The Wednesday count of 48 cases among police personnel has taken the city’s tally to 4,857 new cases. Of the total positive cases in the police force, four are hospitalised while all others are in home isolation. There are 43 officers and 318 staff members. Tests were conducted for all working personnel at the Pune city commissioner’s office around eight days ago when the number of cases from the commissionerate were at nine. The Pune rural police have started administering the third shot of vaccine in Pune. “We started on Monday and so far we have administered around 280 doses. The number of cases stands at 17, including three officers. Nobody is in the hospital,” said Abhinav Deshmukh, superintendent of Pune rural police. A police officer who was recently transferred to special branch from a local police station, said, “I recently recovered and am now in home isolation. The impact was much less this time compared to the second wave. I had fever for one day and then weakness for a few days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/361-pune-cops-test-covid-positive-101642012675443.html
13-01-2022||Delhi||‘Aim to vaccinate all in 15-18 age group by Feb first week in Delhi’||Over 350,000 people in Delhi aged between 15 and 18 years have been administered the Covid-19 vaccine, showed state government data, as senior health officials said they expect to cover the city’s estimated one million teenagers in this age bracket by the first week of February, if they all come forward to get the jab.The Delhi government data shows that the city has vaccinated 352,437 beneficiaries in the 15-18 age group between January 3, when the Centre started immunising teens, and January 11. The pace of vaccinations has also picked up significantly since day one, showed state government data.Over 21,029 shots were administered on January 3, which went up to 33,238 shots the next day. By January 7, the number of vaccine doses administered in a day reached 57,815. Senior health department officials said they aim to continue the momentum over the coming weeks, and their estimates are that at the current rate, Delhi could vaccinate at least half of the eligible teenagers in the group by next week. Delhi has so far immunised 35% of its 1.01 million residents between aged 15 and 17. “We have made our estimates based on the assumption that 100% of eligible teenagers in this age category will get vaccinated. The initial assessment shows that we will vaccinate 50% youngsters by next week and will have administered the first doses to all eligible teenagers by the first week of February,” a senior health official said. According to the central Children have so far been administered Covaxin doses across at least 159 centres in the city. Government officials asked all district magistrates to encourage all eligible residents in their jurisdictions to come forward and get the jabs, with many officials reaching out to people on WhatsApp and social media. Experts also stressed the need to immunise children as soon as possible. Dr PK Sharma, epidemiologist and advisor (public health) with the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), said, “Teenagers should get themselves vaccinated at the earliest in order to have some protection against the virus. I would also advise all parents to stress on getting their younger children vaccinated as and when the government makes provisions for it.”
13-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi man held for filing false complaint alleging abduction, robbery||Police on Wednesday arrested a man for filing a false complaint alleging that he was abducted and robbed of his cash in Kapashera area on Monday. Police said the man, one Arjun Kumar Kesri, lost around ₹3.14 lakh after betting the money online but came up with the fake story of being robbed to mislead his family. DCP(South West) Gaurav Sharma said Kesri, who runs a cellphone shop with his brother, wanted his brother to believe that the money was robbed.DCP Sharma said, “On Monday, we received a distress call from the complainant, who alleged that while he was going to Karol Bagh to purchase cellphones, two men hit his scooter in Kapashera and he fell down. He also said that the two men intoxicated him, abducted him for 3-4 hours, and took away the money from the boot of his scooter. But when police started the investigation, he started giving contradictory statements of the sequence of events. Later he broke down and confessed that he had concocted a story about the robbery to ensure that his brother did not find out the truth about how he lost the money in betting.”“He was responsible for managing the cash and purchasing the phones. In order to earn easy and fast money, he got involved in online cricket gambling. Initially, he won several times but he lost a huge amount in the betting about 2-3 days ago. In order to recover, his losses, he put more bets but finally lost all. In order to clear his debts, he planned to misappropriate the money from his brothers by concocting a false story of robbery, abduction and intoxication,” added DCP Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-man-held-for-filing-false-complaint-alleging-abduction-robbery-101642012370474.html
13-01-2022||Delhi||Courtesy weekend rain, Delhi sees cleanest January air since 2015||Delhi is experiencing the cleanest January air since 2015, with the air quality improving to the “moderate” category on Wednesday. The minimum temperature also rose as foggy conditions kept the effects of cold northwesterly winds at bay.The Capital recorded an overall air quality index (AQI) of 191 (moderate), down from Tuesday’s reading of 224 (poor), as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily 4pm bulletin.Aided by a rainy spell on the weekend, Delhi has already recorded two ‘satisfactory’ air days on Saturday (91) and Sunday (69), while it recorded another ‘moderate’ air day on Monday, when the AQI was 151. Before this, Delhi has never recorded a satisfactory air day in January and has never recorded more than two moderate air days in the month. Officials said this is the cleanest January air spell since the AQI data began to be recorded in 2015.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.The aftermath of the rainy spell is also expected to keep Delhi shrouded in moderate fog, with chances of isolated dense fog, said officials from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), attributing the high minimum temperature in the Capital to it.Delhi recorded an increase in the minimum temperature over the last 24 hours, increasing to 8.2 degrees Celsius (°C) on Wednesday -- one degree above normal – up from 6.5°C on Tuesday. “There are two factors in play at the moment. Wind speed has dropped, which is not allowing colder winds from the mountains to reach Delhi. We are also recording upper-level fog and cloudy conditions due to high moisture, which is not allowing the minimum to drop too much at night,” said IMD scientist RK Jenamani.The maximum temperature was 18.1°C -- two notches below normal — on Wednesday, and it is forecast to hover between 19-20°C for the rest of the week.Delhi recorded ‘moderate’ fog at Palam on Wednesday, with visibility around 200-500 metres, and ‘shallow’ fog at Safdarjung with visibility ranging from 500-1,000 metres in the morning.“We are forecasting moderate fog for the remainder of the week. The possibility of dense fog (when visibility drops below 200 metres) cannot be ruled out either,” said Jenamani.Delhi’s air quality could meanwhile return to the lower end of the ‘poor’ category, with a low mixing height expected to reduce dispersion of pollutants.“With the prevailing partially cloudy conditions, along with maximum temperature gradually rising and moderate wind speeds persisting, air quality is likely to touch ‘poor’ on Thursday and remain the same for the two days. From January 15, air quality is expected to improve due to high wind speed causing strong ventilation of near surface pollutants,” said the Centre-run System of Air Quality And Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/courtesy-weekend-rain-delhi-sees-cleanest-january-air-since-2015-101642012190724.html
13-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi: SDMC, ITO graveyard admin at odds over space crunch||The space earmarked for burying Covid victims at the ITO graveyard, one of the Delhi’s biggest cemeteries for Muslims, is full with the management saying that it had to turn away two bodies last week, and send them to the facility at north west Delhi’s Mangolpuri on the city’s outskirts.This, however, has now triggered a tussle with the South Delhi Municipal Corporation. The civic body has told the graveyard management that it cannot turn away people, and has threatened to issue a show cause notice.Delhi recorded 40 Covid deaths on Wednesday, the most in a single day since June 10 last year, when the Capital recorded 44 deaths, and took the city’s overall pandemic toll to 25,240.The ITO burial ground management said they had to turn away the bodies since the 5-acre section of the graveyard marked to bury those who die of Covid has no space left to dig more graves. The ITO graveyard is spread over 45 acres.Mohammad Shamim, supervisor of the Covid section, said, “Over the last two years, 1,350 bodies have been laid to rest here. There is no more space left and we were forced to accommodate a few more dead-bodies last year by clearing bushes. We had to ask the family members to take the dead bodies to other facility,” he added.However, a senior public health official from the south MCD said the management cannot refuse to accept any bodies and a show cause notice may be issued to them.Shamim Ahmed Khan, secretary of the managing committee, Qabristan Ahle Islam, ITO, said the committee has got an additional 4 acres space near the Millennium Park on the Ring Road last year, but the plan got stuck due to lack of police permission.“We are willing to provide manpower and other services, if that section is allowed for burials. There is no space left in the Covid section. Normally, we level up a part of the burial ground after 4-5 years to create more space but even that cannot be carried out in this case due to Covid. When hospitals are calling us to send more dead bodies, we are forced to advise them to divert them to other four facilities. We also need to take care of normal bodies coming mostly from old Delhi,” he added. Besides, ITO, Covid victims are buried at Mangolpuri, Madanpur Khadar, Okhla and Shastri Park.An SDMC official said the burial grounds are managed by the Delhi Waqf board, but Section 392 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act empowers the municipal commissioner to route the bodies to any such facility.“The management is in violation of Section 392 of DMC Act by refusing to take dead bodies of Covid patients. They cannot differentiate between Covid and non-Covid bodies. We are planning to issue a show cause notice after which further action will be taken,” the official said asking not to be named.Last year, burials at Buland Masjid in east Delhi’s Shastri Park also had to be stopped due to space constraints. EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said they have got an additional space of 2,000 square metres from the Delhi Development Authority, near the Buland Masjid site to prevent a crisis. “Our public health department is working with the graveyard management to increase the capacity,” the mayor said.The annual report on registration of birth and deaths in Delhi shows that around for 10% of annual deaths burial grounds are used. According to the 2020 report, a total of 142,789 deaths were registered in the city, of which 124,965 were Hindus, 13,103 Muslims, 2,365 Sikhs, 513 Christians and 1,843 were registered in others category.Delhi Waqf board, which oversees most burial grounds, has demanded more space to ease the burden on city’s burial grounds. Chairman of the board, Amanatullah Khan, said there are around 45 active graveyards in the national capital, of which five have been allocated for Covid victims.“In case of the ITO burial ground, the Waqf Board has granted permission to use an alternative plot near Indraprastha Ring Road, but the matter is now stuck with the police. The issue of shortage of space at many burial grounds is a reality, and thus more sites should be allocated,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhisdmc-ito-graveyard-admin-at-odds-over-space-crunch-101642011650588.html
13-01-2022||Delhi||Govt forms 11-member council to protect city’s biodiversity, plan for its future||The Delhi government has created an 11-member Delhi Biodiversity Council to protect existing biodiversity parks and oversee the creation of more such facilities in the future in the Capital.Created after the National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) issued directions to have one such body in each state and Union Territory across the country, the council will function as an autonomous unit under the forest and wildlife department of Delhi and receive separate funds. It will hold its first meeting on Friday.As per the gazette notification, the council, headed by Delhi University professor CR Babu as its chairperson, has Delhi’s chief wildlife warden as its member secretary and includes the principal chief conservator of forest, the Delhi development commissioner, the principal secretary (environment and forest) and the principal secretary (urban development) among its five ex-officio members. The body also has four expert members -- Indraprastha University professor Sumit Dookia; Vijay Dhasmana, curator at the Aravalli Biodiversity Park in Gurugram; and INTACH’s Dr Ritu Singh and Manu Bhatnagar -- each of who will have a term of three years.“Our long-term goal is to preserve Delhi’s existing biodiversity and to rejuvenate areas which are now suffering due to the urban stress. With the funds allocated, different sections such as waterbodies, forests and the floodplains can receive individual attention,” said Babu.Nisheeth Saxena, member secretary of the council, said the chairman of the NBA will attend the first council meeting on Friday. “The NBA will guide us in the first meeting, and plans for the year 2022 will also be decided,” he said.Dookia said the council can carry out different types of census for animals and birds once funds are allocated. “Once the first meeting is held, the agenda for the year will become clearer,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-forms-11-member-council-to-protect-delhi-s-biodiversity-plan-for-its-future-101642011170320.html
13-01-2022||Delhi||Despite rule, no pet shop in Delhi registered with state animal welfare board||Over three years after the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Pet Shop) Rules, 2018, was notified, making it mandatory for pet shops in Delhi and other states to be registered with the State Animal Welfare Board (SAWB), not a single pet shop in Delhi has registered so far, according to a Right To Information (RTI) reply from the state animal husbandry department. An official from the department told HT that they have already begun work on registering pet shops.Aimed at bringing accountability to the pet shop trade in the city, the rules under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Pet Shop) Rules, 2018, also require shops to maintain a record of the different animal species it has, their procurement and sale; details of veterinarian checks; and other criteria to ensure decent living conditions for the captive animals.A three-month inspection -- from October to December last year -- of over 30 pet shops in Delhi by a team of volunteers from Ahimsa Fellowship, organised by a group of animal welfare NGOs, also found a number of violations at pet shops, ranging from the sale of animals prohibited under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, cramped cages, lack of temperature control systems and no separate quarantine areas for injured or diseased animals, among others.The lack of data on Delhi’s pet shops had become a problem during the pandemic, when the lockdown in March 2020 forced many to abruptly shut their shops, leaving birds and animals locked up inside. The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) had subsequently issued directions in April, asking SAWBs to evacuate animals stuck inside pet shops with the help of local administration, but the lack of data on such shops posed a problem.An RTI filed by the Fellowship -- HT has a copy -- in November 2021 shows nothing has changed a year on, with Delhi’s animal husbandry department – under which the SAWB falls – stating it has no record of any pet shop in the city. Sunayna Sibal, an Ahimsa fellow who filed the RTI and also took part in the inspection, said technically, pet shops are operating ‘illegally’ and violating several norms in the process.“Ninety-five percent of the pet shops had cages which were too small for the bird or animal they were housing. There were no exhausts or temperature-control systems in most shops, making it uncomfortable for these animals and no pet shop had a separate quarantine area for sick or diseased animals. We also found shops displaying animals outside, leaving them exposed to the elements,” said Sibal, stating they discovered at least seven species prohibited for sale under the Wildlife Protection Act at these shops.“These included the Indian star tortoise, scaly-breasted munias, quails, lesser whistling ducks, parakeets, grey francolins and Indian silverbills among others. An inspection by the SAWB would have led to these animals being seized and the shop sealed, but the lack of accountability is causing these animals to be sold openly,” she added.Asher Jesudoss, who was also part of the inspection, said with no trail of sale and purchase being maintained by pet shops, it was difficult to ascertain how the animals were being procured. “The rules make it mandatory to maintain a record of the sale and purchase, to prevent forced breeding and illegal procurement of animals. We are unable to check that currently,” he said.Ahimsa fellow Akshita Kukreja said they shared a report on the inspection with Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev on December 28, 2021, but they are yet to receive a response. “Another RTI will be filed soon on whether any action has been taken or not,” said Kukreja.Pointing out that each registration of a pet shop will fetch the government ₹5,000, Gauri Maulekhi, trustee at the People for Animals (PFA), said mandatory registration is one that will benefit the exchequer as well. Maulekhi estimated that there are over 500 pet shops in the Capital.“Pet trade is a multi-crore business which was completely unregulated till 2018. Now, the new rules provide for each such business to pay a registration fee to the state government, abide by the conditions imposed and provide receipts to the customers. Keeping multiple species in dirty, crammed spaces is not only cruelty to the animals but a public health hazard too,” said Maulekhi, adding that despite several pleas over the last few years, the development department of Delhi had failed to act.An official from the state animal husbandry department, on condition of anonymity, told HT that the department had data of around 150 pet shops in Delhi. “So far, we have only received two applications for registration. Advertisements and notices have been issued in the past, asking pet shops to register themselves with us, but a fresh campaign will soon be launched to ensure the same,” said the official, adding that district-level officers have also been asked to prepare a database of pet shops under their jurisdiction.“This will ensure there is no cruelty taking place at any pet shop in Delhi. We will not immediately fine any shop and some more time will be given to them to register, failing which will result in the shop being sealed,” the official added.The development department meanwhile did not respond to HT’s queries.‘Not an easy process’Pet shop owners, when contacted, said the lack of transparency in the registration process was making it difficult for most to complete the process. “A number of owners tried registering through the website, but the state animal welfare board’s website does not function a majority of the time. They also do not have a physical office currently, making it difficult to approach,” said Pawan Garg, owner of the Bittoo Pet Shop in Safdarjung Enclave.Lakshay Kumar, owner at the Fancy Fish Aquarium and Pet Shop in Rohini, too supported mandatory registrations. “There is no clarity on the registration process, but all pet shops want to get registered,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/despite-rule-no-pet-shop-in-delhi-registered-with-state-animal-welfare-board-101642010810290.html

13-01-2022||Chandigarh||Kejriwal campaigns in Kharar, AAP gets poll code violation notice||With the assembly elections scheduled on February 14, Aam Aadmi Party national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal along with the party’s Punjab chief, Bhagwant Mann, held door-to-door campaigning at Khanpur area in favour of their candidate Anmol Gagan Mann from Kharar assembly segment in Mohali district. While declaring the poll dates, the election commission had put a ban on rallies and public meetings till January 15, allowing only door-to-door canvassing. Kejriwal also listened to problems of the people of Khanpur and assured them that once the AAP gets voted to power in Punjab, it will solve all their issues. Lashing out at both the Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal, the AAP chief said they had worked only for their vested interests. “Whatever promises we make to the people will be fulfilled, and we will make Punjab the number one state in the country,” said Kejriwal, who even had a cup of tea sitting in the courtyard at a house in Khanpur. We will form govt: MannMeanwhile, AAP Punjab chief Bhagwant Mann said that people have made up their mind to bring a change in the state, and “we are forming the government”. Interacting with mediapersons in Mohali, he presented the AAP’s Punjab Model, comprising a 10-point agenda that focuses on generating employment. According to it, the AAP would create a drug-free and corruption-free state, restore law and order, improve education, health, agriculture, and industrial sectors, provide free power to a certain segment and give ₹1,000 a month to each woman above the age of 18. The AAP has declared its candidates in all three constituencies of Mohali district: real estate baron and former mayor Kulwant Singh (60) from Mohali Urban, Punjabi singer Anmol Gagan Mann (31) from Kharar, and Kuljeet Singh Randhawa (60) from Dera Bassi. The other parties are yet to announce their candidates. AAP gets poll code violation notice The returning officer of Kharar has issued a notice to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for code of conduct violation, after Kejriwal campaigned with more than five people.The returning officer-cum-SDM Kharar, Avikesh Gupta, said it is a clear case of violation of code of conduct as it has been decided by the chief election commissioner that door-to-door campaigning is only allowed with five people. The officer had asked the district president of the AAP to file the reply within 24 hours, failing which action will be taken as per the law.
13-01-2022||Lucknow||Now, OBC leader Dara Singh Chauhan quits as UP minister||LUCKNOW Uttar Pradesh environment minister Dara Singh Chauhan quit the state cabinet on Wednesday, becoming the second prominent other backward classes (OBC) leader to resign in 24 hours after labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya, deepening the turmoil in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The resignation -- which comes roughly a month before assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh -- will send alarm bells ringing in the BJP, which hopes to hold on to the rainbow coalition of backward classes and Scheduled Castes that propelled it to an unprecedented victory in 2017. Like Maurya, Chauhan joined the BJP from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) before the 2017 state polls. And, like Maurya, he blamed the BJP’s treatment of backward castes and Dalits as the reason for his resignation. “I am hurt by the state government ignoring the interests of the backward, marginalised, Dalit, farmers and unemployed youth. Hence, I resign from the cabinet,” he said in a letter to governor Anandiben Patel. Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav tweeted a photo of himself with Chauhan, the MLA from Madhuban, and welcomed him to the SP. Yadav had also welcomed Maurya to the SP on Tuesday but a day later, Maurya made it clear that he hadn’t joined any other party yet. “I haven’t resigned as BJP member yet. I will reveal everything on January 14 though one thing is clear that I am not going [back] to the BJP,” the minister said. “One feels bad if a family member loses way. I would just request the respected leaders who have resigned to reconsider their decision as they won’t achieve anything by riding a sinking boat. I would appeal to big brother Dara Singhji to reconsider his decision,” tweeted deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya after Chauhan’s resignation. Uttar Pradesh goes to the polls in seven phases, beginning February 10 and ending March 7. The votes will be counted on March 10.On Tuesday, Maurya dealt a blow to the BJP with his abrupt resignation from the cabinet, indicating that the BJP’s hold on the non-dominant backward groups, a key demographic that helped the party win the 2017 state and 2019 general elections, may be slipping. Three lawmakers close to Maurya -- Roshan Lal Verma, Brijesh Prajapati and Bhagwati Sagar – also quit the party. On Wednesday, a fourth – Bidhuna MLA Vinay Shakya – said he was with Maurya and a fifth, Meerpur MLA Avtar Singh Bhadana, joined the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), an ally of the SP. To be sure, political realignments are common before every major election, and the 2017 polls also saw a raft of defections. And yet, the resignations on Tuesday and Wednesday, coupled with the BJP’s troubles with former ally Om Prakash Rajbhar and current ally Apna Dal, indicate that the BJP may have to focus on its outreach among the OBCs. The party came to power in a landslide five years ago on the back of unprecedented support among scores of smaller non-dominant backward castes, which resented the powerful Yadavs, also an OBC group considered the traditional base of the SP. OBCs form around 42-45% of the electorate, of which 9% are Yadav. The BJP has been wooing the remaining 32-35% of the non-Yadav OBC votes, which includes Kurmis (5%), Lodhs (4%), and Nishads (4%), among many others. Maurya is a five-time MLA from Padrauna in Kushinagar district who was a top minister in the 2007-12 BSP government and is influential among the Mauryas, an OBC community. Chauhan, a three-time MP (two-time Rajya Sabha MP) and currently a lawmaker, belongs to the Lonia OBC community.Stung by the resignations at a time when chief minister Yogi Adityanath and other senior leaders are deliberating in Delhi about candidate selection, the BJP’s game plan appeared clear. It inducted Naresh Saini, the Congress’s OBC lawmaker from Saharanpur in western UP who hails from the same community as Maurya, three-time SP lawmaker Hari Om Yadav, and former SP lawmaker Dharampal Singh. The event happened in the presence of Keshav Prasad Maurya and the party’s UP unit chief, Swatantra Dev Singh, both OBC leaders. Later in the day, a Sultanpur district court issued an arrest warrant against Maurya in a 2016 case in which he was accused of making objectionable comments against Hindu deities. It asked the former minister to be present in court on January 24. Maurya indicated that more leaders were likely to follow him, and added that the BJP will have to start according respect to its leaders. “My decision to quit has triggered an earthquake in the BJP. I pleaded with the leaders for the welfare of Dalits and backwards but they couldn’t care less,” he said. His son, Utkrisht Maurya Ashok, said the former minister was not concerned about tickets for his children. Maurya’s daughter, Lok Sabha MP Sanghamitra Maurya, continues to be with the BJP. Some BJP leaders argued that the resignations were triggered by fear that the party may drop many sitting lawmakers in a bid to curtail anti-incumbency. “UP elections are important. Naturally, if some candidates are dropped, it could be because of some specific input that might have emerged through field surveys. While it is true that we don’t want to lose any leader, at the same time, why do you think a certain political development that could be big news for the media would force us to compromise on candidate selection? Only the best will be selected. There are hundreds of claimants from each assembly segment and all know that only one eventually would get to contest,” a senior BJP leader said on condition of anonymity.But other leaders admitted that the exits could hurt the party. “It’s not good optics,” said a second party leader. On Monday, BJP MLA from Bilsi, Radha Krishna Sharma, joined the SP, the second Brahmin lawmaker after Digvijay Narain Chaubey, MLA from Khalilabad, to leave the ruling party, when Bahraich MLA Madhuri Verma and Sitapur MLA Rakesh Rathore, both OBCs, joined the SP. The rapid developments also sparked some drama. On Tuesday, Shakya’s daughter Riya made a video saying her father was abducted by her uncle, Devesh. A day later, Shakya and the local police refuted the claim. Hours later, a letter surfaced on social media claiming BJP lawmaker Ravindra Tripathi, considered close to Maurya, had resigned from the BJP. The legislator later filed a police complaint, saying the letter was fake and his letterhead was forged. “Such defections closer to the elections are common and if the joining are any indication, it’s set to be a straight contest between BJP and the SP, with none ready to blink ahead of an exercise that means a great deal for both,” said Irshad Ilmi, a veteran journalist and political expert..
13-01-2022||Delhi||Tajpuriya gang member involved in Gogi’s courtroom shootout murder arrested||A key member of Delhi’s Tillu Tajpuriya criminal gang, who had supplied the weapons that were used to murder rival gangster Jitender Gogi inside a Rohini courtroom in September last year, has been arrested, Delhi police said on Wednesday.Police identified the suspect as Rakesh Tajpuriya, 31, who carried a reward of ₹50,000 for his arrest. Police said he was on the run since his name emerged following the launch of an investigation into Gogi’s killing.On September 24, when Gogi was produced inside a courtroom at the Rohini district courts complex for a hearing, he was shot 18 times by two gunmen. The two shooters had entered the courtroom posing as lawyers, waited for over half an hour for Gogi to show up, and opened fire on him.Gogi died on the spot, while his two killers were shot dead by police inside the courtroom.Jasmeet Singh, deputy commissioner of police (special cell), said Rakesh was arrested at around 10pm on Tuesday after a shootout with the police in Delhi’s Narela area.“Rakesh was one of the main conspirators [behind Gogi’s killing] and facilitated the other suspects in the murder. He’s involved in more than 12 heinous criminal cases such as murder, attempt to murder, robbery, extortion, criminal intimidation in Delhi and Haryana,” Singh said.“We received a tip-off that Rakesh was frequently visiting Alipur and Narela in outer Delhi. He was planning to kill a rival member of the Gogi gang. For the last four months, we have been trying to identify his hideouts to catch him,” DCP Singh said. “Based on a tip-off from an informer, we laid a trap near a factory in Narela’s industrial area on Tuesday night. Our team spotted him on a motorcycle. When they asked him to surrender, he dropped his bike and fired two rounds at the police. The police team fired back one round and managed to arrest Rakesh. Nobody was injured in the shootout. We recovered a semi-automatic pistol from his possession.”Police said Rakesh had helped the other suspects behind Gogi’s killing on the orders of jailed gangster Sunil Maan alias Tillu Tajpuria, who heads the Tajpuriya criminal gang.Also Read: Gogi murder aftermath: Gangster ‘Bachi’ killed in shootout with cops in DelhiThe Gogi and Tajpuriya gangs have been embroiled in a bitter rivalry for about a decade. During these 10 years, more than two dozen people have died in clashes between the two groups. Members of the two gangs who have been arrested have been implicated in cases of contract killings, extortion, robbery and carjacking.Detailing Rakesh’s role in the Rohini courtroom murder, the police said he was the one who escorted the two gunmen who gunned down Gogi. “The gunmen and the weapons used in the crime were arranged by Rakesh. He was present outside the court when the shooting happened. He said he was acting on the directions of Sunil Maan,” Singh said.Gogi and Maan - before the latter came to be known as Tillu Tajpuria - were known to be childhood friends before they both entered college politics at Delhi University’s Swami Shraddhanand College in Alipur. Soon afterwards, they parted ways and turned bitter foes.Until his arrest in March 2020, Gogi, a resident of Alipur who had at least 19 criminal cases against his name, was No. 1 on the Delhi Police’s list of most wanted men.Tillu Tajpuriya is also in jail, while Delhi Police’s investigation into multiple crimes has revealed that he continues to run criminal activities from inside prison.Gogi’s sensational courtroom murder last year had sparked a fierce debate over security loopholes in the national Capital’s court complexes. The incident had prompted the Delhi Police to conduct a security audit. Since then, the management of security of Delhi’s courts has been handed over to the police’s dedicated security unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tajpuriya-gang-member-involved-in-gogi-s-courtroom-shootout-murder-arrested-101641980324041.html

13-01-2022||Chandigarh||Alarming groundwater depletion ‘non-issue’ for parties in Punjab||Gurjant Singh, 29, a farmer hailing from Namol village near Sunam, witnessed the fourth tubewell installation on his farm in January last year.Gurjant owns seven acres of land. The new tubewell was dug up to 330 ft with the cost of ₹90,000 due to the depletion of groundwater in the area whereas around two decades ago, water was found at 100 ft only.Tirath Singh, 60, from the same village, who owns 5 acres, is planning to dig new tubewell up to 500 ft as their earlier tubewell at 180 ft failed to provide sufficient water for the paddy crop. Singh will probably spend over ₹2 lakh on the new bore this month.According to a recent study of the agriculture department, conducted in 2020 in 150 blocks of the state, 117 blocks (78%) are “over-exploited”, six are “critical”, 10 are “semi-critical” and 17 blocks are in the “safe category”.Agriculture experts advised farmers to adopt crop diversification but farmers claimed that they are forced to cultivate paddy crops as successive governments failed to provide the minimum support price (MSP) for other crops. However, environmentalists accused political parties of making an important matter a non-issue in state assembly elections amid freebies.“The state is facing groundwater depletion. Farmers need to adopt crop diversification and cultivate short-duration varieties of paddy to save water. New varieties developed by the Punjab Agriculture University ripen early and require less water. We need to focus on cotton and pulses,” said Jaswinder Pal Singh Grewal, joint director, agriculture (inputs), Punjab.Environment activist from Punjab Baba Balbir Singh Seechewal said water and air should be key issues in the state assembly and Parliament elections but sadly even educated voters are not raising these issues.“Right to life is our fundamental right. Every party should give us this right. It is the government’s duty. Despite the fact that this is one of the major problems that Punjab is battling today, this is a non-issue for all political parties. It is high time that we start taking concrete measures to stop the depletion of groundwater,” added Seechewal.Dr Amandeep Aggarwal, an environment activist, said the water table sinks over 1 meter in Punjab every two years but in some pockets, water recedes even at double pace.“The successive governments and political parties are not serious about the depletion of groundwater. Besides, our drinking water is being polluted. We need cancer-free areas, not cancer hospitals. To improve the water table, the government should develop a rain irrigation model. If government institutes will adopt rain harvest model, the common man will follow them,” added Dr Aggarwal.Farmer Gurjant Singh said, “I am an educated man. I know that 1 kg of rice takes 5,000 litres of water. The overexploitation of groundwater is dangerous. We want to leave traditional crops, but the governments should provide MSP on other crops.”

13-01-2022||Mumbai||Animal activist lodges police complaint, 3 Kalyan pet shop owners booked||The Mahatma Phule police in Kalyan have booked three pet shop owners and attendants after an animal activist from Mumbai lodged a complaint following the fire incident in three pet shops that killed hundreds of animals and pets in Rambaugh, Kalyan (W) on Wednesday.Shashikanth Purohit, a 24-year-old animal lover from Mumbai, lodged an FIR with the Mahatma Phule police station on Wednesday night.“These pet shops are running without any registration or license from the authorities. Maharashtra Animal Welfare Board is the registering authority for these pet shops. The pet shops in Kalyan have not been registered and are illegally operating,” said Purohit.On Wednesday morning, one of the pet shops caught fire, spreading it to two other shops and killing several animals and birds on the spot. Purohit has placed a demand to get the medical examination done of those animals and birds that managed to escape the fire.“In my complaint, I have asked the officials to ensure that those animals and birds that had escaped from the fire are in good health. In a video that surfaced on social media, it was seen that some of the animals and birds were still alive,” added Purohit.According to Purohit, hundreds of animals like cats, birds, mice and Guinea pigs were burnt alive in this incident. They were locked up inside the shop without any attendant or any smoke detection or fire safety measures.“There is a lack of regulations amongst these pet shops as they are allowed to run their business illegally. There are no fire safety norms followed by the shop owners. In this case, such shops should not be allowed to operate,” added Purohit.Based on the complaint, the Mahatma Phule police have registered a case under Sections 337, 429, 289, 268, 3 and 11(1) (A) of Indian Penal Code.

13-01-2022||World||Speculations rife about who could replace UK PM Boris Johnson||With Boris Johnson in his most precarious position yet as UK prime minister, speculation is swirling over who might replace him as leader of the Conservative party and take Britain's top political job.Rishi SunakThe UK's first Hindu chancellor of the exchequer is the current bookies favourite to replace Johnson, having been appointed finance minister in 2020 after only five years in politics.Sunak, 41, was credited with taking bold steps and delivering a sweeping publicly-funded furlough scheme to secure jobs affected by the coronavirus lockdown.Pro-Brexit Sunak's public speaking ability, smart appearance and slick communications style are in stark contrast to Johnson, earning him comparisons to former prime minister Tony Blair.Sunak was noticeably absent from the House of Commons during Johnson's apology Wednesday for attending a lockdown-breaking drinks party at Downing Street, and took hours to voice support for his beleaguered boss.Privately wealthy through his previous business career, Sunak's grandparents were from the Punjab in northern India and emigrated to the UK from east Africa in the 1960s.His father-in-law is Indian tech billionaire Narayana Murthy.Liz TrussAnother front-runner is Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, a free-trade champion whose straight talking and willingness to wade in to the culture wars have made her popular among Tory grassroots.Truss, 46, was handed the top diplomat's role as reward for her work as minister for international trade securing a raft of post-Brexit trade deals.Some MPs characterised her former Department for International Trade (DIT) as the "Department for Instagramming Truss" because of her prolific output on the social media site.Truss, who opposed Brexit but then switched sides, grew up in Leeds, northern England, and previously worked for 10 years in the energy and telecommunications sectors.Michael GoveThe former journalist with a nose for political drama was a driving force behind Brexit and has been an influential member of Johnson's cabinet.Gove, 56, was in September tasked with leading the housing and local authorities ministry, to deliver Johnson's agenda of "levelling up" disadvantaged UK regions.He ran twice to be Conservative leader, in 2016 and 2019, coming third on both occasions.Jeremy HuntFormer foreign and health secretary Jeremy Hunt, 55, lost to Johnson in the 2019 leadership contest during which he branded himself as the "serious" alternative.A fluent Japanese speaker, he is the current chair of the health select committee and has an image as a "nice guy" although is seen by some as lacking charisma.Hunt was a contemporary of Johnson and former prime minister David Cameron at Oxford University, and previously worked as a management consultant and an English language teacher in Japan.Sajid JavidHealth Secretary Sajid Javid, 52, is the son of a Pakistani immigrant bus driver who become a high-flying banker and eventually Johnson's finance minister before resigning in 2020.He has spoken fondly of shaking free market champion Margaret Thatcher's hand when he was a young boy.Javid voted in 2016 to remain in the European Union because of its economic benefits to trade, but later rallied to the Brexit cause and ended his leadership challenge to support Johnson.Priti PatelInterior minister Priti Patel, 49, is the most socially conservative of Johnson's senior ministers, voting against introducing same-sex marriage, and was a prominent Brexit supporter.Patel was born in London to a Ugandan-Indian family and has taken a tough line on immigration while being confronted with record numbers of migrants arriving in the country from across the Channel.An avowed Thatcherite who has had to fend off claims she bullied civil servants, Patel worked in public relations before entering politics.Dominic RaabDeputy prime minister and justice secretary Dominic Raab, 47, led the country when Johnson was in intensive care in hospital with Covid-19 in 2020.The former lawyer and karate black belt was seen as a reliable ally whose unfussy and pragmatic approach made him the right man for a crisis.His move to justice from the post of foreign secretary was seen as a demotion after he initially failed to cut short his holiday as Kabul fell to the Taliban in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/speculations-rife-about-who-could-replace-uk-pm-boris-johnson-101642093509837.html
13-01-2022||World||China criticises Indian army chief’s remarks, doesn’t release info on LAC talks||China on Thursday criticised Indian Army Chief General MM Naravane’s comment about the existence of Chinese threat in the region, saying it hopes that Indian officials would “refrain” from making “unconstructive” comments.The Chinese foreign ministry, however, did not share any information about Wednesday’s 14th round of Sino-India military discussions to resolve the dragging standoff in eastern Ladakh. “We will release information if there is any,” foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said when asked to comment on the talks at Thursday’s briefing.Asked to comment on the Indian army chief’s statement, Wang said, “China and India are working through diplomatic and military channels to advance the easing of the border tension. We hope individual personnel from India will refrain from making unconstructive comments”.Naravane on Wednesday said that the Chinese threat in the region had not reduced in any way despite partial disengagement at multiple friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.Naravane was speaking to reporters ahead of Army Day on January 15.India and China’s decision not to issue official statements a day after the talks concluded is an indication that deep differences exist in implementing the decision to disengage from remaining friction points.On Tuesday, Wang had said: “Currently the situation on the border areas is stable on the whole and the two sides are in dialogue and communication through diplomatic and military channels. “We hope India will work to help the situation to move from emergency handling to a regular daily based management phase,” Wang added.The last military talks in October had collapsed following major differences between the two sides.Both had issued strong statements after the 13th round of talks ended in bitterness.The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) said India had made “unreasonable” and “unrealistic” demands during the talks.New Delhi said the Chinese side wasn’t “agreeable” and “…could not provide any forward-looking proposals” at the negotiating table.Indian and Chinese border troops have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May, 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border.Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas.Ahead of the Wednesday talks, an editorial in state-run China Daily newspaper warned India not be led “astray” by the US.The editorial quoted White House press secretary Jen Psaki describing China as a threat to regional security with its “attempt to intimidate its neighbours” and that the US will “…continue to stand with our partners on that”.“India must not be led astray by such remarks. It should engage in the talks with sincerity and strive to meet China half-way so that they can work together to solve their border disputes,” the editorial said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-criticises-indian-army-chief-s-remarks-doesn-t-release-info-on-lac-talks-101642075798561.html
13-01-2022||World||Whisky for visas: India, UK start post-Brexit trade talks||Britain and India began hammering out a post-Brexit trade deal on Thursday, with London seeking a cut in tariffs on Scotch whisky and greater access to the Asian giant's services and tech sectors.New Delhi, which is notoriously reticent about lowering trade barriers and was dubbed the "tariff king" by former US President Donald Trump, wants in return to make it easier and cheaper for Indians to obtain British visas.A joint statement after Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and British Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan formally launched the talks in Delhi reiterated a target of doubling bilateral trade volumes by 2030."Both sides have agreed that we will focus initially on areas which are of mutual benefit and where there is less disagreement, and for which we have set a very aggressive timeline of next few months," Goyal told reporters."We feel confident that there is so much complementarity between the two economies that we should easily be able to come up with a very substantive agreement in the initial phase... I think we are committed to concluding this negotiation in about a year's time," he said."The UK has world-class businesses and expertise we can rightly be proud of, from Scotch whisky distillers to financial services and cutting-edge renewable technology," Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement."We are seizing the opportunities offered in growing economies of the Indo-Pacific to cement our place on the global stage and deliver jobs and growth at home," he said.Britain has struck trade deals with Japan, New Zealand and Australia as it attempts to compensate for falling trade volumes with the European Union since it left the bloc in January 2020.The total volume of trade at stake in a deal between Britain and India is small fry, however, equivalent to about three per cent of London's total volume of commerce with the EU, Bloomberg News reported.New Delhi's push to ease the granting of UK visas for Indian nationals may also fall foul with Brexit supporters who were keen to cut immigration.Conservative lawmaker Edward Leigh told parliament last week that "working-class voters who voted Brexit did not vote to replace immigration from Europe with more immigration from the rest of the world".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whisky-for-visas-india-uk-start-post-brexit-trade-talks-101642074668372.html

13-01-2022||World||‘Deltacron might be a result of…’: WHO on infection with Delta and Omicron||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday said that ‘Deltacron’ that implies an individual being infected with both Delta as well as the Omicron variant of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is not “really a thing.” The phrase came to the news after a researcher in Cyprus namely Leondios Kostrikis reportedly discovered a strain of Covid-19 that combines both the variants. Furthermore, Bloomberg reported that as many as 25 cases of Deltacron have been detected in the country so far, even as details about the new strain remains unknown.WHO technical lead of Covid-19 Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said that the Deltacron might be a result of “contamination” that occurred during the sequencing process.She, however, clarified that it is possible for a person to be infected with different variants of SARS-CoV-2. The WHO technical lead also stated that there have been examples of coinfection in which individuals were infected with both influenza and Covid-19 “throughout this pandemic.”“There was a recent systematic review that looked at the prevalence of this (coinfection with Covid-19 and influenza). They also looked at whether or not people had more severe disease,” she said, adding that the review discovered that coinfection didn't increase the severity of the disease.

Cui presented a sharp analysis of problems with China’s diplomacy,” it said.The words of caution come against the backdrop of President Joe Biden administration’s strengthening of ties with allies such as Britain, Japan, Australia and China’s neighbour India.China’s current tough line on the US has been spearheaded by top diplomat Yang Jiechi, a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s powerful Politburo, and foreign minister, Wang Yi.Cui, who was China’s top envoy in the US from 2013 until stepping down in June, said Sino-US relations were unlikely to improve in the near future.“The current stage of history in US-China relations will continue for quite some time, and the US will not willingly accept the rise of a power with a very different social system, ideology, cultural traditions and even ethnicity,” Cui said.The US announced a diplomatic boycott of the upcoming 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing in December, less than a month after Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden talked about avoiding conflict and jointly responding to global challenges like climate change.The two leaders had met for more than 200 minutes via video link in November, the first such meeting since Biden became president in January.Ties between the countries in recent years have been deeply acrimonious over wide-ranging issues including alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet, Beijing’s crackdown on the democracy protests in Hong Kong and US’s ties with self-ruled Taiwan, which China sees as interference in its internal matters, and trade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exchinese-envoy-warns-china-on-us-ties-takes-a-dig-at-wolf-warrior-diplomacy-101642069378373.html

He recommended the measure for high-exposure groups, people in outbreak areas and on public transport.Yuen Kwok-Yung, a renowned microbiologist, told local radio that people with chronic diseases or who can’t receive Covid vaccines, along with high-risk workers such as airport staff, could also consider double-masking, which helps boost filtering capabilities.The advice comes as omicron is suspected to have spread at events where people were already wearing masks. Hong Kong, which along with mainland China is the last place still adhering to a strict Covid-Zero policy, is in partial lockdown for two weeks with gyms, cinemas, primary schools and kindergartens shut after dozens of locally-transmitted cases of omicron were detected. The call to use more mask protection against omicron isn’t unique to Hong Kong. In the U.S., the potential for a new recommendation from health regulators is unleashing a scramble for higher-quality N95 masks and boosting prices. Yuen said there’s no need yet for the wide adoption of N95 masks in Hong Kong given the low case count. N95 masks are more expensive and more difficult to breathe in for everyday use, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wear-two-masks-to-keep-omicron-at-bay-hong-kong-experts-say-101642066539330.html
13-01-2022||World||Russia-led troops begin withdrawal from Kazakhstan||Over 2,000 Russia-led troops began withdrawing from Kazakhstan after being deployed when peaceful protests over an energy price hike turned into unprecedented violence claiming dozens of lives.The decision to despatch peacekeepers was a first for the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), often touted by Russia as a NATO equivalent but previously reluctant to interfere in unrest in Central Asia -- a region with long historical ties to Russia.At a ceremony marking the end of the CSTO mission, soldiers lined up as anthems from each of the six CSTO member countries were played before official speeches began."The peacekeeping operation is over ... the tasks have been fulfilled," said Russian General Andrei Serdyukov, commander of the CSTO contingent that saw troops from Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan sent to the former Soviet republic on January 6.The Russian defence ministry said the "collective peacekeeping forces ...are starting to prepare equipment and materiel for loading into the planes of the military transport aviation of the Russian aerospace forces and returning to the points of permanent deployment"Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said on Wednesday that Russian and allied forces "played a very important role in terms of stabilising the situation in the country" during his first visit to the country's main city, Almaty.The financial hub of 1.8 million people was devastated during clashes between security forces and government opponents that gave way to a spree of looting.Claims of foreign meddling"Without a doubt, it was of great psychological importance in repelling the aggression of terrorists and bandits. The mission can be considered very successful," he added.One of the strategic buildings that the CSTO contingent was guarding was Almaty airport, which was reportedly seized by government opponents last week.The airport's press service said that it was handling both domestic and international flights again on Thursday.AFP correspondents earlier Thursday witnessed a funeral for a serviceman killed during the clashes which was attended by dozens of soldiers and featured sombre military music.Tokayev has framed the clashes as a coup attempt assisted by local and international terrorists.Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin hinted that the violence was reminiscent of "colour revolutions" instigated by foreign meddling.Those narratives resonated with some residents of Almaty, despite the lack of proof provided by authorities.'Provoked by West'Retired engineer Malik Shaimukhambetov blamed the shootouts in his city on "foreign aggression", which he said had subverted state troops and allowed gangs to seize government buildings."I see these events as a kind of orange revolution provoked by the west," Shaimukhambetov said, referring to political protests that erupted in Ukraine in 2004.Tokayev said the phased withdrawal of the foreign troops would take no more than 10 days.Concern had mounted that Moscow could leverage the mission to shore up its influence in Kazakhstan.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier warned that "once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave".Last week's violence in Kazakhstan erupted on the back of peaceful demonstrations over a rise in fuel prices and against a background of deteriorating living standards and endemic corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russialed-troops-begin-withdrawal-from-kazakhstan-101642063903751.html

It approved the use of Novavax Inc's vaccine on Wednesday.Since the pandemic began, the country of 52 million people has been among the coronavirus mitigation success stories, with 679,030 cases in all and 6,210 deaths, achieved largely with masks and social distancing.The KDCA reported another record for imported COVID-19 cases for Wednesday, at 391, among a tally for the day of 4,167 infections.The number of South Koreans who tested positive after attending a consumer electronics trade show https://www.reuters.com/business/skorean-officials-test-positive-covid-19-after-attending-ces-trade-show-us-2022-01-12 in Las Vegas last week rose to 119, including some Omicron cases, a KDCA official said.The Omicron variant makes up a small fraction of its overall cases but the share has more than tripled to about 12.5% over the past two weeks.Health officials have warned it could this month become dominant, as it has in the United States and much of Europe, and daily tallies could soar up to an unprecedented 20,000 next month.The government will decide on Friday whether to extend social distancing rules https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/skorea-extend-curbs-amid-omicron-surge-serious-covid-19-cases-2021-12-31, which were reinstated in mid-December after daily infections hit new highs of nearly 8,000.Nearly 90% of South Korean adults have been fully vaccinated and 55% have had a booster shot as of Wednesday, KDCA data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-to-deploy-pfizer-covid-19-pills-as-omicron-wave-looms-101642063883371.html

According to Our World in Data, the US has been reporting a seven-day rolling average of 2,240 Covid cases while the average daily infections in the United Kingdom currently stands at 22,90.The daily Covid cases in Britain peaked around January 5 as the country’s healthcare system was under tremendous pressure due to record-high hospitalisation. On the other hand, the United States is still to reach the peak of its Omicron-driven Covid wave. The US is currently seeing an average of 750,000 cases a day and more than 1,600 daily deaths. The current virus-related hospital admissions are over 150,000, up by nearly 20 per cent from the previous week, according to The Washington Post figures."Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody," Joe Biden's chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci predicted Tuesday.With more than 15 million Covid cases reported last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the Omicron variant is dangerous, especially so for those who have not been vaccinated."While Omicron causes less severe disease than Delta, it remains a dangerous virus -- particularly for those who are unvaccinated," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference."We mustn't allow this virus a free ride or wave the white flag, especially when so many people around the world remain unvaccinated."India, meanwhile, reported 247,417 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, taking the cumulative tally to 36,317,927, according to the Union health ministry's data as per Thursday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-uk-reporting-similar-average-daily-covid-cases-per-million-101642052407429.html

Symptoms include bruising or excessive or unusual bleeding, according to the agency.The changes to the fact sheet include recommendations to vaccination providers about giving the J&J shot to people with existing medical conditions, including those who have a low level of platelets, a type of blood cell that helps stop bleeding.J&J said in a statement that “individuals who have been previously diagnosed with ITP should talk to their health-care provider regarding the risk of ITP and the potential need for platelet monitoring following vaccination.”J&J’s vaccine has also been previously connected to rare but serious blood clots, a condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS. Women ages 30 to 49 were at the highest risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.So far, about 17 million Americans have been given the one-dose vaccine. Last month, the CDC recommended messenger RNA vaccines made by Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. for use in adults over J&J’s shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jj-vaccine-gets-additional-warning-on-bleeding-aide-effect-101642051271715.html
13-01-2022||World||Explained: Why Wordle game is in news and how to play it||The newest craze on social media is Wordle, a website-only game launched in October last year. While the users have been happy with Wordle, posting their daily scores on Twitter and other platforms, the game has been in the news for wrong reasons.Several developers have created identical versions (or clones) to cash in on surging demand for the game, and unsuspecting users have been downloading these app versions, hence pushing the downloads up for clone apps.But Apple cracked down on these attempts, removing these knockoffs of the original game from its App Store.But what is the game all about? And how can we play it? Here’s everything you need to know about Wordle:The game was created by former Reddit software engineer Josh Wardle, originally for his partner Palak Shah, as reported by NPR. The game can only be played on its official website and does not have a mobile app.It’s a once-a-day online word game and gives a player six chances to guess the day's secret word, which has five letters.The aim is to figure out the secret word with the fewest guesses. If a player successfully guesses the word, he is prompted to post his/her score on social media along with the number of tries.The gameplayAfter guessing a five-letter word, the game tells you whether the letters chosen by you are correct or not. The tiles keep changing colours to shows letters which are not in the word (gray), those present in the word but in wrong position (yellow) and words with right position (green).The word of the day is same for everyone and people can play it only once a day.There is also a “hard mode” on the Wordle website where the game wants the player to use yellow or green letter in subsequent guesses.What’s different in Wordle than other games?Wordle is a free-to-use, ad-less experience on a simple website that does not have to be downloaded from Apple's App Store or Google's PlayStore.Wardle says that the game also doesn’t require sign ups with emails, or personal information, thereby making it safe. As soon as the official website opens, the game appears as a pop-up.Meteoric riseWardle created the game for his partner, and played with her and family members for a few months. After seeing the positive response from his family, the developer released it on a website for the public.From 90 users on November 1, Wordle has been played by 300,000 people in just over two months, according to New York Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-wordle-game-is-in-news-and-how-to-play-it-101642049384907.html

Lawyers of Prince Andrew had moved a motion to dismiss the complaint by accuser Virginia Giuffre, but New York judge Lewis Kaplan denied the motion “in all respects".Giuffre alleges that late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein lent her out for sex with his wealthy and powerful associates, including Andrew. The lawyers of the Duke urged the judge to throw out the suit based on the previous $500,000 settlement between Giuffre and Epstein in 2009., saying the accuser had "waived her rights" to sue other defendants in relation to alleged sex crimes committed by Epstein.The New York judge, in his 46-page decision, noted that the deal was "riddled with drafting problems and ambiguities.""The parties have articulated at least two reasonable interpretations of the critical language. The agreement therefore is ambiguous," Kaplan wrote.The decision of the New York judge has caused further embarrassment to the British monarchy and piled up pressure on the Duke to relinquish his military roles. Royal biographer Phil Dampier opined that Prince Andrew is “finished as a working royal”, reported The Sun Online.“It was suggested he would try and get back this year for the 40th anniversary of the Falklands events but that's not going to happen for him the way this is going. It wouldn't surprise me if, in time, he loses his military patronages," The Sun Online quoted Dampier as saying.Andrew's attorneys can still ask the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn Kaplan's decision. If the appeals court upholds the decision, the lawyers could take the case to the US Supreme Court. But legal analysts are skeptical about whether justices would choose to hear it, reported AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/finished-as-working-royal-uncertainty-over-prince-andrew-s-future-after-us-court-decision-in-sexual-assault-case-101642047777378.html
13-01-2022||World||Ex-envoy warns China on US ties, takes a dig at 'wolf warrior diplomacy'||China has been battling a difficult economic situation and its aggressive policies have been increasing tensions in the neighbourhood. This quagmire has led to concerns among Chinese diplomats and experts about the dragon’s relations with the United States.Such concerns were highlighted by China’s longest serving ambassador to the United States, Cui Tianki. Nikkei drew attention to the comments made by Cui at a symposium last month at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, which is used to entertain foreign dignitaries. The candid remarks were peppered with words like “careless” and “incompetent”, noted Nikkei in which Cui asserted that China must be very vigilant while dealing with the US.Taking a dig at China’s “wolf warrior diplomacy”, the diplomat urged China to stop being swayed by US provocations."In principle, we should not fight a war we are not prepared for, a war we are not sure of winning, a war of anger and attrition,” Cui said in the remarks made at the symposium on December 20."In the face of complex situations, we must always have the country at large in mind, and not always think about being an internet celebrity," Cui further said, as reported by Nikkei.The Japan-based newspaper noted that by presenting a sharp analysis of problems with China's diplomacy, Cui differed from other diplomats who play up to President Xi Jinping.The words of caution come against the backdrop of Biden administration's strengthening of ties with allies such as Britain, Japan, Australia and China's neighbour India.China's current tough line on the US has been spearheaded by top diplomat Yang Jiechi, a member of the Chinese Communist Party's powerful Politburo, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.Speaking at the same event, Wang Yi said China welcomed mutually beneficial cooperation and healthy competition with the US, but was not afraid of confrontation.Cui's message was that China's current diplomacy is missing the grand picture as it busily engages in a war of words, said Nikkei. Instead of tit-for-tat slapping of sanctions, Cui said it would be more prudent for China to establish an environment that allows American companies to remain and flourish in the country, rather than allow firms like Apple and Intel to head back home.Chui served as Chinese ambassador to the US for eight long years, before heading home in June 2021. He observed changes in United States’ China policy under three presidents - Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden. He was given an extension by Xi because of the good access Cui had built to the family and inner circle of US President Trump.By the time Cui left Washington, the relations between the US and China had plunged into crisis. The situation was so harsh that he was even denied meeting with major US leaders to bid them farewell.Hence, the remarks by one of Xi’s most trusted diplomat resonated across China. He said the leadership has locked itself in a "war of attrition" without making careful preparations, driven by emotion, noted Nikkei.Discussions have been going on in China about mending the ties with the US, the most significant of China’s bilateral ties. In 2020, the bilateral trade volume was $615.2 billion, including exports to the US worth $452.58 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exenvoy-warns-china-on-us-ties-takes-a-dig-at-wolf-warrior-diplomacy-101642046599646.html

While 107,000 Covid vaccine doses were administered on Tuesday, Dube said, appointments for the first dose were taken by people from all age groups.Quebec Premier Francois Legault earlier announced that the province will impose a new health tax in the coming weeks on unvaccinated individuals.The French-speaking province is struggling to control the highly contagious Omicron variant of coronavirus and the government says that the unvaccinated remain a burden on its public health system. While Quebec has administered the first dose of the Covid vaccine to 90 per cent of its eligible population, Legault stressed that the remaining 10 per cent of Quebecois must not harm others."We are working on a health contribution for all the adults who are refusing to get vaccinated" because they represent a "financial burden for all Quebecois," Legault told a press conference."It is not on all Quebecois to pay for that," he said.The provincial government is yet to reveal the details of the penalty to be levied on unvaccinated people but, according to Legault, it wanted the tax to represent a "significant amount".Rights and medical experts have raised concerns about the proposal to fine the unvaccinated. While Canada's Civil Liberties Association said it could violate Canadians' fundamental rights, health advocates expressed concern about its broader implications."I've not seen anything like this in Canada before. I'm worried about the precedent it would set," said Danyaal Raza, a doctor with Unity Health in Toronto and former chair of Canadian Doctors for Medicare, as quoted by Reuters.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/its-encouraging-unvaccinated-tax-in-canada-s-quebec-leads-to-spike-in-first-dose-appointments-101642040787479.html
13-01-2022||World||Fact checkers say YouTube lets its platform be 'weaponized'||More than 80 fact checking organizations are calling on YouTube to address what they say is rampant misinformation on the platform.In a letter to CEO Susan Wojcicki published Wednesday, the groups say the Google-owned video platform is “one of the major conduits of online disinformation and misinformation worldwide.” YouTube's efforts to address the problem, they say, are proving insufficient.“What we do not see is much effort by YouTube to implement policies that address the problem,” the letter says. “On the contrary, YouTube is allowing its platform to be weaponized by unscrupulous actors to manipulate and exploit others, and to organize and fundraise themselves.” The problem, these groups said, is especially rampant in non-English speaking countries and the global south.The fact checkers are all members of the International Fact Checking Network and include Rappler in the Philippines, Africa Check, Science Feedback in France and dozens of other groups. They lambasted YouTube, saying it frames discussions about disinformation as a “false dichotomy" of deleting or not deleting content.Displaying fact-checked information is more effective than deleting content, the fact checkers wrote. They propose that YouTube focuses on providing context and debunks that are “clearly superimposed” on videos. They also called for YouTube to act against repeat offenders and beef up efforts against misinformation in languages other than English.In a statement, YouTube spokesperson Elena Hernandez said the company has “invested heavily in policies and products in all countries we operate to connect people to authoritative content, reduce the spread of borderline misinformation, and remove violative videos.” She called fact checking “a crucial tool to help viewers make their own informed decisions,” but added that it is “one piece of a much larger puzzle to address the spread of misinformation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fact-checkers-say-youtube-lets-its-platform-be-weaponized-101642037997469.html

As we assess the issue today, the lockdowns are most likely to have an effect isolated in China, because the production facilities in those geographies are principally suppliers to the Chinese market," Deese said on Wednesday.The Chinese government imposed lockdowns in Anyang, Henan province following the emergence of Omicron Covid-19 variants in the city, which has a population of over 5 million people.The lockdown duration is yet to be announced and will be declared separately at a future date.Anyang is the second Chinese city to announce cases from the Omicron variant, following reported cases in Tianjin in December.

The action comes after at least two known North Korean ballistic missile tests.Watch: Why the world is worried by North Korean missile testsThe sanctions by the US treasury department target six North Koreans, one Russia and one Russian firm. The department said that they were responsible for procuring goods for the programs from Russia and China.The US Treasury further said that the steps were aimed at preventing the advancement of North Korea's programs as well as impeding its attempts to proliferate weapons technologies.In last one week, North Korea has launched two hypersonic missiles, with its reclusive leader Kim Jong-un urging the military to make more military advances.Kim was even present for the latest test, which was reported by Japan on Tuesday. After watching the test, he urged military scientists to "further accelerate the efforts to steadily build up the country's strategic military muscle both in quality and quantity and further modernise the army," according to KCNA news agency.While announcing the sanctions, the US treasury department said that North Korea has conducted six ballistic missile launches since September, each of which violated UN Security Council resolutions. All ballistic missile tests by North Korean are banned under these resolutions. Under secretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence Brian Nelson said in a statement that the moves targeted North Korea's "continued use of overseas representatives to illegally procure goods for weapons."North Korea's latest launches were "further evidence that it continues to advance prohibited programs despite the international community's calls for diplomacy and denuclearization," Nelson further said in the statement.The individuals against whom the US has imposed sanctions are:• Choe Myong Hyon, a Russia-based representative of North Korea’s Second Academy of Natural Sciences (SANS)• Sim Kwang Sok, a North Korean based in China, who worked to procure steel alloys• Kim Song Hun, another North Korean based in China (in Shenyang), procured software and chemicals• Two more China-based North Koreans, Kang Chol Hak and Pyon Kwang Chol• Russia-based North Korean O Yong Ho, who the treasury department said worked with other sanctioned nationals and firms to procure multiple goods with ballistic missile applications, including Kevlar thread, aramid fiber, aviation oil, ball bearings, and precision milling machines.• Russian national Roman Anatolyevich AlarThe Russian firm sanctioned by the US treasury department is Parsek LLC.North Korea's UN mission, Russia and China's embassies in Washington and the Russian firm have so far not responded to the US action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-missile-launch-us-sanctions-russian-national-6-others-101642037028268.html
13-01-2022||World||As Delta retreats experts warn darker days lie ahead for US hospitals||The highly infectious omicron variant has flushed out the delta strain across the US, but the ascendance of the purportedly milder form of Covid-19 has done nothing so far to ease the burden on stretched hospitals.The omicron variant represents about 98% of cases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday. That number is based on data for the week ending Jan. 8 and is a significant increase from just two weeks prior, when omicron accounted for 71.3% of cases. Omicron’s heightened transmissibility coupled with the immunity some have built to combat the delta through vaccination and exposure, have made conditions favor the “more mild” variant, said David Wohl, a professor at the Institute of Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. But experts warn that for those who remain unvaccinated or who suffer from other health concerns, infection from any Covid-19 variant is a major concern. And without intervention, data signal dark days ahead for a health care system already stretched to its limit, they say. Explained: Why you should still try to avoid Omicron infectionIn many parts of the US, the health care system is “collapsing under the weight of Covid patients,” said Neil Sehgal, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. “I started to question whether or not this was the week the health care system would break.”The most recent CDC Nowcast data predict that omicron is dominating caseloads in every region of the country. And while infections appear to be peaking in places that were hit early, such as New York City, the majority of cities are continuing to see infections eclipse previous records and hospitalizations skyrocket. In Maryland, where Sehgal works, some hospitals have moved to crisis standards of care – meaning they have halted certain elective surgeries and redistributed staff. Hospitals in several other states, including Colorado and Oregon, have declared similar crises. Sehgal said that on Tuesday the Maryland Hospital Association pleaded with the public for better adherence to preventative measures, such as masking, and again pushed for vaccinations. Some places are reinstating safety protocols to try to ease the burden on local hospitals. As cases exploded in Utah last week, Salt Lake County health director Angela Dunn issued a county-wide mask mandate, taking the additional step of requiring respirator-type masks, like KN95s, KN90s or KF94s. The county said they would provide the masks at no cost to those who needed them.Preserving the capacity of the healthcare system is crucial, Sehgal said.  “If we don’t act now and we don’t act decisively, it will be too late,” Sehgal said. “Today’s cases are next week’s hospitalizations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-delta-retreats-experts-warn-darker-days-lie-ahead-for-us-hospitals-101642036997928.html
13-01-2022||World||Omicron a ‘welcome’ variant, says Brazil's Bolsonaro amid surge||Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro said the omicron strain that’s causing a surge in Covid cases at home and abroad could be called a “vaccine virus” and is a “welcome” variant.“Some studious and serious people -- and not linked to pharmaceutical companies -- say that omicron is welcome and can in fact signal the end of the pandemic,” Bolsonaro said Wednesday in an interview with Gazeta Brasil website.Bolsonaro has stood out globally for his defiant stance in the face of the pandemic, repeatedly dubbing it “a little flu” despite the more than 600,000 Brazilians who have died from the virus in the past two years. The president, who is up for re-election this year, has been digging in to his position against vaccines. He vowed to not allow his daughter to receive the shot and promised to continue to fight against lockdowns, even as omicron makes landfall in the country, causing cases to surge past 70,000 a day. For most of December, daily infections rarely surpassed the 10,000 mark. What We Know About the Omicron Variant Now: QuickTakeThe rising Covid cases following year-end holidays have filled emergency rooms across the continent-sized nation and led to a massive jump in demand for tests. On Wednesday, private laboratories, hospitals and pharmacy chains like Rede D’Or Sao Luiz SA, Diagnosticos da America SA and Raia Drogasil SA said they were limiting the amount of tests available to the general public, prioritizing hospitalized patients with more severe symptoms, health-care professionals and essential services workers. But while hospitalizations have ticked higher in Brazil in recent weeks, so far there hasn’t been an onslaught of patients seeking intensive care units like in mid-2021, before vaccines were widely available. It’s a similar pattern to that seen in countries from Argentina to South Africa and Denmark, and one that has fueled a change to how some nations approach the pandemic. Despite the seemingly more mild effects of the variant, medical experts warn it could still overburden hospitals and health systems because of how quickly it spreads. Omicron, first spotted in November, has become the dominant strain in many places, including the U.K., U.S., and Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-a-welcome-variant-says-brazil-s-bolsonaro-amid-surge-101642036660002.html
13-01-2022||World||US inflation reaches highest level in four decades as consumer prices jump 7%||Inflation jumped at its fastest pace in nearly 40 years last month, a 7% spike from a year earlier that is increasing household expenses, eating into wage gains and heaping pressure on President Joe Biden and the Federal Reserve to address what has become the biggest threat to the U.S. economy.Prices rose sharply in 2021 for cars, gas, food and furniture as part of a rapid recovery from the pandemic recession. Vast infusions of government aid and ultra-low interest rates helped spur demand for goods, while vaccinations gave people confidence to dine out and travel.As Americans ramped up spending, supply chains remained squeezed by shortages of workers and raw materials and this magnified price pressures.The Labor Department reported Wednesday that a measure of inflation that excludes volatile food and gas prices jumped 5.5% in December, also the highest in decades. Overall inflation rose 0.5% from November, down from 0.8% the previous month.Price gains could slow further as snags in supply chains ease, but most economists say inflation won’t fall back to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon.“U.S. inflation pressures show no sign of easing,’’ said James Knightley, chief international economist at the financial services company ING. “It hasn’t been this high since the days of Thatcher and Reagan. We could be close to the peak, but the risk is that inflation stays higher for longer.’’High inflation isn't only a problem for the U.S. In the 19 European countries that use the euro currency, inflation rose 5% in December compared with a year earlier, the biggest increase on record.Companies large and small are adapting as best they can.Nicole Pomije, a bakery owner in the Minneapolis area, said she plans to raise prices for cookies because of surging ingredient costs.Her basic cookies were priced at 99 cents each, while premium versions were selling for $1.50 each. But Pomije said she will have to jack up the prices of her basic cookies to the premium price.“We have to make money,” she said. “We don’t want to lose our customers. But I think we might.”Businesses struggling to hire have hiked pay, but rising prices for goods and services have eroded those income gains for many Americans. Lower-income families have felt it the most, and polls show that inflation has started displacing even the coronavirus as a public concern.The United States hasn’t seen anything like it since the early 1980s. Back then, Fed Chair Paul Volcker responded by pushing interest rates to painful levels — the prime rate for banks’ best customers hit 20% in 1980 — and sent the economy into a deep recession. But Volcker succeeded in taming inflation that had been running at double-digit year-over-year levels for much of 1979-1981.High inflation has put President Biden on the defensive. His administration, echoing officials at the Fed, initially suggested that price increases would be temporary. Now that inflation has persisted, Biden and some congressional Democrats have begun to blame large corporations. They say meat producers and other industries are taking advantage of pandemic-induced shortages to drive up prices and profits. But even some left-of-center economists disagree with that diagnosis.On Wednesday, the president issued a statement arguing that the drop in gas prices in December and a smaller increase in food costs showed progress.One trend experts fear is a wage-price spiral. That happens when workers seek more pay to offset higher costs, and then companies raise costs further to cover that higher pay. On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a Senate panel that he has yet to see evidence that wages are broadly driving up prices across the economy.The biggest driver of inflation, according to economists, are mismatches between supply and demand. Used car prices have soared more than 37% over the past year because a shortage of semiconductors has prevented auto companies from making enough new cars. Supply-chain constraints have driven furniture prices nearly 14% higher over the past year.Shoppers are feeling the pinch all around them, from the gas station to the grocery store.Vicki Bernardo Hill, 65, an occupational therapist in Gaithersburg, Maryland, says she no longer throws extra canned food, boxes of cereal or bakery items into her shopping cart at the Giant Food store.“I am trying to stick to my list and buying things that are on sale, ” said Hill.Because she couldn't find a good deal on a used car, Hill recently bought a new Mazda, spending $5,000 more than she had planned.Inflation could ease as the omicron wave fades and as Americans shift more of their spending to services such as travel, eating out and movie-going. That would reduce the demand for goods and help clear supply chains.But some higher prices, such as rents, could prove to be stickier. Rental costs, which have accelerated since summer, rose 0.4% in December, the third consecutive monthly increase. That's significant because housing costs make up one-third of the government's consumer price index.Powell told Congress that if it becomes necessary to fight high inflation more aggressively, the Federal Reserve is prepared to accelerate the interest rate hikes it plans to begin this year. The Fed's benchmark short-term rate, now pegged near zero, is expected to be bumped up at least three times this year.Rate increases would make borrowing for a home or car more expensive, and therefore help to cool off the economy.Some economists and members of Congress fear the Fed has acted too slowly to head off inflation and that this could eventually force even sharper rate increases that could damage the economy.Republicans in Congress and even some liberal economists say Biden deserves at least some of the blame for high inflation, arguing that the financial rescue package he pushed through Congress last March added significant stimulus to an already strengthening economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-inflation-reaches-highest-level-in-four-decades-as-consumer-prices-jump-7-101642035750989.html
13-01-2022||World||Kim urges more ‘military muscle’ after missile test||Kim Jong-un personally oversaw the successful test of a hypersonic missile, state media said on Wednesday, and urged North Korea to press ahead with building more “strategic military muscle” despite international sanctions over its nuclear weapons programme.Pictures in state media showed Kim using binoculars to observe the second missile launch by the nuclear-armed nation in less than a week.Hypersonic missiles are listed among the “top priority” tasks for strategic weapons development in North Korea’s five-year plan. After the launch, Kim said North Korea must “further accelerate the efforts to steadily build up the country’s strategic military muscle both in quality and quantity and further modernise the army”, according to North Korea’s news agency KCNA. The Tuesday test, which came as the UN Security Council met in New York to discuss Pyongyang’s weapons programme, sparked swift condemnation, with the US state department branding it a “threat... to the international community”.It was the third reported North Korean test of a hypersonic gliding missile. The first, which took place four months ago, was followed by one last week. KCNA said the most recent test demonstrated “the superior manoeuvrability of the hypersonic glide vehicle”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-urges-more-military-muscle-after-missile-test-101642029182214.html
13-01-2022||World||Reduced hospitalisation risk, shorter stays for Omicron patients: US study||A preliminary US study of nearly 70,000 Covid positive people showed a substantially reduced risk of hospitalisation and death from Omicron even after controlling for growing population immunity levels.People infected with Omicron were half as likely to be hospitalised, about 75 percent less likely to need intensive care, and around 90 percent less likely to die compared to those infected with the formerly dominant Delta variant, according to the paper.Of some 52,000 people infected with Omicron, none ended up on a ventilator, compared to 11 people from nearly 17,000 with Delta.Hospital stays lasted for a median of 1.5 days for Omicron compared to five days for Delta, and 90 percent of Omicron patients were discharged in three or fewer days.The analysis was conducted on data from the Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospital system, which serves a population of around 4.7 million people, between November 30, 2021, and January 1, 2022, when both strains were circulating widely.The findings build on accumulating population-level research from countries including South Africa and Britain, but also on animal and human tissue-based testing, which have found Omicron replicates better in the upper airways compared to the lungs.The new paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was carried out by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, Kaiser Permanente and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."This study controlled for important key parameters such as age, sex, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, prior vaccination and comorbidities," CDC director Rochelle Walensky told reporters on a briefing call Wednesday.The results thus suggest that Omicron is "intrinsically less severe than Delta," and observed reductions in severe cases aren't only the result of more people being vaccinated and infected over time, the paper said.In addition, while the study noted reduced vaccine efficacy against infection from Omicron, it also found substantial ongoing protection against severe outcomes.Walensky warned that the results should not lead to complacency, since Omicron's extreme transmissibility is still stretching the United States' already over-extended health care system and its exhausted health workers.The country is currently seeing an average of 750,000 cases a day -- though that figure is soon expected to exceed a million -- around 150,000 total Covid hospitalisations, and more than 1,600 daily deaths.President Joe Biden's chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci predicted Tuesday that "Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody."But he added that after the country emerged from its current wave, it would transition towards a future of living with the virus, with Covid vaccines moderating severe disease for the majority and effective treatments available for the most vulnerable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reduced-hospitalisation-risk-shorter-stays-for-omicron-patients-us-study-101642034064236.html

It has provisions to help bolster Ukraine’s security and encourages the US to “consider all available and appropriate measures” to ensure the Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline - a “tool of malign influence of the Russian Federation” - does not become operational.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-russia-eye-more-talks-despite-tensions-101642033666644.html

It was not clear how much of the donated wheat would be used as direct humanitarian aid and how much to pay workers in Afghanistan.The expanding programme underlines the growing conundrum faced by the Taliban administration as cash in the country dries up and could raise questions among donors over the use of humanitarian aid for government purposes while strict restrictions remain on financial flows into the country.UN agencies on Tuesday asked donors for $4.4 billion in humanitarian aid for Afghanistan in 2022, calling the funds an “essential stop gap” to ensure the country’s future.“A full-blown humanitarian catastrophe looms. My message is urgent: don’t shut the door on the people of Afghanistan,” said UN aid chief Martin Griffiths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-pay-in-wheat-in-lieu-of-cash-as-economic-crisis-bites-101642028636492.html
13-01-2022||World||Inflation-fighting rate hikes could increase rich-poor divide, warns IMF||Central banks' interest rate hikes aimed at combating inflation could exacerbate a deepening, "dangerous divergence" between advanced and developing economies, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Wednesday.Inflation is not a universal phenomenon, Georgieva noted, but was a problem in a number of countries and especially the United States. U.S. consumer prices surged 7% in the 12 months to December, the largest annual increase in nearly four decades.The Federal Reserve and others have signaled that rate hikes may be imminent in 2022. The "spillover impact on emerging markets .... can add fuel to the fire of divergence," Georgieva said. Rate hikes in advanced economies raise the cost of borrowing and siphon away investments from emerging markets.Georgieva said in December the IMF was likely to downgrade global economic growth forecasts of 5.9% in 2021 and 4.9% this year due to slowing growth in the United States, China, and the Omicron variant; the revision is expected on Jan. 25."Yes, the recovery is likely to continue, but against stronger winds," she said Wednesday, citing inflation and growing debt levels. Social unrest seen in 2019 was also expected to re-emerge this year, which could pose challenges for policymakers, she added.The IMF is urging countries to keep building up their defenses against the current pandemic and future ones, she said. It is "hugely important" to ensure more diversified production of vaccines and reduce the reliance of Africa and other regions on imports.She said she expects increasing demand for IMF financing this year. The IMF's executive board is slated to discuss on Friday a new Resilience and Sustainability Trust lending instrument backed by the Group of 20 countries in October.The trust will allow rich IMF members to donate their share of $650 billion in new emergency reserves, or Special Drawing Rights, to a broader range of countries in need, including small island states and vulnerable middle-income countries.More details are expected during annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank this spring. (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; additional reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Heather Timmons and Jonathan Oatis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inflationfighting-rate-hikes-could-increase-rich-poor-divide-warns-imf-101642024846294.html
13-01-2022||World||Nigeria government ends Twitter ban after 7 months||Nigeria's government on Wednesday said it had ended its suspension of Twitter, seven months after banning the social media giant in a dispute over a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari.Nigeria halted Twitter operations in June after the company deleted a comment by Buhari, provoking an international outcry over freedom of expression.The government and Twitter have been in negotiations since over restoring the service based on a set of conditions, including Twitter registering its operations in Nigeria."The Federal Government of Nigeria directs me to inform the public that President Muhammadu Buhari... has approved the lifting of the suspension of Twitter operation in Nigeria effective from 12am tonight," a statement from the country's information technology development agency said.Agency director general, Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, who was also with the committee in negotiations with Twitter, said the social media giant had agreed to regulations to restore service.Those included establishing a legal entity in Nigeria, appointing a country representative and complying with tax obligations.Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.But it has said the block was deeply worrying and called free and open internet access a basic right.The ban shocked many in Nigeria, where Twitter had a major role in political discourse, with the hashtags #BringBackOurGirls after Boko Haram kidnapped nearly 300 schoolgirls in 2014, and #EndSARS during anti-police brutality protests in 2020.'Unscrupulous elements'Nigerian officials had criticised Twitter for deleting Buhari's comment while accusing the platform of allowing activities that threatened the country's existence.That was a reference to social media remarks by separatist agitators from the country's southeast, where a civil war five decades ago killed one million people."The immediate and remote cause of the suspension was the unceasing use of the platform by some unscrupulous elements for subversive purposes and criminal activities, propagating fake news, and polarising Nigerians," Abdullahi said.Twitter deleted a comment when Buhari had referenced Nigeria's civil war, in the context of a warning to those responsible for recent unrest in the country's southeast.After the ban, officials also referenced then Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's support for the #EndSARS protests last year in Nigeria against police brutality.About 40 million people or around 20 percent of Nigeria's population have a Twitter account, according to local researchers, and many used the platform for business.The United States, European Union and Canada were among those who joined rights groups in condemning the ban as damaging to freedom of expression in Africa's most populous country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nigeria-government-ends-twitter-ban-after-7-months-101642024580406.html

Meanwhile, IGP Kashmir Vijay Kumar visited the encounter site and special operation group (SOG) camp Nillow Kulgam, where besides interacting with Jammu and Kashmir Police, army and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel, he also reviewed the security grid and operational aspects.Kumar said, “The owner of the house — where Bhai was hiding — deliberately misled the search team by concealing the information of his whereabouts which led to collateral damage. Action under terror law will be taken against them.”Bhai, a top Pakistani JeM terrorist was active since 2018 in Shopian, Kulgam and its adjoining areas, said the police, adding, misleading information by the house owner led to the killing of the police constable — Rohit Chib — and injuries to three soldiers.“All the injured were rushed to the hospital. The condition of injured is stated to be stable,” police said. One AK-47 rifle, one pistol and two grenades were also recovered from the encounter site.Starting this year, 14 terrorists have been neutralized, out of which seven were foreign terrorists. As per the J&K Police official figures, last year, 171 terrorists were killed in Kashmir.

13-01-2022||India||“You give ticket to criminal and...’: Parrikar’s son Utpal pans Goa BJP leaders||PANAJI: Utpal Parrikar, the son of former union defence minister Manohar Parrikar on Thursday hit out at the BJP leadership in Goa, asserting that he will not sit quietly if the BJP gives the party ticket for the Panaji constituency to incumbent legislator Atanasio Monserrate.Utpal, who has been keen to contest from the seat represented by his father for more than 25 years, was reacting to BJP Goa in-charge Devendra Fadnavis’s remarks that just because an aspirant is the son of Manohar Parrikar or any leader, didn’t automatically qualify him for the BJP’s ticket. “The kind of politics that is happening in Goa, I cannot tolerate it. It is not acceptable to me. Are they suggesting that only winnability is the criteria (and that) integrity doesn’t matter? Character doesn’t matter? And you are going to give the ticket to a person who has criminal antecedents and we have to sit home quietly?” Utpal Parrikar said in comments to the media. “These are very important things and this is not only about Panaji. What is happening in the Goa political scene is not acceptable. It has to change. Which is what I am trying,” Utpal said.Utpal is up against Atanasio “Babush” Monserrate, a former Congressman who is facing a string of cases including rioting, rape dating as far back as 2008. In the 2019 assembly bypolls held after Parrikar’s death, Monserrate, then a Congress candidate defeated the BJP candidate Siddharth Kuncaliencar who was chosen over Utpal for the party ticket. Monserrate subsequently joined the Congress along with nine other Congress MLA including his wife Jennifer.Fadnavis’s comments on Utpal Parrikar were seen to indicate that he could be overlooked for the party’s ticket once again.“Manohar Parrikar did a lot of work to establish the BJP party in Goa. But just because you are Manohar Parrikar’s or anybody’s son doesn’t mean you will get a BJP ticket. If he/she has the work to show for it, then we think about it. But a decision regarding this is not taken by me, it will be taken by the parliamentary board,” Fadnavis had said. Utpal said that all the party workers and supporters who were with his father since 1994 (when Parrikar was first elected) were with him today.“If now you go on the field, you will see that the people who were with baba (his father) since 1994 and who have made the party what it is in Panaji are with me today. I am going to the people of Panaji and I was meeting them privately and now that elections are near, I am meeting them publicly. The workers who were with Manohar Parrikar are now with me. And with them, I am going ahead,” Utpal said. He however stopped short of saying that he will be contesting the upcoming elections saying that he will announce his decision at the right time. “I haven’t finalised yet. At the right time, I will decide,” Utpal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/you-give-ticket-to-criminal-and-parrikar-s-son-utpal-pans-goa-bjp-leaders-101642098061131.html

There were no casualties on our side.This was revealed by Lt-Gen B. C. Nanda, GOC, Northern Command, at a Press conference here today.Gen Nanda said Pakistani troops attacked with artillery some Indian defended locations at Saltaro ridge in the glacier area on Jan. 10 and 11 last.The attack continued for about 48 hours but no loss of life from the Indian side was reported, he said.The Pakistani troops have also been firing almost daily for the past many days in the Poonch-Rajouri sector in Jammu and Kashmir, he said.The Pakistani authorities are creating tension in Siachin and Poonch-Rajouri sectors "for reasons best known to them", the General added.He said Indian troops has been given strict instructions not to provoke Pakistani troops across the Line of Actual Control and act only in retaliation if they were fired upon from the other side.The General said there were 1,440 instances of Pakistani firing on our side on the northern border last year. The Indian forces retaliated by firing back. The Pakistani tactics could be termed as "harassment" because it was still not reconciled to the Simla agreement and also wanted to keep the Jammu and Kashmir issue alive in the world forum.Regarding Siachin, he said the Indian troops were guarding the borders from heights varying from 15,000 ft to 21,000 ft in harsh weather.He said those manning the border at such heights invariably lost weight and even their speech became slower. It was for this reason that the troops were not kept there for more than six months at a stretch.Talking about the attack in April last year, Gen Nanda said Pakistan occupied a post at a height of 21,140 ft and started firing on our helicopters and "our troops found it hard to survive for some time." Left with no option but to knock the enemy out, troops of the J and K Light Infantry led by Sub Bana Singh launched an assault and recaptured the post at the end of June.On Sept. 22 evening, Pakistan started massive artillery bombardment and then attacked in three columns led by their SSGs (like our commandos)."We stood ground and beat back the attack. The Pakistanis tried again the next night, but were again repulsed suffering heavy casualties. They lost 150 soldiers, while "we lost 24 men and 56 were injured.”The bodies of the Pakistani soldiers could not be collected because of the fear of firing from the Indian side and now these have been covered with a thick layer of snow, Gen Nanda said.On Oct. 7 again there was some activity followed by an attack. There was constant shelling and the whole area was full of pot holes.Gen Nanda said that in the Poonch sector, because of constant firing the Indian army had lost four jawans, with 15 injured, last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-jan-14-1988-another-pak-attack-in-siachin-repulsed-101642094062791.html
13-01-2022||India||Rakesh Tikait by his side, Raut says Sena will contest against Yogi in Ayodhya too||MUMBAI: Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena on Thursday reached out to prominent farmers’ leader Rakesh Tikait to gauge the pulse of farmers as it plans to contest upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray spoke to Tikait as Sena leader Sanjay Raut met the farm leader in Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar to seek “blessings” of the farmers in its fight in the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls.The Shiv Sena, which is planning to field candidates on around 50 to 100 seats in Uttar Pradesh, is banking on the support of farmers.Raut, who is on a visit to New Delhi and UP to mobilise party workers and chalk out its plan, said the party will contest elections at Mathura, Varanasi and against UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath in Ayodhya.Despite its thin presence in UP, Sanjay Raut said the Sena will win seats in the upcoming election, as a “change of power” is expected in the largest state in the country.Raut, who described his meeting with Tikait as “apolitical”, said they mostly discussed issues related to farmers. Thackeray in his phone conversation with Tikait spoke about the Maharashtra government’s policies to support the farmers. Thackeray also invited Tikait to visit Maharashtra, Raut said.“Both Uddhav ji and Rakesh Tikait had a long conversation and both leaders discussed farmers’ issues. We will never ask Tikait ji to enter electoral politics. But this country’s politics cannot function without the support of the farmers. Farmers decide who sits on the throne, and history has shown that once people come to power, they forget the farmers. [But] two months after coming to power, Uddhav ji wiped out the loans of the farmers,” Raut said at a press conference along with Rakesh Tikait.The farmers’ leader said he intended to visit Maharashtra soon. “He invited me to Maharashtra and said that we will discuss Maharashtra’s policies for agriculture and farmers. We will see their policy and spread it elsewhere in the country. We are not connected to politics. It is a political party’s job to contest an election. The Maharashtra government has always supported the farmers’ movement in Delhi. Whenever there was a bandh announced, it was followed in Maharashtra,” said Tikait.Sena’s Rajya Sabha MP added that the party will not enter into an alliance with any political party in UP. The Sena leader said it will win seats in UP in the upcoming elections. “We are confident that we will have a representation in the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly.” At the legislative assembly level in Uttar Pradesh, apart from getting one MLA elected in 1991, all of Sena’s previous attempts have drawn a blank.The party will also field a candidate in Ayodhya opposite chief minister Adityanath.“We are not here to contest against any one person alone. We are here to do our brand of politics and contest elections. Does it say in the Constitution that we cannot contest against some particular person? Yes, we will contest the election in Ayodhya,” said Raut when asked if Sena will field candidates against the Yogi Adityanath, who may contest from Ayodhya instead of Gorakhpur seat.The Shiv Sena is also expected to take up the Hindutva agenda in its campaign in Uttar Pradesh. Raut said that the Ram temple in Ayodhya is built after the court’s verdict and no political party can take its credit. “If they take the credit, Shiv Sena has a major role in it... We have never abandoned Hindutva. Now even Rahul Gandhi speaks of Hindus and Hindutvawadis,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rakesh-tikait-by-his-side-raut-says-sena-will-contest-against-yogi-in-ayodhya-too-101642093200538.html
13-01-2022||India||Cong should realise its leaders are not emperors of India: TMC leader||Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Mahua Moitra on Thursday hit out at the Congress, saying it should realise that its leaders are not "emperors of India" and added that had the grand old party discharged its duty well in Goa, there was no need for the TMC to enter the coastal state's poll fray to defeat the ruling BJP. She said the TMC is ready for an alliance in Goa as defeating the BJP is the "need of the hour", but added that the Congress should get off its "high horse" and wake up to its depleted strength. Moitra was reacting to senior Congress leader P Chidamabaram's assertion made earlier in the day that the Congress and the BJP are the two main contestants in Goa and if the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the TMC fielded candidates and secured some votes in the upcoming assembly polls, in effect they will be splitting the non-BJP vote. In an interview to PTI, Chidambaram also said that the TMC and the AAP do not have cadre base in constituencies in Goa and they attempt to build their parties through defections. Referring to the Congress leader's statements, Moitra said the fight in Goa is between the BJP and anti-BJP forces. "The anti-BJP forces in Goa today are Congress, AAP and TMC. Now, this is a fight between them. Neither of them can stake a claim that we are the only ones in the fray," she said. Moitra, who is TMC's desk-in-charge for Goa, said that all the three parties are in the fray in Goa, and this is the reality that the Congress should wake up to. "I think that it is important for people to realise that if Congress had done its job, there was no need for us (TMC) to be here. We are here because Congress could not do their job. Congress is a platform which is not adequate enough to defeat the BJP," she added. The TMC is ready for an alliance, Moitra said, adding, "We are saying come to the table and talk to us to see how we can defeat the BJP. This is the need of the hour." She said the people of Goan will respect the fact that the TMC is not sitting on a high horse and that the party has no ego. "TMC is saying if everybody come together we can defeat the BJP," she said. She said that Chidambaram and Congress leadership should realise that the time is ripe to fight the BJP and the time is also right for the Congress to get off its high horse and realise that it has not been able to fight this battle alone. Referring to Chidambaram's statement that the Congress was "dismayed" when the TMC "lured" its MLAs into its fold, Moitra said the Congress should not speak about defections as they have welcomed (BJP minister) Michael Lobo, BJP leader Delilah Lobo, former minister Carlose Almeida in the party. This attitude that if they do it, it is right and if everybody else does it then it is wrong does not suit the Congress. I would like to remind the Congress that all those people who find it impossible to have a fighting platform in the Congress are the ones who are coming to the TMC, she added. "By Congress' definition, (TMC supremo and West Bengal CM) Mamata Banerjee is a defector. By their definition, (YSR Congress chief and Andhra Pradesh CM) Jagan Reddy is a defector. But these are the people who are chief ministers and running the states. It is high time that Congress wakes up of its depleted strength and realise that they are not emperors of India," she added. "We appeal to the people of Goa, that we are here to offer an anti-BJP platform. We are open for an anti-BJP platform...we have said that, but if people think that they are emperors and they are doling out largesse, then fine we are there as a platform and Mamata Banerjee is anti-BJP leader," she said. Assembly polls for all 40 seats in Goa will be held on February 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-should-realise-its-leaders-are-not-emperors-of-india-tmc-leader-101642089275697.html
13-01-2022||India||Was detecting 1 out of 33 cases previously: IIT expert on India's Covid testing||The latest guideline of the Indian Council of Medical Research that only those who have symptoms of Covid-19 should get tested has got experts divided. IIT mathematician Manindra Agrawal said it is a correct approach as the wave is going to have a very large number of cases with "nearly all of them mild". It is better to focus resources towards those who need treatment instead of testing a very large number of people, Prof Manindra Agrawal tweeted."Some have argued that if we do not detect and isolate asymptomatic cases, they may infect a person with comorbidity causing serious illness. This is partly true. However, one needs to keep in mind that we were only detecting 1 out of 33 cases in India even with the previous strategy. So isolating some asymptomatic cases is not going to make any material difference in how the pandemic spreads or in protecting people with comorbidities," Prof Agrawal said.Some doctors are of the opinion that the transmission chain will not be broken if asymptomatic patients are not tested and isolated. "If you just presume that you are COVID positive without any test, you would not take isolation measures as strictly as you would have taken, if you had the confirmed report. Therefore, it is important that you get yourself tested and then go through strict isolation measures so that we can break the transmission chain," Dr Arvind Kumar, senior surgeon, Medanta hospital, told ANI."If anybody has an impression that it is like common flu, then we need to convince them otherwise, we are going to face serious problems because if a massive number of people get infections at the same time, we might be facing a situation like last year. It is best avoided," Dr Kumar said.According to the new testing guideline people who have cough, fever, sore throat, loss of taste or smell and breathlessness should be tested. Asymptomatic people, unless identified as high-risk, do not need to be tested, the ICMR has said. Apart from asymptomatic individuals, patients out of home isolation, discharged from Covid-19 facilities and those undertaking interstate domestic travel need not be tested.The testing number has come down, as a result of the new guideline, but case positivity rates in states have gone up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-testing-only-symptomatic-people-for-covid-right-strategy-what-experts-say-101642089092082.html

13-01-2022||India||NIA takes over Ludhiana court blast probe||NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday took over the probe into December 23 Ludhiana court blast, in which the alleged bomber Gagandeep Singh was killed while six people were injured. A senior official said on Thursday they took over the probe from Punjab police after the ministry of home affairs issued the notification. Initial investigations carried out by the Punjab police pointed to the role of Khalistani groups. Till now, the central anti-terror probe agency was informally assisting Punjab police in the probe for the past three weeks. Several inmates in Ludhiana Central Jail are learnt to have been interrogated as Gagandeep Singh, a dismissed police officer, was lodged there last year in a drug-related case.It is suspected that Gagandeep Singh came in touch with several Khalistani members in the prison including Ranjeet Singh Cheeta and Sukhwinder Boxer, who allegedly have links with Pakistani spy agency, ISI.NIA will also investigate the role of groups operating from other countries including Pakistan as it has the mandate to carry out investigations abroad and has a good database on Khalistani networks.Gagandeep Singh was dismissed from service in 2019 in connection with a drugs case and spent two years in jail. He was released in September this year.After the blast, he was identified on the basis of technical evidence including mobile location and later his family too recognized his body. Initial reports also suggested that banned outfit Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) is behind the blast after a key member of the group - Jaswinder Singh Multani was detained by German police on December 28 from Erfurt. However, the central agencies are yet to find any direct evidence about Multani’s involvement in the Ludhiana bomb blast but officials refused to rule anything out.Multani was earlier under investigation for terror-related incidents in Punjab in 2021 apart from allegedly sending consignments of weapons, explosives, drugs, pistols, and hand grenades with the help of Pakistan-based operatives. A close associate of US-based SFJ chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, Multani is known as an expert in radicalising Sikh youth to take part in extremist activities.A separate first information report (FIR) filed by NIA against Multani on December 30 stated that he was “in touch with an ISI operative Jibran and Pakistan-based smuggling network members Rana Taseem, Imran and others, and is actively pursuing a conspiracy to carry out attacks in Mumbai and other parts of India, with support of his Punjab-based associates under the instruction of ISI.”Some of Multani’s associates named in the NIA case include - Jagdish Singh Bhura of the Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), deputy chief of KZF Gurmeet Singh, who is also associated with SFJ, Ranjeet Singh Pakhoke of the Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF), Sukhdev Singh Heran and Hardeep Singh Nijjar of Babbar Khalsa International, and KTF members Paramjit Singh Pamma and Ranjeet Singh Neeta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-takes-over-ludhiana-court-blast-probe-101642088580192.html

However, the image is only manufactured and not real.The Wordle game is very simple. The players have six guesses to find a five-letter word of the day, which is chosen by the website everyday. With each guess, the colour of the tiles that appear in the game changes, indicating if a letter will be present in the word or not.Wordle 056 6/6 pic.twitter.com/T4eaGMEw3fIf a tile turns green, then the letter is in the correct position and if it turns yellow, the letter is still present in the word but only in a different position. A grey tile shows that the letter is not present on the word. After successfully guessing the word, twitter users share the results on the platform along with their score.It is this trend which Gandhi has used in his latest tweet. In the manufactured image which he had shared, words like “JUMLA”, “TAXES”, “HUMDO”, “JHOLA”, “SNOOP” and “PHOTO” could be seen, all of which he had used to criticise the ruling BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The picture also had the words “Guess who?” written at the top of the tiles.The jibe from Gandhi comes ahead of the assembly elections in five states, for which the election commission has announced the schedule. The Congress MP who was abroad on what the Congress called a “personal visit” since late December 2021 had reportedly returned from his trip on Sunday (January 9), news agency ANI reported citing party sources.

The organisers had promptly removed the unknown participant from the online event and university authorities said a full-fledged investigation into the incident is on. The online programme, organised every evening, is a therapy session during Covid time comprising songs, recitals and audio plays, the spokesman said. "We condemn this act of abusing the VC, but we would like to inform that he is the one who had brought in this culture of abusing people even at official meetings in past," Visva Bharati University Faculty Association office bearer Sudipto Bhattacharya said on Thursday. Alleging that VC's action had made the locals furious, he said "We would like to bring this to the attention of those who appointed the VC before something major happens". The SFI controlled students' body too condemned the incident and demanded that the person in question be identified. "Whatever be their grudge against the VC, this is against the spirit of Viva Bharati. One cannot insult his teacher," VBU SFI unit spokesman Somnath Sow said. A spokesman said the university will come up with stricter rules for its online events henceforth to prevent any repeat of the incident. During a purported conversation at the online session some abusive comments were made against the VC from an unknown account and Chakraborty was heard telling senior faculty members to remove and block all unidentified participants from the session. "First remove these unidentified participants. We will then restart the session," he was heard saying. "Please see to it that there is stricter regulation in future," the VC had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abusive-comments-against-visva-bharati-vc-at-online-event-101642082942930.html

In his letter, Rao also attached copies of local media reports about the incident.In response, Scindia, in a tweet, said, “We will examine the issue at our end & take necessary action. Passengers & staff at the airport will not face any further inconvenience.”Earlier in the day Rao had shared a copy of his letter to Scindia on Twitter. “In a shocking incident,@YSRCParty leaders have got water supply stopped to Tirupati intrntl Airport, staff qtrs & roads dug up. Highly condemnable. I've written to Civil Aviation Minister Scindia Ji seeking a high level probe into the incident,” he said.In his letter, Rao said that the Tirupati Municipal Corporation had “suddenly” stopped the supply of water at the airport and also dug up the roads leading to the residential quarters.“On Monday i.e January 10, Tirupati Municipal Corporation suddenly stopped water supply to the Airport and the residential quarters hours after Airport entry was denied to some members of the ruling YSRCP party the previous day,” he said.“This highhanded, vengeful and thoughtless action has inconvenienced hundreds of passengers who travel to and from Tirupati airport and has caused serious hardship to the families in residential quarters. Vengeful action did not stop at that. Roads leading to the residential quarters were suddenly dug up which prevented movement of vehicles including the private water tankers,” he added, demanding for an enquiry into the issue.However, he also highlighted that the civic body had said the disruptions were due to repairs but dismissed the explanation as “flimsy” and claimed it was an act of revenge.“Though the senior officials of the Tirupati Municipal Corporation claim that the supply disruption was due to repairs, this explanation is flimsy and everyone knows that this was done as a retaliatory measure by the local leaders of the YSRCP party,” he said.Further, he also said that the water supply to the airport and the residential quarters were restored within a day but the dug-up roads might take at least a week’s time to be repaired.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-examine-take-action-civil-aviation-ministry-on-alleged-water-supply-disruption-at-tirupati-airport-101642082435088.html
13-01-2022||India||Mumbai records 13,702 infections in 24 hours; 46,406 new infections in state||Mumbai on Thursday reported 13,702 new Covid-19 infections in a 16% fall from Wednesday's 24-hour tally. The case positivity rate stood at 21.73%. On Wednesday, Mumbai reported over 16,000 fresh cases.  For the last few days, Mumbai's 24-hour tally has been oscillating making it difficult for data scientists to figure out whether the third wave in the city is ebbing. After crossing the 20,000-mark, the city's 24-hour tally decreased to 19,474 and then it sharply fell to 13,648 cases. On Tuesday, it further fell to 11,647 cases.Maharashtra on Thursday reported 46,406 fresh infections and 36 deaths in the last 24 hours. This is a slight decrease from yesterday's 24-hour tally of 46,723. There were no new cases of the Omicron variant reported in Maharashtra. Till date, a total of 1,367 patients infected with Omicron variant have been reported in the state, and of these, 775 patients have been discharged following a negative RT PCR test, according to the state health bulletin.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday said there is no decline in Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra. "In the past two-three days, the reporting of COVID-19 cases might have come down. It may be because of the low testing. On Wednesday, the state has reported around 46,000 new COVID-19 cases. So, there is no indication of flattening of the curve in Maharashtra." The Indian Council of Medical Research has mandated that only symptomatic people will get tested for Covid. While this will naturally bring down the number of tests done in a day, it is likely to increase the test positivity rate as the majority of the people who will get tested will emerge as positive cases. As Mumbai's daily cases fell from 20,000 to 11,000, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar on Wednesday said the numbers of Covid-19 cases and Omicron cases were slowing down in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-sees-a-dip-in-daily-cases-13-702-infections-in-24-hours-101642082152914.html

About 15 passengers are reported to be in critical condition. A special train from Jalpaiguri reached the accident site at around 7 pm to take the injured to the hospital.Spoke to Railways Minister Shri @AshwiniVaishnaw and took stock of the situation in the wake of the train accident in West Bengal. My thoughts are with the bereaved families.

13-01-2022||India||‘Be ready for other Covid variants after Omicron': 3 things PM Modi emphasised in meeting with CMs||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said despite Covid-19 cases increasing in the country, there is no need to panic as whatever variant it may be, the way to fight it is vaccination. This was the first meeting of PM Modi with the chief ministers of the states and the UTs in 2022. The meeting comes on a day India recorded over 2.47 lakh fresh infections. "This is the third year of India's fight against the pandemic. India's victory is certain," PM Modi said in his closing remarks at the interaction with the chief ministers.Local containment, extensive vaccination and pro-active steps are the three major points PM Modi laid stress on. People may also try India's age-old wisdom of drinking kadha, PM Modi said. “It is not a medicine, but a tried-and-tested tradition of India,” PM Modi said. Talking about Omicron, the variant which is driving the present surge of the pandemic in India and the world, PM Modi said in the initial days of the Omicron outbreak, there was some doubt regarding Omicron. But now the situation is clear and countries like the United States are reporting 14 lakh cases in a day because of Omicron, PM Modi said."Now we have the experience of fighting the pandemic for two years. We must take into account the question of people's employment before we take any action. So, more focus should be on local containment. We should also ensure that maximum people should get treated in home isolation," PM Modi said. Several states and Union territories have announced night curfew and weekend curfew to contain the spread of the infection. "Our preparation should be ahead of all variants of Covid. After we tide over Omicron, we have to make preparation in place to fight other variants of the virus as well. And in this, states will cooperate with each other," PM Modi said.Calling out fake news regarding vaccination, PM Modi said there are many narratives like why vaccination is not stopping reinfection but people should not pay heed to all these as vaccination is the only sure-shot way to come out of the pandemic. It is India's pride that India's vaccines against Covid-19 have been globally acknowledged and India has achieved landmark vaccination figures even before India's vaccination drive completes a year, PM Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/be-prepared-for-other-covid-variants-after-omicron-pm-modi-in-meeting-with-cms-101642077603843.html

Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma presented the 24-year-old boxing star with an appointment letter at a ceremony in Guwahati. He assured her of a monthly sum of ₹100,000 - apart from her salary - that is meant to cover requirements for training. Sarma also said a road in Guwahati would soon be named after her. Borgohain is the second sportsperson from the state to be appointed a DSP in Assam Police as per a new sports policy. In February last year, top sprinter Hima Das was given the same honour. “We are very happy to appoint Borgohain in Assam Police. In the coming days, we expect that apart from pursuing her goals in her sport, she would also help boost the sports atmosphere in the state police force,” CM Sarma said. The chief minister said considering her age and abilities, Borgohain, who is now part of the training department of the state police, can steadily climb to a senior position once she completes graduation in the coming years. “This day will remain very memorable for me as I have joined Assam Police. I would like to thank the state government for this honour. In the coming days, I will try to do well in my sports and bring more glory to the state. I seek your blessings for all my future endeavours,” Borgohain said. The boxer from Barpathar in Golaghat district of Assam, who won a bronze medal in the welterweight category in the Tokyo Games in Japan, has publicly made it known that she’s not content with a bronze-medal finish and go all out for gold in the 2024 Olympics in Paris, France.

13-01-2022||India||Corona infectious for 20 minutes; close proximity: 2 major findings of new study||A new study conducted by the University of Bristol's Aerosol Research Centre has revealed that Coronavirus loses 90% of its ability to infect within 20 minutes of being exposed to the air. To be more specific, within the first five minutes after being exposed to air, the virus loses most of its ability to infect. As reported by the Guardian, the finding once again shows how important it is to maintain distance and mask up.“People have been focused on poorly ventilated spaces and thinking about airborne transmission over metres or across a room. I’m not saying that doesn’t happen, but I think still the greatest risk of exposure is when you are close to someone,” Prof Jonathan Reid, director of the University of Bristol’s Aerosol Research Centre and the study’s lead author, said.Explained: Why you should still try to avoid Omicron infectionThe study, published in medRxiv is yet to be peer-reviewed. To find out what actually happens to the virus after it is breathed out, the researchers, for the first time ever, developed an apparatus that allowed them to generate any number of tiny, virus-containing particles in a simulated environment. Before this, the assumptions about the longevity of the virus were based on studies, but this was the first simulated experiment that showed that the virus becomes ineffective very soon.As the virus leaves the lungs, which provides a relatively moist atmosphere for the virus, the viral particles start drying out. Also, the lower level of carbon dioxide outside the lungs increases the pH. Both these factors - the dryness and the increasing pH level -- make the virus comparatively ineffective.So what does the finding mean? Earlier data suggested that the virus particles remain infectious on surfaces; then it was found that the virus is airborne as well. But the finding of the Bristol study suggests that the spread of the infection occurs in close proximity. If in a group of friends meeting at a cafe, one person is Covid-infected, it is likely that the person will spread the infection to the friends who are in close proximity, rather than to the persons who are sitting on the other side of the cafe, experts explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infectious-for-20-minutes-after-it-s-exhaled-what-new-study-reveals-about-covid-spread-101642069753989.html

In principle, both states have agreed to consult opposition parties, student unions and other stakeholders on this issue on January 18,” Sarma said.Last year, the two chief ministers agreed to sort out the differences in a phased manner and decided to first focus on six of the 12 disputed areas along the inter-state border. The six areas that were taken up first for resolution are Tarabari, Gizang, Hahim, Boklapara, Khanapara-Pilangkata and Ratacherra. The areas fall in Kamrup, Kamrup (Metropolitan) and Cachar districts of Assam and West Khasi Hills, Ri Bhoi and East Jaintia Hills districts of Meghalaya. Both states set up regional committees comprising senior ministers after this broad agreement to visit the disputed areas and speak to local residents and other stakeholders. Earlier this month, the two state governments exchanged reports of their respective committees at a meeting in Shillong.“Mutual understanding between two governments on the border issue has to be ratified by other stakeholders. The government can’t take a decision on it on its own. We hope to sign a memorandum of understanding with Meghalaya within this month,” said Sarma.Meghalaya deputy chief minister Prestone Tynsong who was present at Wednesday’s meeting told reporters that the two chief ministers will meet again in the next 3-4 days, which will be followed by a meeting with union home minister Amit Shah.“Hopefully we would have a final agreement before January 21 (the 50th statehood day of Meghalaya) which will be made public,” he said.

13-01-2022||India||‘Cannot judge man by appearance’: Madras HC upholds death penalty of child rapist||CHENNAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday confirmed the death sentence awarded by a trial court to a 26-year-old man for raping and murdering a seven-year-old girl in Tamil Nadu’s Pudukottai district. A bench of justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran contemplated if they should reduce the sentence. “We were little hesitant initially to take away a life of a person by way of a judicial order and thought of converting the punishment into the one of life imprisonment,” the court said. But after carefully examining the case again, the justices drew in on late German dictator Adolf Hitler, religious texts of Quran, Bible, the Mahabharata and Tamil devotional singer Seergazhi S Govindarajan, besides various Supreme Court orders, and concluded that this was one of the rarest of rare cases for death penalty.“It is pertinent to mention here that everyone’s mind contains a liar, a cheat and a sinner and a man cannot be judged by his outer appearance, as Adolf Hitler, who ordered the execution of some eight million people and was responsible for the deaths of many millions more, hated cruelty to animals and was a vegetarian,” the order read. “If a person like the accused herein is allowed to survive in this world, he will definitely pollute the mind of other co-prisoners, who will be at the verge of release from jail in which he is confined. When the attitude of a man turns into the one of a beast having no mercy over other creatures, he should be punished and sent to the eternal world.”The facts of the case are that on 30 June 2020 around 3pm, the accused, Samivel alias Raja took the girl who belonged to a Scheduled Caste to a temple and then an isolated place committing the offence of aggravated penetrative sexual assult. Fearing that the child would reveal the crime, he dashed her head against a tree and also pierced her face and neck and threw her body into a dried pond in the village. He then covered the child’s body with leaves and shrubs to screen the evidence. The child’s father had filed a ‘missing child’ complaint with the local police.The prosecution, in order to substantiate the offence against the accused, had examined 18 witnesses, marked 38 documents and exhibited 8 Material Objects and on the side of the accused, neither any witness was examined nor documents marked. The Trial Court (Mahila Court, Pudukkottai) after analysing the evidence let in by the prosecution, found the accused guilty of the offence and three sentences for death by hanging, two rigorous imprisonment for seven years and a life imprisonment under sections of POCSO, IPC and the SC/ST Act. The accused file an appeal against the conviction. “In all fairness, we find that the judgment of the trial court fulfilled all the touchstone to determine that it is one of the rarest of rare cases for imposition of death sentence, as imposition of any other punishment much less life imprisonment is completely insufficient and inadequate and would not meet the ends of justice,” the court said in its orders. “Taking into consideration the brutality of attack, the barbaric manner in which the deceased child was murdered and the mental agony undergone by the parents, we find that except death sentence, no other sentence will be adequate.”

With this, the country’s Omicron tally reached 5,488.The health ministry data also showed that 2,162 Omicron patients recovered in the last 24 hours.Maharashtra continued its top position with 1,367 cases of the Omicron, followed by Rajasthan at 792, Delhi 549, Kerala 486 and Karnataka 479.Also Read | Explained: Why you should still try to avoid Omicron infectionSince being detected in South Africa in November last year, Omicron has spread very fast across the globe. In India, the first case was detected on December 1, and the number crossed the 5,000-mark in little over a month.The variant is heavily mutated, with more than 30 mutations reported in its spike protein. Many experts claim that this is the reason why Omicron is more resistant to existing vaccines.Many studies are being conducted across the world to understand the behaviour of the new variant. From changing the type of masks, to developing new vaccines, researchers are finding way to stamp out an outbreak of the highly infectious virus.A third shot of the vaccine, known as the booster dose, is being advocated to increase the immunity against Omicron. India has also launched a programme to give the additional jab - called precautionary dose - to its eligible population, which includes those above the age of 60 with comorbidities and frontline workers.India, meanwhile, logged 2,47,417 new coronavirus infections, the highest in 236 days, taking the total tally of Covid-19 cases to 3,63,17,927.The active cases have increased to 11,17,531, the highest in 216 days, while the death toll has climbed to 4,85,035 with 380 fresh fatalities, the health ministry data updated at 8am showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-620-omicron-cases-highest-single-day-jump-so-far-101642052065439.html

Considered as the day on which Sun transitions into Capricorn, Makar Sankranti is celebrated with great pomp and enthusiasm.On this day, farmers across India tribute to Sun God, and wish for a good crop. In different regions of the country, the festivities are known by different name, for e.g., as Magh Bihu (Assam), Maghi (Punjab), Sakraat (Haryana), Pongal (Tamil Nadu), Push Sankranti (West Bengal), Sankranthi (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana) etc.Another customary and popular practice associated with this festival is kite flying. In Gujarat's Ahmedabad, since 1989, the day has been observed as International Kite Festival.Also Read | Makar Sankranti: Here's why kite flying is a major part of the festivalThis year, the ministry of AYUSH will organise a Surya Namaskar demonstration programme for around 7.5 million people globally. The programme, the ministry said in a statement, will underline the importance of Makar Sankranti in ‘our cultural and spiritual heritage.’“The Sun, as the primary source of energy, is critical not only for the continuation of the food-chain but it also energises the mind and body of human beings. Scientifically, the Surya Namaskar has been known to develop immunity and improve vitality, which is significant to our health during pandemic conditions. Exposure to the Sun further provides the human body with Vitamin D, which has been widely recommended in all medical branches around the world,” the AYUSH ministry noted in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/makar-sankranti-2022-history-and-significance-of-festival-101642042663317.html

13-01-2022||India||Explained: Why you should still try to avoid Omicron infection||The highly contagious Omicron strain of coronavirus causing milder illness compared to previous variants of concern has fuelled a debate around the risk of catching the virus. Many have asked why to take extreme precautionary measures against the virus since the high transmissibility of the Omicron variant would expose almost everyone to the disease. But experts have cautioned against such views citing various reasons.Here is why experts warned against getting complacent about Omicron:While Omicron may be more likely to cause asymptomatic cases, the rapid spread of the variant means more people, in absolute, numbers will experience severe illness. There is still a large section of the global population that are unvaccinated against coronavirus disease (Covid-19), leaving them vulnerable to the latest variant of concern."I agree that sooner or later everyone will be exposed, but later is better," said virus expert Michel Nussenzweig of Rockefeller University. "Why? Because later we will have better and more available medicines and better vaccines."Omicron especially dangerous for the unvaccinated, warns WHOAnother reason to take preventive measures against Omicron is that people with milder symptoms could still infect others who are at risk for severe illness. There is also a lack of data on the long-term effects of Omicron infection, which means underestimating Omicron could put people at risk of a debilitating long-haul Covid syndrome that can linger for months or years. The “silent” effects of Omicron infection are also unknown.The healthcare infrastructure could witness tremendous strain given the high transmissibility of the variant. According to the HT dashboard, 93.6% of hospital beds currently are vacant across 15 states and Union territory, the ongoing Covid wave in the US and Britain overwhelmed the healthcare system with record hospitalisations. Hospitals have had to postpone elective surgeries due to a record surge in infections.More infections also give the virus more opportunities to mutate and the possibility of a more virulent variant in future is something the world can not afford to, given the global health and economic crisis."SARS-CoV-2 has surprised us in many different ways over the past two years, and we have no way of predicting the evolutionary trajectory of this virus," Reuters quoted David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, as saying.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-why-you-should-still-try-to-avoid-omicron-infection-101642035109209.html
13-01-2022||India||PM Modi to interact with CMs on India's Covid-19 situation today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with chief ministers on Thursday over the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation in the country amid a surge in infections due to the Omicron variant, according to people familiar with the matter. He will interact with the chief ministers at 4.30pm via video conferencing, people cited above said.The meeting is scheduled to take place at a time when India is inching closer to 250,000 daily infections in the new Covid wave largely driven by the highly contagious Omicron variant. The rapid surge in Covid-19 cases has prompted the authorities to impose fresh restrictions, including night curfew and ban on large gatherings.The prime minister chaired a high-level meeting last week to assess the Covid-19 situation in the country, ongoing preparedness of the healthcare system, status of the vaccination campaign, and public health implications of the Omicron variant. During the meeting, the health secretary gave a detailed presentation on the global surge in Covid cases, according to the prime minister’s office.Centre asks states to keep 48-hour buffer stock of oxygen in all hospitalsPM Modi asked officials to coordinate with the states regarding the need to ensure adequate health infrastructure at the district level. He directed officials to continue intensive containment and active surveillance in clusters reporting higher cases and provide required technical support be to states which are reporting higher cases.India has expanded the vaccination drive for adolescents aged 15-18 and has started administering ‘precaution doses’ to healthcare, frontline workers, and senior citizens with comorbidities. PM Modi urged officials to further accelerate the vaccine drive for adolescents in “mission mode.” He said that a meeting with the chief ministers should be convened to discuss state-specific scenarios, best practices and the public health response.“PM also spoke about the importance for continuous scientific research in testing , vaccines and pharmacological interventions including genome sequencing given that the virus is evolving continuously,” the prime minister’s office said in a release.On Wednesday, India reported 246,912 new Covid cases, taking the cumulative tally to 36,317,422, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-interact-with-cms-today-on-india-s-covid-19-situation-101642032309313.html
13-01-2022||India||Two personalities, 2 apps, 1 offensive objective||Neither has a criminal record. Both are in their 20s and tech-savvy. The two are alleged developers of two apps on GitHub that targeted Muslim women, including activists and journalists by “auctioning” them. Now, they are cell mates in a Delhi police station.The similarities end there.Delhi Police officers who have questioned the two men said there is little in common between them. One wanted the world to know he developed the GitHub app Bulli Bai, even daring Mumbai police to arrest him; the other, the alleged creator of Sulli Deals (using an offensive and derogatory term for Muslim women), deleted all digital footprints and social media profiles to ensure he remained anonymous, and managed to stay so for eight months.Neeraj Bishnoi (21) and Aumkareshwar Thakur (26) are locked up together inside a cell at the headquarters of Delhi Police’s Intelligence Fusion Strategic Operations (IFSO) in south west Delhi’s Dwarka. On Sunday night, when police brought Thakur to the IFSO office, after arresting him in Indore, it was the first time the two men met. Police say that for all these months, the two men hid behind anonymous Twitter handles but claim that they were part of the same virtual group where the plan to come up with such an app was discussed last year.“Bishnoi wanted to be famous. Thakur wished to remain anonymous. Bishnoi is loud. He tries to mislead the investigators. He even attempted to hurt himself twice in custody. Thakur is cold; maybe he thinks he has managed to erase the evidence. He doesn’t speak much and blames Bishnoi for framing him,” said a police officer, who questioned the two men. Which is understandable. The first app was launched in July 2021, and if not for Bishnoi’s Bulli Bai, which was launched in December -- and if not for the investigation that followed -- Thakur may have continued to remain anonymous, and safe.Their ideologyInvestigators describe Bishnoi as “cunning” and “emotionless”, and say he has no regrets about what he did. He also talks a lot, they add.”He (Bishnoi) says a lot of things. He says he is a communist. And then he changes his stance and claims that his thoughts lean towards the extreme right. But the evidence we have gathered suggests he has no ideology. He spends hours on the internet, and only wanted to defame women. His laptop showed he is addicted to pornography. We recovered at least 153 tabs on his browser windows that were links to adult websites,” said a police officer who asked not to be named.The officer described Thakur as someone who deliberately chose to target Muslim women. “Thakur seems to be the more rigid between the two. He was the leader of the virtual group on Twitter when the idea to come up with an app was decided. He took the lead and developed the app. He took suggestions from the group members on the people whose photographs were to be used. He seems to have been radicalised on his own after spending hours on social media. He has not spoken to us about any specific incident or anecdote on why he started hating one particular community,” another officer said, referring to Muslims.Thakur is a freelance web designer, who pursued his BCA from IPS Academy in Indore. Bishnoi is a second year B.Tech student (suspended after arrest) from the Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal. Bishnoi, originally from Jorhat in Assam, is the son of the grocer.Thakur’s father works with a private company in Bhopal. Police have said that the two were part of Twitter a group, Tradmahasabha, where, in January 2020 , a plan to defame Muslim women was hatched.Thakur joined the group using one of his handles @gangescion. Bishnoi, too, was in the group with one of his handles.“Bishnoi said he knew Thakur from that group. In fact, Bishnoi used the same code from Thakur’s app to build the Bulli Deals app,” said a third police officer who asked not to be named.One dared cops to arrest him, other deleted proof“You have arrested the wrong person. I am the creator of #BulliBaiApp,” a tweet by handle @giyu44 boasted on January 5, a day after Mumbai police arrested three suspects in the case for allegedly sharing a tweet which promoted the second GitHub app.In the 24 hours before he was arrested on January 5, Neeraj Bishnoi claimed repeatedly on Twitter that he was the person behind the offensive app. He even tagged handles such as that of Satej D Patil, Maharashtra’s minister of state for home (urban) and housing, on Twitter, daring the Mumbai police to arrest him.KPS Malhotra, chief of IFSO, confirmed that Bishnoi was the owner of the @giyo44 Twitter account. DCP Malhotra said Bishnoi had in the past, created at least five Twitter handles using different versions of the name Giyo, such as @giyu2002, @giyu007, @giyuu84, @giyu94 and @guyi44 to promote the app or make derogatory comments against women. Police officers said that Bishnoi even asked his interrogators to address him as Giyo , a name from Giyu Tomioka, a fictional character who kills demons in the Japanese comic and animated series Demon Slayer.“He did not want to be arrested so he masked his IP address and showed that he was posting the tweets from Nepal. He even claimed he was from a place near Kathmandu. He wanted people to know that he created the app but did not think we would trace his digital footprint and arrest him from his house in Assam,” the third police officer said.Meanwhile, in Indore’s New York City Township Colony, Thakur was following the news. Delhi Police did register a case against the creators of the first app in July 2021, but the probe went nowhere.“Thakur used his iPad and iPhone to access social media, but after the public outcry (following the first app), he logged out. He even logged out from all Twitter groups he was part of; erased his Facebook account, and accounts he had in his own name; and did not keep in touch with anyone even anonymously. We have seized his electronic devices and sent them for forensic examination,” the third police officer added.According to this officer, Thakur first joined Twitter using his own credentials in 2013. He completed his BCA in 2018 but worked from home, taking on website design assignments. “He started calling himself a Trad around 2019. He said Trad groups on social media are for like-minded people with self-created philosophy of ensuring that the world should not change and stick to traditions.”Two carefully lived livesThe two men spend hours on social media but were different characters in front of their family. Thakur’s father, Akhilesh Thakur, who spoke to reporters after his son’s arrest, has refused to believe the police’s allegations. He said he still believes that Thakur was arrested only because Bishnoi named him in his interrogation. “My son told me over phone that he has not done anything wrong. Some accused took his name and he is being implicated wrongly,” his father told HT. The family said Thakur was not even part of any social media group so the allegations of him developing such as app were false.In Jorhat, Bishnoi’s family, too, is unable to come to terms with the police’s allegations. Police said they weren’t surprised that the family knows nothing about Bishnoi’s criminal side. “Bishnoi, who has an opinion on almost every topic on social media and was vociferous about it through his anonymous accounts, was a completely different person when our officers arrested him. It cannot be explained. He was so connected to his family and appeared to be a man without a single fault. Here was a man who masked his IP address, and dared the police to arrest him,” a fourth officer said.Bishnoi’s father Dashrath has a different take on why he believes his son in innocent.

Further, Jaydev used to trade using only his own account, as per Sebi order.The watchdog said that Himanshu and Raj along with their family members have made wrongful gains of ₹2.61 crore while Jaydev has made wrongful gains of ₹0.23 crore by taking positions in scrips ahead of their recommendations in the Telegram channel and subsequently offloading the said positions, post the recommendations.By indulging in such acts, they violated the provisions of PFUTP (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) norms, Sebi said.It has also ordered impounding wrongful gains to the tune of ₹2.84 crore.The regulator has directed the individuals to "refrain from accessing the securities market and prohibiting them from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities for an appropriate period".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telegram-case-sebi-bans-6-for-manipulating-stock-prices-101642025364289.html

13-01-2022||India||Goa elections: Can’t forge alliance with big brother attitude, says TMC||The TMC is not averse to a larger alliance for opposition unity to take on the BJP in the Goa assembly polls but such a coalition cannot be forged with a “big brother” attitude, TMC leader Sushmita Dev said on Wednesday in an apparent swipe at the Congress.Dev, the TMC’s co-incharge for Goa, also hit out at the Congress for stating that her party was fracturing the anti-BJP vote and said that by that logic, the Congress had tried to cut into the anti-BJP vote in West Bengal.The Rajya Sabha member said the Trinamool Congress (TMC) decided to enter the poll fray in Goa at a time the people of the state want to get rid of the BJP and there is a huge sense of “underconfidence” in the Congress for not being able to form the government after the last assembly polls despite being the single largest party.“Till today, the Congress has not been able to explain that to the people of Goa. When we entered the fray there was a vacuum in a sense -- the people did not want the BJP and they were sceptical and pessimistic about the Congress,” Dev told PTI in an interview.Assembly polls for all 40 seats in Goa will be held on February 14. The TMC has been carrying out an aggressive campaign, including on social media platforms such as Koo, to boost its chances in a contest involving several players.Dev said after Mamata Banerjee leading the TMC to a landslide victory in the West Bengal assembly polls over the BJP against all odds, people in Goa now want a strong leader and a party that does not cow down.Asked about TMC’s Goa in-charge Mahua Moitra’s tweet on Opposition unity that set off speculation over a possible grand alliance including the Congress and the TMC, Dev said, “When you talk about Opposition unity, it has a huge merit. But...when you unite with somebody, the nature of that unity depends on the strength of that party.”Citing the TMC’s alliance with the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, Dev said her party is giving its alliance partner in Goa its due and respect.”Question is, whether it is the Congress or any other party, if there has to be a larger alliance for opposition unity then any party, whether you are a national or regional, you must realise your strengths and weaknesses. You cannot come with a big brother attitude,” she said.Dev said if parties can sit across the table and come up with a strategy to take on BJP, keeping everyone’s strength and weaknesses at the forefront, without the attitude of being a “big brother”, the TMC is not averse to it.”I would not like to name ‘A’ party or ‘B’ party. But any alliance should be backed by logic, it must be reasonable. We need to have a mindset of not having a big daddy approach,” she added.The Congress has dismissed talk of alliance with the TMC with AICC general secretary (organisation) K C Venugopal tweeting on Monday, “The rumour in circulation that a possible alliance with TMC was discussed by Shri @RahulGandhi in today’s meeting is completely baseless & untrue.””Let me assure that the Congress party is confident- we will put Goa back on the path to progress soon,” he had said.Hitting out at those calling TMC a “vote cutter” in Goa, Dev said that the criticism was not fair and meant indirectly telling the party that a leader like Mamata Banerjee should be confined to West Bengal for the rest of her life.”Today, why doesn’t anybody say that to Priyanka Gandhi. Isn’t Priyanka Gandhi cutting votes of the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh. You don’t ask that question to Priyanka Gandhi in UP or to anybody in Odisha just because they have the banner of a national party, but they are zero in so many states,” Dev, who quit the Congress to join the TMC last year, said.”They (the Congress) should also shut shop and stop cutting votes of other regional parties like RJD, SP, Shiv Sena. So, such an argument is a fallacy,” she said.Asked about Congress’ Goa polls in-charge P Chidambaram’s remarks that TMC and AAP are fracturing the anti-BJP vote, Dev said, “Mr Chidambaram is a very astute politician, very senior to me. Mr Chidambaram should first answer the question: Didn’t the Congress try to fracture the anti-BJP vote in Bengal?”She said Chidambaram should ask former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi to shut shop in Bengal.She claimed that Chidambaram had to be sent to Goa because the Congress’ situation in the state was not turning out how it expected it to.Dev said that in line with his argument, Chidambaram should also think of compromising some seats and not fracture the vote of strong leaders like Kiran Kandolkar and Luizinho Faleiro in their respective seats.She also slammed the Congress for alleging that the TMC was poaching its leaders in Goa, saying that going by that argument isn’t Michael Lobo or Revanth Reddy or Nana Parole joining the Congress, poaching.Asked if the TMC’s national aspirations and Mamata Banerjee’s 2024 pitch to take on Prime Minister Narendra Modi depends on Goa results, Dev said in elections there are ups and downs and if TMC wins Goa, it doesn’t mean that the PM candidate for 2024 is decided nor losing the polls would mean Mamata Banerjee or her party is out of the race for 2024.”That is putting things in boxes and that is not how things work. Many sets of elections will happen (before 2024),” she said.”Can we say that if Congress is below 10 in UP then Rahul Gandhi is out of the race for PM. No one is asking that question so why should we be asked that question,” she said.Dev, citing Mamata Banerjee’s remarks in the last Opposition meeting in August 2021, said -- “If you want to defeat BJP, you just can’t depend on Mamata Banerjee in Bengal or RJD in Bihar and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, you need the likes of Jagan Reddy, KCR and other regional satraps to come in.””Will they sit with Congress, what is their history (with the Congress)? So Mamata Banerjee has many roles to play, a tall leader like Sharad Pawar has many roles to play. Congress will not be able to bring many regional satraps on board for its sheer history. Jagan Reddy is a big example of that,” she said.Dev also explained Mamata Banerjee’s “no UPA” statement, saying it must be seen in context that UPA was an understanding to run a government and today there should be a larger form of UPA with more alliance partners.Dev expressed confidence that the TMC would form the next government in Goa, asserting that a month before pilling was crucial.In the 2017 Goa assembly elections, the Congress had emerged as the single largest party by winning 17 out of the total 40 seats. However, the BJP then quickly tied-up with some regional parties and independents to form government in the coastal state.The Congress is now left with just two assembly seats in Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-elections-can-t-forge-alliance-with-big-brother-attitude-says-tmc-101642016091328.html

According to Manipur police, Abujam John (56) and Abujam Tomba alias Rishikanta (37) were shot dead by unidentified persons on Sunday night at Samurou Awang Leikai, under Wangoi police station, 16 km south of Imphal. Abujam John is said to be supporter of state’s agriculture minister Oinam Lukhoi, who was elected from Wangoi assembly constituency in 2020 by-elections on a Bharatiya Janata Party ticket while Rishikanta is an Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) personnel. Police said probe is on to ascertain the reason behind the killings and added that the accused remain at large. Additional superintendent of police (Ops) M Amit Singh of the Imphal West district will head the SIT while sub-divisional police officer Kh Farook Ali of Mayang Imphal police station will be the investigation officer in the case, said an order from the Manipur administration. The order also stated that officer in-charge S Nabajiban Ningthouja and sub-inspector Bishorjit Singh, both from Wangoi police station, will assist Ali in the case. “The officer in-charge, Wangoi PS and the I.O of the case are directed to handover the case record to Kh Farook Ali, MPS, SDPO/ Mayang Imphal for further investigation,” the order said, adding the SIT should submit the probe progress to the Imphal West superintendent of police on a daily basis. Meanwhile, police on Wednesday said the post-mortem examinations of the two bodies have been conducted. Chief minister N Biren Singh and Lukhoi visited the victims’ families, who have refused to accept the bodies of the deceased, at Samurou Awang Leikai on Monday and assured that the accused will soon be arrested. “We do not know the reason behind these killings. Elections can be the reason behind these killings. The government will not remain silent until the perpetrators are arrested,” the CM had said on Monday. Demanding justice for the deceased, a Joint Action Committee was formed, which announced complete shutdown of Mayai Lambi road in the state from 6am to 5pm every day starting Wednesday. However, medical services, educational institutions and emergency services will be exempted from the shutdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-forms-sit-to-probe-jawan-bjp-worker-s-murder-101642015791078.html
13-01-2022||India||BJP steps up attack on Channi over Modi’s security breach||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday stepped up its attack against Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security breach on January 5, and demanded an apology from the former in the matter.While Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath slammed Channi’s “lack of responsibility” in the case, Union minister Smriti Irani hit out at the Punjab chief minister for briefing Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on the matter. Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami described the security lapse as “pre-planned and sponsored” while his Assam counterpart, Himanta Biswa Sarma, called it a “murder conspiracy” and sought Channi’s arrest in this regard.Adityanath was addressing reporters in the national capital when he claimed that “a sting operation had proven that there was a conspiracy to disturb the Prime Minister’s security detail”.He was referring to a report by a news channel which claimed that Punjab Police personnel had alerted their seniors and the administration about the presence of protesters along the route that Modi was supposed to take during his visit to Ferozepur last week. Due to the presence of the protesters, Modi’s convoy was stranded on a flyover for 20 minutes before returning back to Bathinda airport. “This has become clear that this (lapse) was pre-decided. The Punjab government did not follow the rules and protocol as per the bluebook (of the Special Protection Group). The chief minister did not even follow the elementary process of receiving the Prime Minister,” he said.Hitting out at Channi for briefing Priyanka on the matter, he said: ““Breach in the security of a person who holds the highest constitutional position is condemnable. That the Punjab chief minister also shared details of the security breach with a person (Priyanka) who is in charge of Uttar Pradesh elections shows his lack of responsibility towards a serious issue.” Speaking on similar lines, Irani told reporters in Delhi: “Why did the Punjab chief minister brief a private citizen (Priyanka Gandhi Vadra) on the Prime Minister’s security protocol and the breach? Why is the private citizen, who is a part of the Gandhi family, an interested party into the matter?”“I reiterate our questions to the Congress high command. Why were security measures deliberately breached with the active connivance of the Congress-led government in Punjab? Who in Congress sought to benefit from the breach?” she added. Continuing her attack on the state government and administration, the BJP leader said: “What is extremely disconcerting is that the Punjab Police officials have highlighted how they continuously engaged with the Congress government and the administration in Punjab to bring to light the threat to the security of Prime Minister and his route.” Dhami also referred to the news channel’s report to attack Channi. “The lapse in the Prime Minister’’s security is a very serious issue. And now in a sting operation done by a private news channel, it has been proved that the lapse was not spontaneous but a deliberate one planned and sponsored by the Congress-led Punjab government. It was a big conspiracy,” he told reporters in Dehradun. Sarma sought Channi’s “arrest over an alleged conspiracy to kill the Prime Minister”. Alleging that Channi was aware of a plot to target the Modi during his Punjab visit, Sarma said even though an international conspiracy was underway involving Khalistani terrorists, Punjab government did not take any steps. “Political difference doesn’t give you the license to conspire or physically eliminate a person like the Prime Minister. How can a democratically elected CM get directly or indirectly involved in such a conspiracy?” he said. “This episode was not a coincidence, but a murderous conspiracy. And it didn’t happen suddenly. It was pre-planned. There was no natural incident, it was organised. It wasn’t spontaneous, but sponsored,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-steps-up-attack-on-channi-over-modi-s-security-breach-101642015491007.html
13-01-2022||India||Arrest warrant against Swami Prasad Maurya in 2014 hate speech case||A local court on Wednesday issued an arrest warrant against former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) minister Swami Prasad Maurya, who quit the Uttar Pradesh Cabinet on Tuesday, in connection with a 2014 hate speech case.Yogesh Yadav, special judge in the MP-MLA court in Sultanpur district, issued the warrant after Maurya failed to appear before it on Wednesday. The judge fixed January 24 as the next date of hearing.The case relates to a speech made by Maurya in Lucknow on September 21, 2014, wherein he allegedly made objectionable remarks against Hindu gods. Back then, he was with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and was the leader of opposition in the state assembly.“Goddesses Gauri or Lord Ganesha should not be worshipped during weddings. It is a conspiracy by the upper caste dominated caste system to mislead Dalits,” Maurya, an influential OBC leader, had allegedly said. Hearing a petition filed by advocate Anil Tewari, the court of additional chief judicial magistrate (Sultanpur) on November 20, 2014, held the then BSP leader prima facie responsible for hurting religious sentiments. On December 1, 2015, an arrest warrant was issued against Maurya which was stayed by the Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court.The former minister is likely to join the Samajwadi Party ahead of the state elections. He said he will make a formal announcement in this regard by January 14. HT tried to reach out to Maurya for a comment but could not get one immediately. 
13-01-2022||India||Make stand clear on K Rail, HC tells Centre||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala high court on Wednesday directed the Union government to make its position clear on the high- speed rail project, K Rail, and stayed the process of laying boundary stones of the project in violation of the Survey and Boundaries Act ahead of the social impact study. While hearing a bunch of pleas, Justice Devan Ramachandran said though the state government contended that there was an in-principle approval, there was no clarity on the Centre’s position. The court also observed that it was improper for one counsel to appear for both the Union Government and railway ministry. “This is perhaps the biggest project Kerala has undertaken so far. Such a project should not be implemented intimidating and threatening people. All these pleas are being filed because of the haste to implement the project. The law cannot be violated in its attempt to execute the scheme,” the court said. It directed the Centre to explain its position during the next hearing on January 21 and asked the K Rail not to lay boundary stones of the project. Earlier in north Kerala protesting people have uprooted many boundary stones. CPI(M) Kannur district secretary M V Jayarajan had threatened people who uproot survey stones saying “they will have to keep their tooth intact.” Meanwhile, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in an article in ‘Chintha weekly, a party-run publication, claimed that the Centre and railway ministry have given approval for the project and the government will go ahead with it. The government has also decided to print 50 lakh small booklets to be distributed among people to clear all doubts and apprehensions about the project. The government’s ambitious high speed rail project ran into trouble after main opposition parties and green activists opposed it vehemently. The ₹63,940 crore project seeks to develop a high-speed rail corridor connecting Kasaragod in the state’s north to Thiruvananthapuram in the south. The state needs 1,383 hectares of land for the proposed project, of which 1,383 hectares are private. The rail line will bring down the travel time between Kasaragod and Thiruvananthapuram, covering 529.45 km, from 12 hours to four hours. It will be completed by 2025, said Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd (KRDCL), the nodal agency for the project. But the union government is yet to approve the project and no social and environment impact studies were held so far. Besides opposition many green activists also opposed the big budget project saying it will be a disaster for the state. They said government conceived the idea when climate experts and others warned it will face recurring calamities due to climate change, they said. Last week noted social activist Medha Patakar joined the protest against the project. “Never expected a left government will come out with such a project which will threw lakhs of people out of their homes and damage environment. The CM should shed its adamant posture and talk to protestors,” she said Kozhikode on Monday. The Congress and BJP have announced agitational programmes against the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/make-stand-clear-on-k-rail-hc-tells-centre-101642015070916.html
13-01-2022||India||KCR asks people to revolt against Centre, writes to Modi demanding rollback of fertiliser prices||HyderabadTelangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Wednesday demanded that the Centre immediately roll back the increase in fertiliser prices which, he said, has pushed the agriculture sector into deep crisis and broken the backbone of farming in the country.The chief minister wrote a strongly-worded letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, registering his protest against the increase of fertilisers’ prices.In a statement earlier, he called upon the people to “root out the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government at the Centre,” which is weakening the rural economy by playing havoc with the farm sector and handing it over to the corporates.KCR, as the chief minister is popularly called, asked the people to confront the BJP on the farmers’ crisis at every opportunity. “If the Centre fails to withdraw the increased prices of fertilisers, there will be statewide and countrywide agitations against the Central government,” he warned.He also urged the farming community in the state to expose the BJP’s conspiracy and join the struggle to make the Centre withdraw the fertiliser price hike.In his letter to the Prime Minister, the chief minister said it was sad that the prices of two most consumed fertilisers – NPK 28.28.0 and Muriate of Potash (MoP) had increased by more than 50% and 100% respectively in the last three months.“Instead of bearing the increasing import costs of raw materials and maintaining the prices of fertilizers at an affordable level to the farmers, the Central government has chosen to pass on the burden to the farmers,” he alleged.He pointed out that in February 2016, the NDA government had made a tall promise that it would increase the income of the farmers two-fold by 2022. “Instead of fulfilling the promise, it has now increased the prices of fertilisers at an all-time high,” he said.He said the steep hike in fuel prices due to indiscriminate imposition of cess across the board had caused great distress to farmers, who had taken up farm mechanisation. Now, the increase in fertiliser prices had put enormous burden on the farmers, he said.KCR also pointed out to the Prime Minister that the farmers were denied minimum support prices (MSP) for many farm produces, as a result of which the farmers are compelled to sell their produce at lower prices there by making agriculture non-remunerative.Stating that the BJP government is totally against the farmers, the chief minister said there was deep conspiracy behind the central government policies and actions to make the lives of farmers miserable.“Decisions like to install meters to motors to collect the power charges, not linking MGNREGP with the farm sector, increasing the fertilisers prices to all time high, not purchasing the paddy cultivated by the farmers etc., have made farmers’ life miserable,” he said, adding that the farmers have no option but to take up their ploughs and revolt against the Central government.

Many of these organisations and societies were divided between the two states. But there has been disputes over many other organisations, mostly located in Hyderabad, their assets and liabilities.Among the 107 institutions listed under Schedule 10, more than 90 institutions are located in Hyderabad, which was the capital of undivided Andhra Pradesh for nearly six decades. All these institutions together have assets worth thousands of crores of rupees in the form of buildings, lands and bank deposits, on which both the governments are staking claim.Telangana has been claiming that as per the provisions of the AP State Reorganisation Act, it has absolute control over the institutions located in Hyderabad. Andhra Pradesh has been demanding that the properties of these institutions be divided on the basis of population ratio.The Andhra Pradesh government has also been insisting on the division of AP Bhavan in New Delhi on the population ratio basis. The Telangana government proposed to take over the entire complex and offered a suitable piece of land to Andhra Pradesh for the construction of a new AP Bhavan complex.At the Wednesday’s meeting, the Andhra Pradesh government reiterated its demand for securing payment of power bill dues of ₹6,015 crore to be paid by the Telangana discoms to AP Genco. However, Telangana officials say the total outstanding was only ₹3,442 crore, after deducting the dues to be paid by AP discoms to Telangana Genco.AP chief secretary Sameer Sharma also raised the issue of the Centre extending financial assistance to the state towards resource gap funding for 2014-15, increased funding for Polavaram major irrigation project, setting up of crude oil refinery and petro-chemical complex, development of Ramayampatnam port and Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial corridor.
13-01-2022||India||India reports 246k new Covid cases, its highest since May 16||India on Wednesday saw new cases of Covid-19 soar to nearly 250,000, as the country saw the largest single-day increase in infections since May 16, 2021, or in 236 days, as the nationwide surge in cases propelled by the Omicron variant continued to soar.Wednesday’s case count of 246,912 means that daily cases have now grown more than 10-fold in under two weeks (there were just 22,487 new infections on December 31) – a speed of rise in infections previously unseen in the two years of the pandemic in the country.The highest ever single-day surge recorded in the country was on May 6, 2021, when there were 414,431 daily infections, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.With this, the seven-day average of daily infections in the country has now soared to 172,263, a 226-day high, data shows. Just 17 days ago, this number, which denotes a region’s case curve, was at 6,641 cases a day – the lowest level seen in the country since the early days of the pandemic.To be sure, such a sharp rise in daily infections is keeping in line with trends in Covid waves seen across the world due to the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Experts have said that while infections of the new variant, which was first discovered in South Africa in early November, are spreading a lot faster than previous iterations of the coronavirus, they are largely asymptomatic or mild, with only small fraction resulting in deaths across the world.On Tuesday, HT reported that Mumbai and Delhi, the earliest urban hot spots of India’s third wave appear to have started exhibiting early signs that their infections curves may be flattening. While key data indicators in Mumbai suggest that numbers in the city have already started peaking, and appear to be dropping just as fast as they were rising in the previous weeks.With 46,723 new infections reported on Wednesday, Maharashtra was the state with the highest number of daily cases in the country. It was followed by Delhi, which saw 27,561 new cases on Wednesday, and West Bengal, which reported 22,155 new cases.Nearly half of all infections reported across the country in the past week can be traced to just these three states, data shows.To be sure, doctors and health experts said that numbers on the ground in many regions may be higher as a lot of people have resorted to using home test kits due to milder symptoms occurring with the Omicron variant, and do not necessarily follow up with a RT-PCR test if they are positive, thereby staying off the radar. There is, however, no way to map these cases since most mild patients are recovering in home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-reports-250-000-new-covid-cases-highest-single-day-spike-since-may-16-last-year-101642014480053.html

ICMR on Monday said contacts of Covid-19 patients do not need to be tested unless identified as high-risk based on age or comorbidities.Talking to the media on Wednesday, Gupta said the government had decided to continue with the current testing patterns, and he said in view of the rising cases, testing will be increased in the state. “We will continue to test contacts of Covid-19 patients and all other categories we have been testing so far. In fact, we will increase testing in the coming days. We will also identify high-risk groups such as delivery boys and other professionals and conduct random testing,” he said.Karnataka on Wednesday registered 21,390 fresh Covid cases and 10 fatalities, taking the tally to 3099,519 and toll to 38,389. The state has been witnessing a steady surge in cases since the last week of December and had reported 14,473 new infections on Tuesday.Of the new cases on Wednesday, 15,617 were from Bengaluru Urban that saw 874 people being discharged and 6 deaths.

13-01-2022||India||CID serves fresh notice to YSRC rebel MP Raju for questioning in sedition case||HyderabadThe Crime Investigation Department of Andhra Pradesh police on Wednesday served a fresh notice on rebel parliamentarian of YSR Congress party Kanumuru Raghurama Krishnam Raju in connection with a sedition case pending against him since May last year, officials familiar with the matter said.A team of CID officials headed by deputy superintendent of police R G Jayasurya from Vijayawada served the notice to Raju at his residence in Hyderabad when he was about to leave for his native place Bhimavaram for Sankranti festivities. Raju, who represents Narasapuram parliamentary constituency in West Godavari district, came to his Hyderabad residence on Tuesday.The team asked Raju to appear before the CID headquarters in Mangalagiri in Guntur district on Thursday for questioning in connection with the cases pending against him, the officials aware of the developments said.Raju’s lawyers told the police that the MP won’t be able to come to the CID office at such a short notice, as he was going to Bhimavaram for Sankranti festival. They said his health also would not permit him for being questioned by the police.The CID officials, who consulted their superiors, gave him another four days’ time and asked him to come to Mangalagiri on January 17. Raju accepted the notice and agreed to appear before the CID.The rebel YSRC MP, however, said the CID questioning should be transparent and in accordance with the law. “Last time, the authorities removed the CCTV cameras and tortured me physically, at the behest of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy,” he alleged. Raju, who had raised a banner of revolt against the chief minister within a year of getting elected to the Lok Sabha in April 2019, was arrested by the Andhra CID from his residence in Hyderabad on May 14 last year.He was charged under sections 124A (sedition), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups), and 505 (conducing public mischief) of IPC. The CID, in a statement after his arrest, said Raju had been indulging in hate speeches against certain communities and promoting disaffection against the government.“It was found that through his speeches on regular basis Mr Raju was indulging in systematic, schematic effort to cause tensions and by attacking various government dignitaries in a way which will cause loss of faith in the government which they represent,” the CID said.On the same night, Raju moved a bail petition in the state high court on health grounds, which directed the government to send him to the Guntur government hospital and later to a private hospital. The high court, however, rejected his bail.Later, Raju moved the Supreme Court for bail. He alleged that he was subject to physical torture by the CID during his stay in the police station. On May 17, the Supreme Court ordered that Raju be admitted to the Military Hospital in Secunderabad for medical examination.On May 21, the Supreme Court bench confirmed that Raju had suffered a fracture in his left foot and there were bruises on his legs. Based on the report, the apex court granted him bail.On May 26, Raju was released from the Military Hospital and flown to New Delhi. Since then, he has been staying put in New Delhi.The YSRC parliamentary party headed by V Vijay Sai Reddy had moved a petition before Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla in July 2020, seeking Raju’s disqualification from the Lok Sabha. The petition has been pending before the Speaker.On Saturday last, Raju announced that he would be quitting his Lok Sabha membership soon and contesting the by-election from Narasapuram. “I will take a call after February 5 on my resignation and my future course of action,” he said.
13-01-2022||India||Six minors arrested for gang-raping teen in Karnataka’s Kalburgi: Police||Police in Kalburgi district have arrested six minors for raping a 13-year-old girl suffering from dementia. The crime took place on January 5 and based on a complaint from the girl’s family, the suspects were taken into custody by police on Tuesday, officials said on Wednesday.All five accused, who were not named by police, were neighbours of the girl in Kalburgi city. YS Ravikumar, commissioner of Kalburgi police, said all the suspects are between the ages of 15-16 and they are currently in the custody of the district juvenile justice home.“The girl had dementia. The accused are her neighbours and they were well-known to her. On January 5, they took her to a desolate area behind a college in Sunnada Bhatti area where she was raped,” said the officer said.The parents of the girl filed a complaint in Gulbarga university police station on Monday in this connection. They also revealed that they came to know about the incident late as the girl suffers from dementia.“The girl complained of stomach pain and later parents realised that she was raped. Following the complaint, we have conducted a medical test and rape was confirmed in the test,” Ravikumar said.Based on the complaint, police began the investigation and were able to zero down on the suspects.“Since they were minors, we had to follow some regulations such as not keeping them in custody. We have transferred them to a juvenile justice home. However, they have been booked under the IPC section 376 D (gang rape). We will see through that the accused get maximum punishment,” the officer said.The girl was hospitalised and treated, he said.Around a month ago, a 70-year-old man was arrested for allegedly raping a 13-year-old girl under Revoor police station limits in Kalburagi district. According to police, on November 29, the old man lured the girl promising her eatables which he told her was in his field. The girl went with him to his field.The accused is said to have raped the child in his field. When the parents returned from work in the evening, they found their daughter crying inconsolably. After much coercion, the child narrated the horrific incident.
13-01-2022||India||Kerala: Positivity rate at 17% as over 12,000 cases reported in a day||Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala on Wednesday reported another surge in Covid-19 cases with 12,742 cases with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 17.1% even as the first cluster of Omicron cases was formed in the state in Pathanamthitta.As cases rose sharply Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Health Minister Veena George called for extreme caution but the ruling party drew flak on Tuesday after it conducted a mega dance fest, Thiruvathira, in Parasala in Thiruvananthapuram district as part of the ongoing party conference. The opposition Congress has petitioned the state police chief. Health minister George said in a statement on Wednesday that 76 new cases of the Omicron variant were reported ina day in the state, taking the total cases to 421. This is the highest single day Omicron tally since the first case was reported on Dec 7. The statement said the state’s first Omicron cluster was found in Pathanamhitta. George said the cases were reported from a nursing college in Pathanamthitta. The source of infections was traced to a person who recently came from abroad, the statement said. “Situation in Pathanamthitta is worrying. We have taken all precautions to contain the spread. We have formed a separate cluster,” she said. Out of 421 Omicrons case, 290 people arrived from low-risk countries, 85 from high-risk nations and 43 contracted the virus through local infection, the minister said. Meanwhile the state reported 12,742 Covid-19 cases after 72,808 samples were tested with a TPR of 17.1 per cent, said the health ministry. TPR crossed 17% after four months. “The spike in Covid-19 cases is due to the spread of the Delta variant. The government has decided to open first-line Covid treatment centres in view of rising cases,” she said. Similarly, the state reported 23 Covid-19 deaths and added 176 backlog deaths taking total fatalities to 50,254. A close look at the statistics shows that there is a huge disparity between current case fatality rate and actual deaths, said health experts. Interestingly 19,341 deaths were added to the official list after the Supreme Court put down strict guidelines for declaring Covid-19 deaths, statistics show. More than 15,000 appeals are still pending before the committee to declare their kin’s death as Covid deaths -- reported between June 2020 and July 2021. Under-counting came to light after the government announced relief for the dead. “The government will have to release details of under-counted deaths which were later added to the official list. Details will make the process more transparent and it will also help medical community,” said public health expert Dr N M Arun. As criticism over the dance programme mounted, CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishan said in Kannur that the event should have been avoided. Reports suggest more than 500 dancers assembled at the ground and none of them wore masks during the event. As per the government directive in all public programmes, numbers should not exceed 50. Party insiders said dancers were rehearsing the programme for more than a week and leaders were aware of the event. “This is a blatant misuse of power. It is strange police are yet to book organisers”, said BJP state president K Surendran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-positivity-rate-at-17-as-over-12-000-cases-reported-in-a-day-101642014290837.html
13-01-2022||India||Centre asks states to keep 48-hour buffer stock of oxygen in all hospitals||The Centre has asked all states and Union territories to keep at least a 48-hour buffer stock of medical oxygen in hospitals to meet any surge in demand due to the current wave of Covid-19 cases.In a letter to states and UTs, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Tuesday said, “… all health facilities providing in-patient care and oxygen therapy should have a buffer stock of medical oxygen sufficient for at least 48 hours. The liquid medical oxygen tanks at the health facilities should be sufficiently filled and an uninterrupted supply chain for their refilling should be ensured…”Hospitals across the country have been strengthened with pressure swing adsorption plants, which generate oxygen from ambient air. “It is important to ensure that these PSA plants are kept fully functional. All steps should be taken for the proper upkeep and maintenance of such plants,” said Bhushan. He added that oxygen concentrators supplied by the Centre should remain fully functional at all times.He also directed states to ensure all the health facilities have adequate inventory of oxygen cylinders along with back-up stocks and robust refilling systems. “These cylinders must be filled and kept ready,” Bhushan said.On Wednesday, the Delhi government said the national Capital now has an installed capacity of 900 metric tonnes (MT) of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) compared to about 730 MT that was available in May 2021, when the second wave hit the city. As mandated by the Centre in its letter, the Delhi government also has created a buffer reserve of 442 MT.During the April-May wave of cases, many parts of the country saw an acute crisis of medical oxygen after a surge of patients in critical condition overwhelmed hospitals and stocks.Besides, a total of 90 PSA plants have been commissioned so far and another eight will be commissioned by the end of this month, the Delhi government informed. Cylinders with a total oxygen capacity of about 227 MT are with different hospitals, nursing homes and Covid Care Centres in the city. As for keeping cylinders in reserve, the administration has 6,000 ‘D type’ cylinders at its disposal and another 9,115 cylinders are with the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC).When asked about the status of the 15 cryogenic tankers that were to be procured by the Delhi government, a senior health official said work orders have been awarded for its procurement. “The delivery of three tankers is expected by January 24. The next will be a batch of six tankers which will be delivered by February 24 and then the next six will be delivered on March 24,” the official said on condition of anonymity.All tertiary care hospitals, or higher-level health facilities, have been asked to have life support equipment, including ventilators, BiPAP, SpO2 systems, and associated consumables, in sufficient numbers to respond to the emerging needs.The health secretary also directed hospitals to adopt all infection prevention protocols while using the oxygen delivery devices and equipment. For that, he said adequately trained people should be deployed at all hospitals. “As advised, training of facility-wise Oxygen Stewards should be completed within the next few days.”The Union ministries of health and skill development and entrepreneurship have already organised 10 hours training for operators of PSA plants for day-to-day operation, 40 hours training of master trainers and 180 hours training of trouble shooting of PSA to a significant number of persons in all states.The states need to co-ordinate with private health facilities that provide oxygen therapy to explore the option of utilisng their services after assessing them, especially when the demand is at its peak.The Centre also asked states to again make functional oxygen control rooms so that any issue related to supplies of the life-saving gas is resolved without wasting time. “…with timely preparations and responsiveness, I am confident that we will be able to meet the challenges ahead of us…,” said Bhushan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-states-to-keep-48-hour-buffer-stock-of-oxygen-in-all-hospitals-101642014110831.html
13-01-2022||India||Karnataka: Experts link Covid spike to political activities||Heightened political activities in Karnataka are among the main reasons for recurring surges in Covid-19 cases, data shows, as large gatherings without masks, social distancing or other precautions continue to fuel infections in the southern state.While the Congress in the state continues to hide behind the fact that hospitalisations, especially those in intensive care units (ICU), are at a minimum, their 10-day padayatra or march for Mekedatu, experts say, could potentially spread the virus to rural parts of Karnataka where access to healthcare and vaccines is limited.Data shows that there has been a 14-fold increase in daily infections across Karnataka since January 1 -- from 1,033 cases on the last day of 2021 to 14,473 reported in the 24-hour-period on January 11. The impact on Covid cases because of the Congress padyatra would be visible after some days. Experts point to the gestation period of the spread that would show up in about a week’s time after large events, much like fatality rates that increase once the number of new infections starts coming down.During the second wave in Karnataka in March last year, surge in cases happened after heightened political activities like bypoll campaigning, protests and other events that attracted large crowds, among other reasons.“No one takes permission to protest,” Siddaramaiah, the leader of the opposition and senior Congress leader, said on Wednesday.But there are restrictions imposed by the Basavaraj Bommai-led BJP government against large gatherings across Karnataka, which now has over 73,000 active Covid-19 cases.The Congress alone cannot be blamed for the surge but their continued march without masks and through villages across the Old Mysuru region has the potential to spread the virus to villages as people return to their homes. Not wearing masks or maintaining social distance by the public is a big problem, experts said.That the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is ‘mild’ has been rejected as a wrong notion by experts. Infectious disease epidemiologist and Covid-19 Technical Lead at the World Health Organisation (WHO) Maria Van Kerkhove on Tuesday said that Omicron is not a mild disease as “people are still being hospitalized for Omicron,” according to a PTI report.“Omicron has been detected in all countries where we have good sequencing and it’s likely to be in all countries around the world. It is quick, in terms of its circulation, overtaking Delta. And so Omicron is becoming the dominant variant that is being detected,” Kerkhove said during a virtual questions and answers session, PTI reported.But all of the blame cannot be placed squarely on the Congress as the Bommai-led government and his predecessor, BS Yediyurappa, too have taken decisions that are more ‘reactionary’ than ‘preventive’ with restrictions coming only after caseload reaches unmanageable levels.The Bommai government’s decision to go in for night and weekend curfews on December 26 was based on the rise in daily infections that was in the week before averaging at over 2000 cases across the state.Then chief minister BS Yediyurappa had allowed bypolls and other political events to carry on unhindered for at least two months before abruptly announcing a 14-day lockdown on April 21 last year.“The second wave was driven by political activities,” Dr N Ravi, a noted virologist, said.“Whoever does it is being irresponsible. I can be irresponsible and get infected. That is my personal choice. But when I am irresponsible and put others at risk, I think I should be put behind bars,” he said. The Yediyurappa government started to relax restrictions in 2021 when the caseload was 2,955,772 in January and then 1,762,845 in February. However, despite a steep increase in cases in March (caseload 2,614,401), Yediyurappa had decided to look the other way to clear the field for elections and repeatedly denied any chance of a lockdown. But soon enough a lockdown was announced, adding to the financial hardships of the state’s population.Dr Ravi said that restrictions are necessary, backing night and weekend curfews. “These are the times that people normally go out or get together, adding to the spread,” he said.“When it comes to health and disease spread control, politicians cutting across party lines don’t care for it. Their survival and their image are more important than a fellow human being suffering,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-experts-link-covid-spike-to-political-activities-101642014050972.html
13-01-2022||India||75% rise in Parliament Covid-19 cases over 3 days; 718 test positive||At least 700 parliament officials have tested positive for Covid-19 since December 4, a senior Rajya Sabha official said on Wednesday. According to data compiled by HT, this indicates a rise of nearly 75% in cases reported from Parliament house complex since January 9.Till January 9 ( from the first week of December), nearly 400 cases were reported from the complex. While most officials testing positive are asymptomatic, authorities are concerned about the prevalence of the infection ahead of the crucial budget session, scheduled to start on January 31.“718 have tested positive in Parliament house complex since December 4. These include 204 people in the Rajya Sabha secretariat. Rest of the cases were reported from the Lok Sabha secretariat and allied services,” the official cited above added.“RS chairman M Venkaiah Naidu has reviewed the situation with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and the secretary generals of both Houses have been asked to explore options on how the budget session can be conducted amid this third surge in Covid-19 cases,” the official added.Both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have asked a third of their staff to work from home, officials familiar with the matter said. That includes half of the officials and staff below the rank of undersecretary/executive officers. All of them will work from home till the end of January.A Lok Sabha circular also directed officers visiting Parliament to maintain a staggered working schedule to avoid crowding. “The working hours of all employees who attend office may be staggered between 10 am to 10.30 am with corresponding office exit timings to avoid rush in commuting as also in lifts and corridors,” it said. HT has reviewed a copy of the circular.HT reported on Wednesday that authorities are exploring several options including a staggered timetable for Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha and a highly dispersed seating arrangement for the MPs for the upcoming session.“We are looking at various options, but the final option would depend on the Covid-19 situation towards the end of this month. The Lok Sabha Speaker and the Rajya Sabha chairman will meet around January 25 or 26 to decide how to run the session,” said a top-ranking functionary.Officials are also not sure if this session will run its normal course. A top functionary said the elections in five states is another key factor that might ultimately lead to a curtailed session..
13-01-2022||India||Covid-19 testing options enhanced in India: ICMR||Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has significantly enhanced availability of testing products in the country as part of its purposive strategy for Covid-19 tests, said its director general on Wednesday.“They (testing products) are huge in number; and citizens have been empowered (as part of the strategy) to get tests done easily whether it is home based test, rapid antigen test or RT-PCR. The purpose of the revised testing strategy that was released two days back is early detection of symptomatic cases for quick care, and early detection of the infection for the elderly with co-morbidities for quick care,” said Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR, during the weekly Covid briefing.India has tested about 700 million samples to detect Covid-19 in the past two years, across 3,128 laboratories.In all, 205 RT-PCR kits, 53 rapid antigen test kits, and seven home antigen test kits have been approved and are currently in use in the country. India’s daily capacity of RT-PCR tests at present is roughly two million .

Learning from the pandemic, we keep working to ensure inclusive and quality healthcare services to all our countrymen,” he said,The Prime Minister said that they are working towards taking Indian practices such as Yoga, Ayurveda and Siddha to the world. “In the coming years I envision India as being the go-to destination for quality and affordable care,” he said. “India has everything needed to be a hub for medical tourism. I say this based on the skills of our doctors.” He urged the medical fraternity to take up at telemedicine as well.“I am told that this would be the first time that 11 medical colleges are being inaugurated at one stroke located in any one state,” Modi said adding that recently, he had inaugurated 9 medical colleges at one go in Uttar Pradesh.With these 11 new colleges -- one each in Virudhunagar, Namakkal, Nilgiris, Tiruppur, Thiruvallur, Nagapattinam, Dindigul, Kallakurichi, Ariyalur, Ramanathapuram and Krishnagiri -- the total number of government medical colleges in the state has increased to 36 with the total number of medical colleges in the state at 70, which is the highest in the country, a state health department official said.The 11 colleges were sanctioned during the regime of NDA ally AIADMK between 2017-2021. A major part of construction was completed before the DMK assumed office in May 2021.The colleges have been constructed at an estimated cost of nearly ₹4,000 crore, of which around ₹2,415 crore has been given by the union government and the remaining amount is met by the state.Talking about his fascination for the Tamil language, Modi also pitched for the Centre’s National Education Policy (NEP) which the DMK-led government has been opposing.Tamil Nadu has been planning to come up with a state education policy. “We have given great emphasis on promotion of Indian languages and Indian Knowledge Systems in our National Education Policy 2020,” Modi said. “Tamil can now be studied as a classical language in school education at the secondary level or middle level. Tamil is one of the languages in the Bhasha-Sangam where school students get familiar with 100 sentences in various Indian languages in audio, videos.”During his address, chief minister M K Stalin asked the Prime Minister to consider the state’s request seeking exemption from NEET favourably. “…the admission policy of Tamil Nadu plays a very important role in our health infrastructure. It is to protect this, we have been continuously demanding NEET exemption for Tamil Nadu,” Stalin told the Prime Minister. “Our moto is to provide opportunities to poor people and those from the hinterland. This policy is the reason for Tamil Nadu’s success in the health sector.”
13-01-2022||India||Northwest regions record 628% excess rain: IMD data||The northwest India has recorded 628% excess rainfall during the past 10 days with all nine subdivisions in the region recording large excess downpour (over 60% above normal), according to data released by India Meteorological Department (IMD).Central India also recorded 293% excess rain in the period from January 1 to 12, leading to cumulative 373% excess rainfall over the country.“Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi recorded 53.3 mm rain against a normal of only 4.2mm, an excess of 1,169%; Punjab recorded 80.3 mm against normal of 5 mm rain (1,502% excess); Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh recorded 128.1 mm against normal of 21.1 mm rain (507% excess),” IMD data suggests.According to data compiled by IMD, Pune, while the northwest India generally records an average of 68.5mm rain in the winter months of January and February, in January so far (till Wednesday), the region has already witnessed 59 mm of rainfall. This was mainly due to the effect of three western disturbances and moisture incursion from Arabian Sea, IMD said, adding two more western disturbances are expected to affect northwest India next week.“In a very few days a lot of rain has been recorded due to consecutive active western disturbances affecting the Western Himalayan region. Normally so much rain is not expected during this season. These western disturbances have also caused large amounts of rain over central India. We had forecast that there would be above average rains in January. Since two more western disturbances are expected to affect the region till January 18, all subdivisions will continue to record excess and large excess rains. The rain will favour winter crops over northwest India,” said DS Pai, head of the climate research and services at IMD, Pune.Farmers maintained that the winter rain has favoured a few crops, but it has also caused largescale damages to certain produce.“So far rain has been favourable for farmers, especially for wheat and mustard, but potato crop has suffered a lot due to excessive rains. The dependence on irrigation has reduced,” said Harinder Lakhowal, general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union.The western disturbance, which caused widespread rain over northwest India last week, is lying as a cyclonic circulation over northwest Uttar Pradesh. “A trough (line of low pressure) is running from south interior Karnataka to south Chhattisgarh in lower tropospheric levels. A cyclonic circulation is lying over south Konkan in lower tropospheric levels. Confluence of winds from Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal at lower tropospheric levels is likely to continue over east and adjoining central India during next three days,” IMD said in its forecast on Wednesday.This would mean widespread rain over central and east India. Widespread light to moderate rainfall is likely over Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Sikkim, Telangana and Coastal Andhra Pradesh during January 12 to 14 and isolated to scattered light to moderate rainfall over Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh is likely till January 14, IMD said.Isolated heavy rainfall is likely over Odisha on Thursday while isolated thunderstorms with lightning and hail is likely to continue over Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Sikkim till then.Scattered to fairly widespread rainfall is very likely over most northeastern states, including Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura on Wednesday and Thursday.“Under the influence of a cyclonic circulation over Southwest Bay of Bengal and another over south Tamil Nadu in lower tropospheric levels, rainfall or thundershowers are likely over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and Mahe during next four-five days,” IMD predicted.Meanwhile, two fresh western disturbances are likely to affect northwest India, the first from January 16 and likely to cause isolated to scattered rainfall on January 16 and 17; the second from January 18 and likely to cause light/moderate scattered to fairly widespread rainfall over the Western Himalayan region and light isolated to scattered rainfall over adjoining plains for subsequent two-three days, IMD said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/northwest-regions-record-628-excess-rain-imd-data-101642013215968.html
13-01-2022||India||NIA told to probe illegal Rohingya immigration||The government has asked the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to probe what it believes is a well-oiled international illegal immigration racket, in which Rohingyas and Bangladeshi Muslims enter India illegally through porous border passages in Assam, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Meghalaya using fake documents, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.Initial information with central agencies reveals the racket is run from Bengaluru but has a presence across India. The people involved not only organize the illegal entry of Rohingyas and Bangladeshi Muslims, but also arrange their transportation to various cities so that they settle there, said an official with a central agency.The person behind the racket has been identified as Kumkum Ahmed Chaudhury of Bengaluru, who supervises illegal migration in association with Sahalam Laskar of Jammu and Raju Ali, a Pakistani national. Chaudhury and Laskar originally hail from Assam but operate from Bengaluru and Jammu , the first official added.While asking the NIA to look into the matter, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) said in a communication to the agency that “there is a well-designed larger conspiracy to exploit the illegal migrants and also to destabilize the population ratio and demographic scenario of the country”. HT has seen a copy of the communication dated December 23.It is suspected the gang has been successful in bringing several Rohingyas into the country over the past few years.The central anti-terror probe agency has already formally taken up the investigation in the matter couple of weeks back and a team is trying to gather details about the racket, said another official.The second official added that the network involved in sending Rohingyas to India usually arrange forged documents such as PAN cards, Aadhar numbers, driving licences and ration cardsThe Centre has maintained that illegal immigrants including Rohingyas pose a threat to national security and that there are reports about some Rohingya migrants indulging in illegal activities. The government also claimed in parliament last month it doesn’t maintain data on THE number of Rohingyas currently staying in India.In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court in September 2017, in response to a petition filed by two Rohingya immigrants seeking refugee status, the home ministry said “Continuance of Rohingyas’ illegal immigration into India and their continued stay has serious national security ramifications and threats.”The affidavit estimated that there were then around 40,000 Rohingyas Muslims in the country. It added that intelligence inputs suggested some Rohingyas had links with Pakistan-based terror organizations and that they were indulging in anti-national activities such as mobilization of funds through hawala channels, procuring fake identities and indulging in human trafficking.Through multiple communiqués the MHA has asked states to identify illegal Rohingyas and deport them.India is not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention and rejects the UN position that deporting Rohingyas violates the principle of refoulment , sending refugees back to face danger.UN Chief Antonio Guterres said in October last year that at least 15,000 people from Myanmar are estimated to have crossed the border into India since the February 1 military coup there.Over 7 lakh Rohingya Muslims , one of the largest minority ethnic groups of Myanmar, fled their country in 2017 following a deadly crackdown. The majority of them are now living in refugee camps in Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-told-to-probe-illegal-rohingya-immigration-101642013090605.html
13-01-2022||India||SC notice to Uttarakhand govt in Haridwar hate speech case||The Supreme Court on Wednesday sought a response from the Uttarakhand government on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a former Patna high court judge and a journalist, demanding stringent action against those involved in making hate speeches at a religious event held in Haridwar last month where some speakers allegedly called for violence against Muslims and Christians.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, also allowed the petitioners to approach the local administration and police authorities in Uttar Pradesh with their plea to stop a similar religious event in Aligarh on January 23. “For the present, we are issuing notice to the state government...We also permit the petitioners to bring to the notice of the concerned local authorities the relevant laws and orders of this court with respect to the event that is going to take place,” directed the bench, also comprising justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli.The bench said that it would take up the PIL after ten days, during which time the court would also ascertain if there is any similar case already pending before it and that the fresh case should be heard along with the old matter. During the hearing, the CJI observed that there are enough provisions under the Indian Penal Code and other laws against hate speeches, besides a judgment of the Supreme Court in 2019 that issued various guidelines for the Centre, states and Union territories to act against such offenders. “The law is already there. There are enough provisions under the IPC etc. There is no difficulty as far as the law is concerned. There are directions of this court too. What do we say when there is already a law?” the bench asked senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for the petitioners, former HC judge Anajana Prakash and journalist Qurban Ali.Sibal responded that although the apex court has dealt with the issue of hate speech in the past, problems arising out of religious events called “Dharm Sansad” were being taken to it for the first time. “We are now dealing with Dharm Sansads where calls for genocides are being made. Due to these Dharm Sansads, the atmosphere of entire country will be vitiated. The ethos of this country and the social fabric is under threat,” added Sibal. At this, senior advocate Indira Jaising also intervened on behalf of activist Tushar Gandhi, who was one of the petitioners in the case when the Supreme Court in 2019 issued directives on appointing nodal officers to curb hate speeches and stop mob lynching over suspected cow slaughter.“The direction by this court to appoint nodal officers to prevent such incidents have not been implemented by any state. Had those directions been implemented, these problems would not keep cropping up. While the 2019 direction was on mob lynching over cow slaughter, here is an open call to exterminate one particular community. This issue has not been addressed by any court till date,” argued Jaising. The bench, however, clarified that it would first ascertain if similar matters were already being heard by any other bench in the top court. “This is a matter I want to take up and hear it but if some other bench is already seized of it, we cannot entertain it here,” justice Ramana told the counsel. On a request by Sibal to urgently list the matter in the wake of another Dharm Sansad being organised in Aligarh on January 23, the bench said that the petitioners were permitted to approach concerned authorities in Uttar Pradesh with their plea to stop the event. The court has also issued notices to the Centre and Delhi Police. The petition has made Centre a party over issuance of nationwide guidelines against events like Dharm Sansads. The Delhi Police has been involved by the petitioner in connection to the event organised by representatives of right-wing organisation ‘Hindu Yuva Vahini’ in the Capital last month. On Monday, the bench agreed to urgently list for hearing this petition after Sibal requested it.The event in Haridwar, held from 17-19 December, was organised by Yati Narsinghanand, a religious leader who has been accused in the past of inciting violence with his incendiary speeches. After several controversial videos from the event that were circulated on social media triggered outrage, the Uttarakhand police registered a first information report (FIR) against some leaders present at the event, including Jitendra Narayan Singh Tyagi, formerly known as Waseem Rizvi, for allegedly giving a “provocative speech” against “a particular religion” (Islam) at the Dharm Sansad. No arrests have been made in the case so far.Uttarakhand minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said, “The government will examine the Supreme Court order and follow the directives. As far as the action taken by the government is concerned, an SIT has already been formed which is probing the case as per the law.”Rizvi was the former chairman of the Shia Central Waqf Board who converted to Hinduism on December 6 last year in the presence of Narsinghanand. Former Patna HC judge and senior advocate Prakash, and journalist Qurban Ali, have approached the Supreme Court complaining of inaction against those who made hate speeches at the Haridwar Dharm Sansad and in Delhi. Few days after a case was registered against the accused in the matter another video went viral in which a police official from Haridwar Kotwali police station, where the case was registered, was seen sharing a laugh with some of the accused in the case, including Narsinghanand, Tyagi and Annapuna Maa. Urging the court to set up a special investigation team to probe the incident and bring guilty to book, the petition has said that the speeches made at the Sansad posed a grave threat not just to the unity and integrity of the country but also endangered the lives of millions of Muslim citizens.It also cited some viral videos of the incident, reportedly showing proclamations made by various religious leaders at the event while contending that the Police authorities are hand in glove with the perpetrators of communal hate.Meanwhile, the accused have maintained that they stick to their statements in the Dharm Sansad and there was nothing wrong in it. In addition, several other seers have decided to hold a protest meeting in Haridwar on January 16 protesting the registration of the criminal case against participants in the conclave .

Stating that the ‘bandh’ call was illegal on the basis of a Supreme Court order, Talo Potom, district magistrate of Itanagar, directed BSNL and all other private internet service providers to suspend mobile internet including wi-fi services in the capital region.In his order, Potom said that the move was necessary “to prevent occurrence of serious law and order problems” during the proposed ‘bandh’ called by ANYA. Last month, ANYA, which is the premier youth association of the Nyishi tribe, had levelled corruption charges against Khandu and asked him to respond within 15 days.On December 30, the association demanded Khandu’s resignation within seven days for failing to respond to the charges. On January 10, ANYA announced a decision to call a 36-hr-long strike demanding his resignation.On Tuesday, the Itanagar district magistrate declared the strike as illegal, and banned the entry of people from outside the capital region unless they have a valid reason or a medical emergency. Potom’s order said there were reports that there will be a huge influx of supporters of bandh call from ditricts to the capital region and such influx may lead to serious law and order problems.
13-01-2022||India||Winter sowing powers on despite third wave||India’s rabi or winter sowing is powering on robustly despite the pandemic as above-normal seasonal rains have set the stage for the rapid planting of key crops, exceeding last year’s levels for this time of the year, official data shows.The farm sector has emerged relatively unscathed from the pandemic due to higher subsidies and fewer Covid-related curbs even as millions of farmers were on protest against three farm laws, which were eventually repealed by the government on November 30. However, oversupply of labour in the hinterland, triggered by migration of millions of workers back to villages due to the closure of several sources of employment due to the pandemic, and the prices of produce, will still weigh on the farm economy, analysts said.As on January 10, the total area sown under rabi crops is 65.2 million hectares, against 64.6 million hectares sown during the corresponding period of last year. The total area shows a marginal increase of nearly 600,000 hectares.“Overall, there has been no impact of the pandemic on farm operations and total acreages are expected to exceed last year’s levels if current sowing trends holds,” said Abhishek Agrawal, an analyst with Comtrade.Agriculture has chugged on unharmed by successive waves of coronavirus infections. In 2020-21, when India faced a rare recession due to the pandemic, agriculture was the only sector to post positive growth of about 3.1%. This helped keep farm incomes steady. Higher fertiliser subsidies, raised by ₹14,000 crore during the summer-sown season, kept farm growth up.According to data from the India Meteorological Department, winter rainfall in the country stood at 8.1mm against normal of 2.4mm, which is a departure of (+) 237% during the period from January 1 to January 10.“These rains have been beneficial for early sowing although they have been damaging for some crops in some southern states,” Agrawal said.According to official advance estimates of GDP for 2021-22 released this week, the agriculture sector is estimated to grow at 3.9%, higher than the 3.6% expansion recorded in the previous financial year. The targeted growth rate for the farm sector is 4%. Overall, the country’s GDP is estimated to expand to 9.2%, lower than the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) December 2021 projection of 9.5%.The farm sector is crucial to Asia’s third-largest economy because it employs the most people and spurs overall demand. For example, when farm output is strong, nearly half of all consumer goods, such as television sets, are sold in rural areas.Good harvests help keeping a lid on inflation, but also tend to depress farmers’ incomes in a country where half the population depends on a farm-derived livelihood.Lower inflation is key to the Reserve Bank’s holding of interest rates steady to boost growth, as the economy battles another Covid wave due to the highly transmissible Omicron variant.The country’s retail inflation however rose sharply to 5.59% in December 2021 from 4.91% in November, pushed up by rising prices of manufactured items and food, data released by the government showed on Wednesday. Food inflation rose to 4.05% in December from 1.87% in November.The latest sowing trends show a shift towards oilseeds, a scare commodity, from cereals. Rapeseed and mustard have been sown on 8.9 million hectares compared to 7.2 million hectares sown during the corresponding period last year, up 23%.In recent months, prices of cooking oil, two-thirds of which is imported, had increased to record levels due to higher international prices.The higher acreage in oilseeds has resulted in slightly lower acreage under wheat, whose net-sown area stands at 33.3 million hectare against last year’s 33.9 million hectare for this time of the year.The area under pulses, another key commodity, stood at 15.6 million hectare compared to 15.7 million hectare.“The farm sector has shown remarkable resilience because of two reasons. One, rural supply lines, especially of agricultural inputs, held steady despite the pandemic. Two, rains were plentiful during the 2021 monsoon,” said DK Joshi, chief economist of Crisil Ltd, a ratings agency.
13-01-2022||India||New study shows how coronavirus loses infectivity once exhaled||When exhaled, the Sars-CoV-2 is most potent in causing infection within the first two minutes. It then drops significantly over the next three minutes, and between five and 20 minutes, it consistently loses potency to cause infection, retaining only 10% of its infectivity at the 20th minute.The insights have been drawn from a first-of-its-kind study by scientists at the University of Bristol, who used novel techniques to keep the virus suspended in a controlled environment using electrostatic energy. The researchers exposed the virus to varying levels of humidity and found that the coronavirus survived longer when the air was more moist, but rapidly lost their ability to replicate when it was drier.The authors explain the science behind why it happens: the virus is transmitted as airborne droplets, surrounded by water that includes various chemicals. When the relative humidity is low, the droplets begin to crystallise quickly, robbing the virus of its biological viability.The most rapid loss in infectivity happened when the relative humidity of air was in the 40% range – in this condition, the virus lost half of its infectivity within the first five seconds. But if the relative humidity was at 80-90%, it retained 48% of infectivity for a good five minutes.What does this mean?Fundamentally, it shows what has been understood from real-world observations: the majority of the transmission happens during prolonged, consistent contact with an infectious person. If the person is talking loudly or singing, they are consistently spewing out more viral particles, which increases the chances of someone getting infected. It also suggests that most infection happens when transmission is at a shorter range. This is why outdoor spaces have consistently proven to be safer. The correlation between humidity and infection viability of the virus suggests that the likelihood that someone will catch the virus in summer is lower than in monsoon, if they are exposed to a contagious person for the same duration of time at the same distance. The equation become a little complicated in Indian winters, though. Relative humidity depends on temperature – if it’s cold, the air’s ability to hold is water is reduced, consequently raising the relative humidity levels. Conversely, for instance, if you switch on a heater in your room on a cold day, the relative humidity will reduce and you will feel it becoming drier as the higher temperature expands the air’s ability to hold water.Does it hold true for Omicron too?It almost certainly does, the authors say. While the test did not include the Omicron variant, the scientists found the loss of infectivity was consistent across three variants that they tested. They also detailed the “physiochemical” processes that essentially reduce the virus’s viability. Biological fluids like saliva and the airborne particles we exhale carry chemical buffers – these buffers tend to be stable at a particle level of acidity. But once they come in contact with their air, they become more alkaline. In other words, the vapour which the virus floats after being exhaled becomes less suited for the pathogen’s survival. The reasons for this, the scientists added, will be further investigated by them.Studies published over the last month suggest that Omicron may be spreading more readily because it thrives significantly better in the upper respiratory passage. In any case, the new study that shows how the virus survives or loses infectivity reinforces the need for people to stay masked, avoid prolonged, close contact, and ventilate indoor spaces.
13-01-2022||India||Conflict last resort, but ready for it: Army chief||India will deal with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in a firm and peaceful way, but if it comes to war or conflict, the country will emerge victorious, Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on Wednesday.While expressing hope that the ongoing dialogue with China will help resolve the lingering border row in eastern Ladakh, where the two armies have been locked in a standoff for more than 20 months, he said the Indian Army was at its highest level of operational preparedness in the sensitive sector, where the situation was under control.“What happens and whether a situation escalates or not is difficult to foretell or predict. But whatever we have done so far (augmenting troops, weapons and infrastructure), we’re in a position to meet whatever is thrown at us in the future. I can assure you that. War or conflict is always an instrument of last resort. But if resorted to, we will come out victorious,” the army chief said at his annual press briefing ahead of Army Day on January 15.
13-01-2022||India||Probe report on Nagaland killings in 1-2 days: Army chief||The army court of inquiry into the killing of 13 civilians in a botched counter-insurgency operation in Nagaland’s Mon district last month is expected to submit its report in a day or two, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on Wednesday.Appropriate action will be taken and corrective measures instituted to further refine the army’s standard operating procedures (SOPs) based on the outcome of the investigation, he said.The army inquiry is being conducted under a major general posted in the country’s North-east. A special investigation team (SIT) set up by the Nagaland government is also probing the incident. The civilians were killed in two separate firing incidents on December 4 and 5 last year.In the first incident, army personnel gunned down six coal mine workers after mistaking them for insurgents. Soon, angry villagers reached the spot and set ablaze security vehicles, sparking off another round of firing by the forces to control the situation in which seven villagers and one soldier died.“The regrettable incident is being thoroughly investigated. We remain committed to the security of our countrymen, even in the conduct of operations. We have SOPs that encapsulate our operational experience, which have stood the test of time. Corrective measures will be instituted to further refine our SOPs,” the army chief said at his annual press briefing ahead of Army Day on January 15.The December 4 incident involved a Special Forces unit that had laid an ambush after receiving intelligence inputs on the movement of militants in the area.The gunning down of the civilians renewed the demand for the withdrawal of the Armed Forces Special Power Act (AFSPA) from the state. The Act, which grants special powers to the forces to maintain public order in “disturbed areas”, has been a contentious issue in the state, with civil society members saying it gives army personnel impunity to carry out excesses and forces saying it helps them maintain order in restive areas.The AFSPA bestows sweeping powers on the forces and prohibits prosecutions from being initiated without the go-ahead from the Centre, if the allegations are linked to the public duty of the accused.The incident came weeks after militants ambushed an Assam Rifles convoy near the porous India-Myanmar border in Manipur’s Churachandpur district, killing five soldiers, including a colonel, his wife and their eight-year-old son.Reacting to the army chief’s statement, Konyak Union, the apex tribal body in Nagaland’s Mon district, demanded that any action taken report should be brought in public domain.“I heard about the army chief’s statement today. We shall see when the investigation report is out. As for his announcement that appropriate action will be taken, our people’s demand right from the start is that any action taken report should be brought out in the public domain,” said Howing Konyak, president of Konyak Union.The union had earlier served a 30-day ultimatum to the government, demanding that all officers and jawans involved in the killings of civilians be booked under applicable civil court, and the action taken report must be brought before the public domain. The ultimatum expired on January 10.Howing Konyak said a crucial all-Konyak Summit convened by the tribe’s civil society organisations is scheduled to be held on January 14 to deliberate on the further course of action.All nine Konyak legislators in the state’s 60-member assembly, along with village council leaders, civil servants, leaders of student unions and women organisations are expected to attend the summit.
13-01-2022||India||Somnath appointed ISRO chief||Senior rocket scientist S Somnath was on Wednesday appointed the next chairperson of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) and the space secretary, an order issued by the central government said.Somnath, currently the director of the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, will take over from K Sivan, who is set to retire on Friday.Fifty-eight-year-old Somnath, who will become the 10th chairperson of the Indian space agency, has previously held the position of team leader for the Integration of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). He is a graduate in mechanical engineering from Kerala University, and completed his postgraduation in aerospace engineering from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru.“His appointment is for a combined tenure of three years from the date of joining of the post, inclusive of an extension in tenure beyond the age of superannuation in public interest,” an order issued by the Centre said.Speaking to the media, Somnath said that the aim during his tenure will be to expand the space programme on a bigger scale.“The primary responsibility is to create a space enterprise in the country where all stakeholders come together to expand the space programme in the country on a bigger scale and aligning the overall space programme with the mission of the government,” he said.Sivan, the outgoing Isro chief, was in January 2018 appointed as the space agency’s chairperson, secretary of the department of space and chairman, space commission. He was in December 2020 given a one-year extension till January 14, 2022. The posts of the ISRO chairman, the space secretary and the space commission chief are usually held by the same person.The announcement came on a day Isro successfully conducted the qualification test of the cryogenic engine for the Gaganyaan programme for a duration of 720 seconds at its propulsion complex in Tamil Nadu’s Mahendragiri.India’s first-of-its-kind human space mission, the Gaganyaan is set to be launched in 2023, the Union ministry of science and technology said last year. This launch will make India the fourth nation in the world to launch a human spaceflight mission after the US, Russia and China.“The performance of the engine met the test objectives and the engine parameters were closely matching with the predictions during the entire duration of the test,” Isro said.“This successful long-duration test is a major milestone for the human space programme – Gaganyaan. It ensures the reliability and robustness of the cryogenic engine for induction into the human-rated launch vehicle for Gaganyaan.”The ISRO said that this engine will undergo four more tests for a cumulative duration of 1,810 seconds and, subsequently, one more engine will undergo two short-duration tests and one long-duration test to complete the cryogenic engine qualification for the Gaganyaan programme.
13-01-2022||India||Centre asks BARC to resume TV ratings for news channels||NEW DELHI: The ministry of information and broadcasting on Wednesday asked the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) to resume the release of television rating points (TRPs) for TV news channels and sought the release of data of the last three months for a “fair and equitable representation of true trends”.“The ministry of information and broadcasting has asked the BARC to release the news ratings with immediate effect and also to release the last three months' data, for the genre in a monthly format, for fair and equitable representation of true trends,” the ministry said.The resumption comes after over a year of TRPs being suspended following allegations of manipulation of ratings that emerged in October 2020. The Mumbai Police arrested at least five people over an alleged TRP scam. The police also questioned executives of Arnab Goswami-led Republic Media Group with regard to the case. Republic Media Group has denied any wrongdoing.As the controversy grew at the time, the BARC, which provides TRP data, announced a three-month-long suspension of weekly ratings of news channels across languages.The council said it would review and augment the current standards of measurement to improve on “statistical robustness”, as the government set up a four-member panel to look into the allegations and submit its report within two months.The joint industry body, which includes broadcasters, advertisers, and advertising and media agencies, said that it has initiated changes in the governance structure in keeping with the “spirit of the TRP Committee Report and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI’s) recommendation dated 28.04.2020”.“The BARC has undertaken revision in its processes, protocols, oversight mechanism and initiated changes in governance structure etc,” the statement added. It has also initiated a reconstitution of the board and technical committee to allow for the induction of independent member and will be an oversight committee. It has also tightened and revamped the access protocols for data.As per the revised system, the reporting of news and niche genres shall be on a ‘four-week rolling average concept’. “The BARC has indicated that in view of the changes undertaken by it, they are reaching out to related constituencies to explain the new proposals and are in readiness to actually commence the release as per the new protocols,” the statement said.The ministry, meanwhile, has also set up a working group under the chairmanship of the CEO, Prasar Bharati, Shashi Shekhar Vempati for the consideration of leveraging the Return Path Data (RPD) capabilities for the use of TRP services, as also recommended by TRAI and the TRP Committee Report. The Committee has been asked to submit its report in four months’ time. RPD capabilities imply that the set top box which is receiving the signal will be able to convey data on how the subscriber is using the box. The idea is to for the set top box to automatically capture the subscriber behaviour to provide an accurate estimate of viewership.The National Broadcasters Association is slated to hold a meeting to discuss the decision on Thursday, following which the organisation will issue a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-barc-to-resume-tv-ratings-for-news-channels-101642011591965.html
13-01-2022||India||PM’s security lapse: Ex-SC judge to head probe panel||The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the constitution of a five-member independent committee to be headed by a retired judge of the court, justice Indu Malhotra, to investigate and fix responsibility on those responsible for the breach of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security in Punjab last week.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, was critical of the “blame game” between the Centre and the state government over the issue, and directed that the committee to ascertain the causes of the breach and those accountable for it. It also asked the committee to recommend remedial measures and safeguards necessary for the security of the Prime Minister or others protected by the special protection group (SPG).To be sure, the PM is currently the SPG’s only protectee after a change in the security norms in 2019. All others who fall in the highest Z+ category are protected by the Central Reserve Police Force.“Not only are the officer(s)/authority responsible for the above­-stated lapse liable to be identified, but there is also a greater urgency to evolve new measures that may ensure there is no recurrence of such lapses in the future,” held the bench, which also included justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli.The committee will also comprise the registrar general of the Punjab & Haryana high court, director general (DG) of Chandigarh Police, director general or his nominee not below the rank of inspector general of police of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), and additional director general of police (security) in the Punjab Police.Asking the committee to submit its report “at the earliest”, the bench directed both the Centre and the Punjab government to put in abeyance their respective inquiry panels till the committee concludes its investigation.It held that the pertinent questions on PM’s security breach cannot be resolved through “one-­sided inquiries” and that a judicially trained independent mind, duly assisted by competent officers, would be best placed to effectively visit all issues and submit a comprehensive report for the consideration of this court.The top court took note of the war of words between Centre and the Punjab government, which have accused each other of lapses that led to the unprecedented breach. “There is, however, a blame game between the state and central government as to who is responsible for such lapses. War of words between them is no solution. It may rather impair the need of a robust mechanism to respond at such a critical juncture,”said the court.The Prime Minister was stuck on a flyover for 15-20 minutes on the road from Bathinda to Ferozepur on January 5 due to a blockade by protesters while headed for an election rally. The incident sparked a furious political battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress government in Punjab, which goes to the polls next month.In its 11-page order issued on Wednesday, the court underlined the significance of the issue raised by a lawyer-run orgnisation, Lawyer’s Voice, in a public interest litigation (PIL) in so far as ensuring the security of the Prime Minister by the SPG is concerned.“Any lapse in this regard can lead to devastating and serious consequences,” stated the court while pointing out that the legislative intent behind the SPG Act and the Blue Book (a set of instructions under which the SPG holds an advance security liaison with everyone involved in securing a PM’s event) maps out a comprehensive mechanism for ensuring proximate security of the Prime Minister while he is touring a state.The additional object of the provisions and the Blue Book, said the court, is to avoid any human error, negligence or any wilful omission or commission which may hamper or expose the safety and security of the executive head of the nation while he is travelling in a particular state.The court directed the Union and state governments to provide all assistance to the members of the committee for completion of the assigned task while adjourning the petition until a report is received from the panel.The PIL by Lawyer’s Voice, argued through senior advocate Maninder Singh, sought a “professional and effective” investigation into the incident after immediately securing all the relevant materials in safe custody. The plea also demanded the suspension of Punjab’s chief secretary and director general of police (DGP) over the unprecedented lapse.Taking up the petition for the first time on Friday last week, the court directed the DG, Chandigarh, and an NIA officer to assist the high court registrar general in taking custody of all materials related to the PM’s security breach. It also asked the inquiry committees of the Centre and state to not proceed for the time being.On Monday, the bench shot down the Union government’s request to let the Centre’s inquiry panel conclude its probe into the incident, declaring that it would constitute an independent panel, to be headed by a retired SC judge, to probe the episode.The court also pulled up the Centre for insisting on its inquiry panel proceeding against the chief secretary and Punjab DGP over the security lapse even as it simultaneously urged the bench to examine the matter.During the previous hearings of the case, the Centre, represented by solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta, remained emphatic that Punjab’s chief secretary and DGP could not escape the statutorily mandated proceedings against them since they were directly responsible for ensuring a secure route for PM, and had even approved the route where the convoy was halted due to the protesters.The Punjab government’s advocate general DS Patwalia, on his part, objected to the show-cause notices issued to state chief secretary and DGP, complaining that the notices already recorded findings that the officers prima facie violated directions issued under the SPG Act by not ensuring adequate security. “I am sanguine that I won’t get a fair hearing before Centre or any central agency. Please, hang me if I am guilty but don’t condemn me without a hearing,” Patwalia told the court at the time.The breach in the security forced the PM to cancel his first rally in poll-bound Punjab. The Union home ministry sought a report on the incident from the state government.Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi expressed regret over the incident but rejected allegations of any complicity. Channi claimed that his government did not have information about the PM going by road instead if in a chopper which was a last-minute decision due to inclement weather.

The law provides for recognition of the identity of transgender persons, prohibition against discrimination and including them in education, health, social-security facilities as well as other welfare measures of the government.According to a National Crime Records Bureau, there were 70 transgender prisoners in jails across the country in 2020.The home ministry said the self-identity of transgender persons must be respected at all times while conducting admission procedures, medical examination, frisking, clothing, requisitioning of a police escort, treatment and care inside prisons.In this context, the home ministry asked prisons to facilitate the process of acquiring the transgender identity certificate under the transgender persons law if such a request is made.It also stressed that ‘transgender’ should be included as a category in the prison register as well as electronic records. In case a court warrant does not mention the self-identified gender of the inmate, the prison superintendent must make changes in the document with the help of legal services authorities, the advisory said.Also Read: Caring for the vulnerable:Transgender persons | OpinionA senior official at Delhi’s Tihar jail, the country’s largest correctional facility, said transgender inmates are well assimilated with other prisoners. “Currently, we have about 8-10 transgender inmates. The transmen are lodged in male prisons while transwomen are in female prisons according to their choice. The MHA advisory also says any separate enclosure should not result in their complete isolation. We also monitor their security situation”.Chayanika Shah, a Mumbai-based academician and activist, said: “It’s ironic that government comes with such advisory for prisons but on the other hand, the NCERT (National Council for Educational Research and Training) removes the teachers’ training manual on the integration of transgender or gender non-conforming students in schools from its website after the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) asks it to (NCERT removed the manual following a controversy in November 2021). First, these changes should be made outside, in society by providing transgender persons jobs, education, health facilities. As far as prisons are concerned, I think the person concerned should have the right to decide where he/she wants to be inside the prison.”Also Read: Sensitise teachers on transgender issues | OpinionThe home ministry advisory also said frisking of a transgender person may be conducted by a person of their preferred gender or by a trained medical professional and the person conducting the search much ensure the safety, dignity and privacy of the inmate.“At the stage, where the search requires stripping, it must be done in a private room or partition. The search should be confined to compliance with security protocols and restriction of contraband, and should not be aimed at determining the gender of the person,” MHA advisory said.Prison authorities have further been asked to provide health care facilities and meetings with family, legal advisers on par with other prisoners.“At the stage, where the search requires stripping, it must be done in a private room or partition. The search should be confined to compliance with security protocols and restriction of contraband and should not be aimed at determining the gender of the person,” MHA advisory warns.The prison authorities have further been asked to provide health care facilities and meeting with family, legal advisers at par with other prisoners.The advisory tells the prison chiefs to train and brief the staff about the protection of rights of transgender persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-separate-wards-for-transgender-inmates-mha-advisory-tells-prison-chiefs-101641903035152.html
13-01-2022||India||Has the peak of 3rd wave arrived? What Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru's Covid numbers say | 5 points||After reporting over 2.47 lakh cases on Thursday, India now stares at another surge on Friday as several states on Thursday evening reported a huge rise in the number of Covid cases -- highest in several months. Delhi on Thursday reported 28,867 fresh infections which is the all-time high for the Capital since the beginning of the pandemic. Bengaluru on Thursday reported 18,374 fresh Covid cases. Kolkata reported 6,768 cases while West Bengal's positivity rate reached 32.13% with 23,467 cases. Chennai on Thursday reported 8,218 cases.Maharashtra and Mumbai, however, maintained the 24-hour tally, with Mumbai seeing a dip in comparison with yesterday, and Maharashtra reporting around 46,000 cases.Where India stands in respect to 3rd wave:1. As hospitalisation has remained low in Delhi, health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said the ongoing wave has peaked in Delhi and cases may go down soon. A day after, Delhi reported the highest-ever single-day spike.‘Be ready for other Covid variants after Omicron': 3 things PM Modi emphasised in meeting with CMs2. "Epidemiologically, the peak of a wave is determined with the help of the rate of transmission, the number of infected people and the uninfected susceptible population. It can be plotted on a graph but the ground reality is always different from epidemiological modelling," Director of the National Institute for Implementation Research on Non-Communicable Diseases, Jodhpur, Dr Arun Sharma said. Dr Sharma said the positivity rate is the most important factor to understand a wave as the number of cases may increase or decrease depending upon the tests conducted.3. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said there is no indication of plateauing of the peak and the low number can be attributed to the low number of testing. According to ICMR's latest guideline, only symptomatic patients should get tested.4. Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, vice chairman of the research cell of Kerala's unit of Indian Medical Association, said the number of hospital admissions is the best indicator of the severity of the ongoing wave of the pandemic, but it is difficult to say whether the wave has peaked or not.5. According to scientific projections, the peak of the ongoing wave is likely to come anytime around January 15 and after that. The peak, as data scientists have projected, could be different in states.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday interacted with the chief ministers of the states and Union territories and emphasised local containment and home isolation. India's preparation should be ahead of all variants of Covid and after Omicron, India should be ready for other variants as well, PM Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/has-the-peak-of-3rd-wave-arrived-what-delhi-kolkata-bengaluru-s-covid-numbers-say-5-points-101642093500906.html
13-01-2022||India||India-China 14th round military dialogue fails to move forward||The 14th round of India-China military dialogue on Wednesday failed to yield any positive outcomes but both countries decide to work towards mutually acceptable solutions to resolving the Ladakh LAC stand-off. The next round is expected to be held soon to continue the momentum of discussions.While both sides are scheduled to come out with press statements today, the Indian side clearly failed to persuade the PLA towards disengagement from Gogra-Hot Springs near Kongka La as well as resolving patrolling rights issues in Depsang Bulge in Daulet Beg Oldi sector and Charding Nullah Junction in Demchok sector.In pure diplomatic language, the talks were constructive without any positive outcome and reaching mutually acceptable solutions is work in progress. This means both the Indian Army and the PLA commanders will continue to engage in future but there is no guarantee on whether the PLA will restore April 2020 status quo ante in Gogra-Hot Springs or resolve the Depsang Bulge or CNJ issue.The Indian Army apparently raised the issue of PLA building a bridge over Pangong Tso, east of Srijap Complex, for faster troop deployment and rapid militarisation of the occupied Aksai Chin area by the Chinese Army all along the 597-km Ladakh LAC.Fact is that the PLA with new border law and rapid military and technological upgradation on their side of the unresolved LAC is converting the 3,488 km line into Line of Control.Both the Indian and PLA armies are locked in a stand-off all along Ladakh LAC since the Chinese Army under instructions from the Central Military Commission under President Xi Jinping decided to unilaterally change the LAC and impose the rejected 1959 cartographical line on the Ladakh LAC in May 2020. Since then the two sides are fully deployed with more than three divisions of troops on each side with missile, rocket, artillery and tank regiments apart from the Air Force being on standby in the hinterland. The PLA by transgressing in Pangong Tso, Galwan, Gogra-Hot Springs area in May 2020 broke the bilateral 1993 and 1996 peace and tranquility agreements signed at the level of heads of states.While for China’s wolf warrior diplomats this is the new normal, the Modi government has rejected these aggressions and decided to bilateral relations in a cold storage till such time Beijing does not resolve the Ladakh LAC.

Pakistan has to accept what are their positions and what are ours, and both of us have to sign on the dotted line before any kind of disengagement takes place. What is happening in eastern Ladakh is quite similar…first disengagement, then de-induction and de-escalation, which is another way of saying demilitarisation,” the army chief said at his customary press briefing ahead of Army Day on January 15.Acceptance of AGPL is the first step towards demilitarisation but the Pakistan side loathes doing that. He said the Siachen situation occurred because of unilateral attempts by Pakistan to change status quo and countermeasures taken by the Indian Army.The Line of Control that divides India and Pakistan ends at a reference point called NJ 9842. The boundary beyond this point was referred to simply as “thence northwards to the glacier,” leading to different interpretations.“The LoC was delineated up to NJ 9842 and thereafter there was an understanding it would remain unoccupied. But since they made an effort to occupy it, we were forced to take countermeasures. And now both sides are face to face all along the glacier,” he said.The 76-km-long glacier acts as a wedge between the Shaksgam valley under Chinese control and Baltistan, which is occupied by Pakistan. Security experts have argued that occupation of the glacier will not allow the Pakistan army to link up with the Chinese and threaten Ladakh.The Indian Army launched Operation Meghdoot in April 1984 to secure the glacier after Pakistan army occupied the heights on Siachen. Several rounds of talks between India and Pakistan on demilitarising the Siachen glacier have failed with Islamabad refusing to authenticate troop positions on the ground.Almost 80% posts on the glacier are located above 16,000 feet, with Bana towering above the rest at 21,753 feet. Experts have cautioned against withdrawing from Siachen until Islamabad authenticates troop positions on the ground as it would be a formidable task to reclaim the glacier.India currently occupies dominating positions on the Saltoro ridge with Pakistani posts located 3,000 feet below.
13-01-2022||Today's||2022 elections: It’s back to divisive politics||Uttar Pradesh (UP) chief minister (CM) Yogi Adityanath has never hidden his saffron robes in politics. Which is why it isn’t a surprise when he calls the elections in the country’s most populous state an “80:20” battle, a reference to the Hindu-Muslim population ratio in UP. Eighty per cent are those who are supporters of nationalism, good governance and development, and “20% are those who are against the Ram Janmabhoomi and sympathise with terrorists,” argues Adityanath. Rarely has a CM attempted to shape the political discourse in such “us” versus “them” terms, but then never before has a monk, who once spearheaded a Hindu militant group, become CM.
13-01-2022||Today's||Tilak’s imprint on Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav||In September 1897, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak was tried for sedition for publishing two articles in Kesari, the weekly he published from Pune. The first was a poem “Shivaji’s utterances” and the second was an account of the proceedings of a festival held to commemorate Chhatrapati Shivaji’s coronation. The jury found Tilak guilty of sedition and sentenced him to 18 months in prison. Why were the British threatened by the description of the proceedings of a festival that was meant to mark Shivaji’s coronation? Since the early 1890s, Tilak strove to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi and Shivaji’s coronation as public events with large-scale participation. Jan Bhagidari (community participation) in these festivals led to the organising of various events: Public debates, recitation of hymns, and cultural programmes. Tilak felt that such occasions would build unity, instil a sense of pride in one’s culture and heritage, and inculcate a sense of patriotism towards the country. The article in Kesari carried observations Tilak made during the coronation festival. He said: “A country which cannot unite even on a few occasions cannot hope to prosper … We should not forget that Ram and Ravan felt no difficulty whatsoever to meet in the same temple on the occasion of worshipping Shankar”. Nations that celebrate together, bond together. Therefore, the role of festivals in acting as a glue that binds the country cannot be missed. National festivals such as Independence Day and Republic Day play a huge role in reminding us of the travails, struggles and sacrifices that our forefathers had to suffer to overthrow British colonialism and forge a new paradigm of governance. Community and religious festivals such as Makar Sankranti, which is being celebrated today, are important since they connect us to our heritage and civilisational ethos, spanning many millennia. Although most Indian festivals are often region-specific, the message they convey is always universal. This clearly distinguishes Indian festivals from those in the rest of the world. Festivals such as Eid and Christmas have always been embraced with open arms in India and the universal values that they offer are celebrated by a majority of people. The harvest festival of Makar Sankranti is celebrated across the nation under different names such as Uttarayan, Pongal, Ghughutiya, Lohri, Poush Sankranti, Suggi Habba, Makara Chaula, Maghi Sankrant, Magh Bihu, Shishur Saenkraat, and Khichdi Parv. This festival has different manifestations, based on the region: In the hills of Uttarakhand, children feed roasted flour with jaggery to crows to welcome migratory birds, in Gujarat the skies are filled with kites while people feast on Undhiyu. The Telugu state festivities involve decorating entrances of houses with rangoli and providing alms to the Gangireddu community which visits each house along with decorated bulls. Across many cultures, languages, and rituals, Makar Sankranti evokes the same love and joy. It stands testimony to our geographical diversity and rich cultural heritage. Such festivals also require platforms where they can be hosted and celebrated. In this, the role of temples, religious places, and river fronts cannot be understated. For festivals to resonate and gain traction, the government is taking proactive steps to ensure that the infrastructure and access to our spiritual heritage, rivers and religious places have adequate facilities. The creation of Buddhist, Krishna and Ramayana circuits, the inauguration of the Parshuram Kund in the easternmost tip of India and providing improved facilities at the temples in Somnath have been attempts in this direction. Further, with the inauguration of the Shri Adi Shankaracharya Samadhi at the Kedarnath Temple and the first phase of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi, the construction of a beautiful Ram Temple at Ayodhya, providing facilities at the Hazratbal mosque in Kashmir and the Hayat Bakshi Mosque in Hyderabad, the development of Guru Gobind Singh’s birthplace at Patna Sahib, the construction of an international airport at Kushinagar to facilitate Buddhist pilgrims and the development of churches in Goa and Velankanni show the government’s commitment to restore and protect the country’s rich cultural heritage. Once these places are developed, they will improve the spiritual experience of our devotees so that they can celebrate our festivals with fanfare. India’s 75th year of Independence is being celebrated under the theme of “Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav”. Prime Minister Narendra Modi sees this as not just a celebration of our past achievements but also as an opportunity to provide a template for India in its 100th year of Independence. Much like Tilak envisaged in the 1890s, the various programmes and commemorations being planned and executed until August 15, 2023, aim to instil a sense of patriotism through public participation and celebrate our unity in diversity. While Tilak was driven by the need to root out a common foe, the British, today’s need is to foster brotherhood so that we can realise the goal of an “EK Bharat, Sresht Bharat.”G Kishan Reddy is the minister of culture, tourism and development of the Northeastern Region.
