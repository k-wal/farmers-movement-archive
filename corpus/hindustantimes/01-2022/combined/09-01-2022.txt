You are not campaigning with the purpose of an electoral win but to eliminate a corrupt system from its grassroots to implement a system of honesty and integrity. The AAP government in Delhi proved that change is possible,” Kejriwal said in a video address to the party workers as AAP looks to achieve a national footprint in the upcoming elections to the legislative assemblies of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur.The AAP is the principal opposition party in Punjab, but does not have any presence in the other four states.“Delhi government is a living testimony of how honest governments cannot just survive but create examples for the future, Kejriwal said.The Delhi chief minister hit out at the opposition parties in the five states over corruption. “Various political parties have been telling us that running a government is not that easy, it requires some element of corruption and bigotry. The AAP government (in Delhi) proved that governments can be run with honesty as well. These parties told us that winning an election requires truckloads of cash and even more deceit. AAP proved that elections can be fought with honesty, and can also be won with honesty,” Kejriwal said.CM flagged that the AAP government has proved that schools cannot just be improved but revolutionized and the children of the poor can get to stand on the same pedestal as the children of the rich. “These parties could not fix government hospitals in 75 years, but AAP did it in just five years. It has given this country a huge hope that politics can be revolutionized for good. Yes, it is possible, but it is not easy. It requires dedicated effort like what was seen in the freedom struggle. Every AAP volunteer should take a pledge to not rest until they eliminate this corrupt regime plaguing the country,” CM stated.The AAP chief asked party volunteers to undertake door to door campaign in the wake of restrictions in view of the soaring Covid cases. “Door to door campaigning is allowed. All our volunteers should get on to door to door campaigning with full strength. Whenever you go to someone’s house — first ask them how they’re doing, how everyone’s health is. Before asking for votes, if they need any help, first do that. Consider this to be an opportunity to commit yourselves to service of people,” said Kejriwal, adding that later they should explain the AAP government’s achievements in schools, healthcare, electricity-water supply in Delhi to the electorate.“Tell them that AAP would do the same in your state too if it comes to power. Remember, we do not have to abuse or slander any other party or party member. We have to orchestrate a positive campaign. We have to go to every doorstep, no matter their political standings. Consider everyone to be your own, and win them over,” Kejriwal said.Kejriwal added that the volunteers should ready to take on the detractors over their allegations of ‘freebies’. “If someone asks you why the AAP offers freebies — ask them, if it is not a government’s duty to ensure the highest standards of education to each and every child of this country? The idea of being in government translates to ministers and MLAs enjoying free services while the public running from pillar to post. The AAP will change this. Now ministers and MLAs will serve the public while the people will enjoy the best of the facilities,” Kejriwal said.The Election Commission of India on Saturday announced a seven-phase poll schedule starting February 10 for five states - Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur and Punjab - slated to vote for a new legislative assembly, with the final count happening on March 10.Prof Tanvir Aeijaz, an associate professor of Political Science at Ramjas College, said campaign for elections is about political mobilisation. “Political parties, including those who have formed the government, must mobilise on issues which goes along with constitutional morality. A positive campaign therefore would mean articulating and aggregating public interest in terms of achievement or non-achievements of the incumbent government. Political campaign should not be done on conflictual lines by invoking caste, colour or religion,” said Aeijaz.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/avoid-slander-spread-aap-s-positive-work-kejriwal-to-workers-ahead-of-polls-101641752603693.html
09-01-2022||Delhi||Delhi records 17 Covid deaths, daily cases over 22,000||Seventeen people in Delhi died of Covid-19 on Saturday, according to state government data, the most single-day fatalities of the infection in over 200 days, while the daily case count jumped past 22,000, even as a majority of patients in the Capital continue to recover at home, without needing a hospital bed.The city added 22,751 cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, said the health department’s daily bulletin, the most cases in a day since May 1 last year, when Delhi logged over 25,000 fresh infections days after the peak of the fourth wave.Of the 96,678 tests conducted on Saturday, 23.53% samples returned positive results. This statistic went past the 20% mark for the first time since May 9 last year, and is now at its highest level since May 7, when this number was just short of 25%.Over 60,000 people in Delhi are currently battling Covid-19.The Covid-19 death toll on Saturday was the highest in a single day since June 16 last year, when 25 people in the city succumbed to the infection. However, hospitalisation figures continue to remain low, with the city’s health infrastructure left with plenty of headroom, even as the Covid-19 caseload returns to levels last seen over seven months ago. Nearly 88% of all hospital beds in Delhi were vacant as on Saturday, according to state government data. The city, at present, has over 14,000 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients, of which just 1,800 are occupied.This is in line with trends across the world, which show that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus causes milder infections than Delta, and leads to far fewer hospitalisations.Further, the Delhi government has previously said it can reserve 37,000 beds for Covid-19 patients, if the caseload necessitates it, a move that is part of a larger plan to augment the city’s bed capacity to 65,000. Delhi’s fourth wave of infections, between April and May 2020, continues to be its most fatal and widespread. That surge was driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which pushed hospitals and health infrastructure to the brink, and left over 13,000 dead in that two-month period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-records-17-covid-deaths-daily-cases-over-22000-101641752487557.html
09-01-2022||Mumbai||Over 900,000 eligible for booster doses today in Maharashtra||Mumbai: Over 900,000 healthcare workers, frontline workers and senior citizens including 182,000 in Mumbai will be eligible to take the Covid-19 precautionary shot starting Monday. Going by the Centre’s mandate of the 39-week gap from the second dose, the state has considered April 10, 2021, as the cut-off date for Monday’s drive. “Those who have received their second doses on or before April 10, 2021, will be eligible for the third dose on January 10,” said the state’s immunisation officer Dr Sachin Desai. “Every day more people will become eligible as they will fit into the 39-week mandate,” he said. For instance, those who have completed full vaccination on or before April 11 last year, will become eligible on Tuesday and so on. Mumbai’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said that all precautionary measures will be taken at the centres to ensure social distancing. “The vaccinators will take the history of beneficiaries and anyone who has had the infection recently will be asked to wait till they have completed three months of recovery,” she said. A large number of healthcare workers and frontline workers have tested positive for the infection over the past few days, thus making them ineligible for the booster shots immediately. “Some people say that the infection is like a booster dose, but let’s not forget it’s a disease that affected these people,” said Vellore-based virologist Dr T Jacob John, adding that India should have started booster doses way back in November before the third wave had set in. “We could have had all of December to put up a fight with the wave. But instead, we have allowed the virus a free ground and have started a booster drive in a surging pandemic, which is unacceptable,” said John. He also criticised the mandate for the 39-week gap. “All other countries in the West had a gap of six months for the booster shots, and many countries are now contemplating reducing it further to four months. It doesn’t make sense why India has instead issued a nine-month gap policy,” he said. According to John, there is a possibility of many asymptomatic people, unaware of their infections, lining up for the boosters. “When the infections are surging, there will be many people with silent infections who will land up at the vaccination centres. The question is do we know how the third shot will behave in such population with an unknown, active infection,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/over-900-000-eligible-for-booster-doses-today-in-maharashtra-101641752486294.html
09-01-2022||Delhi||Metro deliberately delaying arbitral award, Delhi HC told||The Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited (DAMEPL) has told the Delhi high court that Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is deliberately trying to delay the execution of over ₹4,600 crore arbitral award against it by not disclosing all its bank account details.In an application, DAMEPL, a subsidiary of the Reliance Infrastructure’s subsidiary (DAMEPL), has told the court said that DMRC is trying to defeat the process by making a limited disclosure of bank account details only with respect to ₹1,642.69 crore despite the court’s previous order directing it to disclose bank account details.“The delay in the payment of the Arbitral Award by DMRC is costing the taxpayer an additional interest burden of almost ₹1.75 crore per day,” the application said.The application by DAMEPL was filed in response to an affidavit filed by DMRC’s on January 5, in which it has made a partial/ limited disclosure of its bank accounts only with respect to Rs. 1642.69 crore out of the total funds of ₹5,800.93 crore that it had disclosed in the court through its last affidavit filed on December 21, 2021.On December 22, Justice Suresh Kait directed DMRC to file an affidavit furnishing the details of its bank accounts along with the balance amount.The judge observed that while the attachment of DMRC’s properties was not permitted under Section 89 of The Metro Railways (Operation and Maintenance) Act, 2002, there was no such embargo with respect to its bank accounts.Saying that DMRC is in contempt of the court’s order, DAMEPL has said that DMRC has intentionally not provided details of its remaining funds and bank accounts, which is clearly disregard and contempt of theIt said that this conduct of the DMRC clearly exhibits that it is deliberately trying to defeat and delay the execution process of the Arbitral Award, and also ensure that the next hearing scheduled on January 11 becomes ineffective.According to DAMEPL, DMRC in its last affidavit on December 21 in the high court, had informed that it had total worth ₹5800.93 crore, as of December 17, 2021. Out of this, Rs. 1642.69 crores were as DMRC funds, Rs. 2412.12 crores as other than DMRC.DAMEPL, its application, has requested the high court to direct DMRC to comply with the court’s previous order in letter and spirit by furnishing complete details of all its bank accounts the funds lying in those accounts along with the respective bank statements, or before the next date of hearing i.e. January 11The application was filed in DAMEPL’s execution plea for the arbitral award won against the corporation.The consortium of Reliance Energy Limited (renamed as Reliance Infrastructure Limited) and M/s Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles, SA terminated the Concession Agreement in October 2012 citing failure of DMRC to cure defects in the structure supporting the Airport Metro Express Line. DMRC invoked the arbitration clause of its contract with the consortium.The concession agreement between the two was signed on August 25, 2008. Under the agreement, DMRC was to carry out the civil works, excluding at the depot, and the balance, including the project system works, were to be executed by DAMEPL, a joint venture of Rinfra and a Spanish construction company -- Construcciones Y Auxiliar De Ferrocarriles -- with a shareholding of 95 and five per cent respectively.In 2017, the Arbitral Tribunal awarded damages to Reliance Infra, an award upheld by a single-judge bench of the Delhi high court in 2018. A division bench of the same court set aside the award in 2019 after which Reliance Infra approached the top court.In September this year, the apex court set aside the division bench’s judgment of January 15, 2019 order and upheld the arbitral award in favour of DMRC, saying that there was a disturbing tendency of courts setting aside arbitral awards.In November, the Supreme Court had dismissed DMRC’s plea seeking a review of its judgment which upheld the 2017 arbitration award in favour of DAMEPL, enforceable against it. The apex court on September 9 had upheld the arbitration award enforceable against DMRC.The DMRC had stated that since the corporation was facing a “financial crunch”, undertaking a “sudden liability” would impact public interest and authorities were, therefore, working out a solution. It had also claimed that the amount liable to be paid was approximately ₹5,000 crore which was lesser than DAMEPL’s claim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/metro-deliberately-delaying-arbitral-award-delhi-hc-told-101641752305791.html
09-01-2022||Lucknow||UP chief secy, DGP order revised security plan for KV Corridor||VARANASI: Chief secretary Durga Shankar Mishra and director general of police Mukul Goyal reviewed law and order as well as the Covid situation and vaccination programme here on Sunday. Both officers instructed the district administration and top police officials to prepare a revised plan for the security of Kashi Vishwanath Corridor as per need and ensure that it was followed strictly. According to a press statement, Mishra and Goyal reached Shri Kashi Vishwanath temple in the afternoon and worshipped Lord Shiva. Thereafter, Mishra inquired about what facilities were being provided to the devotees visiting KV temple from different parts of the country and abroad and what were the arrangements for ‘darshan’ and ‘pujan’. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agarwal gave detailed information about the route plan, including the gates for entry and exit of devotees. The chief secretary took stock of the situation by visiting all the routes of movement of devotees, while the DGP inquired about the security checking of the pilgrims on that route. The CS and DGP also inspected the Passenger Facilitation Centre. They also inspected the routes to Ganga Ghat via Mandir Chowk and inquired about the construction and operation of buildings. After the inspection, both the officers reached the meeting hall where they saw the PPT prepared by the temple administration and the police administration. Mishra said that earlier there were a lot of lanes to Kashi Vishwanath temple. Today, this complex had become very big. So the security arrangements should also be made in accordance with it. The police and the temple administration should work together in a systematic way and prepare the outline of security arrangement in such a way that devotees did not face any difficulty in visiting the KV temple. The DGP said that the earlier security plan needed to be changed now. So, there was need to prepare and follow a revised security plan involving all the security agencies.

09-01-2022||Pune||No vehicle entry fee at Khadki, Dehu Cantts, PCB collects ‘VET’||The Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) order of immediate stoppage of collection of vehicle entry fee (VEF) by cantonment boards across India will be implemented only in Dehu and Khadki cantonments in the city while Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) has claimed that it is collecting ‘vehicle entry tax’ (VET) and will continue to do so due to non-receipt of separate order from the central government. PCB has been earning revenues between ₹15- ₹20 crore annually from VET. The Director General of Defence Estates Office under the Defence ministry stated “That it is observed that collection of vehicle entry fee by cantonment boards by installing barricades or nakas (collection kiosks) does not conform to the government’s initiative towards smooth movement of goods and traffic and impedes the efforts towards the ease of living and ease of doing business”. The ministry said that it has been decided that collection of vehicle entry fee (VEF) by cantonment boards be stopped forthwith. The mechanism for seeking proportionate share from the state government agency cum municipality out of any such similar fees being imposed by them on entry of vehicles centrally may be considered suitably. It is requested to issue necessary instructions to cantonment boards to discontinue the collection of VEF forthwith and compliance reports be sent to the ministry on immediate basis, informed the defence department official. “VEF is the fees imposed by the cantonment board at the board level. We collect vehicle entry tax (VET) that has been imposed by the cantonment board after seeking approval from the central government. Technically speaking, VET can be abolished only after getting the letter to do so from the Centre. But for VEF, the board can take necessary action. This letter that has come is applicable to those cantonments where VEF has been imposed. Definitely as per the spirit of the letter, we might be getting a separate letter from the government and whenever it comes, we will take action. As of now, we are not stopping our collection. At some places, VET was imposed pre-2006 after taking permission from the central government and our case is that. Wherever VEF was imposed, this letter applies to those cantonments. From midnight, VEF will be stopped in Dehu and Khadki cantonment areas,” said PCB chief executive officer (CEO) Amit Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-vehicle-entry-fee-at-khadki-dehu-cantts-pcb-collects-vet-101641750863575.html

09-01-2022||Lucknow||After emissary’s visit, speculation about Yogi contesting from Ayodhya rife||Amid the recent visit of the CM’s emissary to Ayodhya, saints are upbeat about the likelihood of Yogi Adityanath contesting assembly poll from the temple town.The state BJP leadership is also seeking opinion of saints, prominent persons of temple town, party office bearers and booth level workers on the issue. Speculations on the probability of the CM contesting from Ayodhya got credence after his emissary Sanjeev Singh spent two days there last week meeting party workers. Sanjeev Singh, office on special duty (OSD) to the chief minister, was in Ayodhya to meet office bearers and party workers and seek their opinion on the CM’s candidature from Ayodhya (Sadar) assembly seat in the upcoming UP poll. He got a positive response from them. “If BJP decides to field the CM from Ayodhya, it will be a good decision not only for Ayodhya but the entire region,” said Sharad Sharma, regional spokesperson for Vishva Hindu Parishad. Saints of the temple town are also upbeat about this possibility. “All this exercise points towards the state leadership of the BJP exploring possibilities of the CM contesting from Ayodhya,” said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, successor to Mahant Nritya Gopal Das who is chairman of Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust. “If CM contests from Ayodhya, development work not only in Ayodhya about in the entire Awadh region will be expedited,” added the Mahant. By exploring the possibility of CM’s candidature from Ayodhya, the BJP leadership wants to influence around 82 assembly seats falling in Awadh region comprising 22 districts. “Chief minister’s OSD was in Ayodhya for two days. He met party officials and booth level workers to sought their opinion about the CM’s candidature from Ayodhya in assembly polls,” said a senior BJP office bearer of Ayodhya. “The CM’s emissary also handed over a bag carrying a cell phone, a stole and a booklet having details of the state government’s achievements in the last five years,” he added. The BJP leadership has also sought a list of prominent saints and people of Ayodhya ward-wise to seek their opinion on the issue. In Ayodhya, the most favoured assembly seat for the CM would be Ayodhya (Sadar) constituency. At present, BJP MLA Ved Prakash Gupta represents this assembly segment in the assembly. After becoming CM in March 2017, Yogi has been to Ayodhya more than 32 times. On all his visits, the CM visited Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanuman Garhi temple. After the Election Commission of India issued notification to set the poll process rolling on Saturday, candidates have started making an all-out effort to get ticket from their favoured assembly constituencies.

09-01-2022||Pune||Punekars flock to tourist spots before new restrictions kick in||PUNE Crowds of visitors were seen at tourist spots around Pune district over the weekend, with Mahabaleshwar, Lonavala and Bhor taluka emerging as must-visit destinations. From Monday, restrictions across the state will come into force due to the rising number of Covid cases and hence, people seemed out for the weekend to enjoy long drives and treks while they still could. There were queues of vehicles at the Khed Shivapur toll naka on the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway and also at the Urse toll naka on the Pune-Mumbai expressway on Sunday. “Our entire family had gone to Mahabaleshwar. It was a preplanned trip and before the new restrictions would start we wanted to have a family get together. We never know how many more restrictions will be imposed and all tourist spots could be closed,” said Priyanka Deshpande, a Pune resident out for the weekend. Rajesh Navale, a hotel owner in Lonavala said, “Suddenly we saw a heavy rush of people coming in from Pune and Mumbai since yesterday. People are crowding the tourists spots all around Lonavala.” As per the new restrictions imposed by the state government, starting from January 10, only four persons are allowed to travel in a car. Both Covid vaccine doses and a Covid negative report is necessary to travel. Speaking anonymously, a tourist manager from Pune said, “We have sent all our five cars on duty, as there was high demand from public to visit to Sinhagad fort, Lonavala and also to pilgrimage places across the state, like Pandharpur. People took this advantage of the last day before restrictions.” Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “While going out for a picnic or to any tourist place, it is necessary for people to strictly follow Covid norms like wearing a face mask and maintaining social distance for their own safety. Now as per the new state guidelines for travelling full vaccination or Covid negative report is necessary. We need to stop the spread of virus and also prevent infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punekars-flock-to-tourist-spots-before-new-restrictions-kick-in-101641749724683.html
09-01-2022||Pune||50% of Covid cases in Pune city still not Omicron: experts||PUNE Although the number of Covid-19 cases are rising in the city, experts have estimated that while the number of Omicron cases are rising at least 50% of samples that have tested positive for Covid-19, are not of the Omicron variant. Most hospitals have reported staff a positive despite vaccinations. Experts at both National Chemical Laboratories (NCL) and BJ Medical have said that the strain reported in the city and state are the same as those in Africa and the UK. Doctors have also said that Omicron is not affecting deep lung tissues and so symptoms are reported to be mild.As more data emerges from hospitals, more breakthrough infections, that is infections among the vaccinated, are being reported. As per NCL data, 50% of the cases are Omicron, but the other 50% are still of the Delta variant, or its sub-lineages based on samples sequenced since mid-December up until the first week of January. However, given the rise in the number of cases, in the coming days the total number of cases due to Omicron could be around 75% of the total infections and in the next two-three weeks Omicron will replace Delta and its sub-lineages as the dominant variant.Dr Ashish Lele, director of CSIR – National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), said, “We are still reporting close to 50% of swab samples to be of Omicron, while the rest are Delta and sub-lineages of Delta. Up until December, we were reporting fluctuating samples of Omicron, about once in three days in the sewage samples of the city, which has now gone up drastically since January. Now however, it is still not dominant. In the coming days Omicron is sure to become the dominant strain. Based on the published work from Europe and Africa, where the strains were first reported there is no significant change in the strain reported in these countries and the one circulating in Pune or in the state as well.” Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, head of the department of Microbiology, BJ Medical College said, “It would be too early to say for sure now, but it appears that the number of hospitalisations as not affected by vaccinations, however, we are yet to see Omicron reach its peak and the unvaccinated population will surely be at more risk than the vaccinated population. Based on the current observations one can say that Omicron does not affect the lung tissues and only impacts the upper respiratory tract. There is no loss of smell or taste in the case of Omicron. We will soon study the deaths reported in the hospitals since January and see if Omicron has led to any deaths.” City hospitals are also seeing their own staff testing positive for Covid-19. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, during an online meeting arranged by the Pune Platform for Covid-19 Response, suggested that the Isolation centres like the ones at Garware College and at Hingane Stree Shikshan Sanstha need to be reopened in the near future. He stated that 32 of the staff members of Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital have tested positive over the last few days and also that vaccinations are not protecting against Omicron as per data from patients admitted to the hospital. Of 78 admissions, 67 patients were fully vaccinated.As per the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) data, between January 1 and January 9, 355 admissions were reported in seven hospitals out of which 288 have been discharged and there were no deaths reported for this period. Of these, 99 were positive after the first dose, 259 after both doses, 72 were unvaccinated and there were two cases of re-infection. Also, 261 did not report any comorbidity and 102 were comorbid. Dr Purvez Grant of Ruby Hall Clinic suggested that Novovax, the latest vaccine approved in India, be given to all those who have received two doses of Covishield. He stated that the cases of patients admitted are so mild that no one requires ventilators in Ruby Hall hospitals in Hinjewadi and Pune. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar mentioned that in the present wave there is very little hospitalisation as only 2% of patients are in ICU or on oxygen. He stated that five Isolation centres will come up in Pune city (one in each zone) in the near future and also seven hotels will start Isolation facilities. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO) at Pune Zilla Parishad stated that 350 hospitals in rural areas are fully prepared to deal with the emerging situation. Currently the bed occupancy is less than 3%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/50-of-covid-cases-in-pune-city-still-not-omicron-experts-101641749603934.html

09-01-2022||Lucknow||UP: Ban on school fee hike a big relief for parents||The Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to ban any increase in school fees across all the boards for the upcoming academic session (2022-23) because of the prevailing pandemic situation has come as a big relief for parents. More so because many parents are facing late payments and also salary cuts. “My son studies in class 12. The fee is already high and quite difficult for me to arrange. The government’s decision has come as big relief for me in these tough times,” said one Aarti Rastogi.As per the government’s directives issued on Sunday, the schools will continue to charge fees as per the 2019-20 session. However, many parents have also urged the government to ensure that schools don’t flout the orders by charging extra money in the name of additional charges for online examinations, computer and maintenance fees.Deepak Agarwal, whose daughter studies in a girls’ institution, said, “I am into the business of making hoardings. My business took a hit soon after Diwali as there are no new orders.” “It is a good initiative. However, there should also be other concessions as many parents are facing unemployment, pay cuts and slump in business,” said Faraz Ahmad whose son studies at Kendriya Vidyalaya, RDSO.“I’ve three daughters attending school. Even a little increase in their fees would have caused a huge extra burden. I am relieved to hear that there’ll be no hike in fees this year,” said Ahrarul Haque whose children study in ICSE Board schools. “I am elated.

They knew about missed payments on the LIC policy of the family. They offered to invest the money and give monthly returns on it if the family breaks their LIC policies and invests that money with them. So, the family members broke four policies and invested the money with the two women,” said police sub-inspector SB Nikalje of Dattawadi police station who is investigating the case.The family members have been receiving ₹2,000-3,000 per month from the company the two women claimed to be employees of. However, they do not get in touch through any other mode and refuse to return the principal amount.The transactions happened between February 2021 and July 2021, according to the complainant.

09-01-2022||Lucknow||Mayawati urges ECI to ensure free, fair polls||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati has said the Election Commission of India (ECI) should ensure strict implementation of the model code of conduct after the announcement of poll schedule for five states, including Uttar Pradesh, on Saturday.Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, Mayawati said the ECI should ensure that voters belonging to the Dalit community and weaker sections residing in sensitive areas are not deprived from exercising their franchise. “To ensure that police and administrative officers on poll duties act according to law without any discrimination, the poll panel should generate its fear in the government machinery as then only fair election will be possible,” she said. “In last few elections despite surge in Covid, the model code of conduct has been violated openly through rallies and roadshows by various political parties. It has left the people bewildered. In the last few years, the election is being given religious colour. Narrow and selfish politics is being promoted and all types of irregularities have been committed,” she alleged. “The ECI should take measures to create a belief among the people that poll panel will hold free, impartial and peaceful polling,” she said.“BSP is a disciplined party. Directions have been issued to party leaders, office bearers and workers to follow poll code during the election campaign. In our country, election is considered a festival of democracy. The people have right to exercise their franchise to elect a government and one cannot be prevented from casting vote,” she added. Mayawati further said, “I wish to appeal to the people of UP if they want good law and order, all-round development of the state, welfare of the masses, Dalits, backwards, minorities, youths, women traders, farmers, labourers as well as the weaker among the ‘sarva samaj’, they should not be carried away by the poll promises made by rival political parties in their election manifestos that they will release before poll to allure voters. They should not be driven by sentiments but they should support the BSP that has worked for the welfare of the people and there is no difference in the words and deeds of the BSP.”“The BSP is the only political party that works for the welfare of the people without any discrimination. To maintain law and order as well as to check crime, the BSP government had taken action against the wrongdoers even if they were associated with the party. The BSP government had established the rule of law in the state whereas the governments of other parties protect the criminals associated with them,” she claimed.“There is a jungle raj in UP and the people are a harassed lot. A section of the upper caste that had supported the BJP in previous election is miserable. The BJP government will be voted out of power in upcoming polls in case if they do not misuse the government machinery and do not create snag in voting machines. The ECI should take strict measures to check the irregularities,” she said. Hitting out at the Samajwadi Party (SP), the BSP chief said, “There is a political party in UP that has welcomed the expelled leaders of other parties to its fold and sewed up alliances with several small parties. Its leader has claimed to win 400 out of the total 403 seats. His dreams will be shattered on March 10. BJP and other parties will face the same fate. The BSP is the only party that can give a popular government on the ‘sarvajan hitay- sarvajna sukhay mantra’ in UP.” “The people have made up their mind to bring BSP to power despite the report of the survey agencies showing BSP out of the race. In 2007, they had predicted BSP’s defeat. Again, the BSP will prove all surveys wrong to form a government with majority. The BSP will perform well in Uttarakhand, it will form government in Punjab in alliance with Shiromani Akali Dal. The BSP will fulfil of the dreams of Dr BR Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram,” she claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mayawati-urges-eci-to-ensure-free-fair-polls-101641748703277.html
09-01-2022||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh assembly polls: Stakes high in Braj region with focus on Mathura||The Braj region with 40 assembly seats has emerged as one of the focal points of the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls this time as it is home to Mathura’s Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi.There is speculation that Mathura is in the race to become a VVIP assembly seat as a party MLC has demanded that chief minister Yogi Adityanath be fielded as the BJP candidate there.The region has produced a mixed bag of results in the past parliamentary and assembly elections. The Braj region comprises Agra and Aligarh divisions, each having four districts.Agra, Mathura, Firozabad and Mainpuri are the four districts in Agra division with a total of 23 assembly seats. The districts of Aligarh, Etah, Kasganj and Hathras comprise Aligarh division having 17 assembly seats. DOMINANCE OF BJPIn the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won the Agra, Fatehpur Sikri (Agra Rural), Firozabad and Mathura seats. The party showed its dominance in Aligarh division, too, and won and all three parliamentary seats there —Aligarh, Etah and Hathras. While the BJP bagged all the seven other seats in the Braj region, the Mainpuri parliamentary seat remained loyal to Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav.This time, the BJP is under pressure to repeat the performance of the 2017 assembly elections when it made a clean sweep, winning all nine seats in Agra district, all four seats in Etah district, all seven seats in Aligarh district and all three seats in Kasganj district. The BJP also won four seats each in Firozabad and Mathura districts and two seats in Hathras district but lost one seat each in Mathura and Hathras to the BSP. The SP won the Firozabad seat. In Mainpuri, the SP won three seats and the BJP one.The BJP won 34 of the 40 seats in the Braj region in the 2017 assembly polls. The Samajwadi Party bagged four assembly seats and the BSP two. The Congress and the RLD drew a blank.In the 2012 assembly elections, the SP was the clear winner in the region with 19 assembly seats, the BSP bagged 11 seats and the BJP three seats. The RLD won six seats, including three each in Mathura and Aligarh as Jats remained loyal to the party. The Congress won one seat in Mathura. STALWARTS OF BRAJ REGIONFormer Prime Minister the late Chaudhary Charan Singh had been a student of Agra College and his legacy continued to have its say in the Jat dominated constituencies in Mathura and Aligarh. His grandson Jayant Chaudhary won the Mathura Lok Sabha seat in 2009 and the Mant (Mathura) assembly seat in 2012. Chaudhary Charan Singh’s wife Gayatri Devi and daughter Dr Gyanwati had contested from Mathura and Aligarh with mixed results in parliamentary and assembly polls. Bateshwar, also known as “mini Kashi” in Agra district, is the ancestral village of former Prime Minister the late Atal Bihari Vajpayee.Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav taught at a school in Mainpuri before entering active politics.Former chief minister Kalyan Singh, a key figure in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, is fondly remembered as Babuji in Aligarh, Etah and Kasganj, the three districts where the BJP won all 14 assembly seats in 2017.Actor-turned-politician Hema Malini won the Mathura Lok Sabha seat in 2014 and 2019, riding on the Modi wave. She had defeated RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary in 2014. ISSUES AND SCENARIOMathura, along with Ayodhya and Kashi, is among the three most prominent religious cities in UP. But it is for first time that Mathura has emerged as an election issue due to it being the location of the Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi. Mathura enjoys the reputation of being the most visited city, probably second only to Gorakhpur, by chief minister Yogi Adityanath. He has been in Mathura nearly 30 times in his five-year term. The impact of this was seen with Mathura being given the status of “teerth” (pilgrimage). “For the BJP, Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura is not an election issue, but an issue of respecting our cultural heritage which any nation should be proud of. It was SP president Akhilesh Yadav who equated Sardar Patel and Muhammad Ali Jinnah and made it an issue. The BJP does not resort to such gimmicks and is all set to repeat the performance of the 2017 state assembly elections on the issues of development, law and order situation, pro farmer and pro poor initiatives,” said Surendra Gupta, the BJP’s Braj kshetra (region) vice-president.On the other hand, Dr Rahat Abrar, the former director of Urdu Academy at Aligarh Muslim University in Aligarh, says, “However hard one tries to make Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi or Jinnah an election issue, the voters seem to be prudent enough and have attained “political maturity” to think about the real issues. The BJP does face resentment amongst youth, farmers and poor for inflation, unemployment and the alleged anti-farmer policies. The SP-RLD combine seems to be in a position to reap the harvest of anti-incumbency in this belt of the Braj region supported by strong inclination amongst Jats and Muslims towards the alliance.”The farmers’ agitation, which was much stronger in other areas of western Uttar Pradesh, did not find as vocal a resonance in the Braj region but RLD state spokesperson Kaptan Singh Chahar is confident about revival of the party under Jayant Chaudhary’s leadership in alliance with the SP. Having switched recently from the RLD to the Congress, Anil Chaudhary, chairman of the Kisan Congress in Western UP, argues that the Congress is not a spent force in the Braj region.“The Congress had an MLA from Mathura till the 2012 assembly polls. It won the Mathura and Aligarh Lok Sabha seats in 2004. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is working day and night for the revival of the Congress in the Braj region,” said Anil Chaudhary, a prominent Jat leader. “It was the Congress which brought the new land acquisition bill paving the way for better prices to farmer for their land acquired. It was in 2013 when the Congress brought a proposal for reservation to Jats in the central government jobs as backward (although the move got struck in court),” Anil Chaudhary claimed.

09-01-2022||Mumbai||For third day in a row, state reports more than 40k cases||Mumbai After the sharp reaction from gymnasium operators in the state, the state government revised its notification issued on Saturday to allow the gymnasiums and beauty salons to operate at 50% of their capacity.However, the state government warned with additional curbs if the crowding at the liquor shops and places of worship continued. The state reported 44,388 new infections, of which 19,474 were from Mumbai. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region, comprising nine big cities including Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan-Dombivali, Navi Mumbai accounted for 33,299 of the daily caseload. Pune district clogged 6,483 new cases, including 886 in Pune and 4,065 in Pimpri-Chinchwad, followed by 926 in Nashik district. Maharashtra also reported 207 Omicron infections on Sunday, taking the tally to 1216. Of the new cases, 40 were from Mumbai, 57 from Sangli, 22 from Pune city, 15 from Pimpri-Chinchwad, 21 from Nagpur district, 21 from Thane city. 454 Omicron infected patients have been discharged. In a revised order, the state government clarified that beauty salons and gymnasiums should ensure that all staff members are vaccinated and people visiting them are also fully vaccinated. The use of masks at the gymnasium has also been made compulsory. The activities which need the removal of the masks at the beauty salons have been prohibited. On Saturday, in the wake of the daily caseload hovering around 40,000 for the last few days, the state had imposed certain curbs by issuing a notification. Stepping out between 11 pm and 5 pm has been prohibited, while crowding at public places between 5 am and 11 pm has also been banned. State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the government will gradually bring curbs on places of worship and liquor shops to avoid crowding. “There will be curbs imposed at liquor shops or the places of worship if the crowding at these places increases. We have not imposed any curbs on temples and other religious places, but we expect the crowding to be restricted to 40 to 50 people. If these norms are not adhered to, there could be more curbs,” he said. Tope said that though Covid cases are on the rise, the rate of hospitalisation is low and the consumption of oxygen was also under control. “Curbing crowding at public places is the key to containing the spread of the virus. The curbs imposed on Saturday are with the intention to arrest the rise in the number of cases,” he said. The state tally now stands at 69,20,044, while the death toll has touched 1,41,639 after the addition of 12 fresh deaths on Sunday. Dr Avinash Supe, head of the state-appointed death audit committee and former dean of KEM Hospital said that in the later stage, the smaller cities and rural parts of the state may witness a surge. “Currently, Mumbai and other big cities are contributing to most of the daily caseload on the similar trend witnessed during the first and second wave. By January 26, the Mumbai cases will see a downward trend and by February 15, there will be a significant reduction. Other parts of the state including smaller cities and rural parts will see a rise in the next two to four weeks. As such, the peak and the downward trend in Maharashtra will take little longer to come,” he said. Dr Supe further said that though the death rate is low, it may rise in the next two weeks. “It would not be as high as reported during the second wave, but the numbers will double in next few days. Most of the deaths are among the non-vaccinated, comorbid and elderly patients,” he said. 
09-01-2022||Lucknow||Assembly polls: 70 seats up for grabs in western Uttar Pradesh||Twenty districts of western Uttar Pradesh will vote in the first and second phases of the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls on February 10 and 14 in this agrarian belt where the year-long farmers’ movement and other issues, including the demand for legal guarantee on MSP (minimum support price) of crops, price rise and law and order, are likely to have an impact.Even as political parties and their leaders have prepared their strategies to woo voters, the Election Commission’s ban on road shows, rallies and other processions till January 15 due to rising Covid-19 cases means the parties will have to largely bank on social media and other alternative ways to campaign.Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) media incharge and farmer leader Dharmendra Malik says the entire election will be between “pro-BJP and anti BJP” people. It won’t be easy for the BJP to repeat its resounding victory of the 2014, 2017 and 2019 elections this time, he argues.“Many pro-BJP voters seem to have turned against it in the region especially in the rural areas. The year-long farmers’ movement had played a significant role to bring about this shift of opinion,” claims Malik.At the same time, he says one shouldn’t take the BJP lightly because of its resources and well-established force of trained workers and leaders.Political analyst Jamshed Zaidi, too, believes the situation is not as conductive for the ruling BJP as it was in the 2017 elections when the party won 51 out of 70 assembly seats in the region ( Meerut, Saharanpur and Moradabad divisions).Zaidi says the farmers’ movement, price rise, unemployment and multiple problems of the common man may have a bearing on the prospects of the ruling party.The farmers’ movement has given a new lease of life to the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) in its political home turf of western UP and its alliance with the Samajwadi Party (SP) would pose a tough challenge to the BJP. The death of Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Ajit Singh due to Covid-19 related complications in May will also bring sympathy votes for his son Jayant Chaudhary who now heads the party.Veteran farmer leader Harpal Singh Bilari says the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013 were a turning point in the politics of western UP and the BJP won all 14 seats in the region in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The party also came to power in the state in 2017 elections by winning 51 out of the region’s 70 seats. Bilari claims the farmers’ movement will prove to be another turning point for the BJP and angry farmers will vote it out of power.Bilari identifies sugarcane dues, inflation, cases against farmers, the demand for legal guarantee on MSP (minimum support price) of crops, problem of stray cattle as some of the major issues in the region. These issues could take voters away from the BJP in the election, he says.Bilari also claims the people no longer believe the BJP’s assurances and claims.In the 2012 assembly elections, the BJP won only 11 of the 70 seats in the region. The Samajwadi Party (SP) bagged 25 seats, the Bahujan Samaj Party 23, the Congress, the RLD three and others one that year.In 2017, the BJP won 51 of the region’s 70 assembly seats. The SP won 15, the Congress two, the BSP and the RLD one each.The political analyst says the BJP played its Hindutva card well in the 2014 (Lok Sabha), 2017 (assembly) and 2019 ( Lok Sabha) elections. It made a gain of 40 assembly seats in 2017 in comparison to the 2012 polls. The BSP suffered a loss of 22 seats and the SP of 10 seats.Another farmer leader Surendra Singh says the farmers and their family members voted in favour of the BJP in 2017 elections, believing the party will bring “achche din” (better days) but all this proved a “jumla” (rhetoric).Addressing a mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar a day after Rakesh Tikait burst into tears at the Ghazipur border in January 2021, his brother BKU chief Naresh Tikait regretted supporting the BJP in elections and declared that the mistake would be rectified.“BJP ko support karna hamaari bhool thi (It was our mistake to support the BJP),” Naresh Tikait had said.At the next Mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar on September 5, 2021, his brother and BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait appeared to attack the BJP’s Hindutva card by raising slogans of Har Har Mahadev and Allah Hu Akbar from the stage.His father the late Mahendra Singh Tikait, one of the most prominent farmer leaders of the region, used to raise slogans at his rallies and meetings to strengthen communal harmony in the region.Zaidi says the farmers’ movement revived the broken communal harmony by reducing differences between the dominat Jats and Muslims in the region and this will be winning equation for the RLD.He explains that Jats and Muslims could influence the outcome in more than 25 to 30 seats in the region, where they constitute 30 to 50% of the voters. The outcome will also depend on the mood of other castes, including OBCs, Dalits, Brahmins, Thakurs and Sainis, he says. Dharmendra Malik says the Dalits also hold the key in the region but they seem confused in this election because of the “indifferent attitude of BSP chief Mayawati”.Malik claims the BJP is working hard to win over the Dalits to offset the loss of Jats and other annoyed voters in the region.“It would be interesting to see whether people will still support Hindutva or give priorities to employment, inflation, law and other issues which have been adversely affecting their daily lives,” says Malik.On the other hand, former UP BJP chief Laxmikant Bajpai believes the farmers’ movement is an issue of the past and it has no impact now.“People of the region will support us as they did in previous elections,” says Bajpai.The BJP’s Meerut MP Rajendra Agarwal says the party will contest election on the basis of the work it has done for the people.“Look around Meerut, (you will see) the network of roads developed by the double engine government,” he says.Agarwal also mentions inauguration of the IT park, the state’s first sports university, Meerut-Delhi Expressway, the Ganga Expressway connecting Meerut to Prayagraj and many other highways being built through the region to connect Delhi, Dehradun and other destinations.He also mentions the under-construction rapid rail project between Delhi and Meerut.During their visits to the region, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other leaders also raised the issues of “palayan” (exodus) and restart of Kanwar Yatra to blend the issue of Hindutva with development. They also claimed that daughters and sisters are safe under the BJP rule because government has put the mafias and criminals behind bars. The party opponents, however, question the BJP’s claim about women safety and mention the Hathras and Unnao cases. They further allege that the BJP will misuse government machinery and money power to influence voters in the election, adding that the election commission needs to put an effective check on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/assembly-polls-70-seats-up-for-grabs-in-western-uttar-pradesh-101641746608903.html

Addressing a news conference at his residence here, Jaiswal, a three-time MP from West Champaran, said the BJP legislator’s move was guided by emotions after some of her relatives made uncharitable remarks against her. “She is locked in a property dispute with some relatives. After receiving some uncharitable comments from them, she offered to resign. She is returning to her constituency and now has no intention to give up the membership of the state assembly,” Jaiswal said, describing the move as non-political. Earlier in the day, Rashmi Verma created ripples in political circles after her photograph showing her with a resignation letter started doing the rounds in the social media. “I am putting in my papers from the membership of the state assembly on my own accord owing to some personal reasons,” reads the letter addressed to the speaker of the state assembly. The BJP state president said she had not sent the letter to the speaker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/narkatiaganj-mla-will-not-resign-says-sanjay-jaiswal-101641746605900.html
09-01-2022||Patna||27 new cases of Omicron detected in Bihar||PATNA: Twenty seven new cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 were detected in Bihar after the first genomic sequencing was conducted at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in Patna, its director Dr NR Biswas said. With this, the total tally of Omicron cases in the state has jumped to 28 on the Covid-19 portal of the ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW).“Omicron variant has been detected in 85% of the 32 samples we tested in the first lot of genomic sequencing test at our institute. Four samples (12%) are of the Delta variant, and one is of an insignificant variant, which is unknown,” said Dr Biswas.As many as 21 of the 27 Omicron positive samples are from Patna, two from Madhubani, and one each from Purnia, Vaishali, Gaya, and East Champaran districts, said Dr Biswas.All the samples were either from the IGIMS or those who came to the institute for treatment, he added.The IGIMS had initiated the process to test the 32 samples on genomic sequencer on January 1 and the results were declared on Sunday.“We began by organising the samples and arranging them for genomic sequencing test on January 1. A result above 89% is considered excellent. Most of the samples have given excellent results, which is indicative of good reading and analysis. Only two samples have shown less than 85% result, while one is inconclusive,” said Dr Namrata Kumari, professor and head of microbiology, IGIMS.The state on Saturday had declared its first Omicron positive result after genomic sequencing when a resident of Gujrati Gali in Chapra tested positive for Covid-19. The person, who has since recovered, had an international travel history, having returned from London on December 15, last year. He tested positive at Delhi airport and spent 14 days under institutional quarantine in New Delhi. He was discharged after testing negative on December 29.Prior to that, a 26-year-old resident of Patna’s Kidwaipuri locality was found Omicron positive after an indicative test was done at a private laboratory. The result, however, did not reflect on the health ministry’s portal on Covid-19, as the same was done through ‘S’ gene target failure (SGTF) kit, which is an indicative test of Omicron.Patna accounted for 2,050 new Covid-19 cases, which was around 41% of the total 5,022 cases reported on Sunday, taking the number of active cases to 16,897 in the state. The state also reported one Covid-19 death, taking the overall toll to 12,101 on Sunday. Patna’s test positivity rate had jumped from 12.26% on January 5 to over 21.94% on Saturday, Sanjay Kumar Singh, executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, had said .Meanwhile, 14 of the 17 scientists out of a total 25 staff and family members at the ICMR’s Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences in Patna’s Agamkuan locality, had tested Covid-19 positive over the last few days. The state will also begin administering precautionary dose of the vaccine against Covid to all health care and frontline workers and those 60-years and above with comorbidity from Monday. Those who have completed nine months from their second dose will be eligible for the precautionary shot of the same vaccine they had taken earlier, said state health officials.
09-01-2022||Patna||JD(U) to contest UP with BJP, but seats yet to be decided: Kushwaha||PATNA: JD(U) Parliamentary Board chairman Upendra Kushwaha said his party would fight elections in UP with the BJP, ending speculations about realignment in Bihar politics following RJD state chief Jagtanand Singh’s offer of support to chief minister Nitish Kumar on the special state status and caste census issues should the BJP decide not to come on board. “We will fight (UP polls) as part of the NDA. It was decided during an earlier meeting,” Kushwaha said on Sunday, adding that the number seats the JD(U) would contest has not been decided yet. The JD-U wants to contest enough seats to keep its hopes of achieving the national party status alive. Kushwaha said union minister RCP Singh had been authorised to coordinate with the BJP on seat sharing. “With not much time left, this may be decided soon. Our strategy in UP is to contest enough seats so that we could have a chance of achieving national party status. But how many seats we will get is something that will be decided after talks and that must be on. But the fact is that we will contest with BJP,” he said. Analyst Prof Nawal Kishore Choudhary said Nitish Kumar is a pragmatic politician aware of his strengths and weaknesses as well as that of his allies to play his cards deftly. “He knows a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. He will never go for an offer (RJD’s) that remains in the domain of uncertainty. Choudhary Charan Singh is an example who was made the PM, but could not even seek trust vote due to withdrawal of support before that. He (Nitish) is not the one who would be happy being a titular head, but at the same time wants to keep sending messages to the BJP that it has more options. That may help his party get some seats in UP as well,” Choudhary said. “BJP has been accommodating to Nitish, as it does not want to lose another ally. If JD(U) gets even some seats in UP, where the BJP fully dominates, to keep its flock together, that will be a step forward for the party.” Former director of AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies DM Diwakar said the ongoing political ‘noora-kushti’ (fixed fight) was apparently a balancing game due to future stakes, which would become important with some key decisions to be made, namely, JD(U)’s stake in UP elections, Bihar legislative council elections, Rajya Sabha elections and appointment on posts that have remained vacant for a long time. “Accommodation at one place means room at another. That is how politics runs. Everyone knows JD-U does not have big presence in UP, but as an ally it will like to have commitment for Bihar, where it has higher stakes. BJP-JD-U alliance suits both in equal measure due to an unavoidable House arithmetic and hardly leaves room for manoeuvres,” Diwakar said.

09-01-2022||Mumbai||HC quashes rape complaint against man after he marries complainant||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court (HC) recently quashed an FIR alleging rape filed by a woman, 25, after the accused married the complainant. The court held that no purpose would be served by keeping the husband behind bars when the wife’s grievance had been addressed.A division bench of justice Prasanna Varale and justice Anil Kilor, while hearing the criminal application of Swapnil Patil, was informed by advocates Ganesh Gupta and Pratik Patil that their client had been booked under sections 376 (sexual assault) and 354 (assault or use of criminal force) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on January 1, 2020 and was currently out on bail. The advocates informed the bench that the complainant and the accused had got married thereafter on March 11, 2020 in Raigad district. Based on the fact that the couple was now married and the complainant had voluntarily sought withdrawal of her complaint against her now husband, the HC should quash the FIR against their client. According to the FIR registered with the Wadala T T police station, Patil had forced sex with the complainant in June 2019 and between June 2019 and January 2020, they indulged in sex on several occasions upon his assurance of marriage. The complainant said she was unwilling to give any oral or documentary evidence to substantiate her complaint. However, the court noted that an offence under section 376 of the IPC is of serious nature and is an offence against society and consequently, cannot be quashed by consent. Referring to a Supreme Court order however, the bench said, “The court has to endeavour to find out whether the FIR indeed discloses ingredients of such offence and that the court can accept the settlement and quash the FIR.”Coupled with the fact that the complainant was unwilling to cooperate and lead any evidence and that both were already married, the bench observed, “No fruitful purpose will be served by continuing with the prosecution. Apart from this, now the respondent number 2 (woman) and applicant (Patil) have got married and are residing together as husband and wife.” The court then quashed the FIR and disposed of the application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-quashes-rape-complaint-against-man-after-he-marries-complainant-101641744983463.html

Significantly, ensuring justice in these politically sensitive issues was one of the major planks that the Congress had based its winning poll campaign on, in 2017. Till recently, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu have been raising the issue of justice in sacrilege and related cases in their poll rallies. Setbacks on the legal front, however, have left the three special investigation teams (SITs) with no option than to wait and watch. The SIT probing 2015 sacrilege cases wanted to conduct custodial interrogation of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Ram Rahim by bring him to Punjab in connection with theft a bir of Guru Granth Sahib from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village. The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC), however, citing law and order problems, asked the SIT to question him at Sunaria jail in Rohtak and adjourned the matter to April 21. SIT head IG Surinder Pal Singh Parmar said, “Ram Rahim’s custodial interrogation is important, as he is a key link to the conspiracy. The HC order to question him inside the jail will delay probe. We are taking legal opinion.” 8 months on, new SIT fails to file charge-sheet in Kotkapura firing case The newly constituted SIT probing the Kotkapura police firing incident has missed its six-month deadline to file a fresh charge-sheet. The SIT is in a fix in light of the HC staying investigations in cases pending against former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini till February 2022. While quashing the charge-sheets filed by SIT led by former IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, the HC directed that a new SIT be formed, with investigation to be concluded, preferably, within six months from the date of constitution. Amid these legal tangles, the SIT is waiting for a date from the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), Gandhinagar, in Gujarat, to conduct a lie-detector test. Over six months ago, it had got suspended IG Paramraj Singh Umranangal’s consent to undergo a lie-detector test in connection with 2015 Kotkapura firing case. Saini and former Moga SSP Charanjit Singh Sharma had refused to undergo the test. Charges yet to be framed in Behbal Kalan case A trial court in Faridkot is yet to start hearing arguments for the framing of charges in the Behbal Kalan firing case. The court has exempted Saini from personal appearance following the HC order. Using this as a shield, other accused filed a number of applications for adjournment, delaying the process by over two months to date. The Kunwar Vijay Pratap-led SIT had filed charge-sheets against seven accused, including five cops, in the Behbal Kalan firing case. The SIT had claimed that the cops opened fire at peaceful protesters on directions from Umranangal, who got instructions from Saini; later, both conspired to fabricate evidence, the SIT had claimed. After Kunwar took voluntary retirement, the government formed a three-member SIT headed by IG Naunihal Singh to probe the Behbal Kalan firing case in May. To date, this SIT has not conducted any fresh investigation.

In the 2017 polls, 500 companies had been deployed, against a requisition for 727. By an estimate, between 1 lakh and 1.4 lakh security personnel, including the central forces and the state police, would be deployed during the elections. Fifty companies of CAPF are expected to arrive on Monday. Each company has 92 personnel and officers, with support staff and reserve personnel also included. Practically, there are 64 personnel available for active ground duty in each company. Other than the central forces, 60-70% of state police’s 80,000-odd personnel will also be on poll duty. “There are at least 3,000 polling booths, classified as sensitive and super-sensitive in the state, of 24,689 booths that will be set up,” the CEO said, adding, “Farmers’ protest, drone attacks along border areas, the recent incident of bomb blast in Ludhiana and the alleged entry of unscrupulous persons in religious places are the reasons for seeking additional deployment.”The CAPF may comprise the Border Security Force (BSF); the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF); the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Indo-Tibetan Border Force (ITBP), over and above the state police. The number of sensitive and super-sensitive polling booths could also go up. as it would depend on the candidates that parties field, added Raju.Fourteen assembly constituencies on the international border along Pakistan have been classified as sensitive.

09-01-2022||Mumbai||HT Exclusive: Proposal to fell 12k trees in Thane creek for petroleum pipeline||Mumbai: The Union environment ministry’s Regional Empowered Committee (REC) in Nagpur is considering a proposal from the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) that seeks to axe down 11,904 trees (including at least 2,500 mangroves) in and around the eco-sensitive zone of Thane creek to make way for a petroleum pipeline. The proposal awaits forest, environment and Coastal Zone Regulation (CRZ) clearances from the Centre.The BPCL is hoping to connect its refinery in Mahul in Mumbai to an upcoming petrochemical complex in Rasayani in Raigad district, about 53 km away by road. According to the minutes of an REC meeting held on December 23 in Nagpur, the proposal sought to clear 56.7 acres of forest land and divert it to building a pipeline that will be 39.58km long.Part of the mostly-underground pipeline is proposed to pass through deemed eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) area of Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary. “Approximately 4.171km pipeline section shall pass through mangrove and mudflat area located on both ends,” while about 17km of the pipeline is proposed to pass through areas of Thane Creek protected by coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) rules, a copy of BPCL’s ‘Mangrove Management & Conservation Plan’, prepared as part of the forest clearance process, stated.The state government received BPCL’s proposal for forest clearance in December 2020, and sent it for further consideration to the Centre’s integrated regional office in Nagpur in March 2021.Prior to that, in November 2019, the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) was informed that 2,520 mangrove trees will be impacted by the project, in addition to other reserved forest areas. The MCZMA recommended the project for CRZ clearance from the Centre, which is yet to come. The project is also awaiting forest and environmental clearances.In its December 23 meeting, the REC noted the presence of “11,904 project affected trees, comprised of 499 trees of above 60 cm girth and 11,178 trees below 60 cm girth”, and remarked that the state government needs to “revisit the number of trees proposed for felling.” The REC remarked that “alternative alignments have not been examined properly” and requested the state government to “explore the possibility of shifting proposed alignment” in order to avoid “breaking of fresh forest land and also to save considerable forest land.”The REC has now instructed the state government to submit two detailed reports — one on the number of trees proposed for felling, and another on the pipeline’s alignment — before the proposal is considered further. A member of the REC, seeking anonymity, said, “The project proponent has to provide evidence that it is doing the minimum possible damage to environment. At the moment, it seems there are other viable options that will cause lesser impact, hence the proposal has not yet been cleared.” Hindustan Times was unable to reach Krishna Kumar Damde, project lead at BPCL, despite several attempts.BPCL’s proposed unit will process 45,000 tonnes per annum polypropylene (PP), a thermoplastic polymer used in large quantities by the plastic processing industry, and will act as a storage and processing unit for PP. The pipeline will carry propylene from BPCL’s Mumbai refinery, through Mahul and Thane creek, bypassing the Navi Mumbai International Airport area, UIwe River, Kirki River and further along a national highway up to Rayasani.“The actual influence of the project will be much wider than 56 acres of forest or 11,900 trees. The project proponent will need to build approach roads in CRZ and forest areas in order to build and maintain the pipelines. Oil pipelines have been previously built over mangroves by ONGC in Uran, and the mangroves are now susceptible to violations like dumping of garbage because they are now accessible. It is a good step that the REC has asked for less trees to be cut and for an alternative alignment. The project should be taken back to the drawing board in order to minimise damage to the Creek’s ecology,” Stalin D, member of the High Court-appointed mangrove committee, said.Anand Pendharkar, a city-based ecologist and nature educator, said that the continued loss of mangroves and forest cover due to development projects is worrying. “Mangroves are essential against protecting our buildings, roads and other existing infrastructure from floods, sea level rise, cyclones and storm surges. Despite their importance, and the state government’s recent push to bring them under the ambit of the Indian Forest Act, such linear intrusions continue to be sanctioned. This also leads to the loss of less valued biodiversity, like crabs, mudskippers and other species that aren’t protected under wildlife laws.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ht-exclusive-proposal-to-fell-12k-trees-in-thane-creek-for-petroleum-pipeline-101641739764253.html

09-01-2022||Mumbai||HC commutes death/life sentence of man to ten years as crime not premeditated||Mumbai: The Bombay High Court (HC) recently commuted the conviction of a man from murder to culpable homicide after it was informed that the convict had poured kerosene and set his wife on fire under the influence of alcohol. The man challenged his death/life imprisonment sentence by the trial court on the grounds that his act was not premeditated and was the outcome of a dispute he had with his wife after he spent all his wages on consuming liquor. The court held that as the man had tried to save his wife after setting her on fire- made out grounds for culpable homicide and hence commuted the sentence to ten years of rigorous imprisonment. The division bench of justice Prasanna Varale and justice N R Borkar which had head the appeal against the conviction of Janardan Wagh, a 35-year-old resident of Yeola, Nashik was informed by advocate Amit Mane, who was appointed by the court to represent Wagh that the January 1998 conviction by the 2nd additional sessions judge had based the order solely on the dying statement of the victim. Mane argued that Wagh was falsely implicated in the case by the witnesses. The incident occurred on July 16, 1997 when the people residing near the house of the deceased heard the cries of the woman and on investigating found her to be in flames. They doused the flames in which the accused also helped them and thereafter the woman was rushed to the hospital. The judicial magistrate took the statement of the woman the next day after which due to the severity of the burns she succumbed in the night. In the FIR, the police recorded that while arguing with his wife, Wagh poured kerosene and set her on fire. The police booked Wagh under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Mane stated that while the trial court had relied on the dying statement of the woman it had failed to take note of the fact that Wagh was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. Mane argued that at the most Wagh’s act could be termed as culpable homicide as he had no intention of killing her but not murder. After hearing the arguments, the bench observed, “The prosecution’s own case is that on the day of the incident, the accused was under the influence of liquor. An altercation took place between the accused and the deceased as the wages which he received on the day of incident were spent by him for consuming liquor. It is thus apparent that the incident was not premeditated. It appears that the accused even tried to save the deceased.” The court then held that as the case fulfilled the exception (when fight was unexpected or premeditated. No intention of either of the parties to kill or cause the death of any person) under section 300 of the IPC, the conviction of Wagh was commuted from section 302 of IPC to section 304 (1) of the IPC and sentenced him to ten years of rigorous imprisonment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-commutes-death-life-sentence-of-man-to-ten-years-as-crime-not-premeditated-101641738443241.html

An NDRF team, which arrived from Andheri, returned to base as the breach was eventually repaired.“Around 300 dumpers of sand and other materials were dumped near the jack well where the breach was noticed to control the seepage,” said Prabhakar Giri, deputy engineer, Irrigation department Palghar. This is a temporary measure and a permanent measure will be taken during the summer season when the water level will be less, said an official. “We believe that a 40-year-old cement pipe may have developed holes or may have been dislocated near the jack well, resulting in the seepage. We will install a 125m high-density polyethylene pipe without disturbing the present structure to avoid further leakage,” said the official. “As a long term plan, if need be, we may construct a new jack well at the present site,” he added.The pipe is a type of flexible plastic used for fluid and gas transfer and is often used to replace ageing concrete or steel mains. It is used across the globe for applications such as water mains, gas mains, sewer mains, slurry transfer lines, rural irrigation, fire system supply lines, electrical and communications conduit, and stormwater and drainage pipes.As of now, the dam is totally safe and there is no danger or evacuation needed and by Tuesday the entire civil work will be completed, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/breach-in-palghar-dam-plugged-evacuation-averted-101641738262874.html
09-01-2022||Pune||Pune is dist with highest vax numbers for 15-18 age group; now from Monday, 3rd Covid dose to begin||PUNE On Saturday, Pune district overtook Thane to become the district that has vaccinated the highest number of adolescent beneficiaries in the state aged between 15 and 18 years. Starting from Monday, January 10, the district administration will now begin giving third doses to beneficiaries at all its 179 vaccination centres. As of Saturday, Pune has reported 175,780 aged between 15 and 18 years have taken their first shot of the vaccine, which makes it the district with highest number of adolescents in the state vaccinated. Following Pune is Thane, with 164,625 teenagers vaccinated, while state capital Mumbai reported 58,018 adolescents vaccinated, about three times less than what Pune has reported. With 175,780 adolescents vaccinated, Pune’s estimates that 31.78% of the population has got the first shot of the vaccine. Starting from Monday, PMC will begin administering a third or precautionary dose among healthcare workers and those aged above 60 with comorbidities. Before the dose, it is not mandatory to get a written certificate from any doctor the administration clarified. As of Saturday, Pune also has the highest number of beneficiares still to take the second doseA total of 1,222,848 have been vaccinated - of which 682,893 are from the two civic corporations, PMC and PCMC; and 539,955 are from the rural areas. Of these 75,669 are still due to take their second dose. Over 107% of the estimated population has got the first dose, however, 81% have got the second dose which, if based on absolute numbers, makes Pune the district with highest beneficiaries due to take their second dose. ‘Third dose nine months after second shot and 3 months after Covid infection’Dr Suryakant Deokar, civic immunisation officer said, “We have got a great response from students and those aged between 15 to 18 years for the first dose and we are expecting that more senior citizens would also turn up to take the third or precautionary dose at our 179 centres. All these centres will be providing the third dose of the vaccine. Those who have taken Covishield would get a third shot of Covishield while those who took Covaxin would get a third dose of Covaxin. While beneficiaries have to consult their doctor before taking the third shot, no certificate or written consent would be required. The primary condition is that the beneficiary should have taken the second shot of the vaccine at least nine months before taking the third shot and/or three months after a Covid-19 infection.As per the central government guidelines, all healthcare workers, front-line workers and those aged above 60 with comorbidities are eligible to take the third dose of the vaccine. Private hospitals have been asked to ensure that its own staff is vaccinated with the third dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-is-dist-with-highest-vax-numbers-for-15-18-age-group-now-from-monday-3rd-covid-dose-to-begin-101641736945506.html
09-01-2022||Pune||31 micro-containment zones in Pune, 28 are housing societies||PUNE The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has declared 31 micro-containment zones in the city as of Sunday, after a recent spike in Covid cases across Pune. The Aundh-Baner area has become a Covid hotspot, as it recorded the highest number of Covid cases among all 15 wards under the PMC. As per the data released by PMC on Saturday, 420 of the total 2,471 active Covid patients in the city are from the Aundh-Baner area. Of the total 31 micro-containment zones in PMC, 24 have been declared in two wards – Aundh-Baner and Warje-Karvenagar, each with 12 micro-containment zones. Micro-containment zones currently refer to housing societies, colonies, or slums that have recorded an increase in Covid cases and where access is restricted. The administration demarcates specific areas where entry and exit points are closed and only basic supplies are provided to the people living there. Kothrud-Bavdhan consists of three such zones. Kondhwa-Yewalewadi has two micro-containment zones, and Shivajinagar-Ghole road and Wanowrie-Ramtekdi have one each. Unlike the first wave when the majority of the containment zones were declared in slum areas, 28 of the 31 micro-containment zones are in middle-class and upper-middle-class residential societies. “Majority of the Covid cases are being recorded in middle-class or upper-middle-class societies who have some travel history. Cases are almost nil in slums or societies with lower socio-economic status,” said Dr Sanjeev Wavare, PMC assistant health officer. The severity of the Covid cases is much lower than during the second wave. “All positive cases are being treated as Omicron. While the number of cases is high, severity among Covid positive patients is less,” said Dr Wavare. Fewer people are requiring oxygen supply or ventilation because now more are vaccinated and also due to the nature of the virulence, according to the PMC assistant health officer. Although there are 31 micro-containment zones in various areas under PMC limits, the restrictions there are comparatively diluted than during the second wave, according to Dr Wavare. “People are being monitored virtually through the process of contact tracing. The majority of the positive people in containment zones are in home isolation,” he said. When the second wave was at its peak during April 2021, the city’s tally of micro-containment zones had crossed 1,000. 31 micro-containment areas 28 of them are housing societies Aundh-Baner ward reporting most cases Aundh-Baner and Warje-Karvenagar wards have 12 micro-containment zones each Kothrud-Bavdhan – 3 micro-containment zones Kondhwa-Yewalewadi - 2 micro-containment zones Shivajinagar, Wanowrie– one micro-containment zone each||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/31-micro-containment-zones-in-pune-28-are-housing-societies-101641736702920.html

While offline classes have stopped, hostel, food and commuting all is getting tougher for many.Siddhant Deshmukh, a civil engineering student, said, “Offline lectures should have continued as staff and students are all fully vaccinated. Markets and malls are open. And colleges can follow social distancing norms and Covid-19 protocols to remain safe.”“I am an engineering student and we have offline site visits and practicals. Due to the pandemic, all of this is now online,” said Deshmukh.At present, Deshmukh added, the government has allowed hostels to remain open.Mansi Waghmare, a statistics student preparing for higher studies, said, “If we stay in the city, the question remains how we isolate ourselves and manage medicine and food. And if we go back home, we are putting our entire families at risk. Moreover, if we stay here, our family back home is stressed as they don’t know how we are managing the situation and if we are getting the treatment needed.”According to the state health department, Pune district reported 4,390 new Covid-19 cases and one death due to the infection on Saturday.

However, even as cases are rising, hospital bed occupancy and oxygen demand are low. When these start rising, we will enforce stricter restrictions," news agency PTI quoted the health minister as saying.Restrictions imposed by the state government a day earlier were in the interest of people, he added.Some of the restrictions that have been announced by the Maharashtra government so far include curb on the movement of people from 11pm and 5am unless it is for essential work.According to the guidelines, the movement of five or more people between 5am and 11pm has been barred in public places to prevent overcrowding.Also read | Maharashtra revises order; beauty salons, gyms will function at 50% capacityHowever, citizens have been allowed to travel by public transport provided they are fully vaccinated, the order said.Essential work includes medical emergencies, essential services, and movement to and from airports, railway stations and bus stations with a valid ticket, as well as travel to and from sites of work that are open for 24 hours, such as call centres.Meanwhile, the state government on Sunday issued a fresh set of guidelines for gyms and beauty salons allowing them to operate at 50 per cent capacity.

09-01-2022||Mumbai||Mumbai traffic jams to be unsnarled faster through app-based alerts||Mumbai People in Mumbai have surely waited in a jam helplessly in anticipation of a traffic cop clearing the snarl. But now, you can expect traffic jams to be addressed and cleared within 12 minutes, claims Mumbai Traffic police. The new app-based system introduced by Joint Commissioner of Police Rajvardhan Sinha has enabled the traffic police officers at chowkies to reach the centre of the jam and address the problem within 12 minutes, which earlier used to take more than 20 minutes. According to the traffic police officers, the new app, which has been installed in sync with 5,300 CCTV cameras and the 34 traffic divisions across the city identifies the exact spot of the problem through CCTV and alerts the operators through a private setting in Mumbai Traffic Police App (MTP). The setting is accessible only to operators who are responsible for managing the three traffic divisions in the city. These operators have a list of mobile numbers of the police officers through which the officers are alerted about the traffic jams. Raj Tilak Roshan, deputy commissioner of police (HQ) said that as soon as the CCTV cameras show a traffic jam, the system sends an alert to the operator. He then sends a message through WhatsApp and text message to the officer of the concerned chowkies alerting them about the point of the problem. “Sometimes, it takes time to identify the centre point of a jam by officers manning the jurisdiction and then takes several minutes to clear the problem which costs commuters several minutes, even hours,” said Roshan.After the CCTV identifies the exact location from where the traffic jam starts, the new app sends a message through the operator to the officer closest to the centre point of the jam and once the officer reaches there which may take 10 to 12 minutes, he can identify the cause of the jam and clear it. The system which was set up two months ago is different from Google maps as it is capable of pointing the CCTV to the exact problem causing the jam. In case there is traffic jam due to a wrongly placed barricade, the system shows it on the CCTV after which the officer reaching the spot to unsnarl the jam can remove it or place it in a manner that the vehicles can pass through easily. Or if a vehicle has broken down causing the jam, the officer can move it at the earliest. “Response time has become less which has helped ease traffic to a great extent. We have even decreased the signal timings by 20 seconds by observing the pattern of jams near the Godrej junction at Vikhroli,” said Hussain Jatkar, senior police inspector of Vikhroli traffic branch. Roshan said that the app also keeps a daily log of the time, location and cause of the traffic jam and the time within which the officer reached the spot and cleared it. “Once we identify a spot where frequent jams are created, we identify the problem and report it so that it can be rectified,” said Roshan. In the two months since the app-based alert system was implemented, Roshan said that they had been observing the pattern of the traffic jams and the problem causing them after which they have asked Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to repaint all the zebra crossing and stop lines. “Due to the absence of stop lines and zebra crossings, many drivers were getting confused and crossing the stop lines creating traffic jams by not keeping distance for vehicles in other directions pass. Following our request, the BMC is now repainting the zebra crossing stop lines,” said Roshan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-traffic-jams-to-be-unsnarled-faster-through-app-based-alerts-101641733822785.html
09-01-2022||Mumbai||Medical students react to SC decision on NEET||Mumbai: The Supreme Court’s decision on Friday to permit reservation for Other Backward Class (OBC) and Economically Weaker Section (EWS) categories in the all-India quota (AIQ) seats for undergraduate and postgraduate medical admissions invited mixed reactions from medical aspirants. Students and parents took to social media to share their displeasure at open category seats converted into “new quota” seats.“We waited four months, which ate into more than half the academic time, only to be told that more seats will go under reservation quotas. What’s the use of merit when nearly 65% seats are reserved for minorities,” asked 18-year-old Sheena Mewani, an Under Graduate medical aspirant. “The worst-hit will be UG medical aspirants from states that have very few government medical colleges because these are students who depend on AIQ seats to be eligible for admissions to government institutes in other states. With 37% fewer seats at their disposal, the authorities are giving little chance to students who deserve a seat based on merit,” said Sudha Shenoy, the parent of a undergraduate medical student.AIQ rounds are conducted by the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) in order to fill up 15% seats in government and private medical institutes and 50% seats in government and private post graduate (PG) medical institutes. The remaining seats are filled by the states. Other reserved categories include Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes, and Persons with Disabilities.The National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) 2021 exam was held in September and its results were announced on November 1. The NEET-PG exam, which is usually held in January was delayed indefinitely last year due to increasing cases of Covid-19 registered across the country. It was finally conducted in September 2021, but admissions were stayed by the Supreme Court as it was hearing a series of petitions filed by students questioning the validity of the implementation of EWS and OBC quota in all India quota (AIQ) seats. With the SC decision finally coming through, admission registration will finally kick off after a four-month of delay.The Central government released a notification on July 29, 2021, to include both EWS and OBC quotas in the AIQ seats. On December 18, MCC notified its decision to conduct four rounds of admissions to fill up AIQ seats, and do way with the process of surrendering vacant seats to respective states for inclusion under the state quota. “Most of us were hopeful of the extra reservation being dropped from admission this year, but the court ruling is otherwise. The only good news is that admissions will finally begin. Our fight for merit-based admissions to professional courses will continue,” said Aditya More (18), another UG medical aspirant.While MCC is yet to release admissions schedule for AIQ rounds, the state Common Entrance Test (CET) cell has already started pre-admission registrations for undergraduate health science courses whereas a schedule for PG medical admissions is expected.Many students have also lauded the apex court for this ruling. “Many from the OBC category lose out on admissions into good government medical institutes in states with only a handful of options. The AIQ seats is their only chance at admission in a government-run institute and therefore, this decision by the SC will boost the confidence and chances of such candidates,” said Dr Anusiya Rathi, a PG medical aspirant. Academicians however said that the idea that reservation is the antithesis of merit is an incorrect one, as it allows traditionally disadvantaged communities a shot at equal opportunities. “To say that giving students from culturally, socially and economically backward classes a just chance at education will end up killing merit is very wrong. The reason reservation was introduced was to give equal and just opportunities to everybody, no matter their status. Instead of introducing the politics of caste and economical status in education, students should think that they are sharing seats with fellow students,” said Govardhan Wankhede, retired professor from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), specialising in higher education of the marginalised communities.The SC’s Friday decision was lauded by resident doctors across the country. Several RE associations across the country have been protesting since December 2021, demanding for admissions to PG medical courses to commence to ensure adequate personnel available in the midst of a pandemic and a stretched workforce.
09-01-2022||Delhi||Covid price wars are here, but check is it really cheap||The sharp rise in Covid-19 cases once again forces consumers to stay home and shop for even daily essentials like fruits and vegetables from the safety of their homes. This time however, brick and mortar stores are well prepared to face the competition from online stores and are offering to home deliver these goods at competitive prices. And they are using Whatsapp and text messaging to promote their business. This certainly gives consumers more choice , but on the flip side, the ensuing competition is also promoting unfair and deceptive practices inimical to consumer interest.The competition is most apparent on the price front , with each of them wanting to give consumers an impression that his price is the lowest, without really reducing the price, but making hyperbolic statements such as ‘Steep Price Drop’, ‘Lowest Price’ and ‘Deep Discounts’. And almost all of them use exaggerated ‘reference pricing’ to achieve their objective. Some, for example, show an imaginary ‘Maximum Retail Price’ (MRP) of vegetables to show how their prices are far lower. For example, the price of carrot at ₹25 a kilogram was compared with an MRP of ₹58 to show that there was a saving of 57 per cent or ₹33 a kg ! Now where did this MRP of ₹58 come from? The maximum retail price is the manufacturer’s suggested price for pre-packed goods , as required under the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules. So who fixed the MRP for fresh, unpacked vegetables? Obviously, the MRP is the highly embellished price concocted by the retailer to give consumers an impression that they are getting a discount! Even more shocking was the retailer who claimed a ‘Price Drop’ on tomatoes. His reference price, to indicate the massive price reduction, was ₹104. Tomato prices did go up sharply by the end of September 2021 due to unseasonal rains and the resultant shortage of the commodity. But they came down subsequently with fresh arrivals into the market and as per the union ministry of consumer affairs, by December 14, their prices had come down to around ₹55 and to ₹47.52 by December 21. So on a day when tomatoes cost around ₹38 to ₹45 a kilogram, the retailer was claiming that he had slashed the price from ₹104 to ₹45!‘Strikethrough Pricing’ is another method used by many of them to show price cuts. An imaginary, inflated price is crossed out or struck off to indicate that to be the actual price and show how much the retailer had reduced the price! For example, the price of mushroom at ₹72 for 180 gms was struck off and the selling price was indicated as ₹36, giving an impression that the seller was offering mushrooms at a price well below the market price! These are all unfair trade practices and the consumer protection regulator, the Central Consumer Protection Authority constituted under the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 will have to crack down on such deceptive pricing and protect consumers. Another devious method adopted by some of the retailers is to quote prices for non-standard weights or for odd weights generally not used for buying vegetables and fruits. For example, the price of tomato is advertised for 900 gms, that of brinjal for 450 gms, gooseberry for 225 gms and mushrooms for 180 gms! Specifying prices for such varying weights not only confuse consumers, but also make price comparison with other outlets almost impossible. So the solution lies in making unit pricing mandatory for vegetables and fruits sold online and also for any advertisement or communication pertaining to their sale, made through the electronic media. This can be done through an amendment to E-Commerce Rules and it would go a long way in protecting consumers from unethical sale practices, particularly in these Covid times.
09-01-2022||Delhi||Unit price on packages to help consumers make better choice||In a major policy shift pertaining to pre-packed goods, the government has done away with mandatory standard pack sizes that governed the sale of these goods for over 44 years and introduced instead, unit pricing. The change, which will come into force from April 1 this year, will enhance price transparency and help consumers make an informed choice while buying packed goods. Let me explain the significance of this to consumers with a simple example. Brand A is selling 400 gms of pre-packed ghee at ₹240 and brand B is selling 250 gms at ₹175. Both brands are good and you want to buy the one that is cheaper, but how do you compare the price? The unit sale price or the price of ghee per unit of measure, printed on the package, will help you here. While the unit sale price of brand A would be 60 paise per gram (which is ₹600 per kg) , that of B would be 70 paise per gram( or ₹700 per kg) . So obviously, the difference in price is significant and brand A is cheaper by ₹100 a kg.Similarly, suppose you see on the shop shelf two brands of liquid detergents – Brand A has a maximum retail price (MRP) of ₹700 and the pack contains 2.5 litres of detergent. Brand B is priced at ₹500 and contains 1.5 litres . Which brand is less expensive? Here again, the answer lies in the unit sale price - while the Unit Price of brand A is ₹280 per litre, that of brand B is ₹333 per litre! It is for this reason that unit pricing is known as ‘comparative pricing’ that helps consumers save money.So how did we compare prices all these years without the unit sale price? That’s where the restrictions on pack sizes came into the picture. In order to help consumers compare prices between different brands of pre-packed goods, the Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 1977 mandated that certain essential commodities like edible oil, tea, coffee, wheat flour, biscuits, water, soaps, cement and paints, be sold only in specific recommended pack sizes or weights. For example, pulses had to be sold only in packages of 100 gms, 200 gms, 500 gms, 1 kg, 2 kg, 5 kg and multiples of 5 kg. Since the weights of the packages were uniform across brands, price comparison was easy. The Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules , 2011 that replaced the 1977 Rules also made similar stipulations under Rule 5. However, such restrictions on pack sizes were limited to only those commodities mentioned in Schedule II of the Rules and not all packed goods. Besides, standard pack sizes did not facilitate price comparison between varying weights of different brands or different pack sizes within the same brand.Meanwhile the increasing realization of the importance of unit pricing as an important measure of consumer protection encouraged many countries around the world to introduce in the last decade or so, unit pricing either through regulatory requirements or voluntary codes and the international Organization for Standardization even published a best practices guide for unit pricing (ISO 21041:2018) . By amending the Packaged Commodities Rules on November 2, India too has introduced from April 1, mandatory unit pricing for pre-packed goods. With this change, Indian manufacturers, who were always unhappy with pack size restrictions , have the liberty to pack their products in any size they wish. However, in addition to the declaration of the weight or volume of the product in the package and the MRP, they also have to specify the unit sale price, expressed per gram of the product where the goods weigh less than a kilogram and per kilogram where the net quantity is one kg or more. It would be similar in case of volume, expressed in ml or litre.For unit pricing to really serve its purpose, the union ministry of consumer affairs, which has brought about the change, should also ensure that manufacturers display the unit price in a prominent, legible manner on the principal display panel as mandated. In fact it is absolutely essential that the unit price be displayed just below or adjacent to the MRP . It is equally important to educate consumers on the significance of unit price and the difference between MRP and the unit sale price, so that come April 1, consumers are ready for it.

09-01-2022||Pune||Your Space: Mass awareness about benefits of Covid vaccine crucial||With the rise in Covid cases and fear of Omicron spread, the authorities plan to reimpose more restrictions. Readers share why vaccination is crucial to fight the coronavirus... Mass awareness of vaccine benefits must I think we should learn from the past pandemic events that paralysed daily activities for years. Let’s not forget the Spanish flu, cholera, tuberculosis and other viruses that can be prevented by vaccination. Ensuring full vaccination of the total population is a must. Being a doctor, I see that the government has played an amazing role in getting vaccines easily available at almost every hospital. Millions have succumbed to the virus so people must understand the criticality of vaccination. Raising awareness should be taken into consideration on all platforms - digital media, print media and others. Workplaces must ensure their employees are fully vaccinated. If there are few who are hesitant, educate them on the subject. Regular surveys could help understand the number of people who are yet to be vaccinated and the officials in charge must reach out to them. Speaking the language people understand by involving celebrities in vaccination awareness could also play a vital role. Dr Snigdha Kommana Follow Covid norms Omicron variant is the latest threat from coronavirus that we have been fighting since last two years. Though the central, state and local authorities are managing the Covid situation well even as we are on higher side in population, booster dose is the only solution to check virus spread. It is the responsibility of residents to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Rahul S Upadhye Counter Covid misinformation Local health departments know their communities best and how to keep them informed. Residents should clear their doubts regarding Covid like what would make one more comfortable to get the vaccine? What would make one feel more confident? What information would one need to know of different vaccines? Misinformation is an important driver of vaccine hesitancy and serious obstacle to saving lives. Local bodies should monitor social media and try to counter misinformation with specific facts that will encourage those who are yet to take vaccine jabs to come forward and inoculate. Shaming or arguing does not work. Use testimonials and personal stories of frontline workers, celebrities, government bodies and others to compel others to get vaccinated. Ramsha Farha Awareness key to more vaccinations The main reason for people being hesitant to take the jab is the wrong information floating on social media and through people themselves. This has to stop. People should be made aware of the facts and importance of the vaccine. The local authorities should take initiatives at the grassroots and could rope in various community leaders to spread public awareness about the benefits of vaccine. People tend to believe known faces. Proper education and awareness are the keys to maximum vaccine shots. Tripti Tiwari Wake-up call for non-vaccinated With the government opening up vaccination for 15-18 age bracket, India is going to boast of having 50 per cent of its entire population vaccinated soon. It’s disturbing that many are willingly missing out their jabs and putting themselves and everyone around them at risk. In the wake of the new variant, awareness about vaccine benefits has become increasingly important. Sagar Jain Make vaccination certificate mandatory The government and the corporator of the area should survey and set up a committee for door-to-door vaccination. Awareness should be spread through all mediums. Just as vaccination certificate is compulsory for entry into malls and similar public places, make it mandatory for even stepping out from home. . Sayali Shinde Enlighten vaccine sceptics In the last two years, we have survived the wrath of Covid and now we stand a chance to fight by getting jabbed. However, not many imply the conventional saying “Prevention is better than cure” in life. People who are vaccinated have a better rate of survival than those who are not. The masses should be made aware of the fact that they will live with a lesser risk of contraction post-vaccination. The virus may not affect you, but anyone can be a carrier and may affect your loved ones. Being in a democratic nation, the government may not imply fines for not being vaccinated, however, communities can ensure that people in their vicinity are vaccinated. Understanding and enlightening the sceptics should be the most important step. Ronit Augustin Encourage people to get jabbed It took a little while for the entire vaccination operation to work like a well-oiled machine. Now the process is simple and every hospital and nursing home can administer the vaccine at any time. The process is simple and yet a lot of people are concerned because of fake news and absurd conspiracy theories revolving around the vaccine. The best way to reach the masses nowadays is through social media. Medical experts should collaborate with influencers and debunk all false claims and encourage people to get jabbed at the nearest medical facility that can be found on the Co-WIN website.

Earlier in the day, officials said the Delhi Police had arrested the accused from Indore in Madhya Pradesh. This is the first arrest made in the "Sulli Deals" app case, they said. Hundreds of Muslim women were listed for “auction” on the mobile application with photographs sourced without permission and doctored. Thakur did his BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) course from the IPS Academy in Indore and is a resident of Newyork City Township, officials said. Delhi's Deputy Commissioner of Police (IFSO) KPS Malhotra said during preliminary interrogation, the accused admitted that he was a member of a group on Twitter and the idea to defame and troll Muslim women was shared there. However, Akhilesh Thakur said, "I have come to know that on the basis of just one person's statement, my son, who is an IT specialist, has been arrested and taken to Delhi. My son is being framed and defamed." He said after securing the BCA degree in 2018, his son started web-designing work from home on a personal level. "I am an old-fashioned person. I don't even know how to operate a mobile phone properly. I don't know anything about the 'Sulli Deals' app," said Akhilesh Thakur, who works in a private company. The father of the accused said he was away in Nagda town of neighbouring Ujjain district when the Delhi Police took his son into custody. He also said the Delhi Police informed about the arrest on Sunday morning and made him to talk to his son. “During the conversation, my son told me that we should not get worried,” he said, adding that he would be going to Delhi later in the day to arrange legal help for his son. Meanwhile, the Indore police on Sunday said their Delhi counterparts have not shared any information with them about the arrest from here. “We have come to know only from the media about the arrest of Thakur from Indore by Delhi Police. The Delhi Police have not shared any official information with us in this regard so far," Indore Police Commissioner Harinarayanchari Mishra told PTI. Mishra also said that the Indore police will consider starting an investigation into the matter after the Delhi Police share with them the official details of the case. Earlier in the day, Delhi's DCP Malhotra said, "He (Sulli Deals app case accused) had developed the code on GitHub. The access of GitHub was with all the members of the group. He had shared the app on his Twitter account. The photos of the Muslim women were uploaded by the group members." Investigation has revealed that the accused had joined the group on Twitter by the name of 'Tradmahasabha' in January 2020 using the handle @gangescion. During various group discussions, the members had talked about trolling Muslim women, the police said. "He admitted that he had developed the code/app on GitHub. After the uproar regarding the Sulli Deals app, he had deleted all his social media footprints," the DCP said. The Delhi Police said that further analysis of technical gadgets is underway to find out the codes/images related to the app. Earlier in July, a case was registered by the Delhi Police's cyber cell after it received a complaint about an unidentified group uploading photos of Muslim women on an app. According to police, Niraj Bishnoi, the alleged mastermind and creator of the 'Bulli Bai' application, had disclosed during interrogation that he was in touch with the person behind the Twitter handle @sullideals, the alleged creator of the 'Sulli Deals' app that was hosted on GitHub in July last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/my-son-being-framed-says-father-of-sulli-deals-app-creator-nabbed-by-delhi-police-101641723503958.html

09-01-2022||Delhi||No plan to impose lockdown in Delhi, says Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said the Delhi government does not have any plan to impose lockdown in the national Capital even as the fifth wave of infections continues to spread across the city.The chief minister said Delhi has reported around 22,000 Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours. The daily health bulletin for Sunday will be released later in the evening. Saturday’s bulletin indicated the city added 20,181 fresh cases of Covid-19, and 19.6% tests returned positive results. Delhi’s test positivity rate is the highest it has been since May 9 last year, when the statistic hit 21.67%. Dehi’s Covid positivity rate on December 28 was less than 1%.Arvind Kejriwal announced his recovery from Covid-19 infection on Twitter and addressed a video briefing soon after where he appealed to everyone to not panic and keep strictly following all Covid protocols. The chief minister underlined that though the city is witnessing rapid Covid-19 transmission, hospital beds occupancy is very low, and the recovery is very high.“During the last Covid wave, 20,000 single day cases were reported on May 7, 2021 but there were 341 deaths and 20,000 hospital beds were occupied. Delhi reported 20,000 cases on January 8, but there were only seven deaths and 1500 beds are occupied,” the chief minister stated, adding that he was keeping a close eye on the Covid situation even as he stays under home isolation.Delhi Disaster Management Authority has called a meeting on Monday morning to discuss the prevailing Covid situation with experts and top officials and decide if the Capital needs more economic and travel restrictions to check the coronavirus spread.As of now, the DDMA has ordered a weekend curfew, a 10pm- 5am night curfew on weekdays and advised private offices to make at least 50% of their staff work from home.All Delhi government employees have been asked to work from home or online, except those engaged in essential and emergency services such as fire services, prison, water supply, health, etc.Shops in shopping malls and markets have been told to operate on an odd-even basis (10am-8pm) , dine-in services at restaurants and bars is capped at 50% seating capacity on weekdays and only takeaways are allowed during the weekend curfew.On week days, one weekly market in a zone is allowed to open per day and authorities have been asked to take steps to ensure crowd management. Only 20 people are allowed to attend weddings and funerals.Officials said all these restrictions are likely to continue for the time being.Graded Response Action Plan spells out four different levels of economic restrictions which will come into force at different levels of positivity rate. The lowest level of alert is classified as ‘Yellow Alert’ and came into force when the positivity rate breached 0.5% mark and stayed above it for two consecutive days, and the highest level of alert is classified as ‘Red Alert’ which is planned to come into force if 5% positivity rate breached and the positivity stayed above 5% for two consecutive days. ‘Red Alert’ (level 4) under GRAP spells almost lockdown like restrictions. Under ‘Red Alert’ a complete curfew is to be imposed, Delhi Metro will be closed, only essential private offices are permitted to open, malls are closed. Essential shops are allowed and only standalone non-essential shops are allowed between 10am to 6pm.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in ICMR, said the weekend curfew is designed to restrict movement of individuals and will help slow down the spread of the coronavirus.“The experience of different Omicron hit countries of the world shows that the number of cases will further increase in the country, especially in the weeks to come. Omicron spreads four times faster than the Delta variant, but infection is mild.... The peak is likely to reach in the first week of February. The people should avoid meeting people and avoid gatherings and comply with the guidelines,” said Dr Lalit. He also added that the use of mask is very important, and because of better fitting and better filtration ability, N95 masks provide better protection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-plan-to-impose-lockdown-in-delhi-says-arvind-kejriwal-101641712282295.html

09-01-2022||Chandigarh||Kashmir journalist arrested for ‘anti-national’ activities||A journalist has been arrested in Kashmir for allegedly uploading a protest video of the family of a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant, who was killed in an encounter with security forces earlier this week, his organisation said on Saturday. The arrest has triggered outrage from media and politicians against the J&K administration amid demands of his release.Sajad Gul, a resident of north Kashmir’s Bandipora who had been working with online news portal The Kashmir Walla, was first picked up by the army and then handed over to police on January 5, the organisation said. The news outlet said that Gul was charged under sections 120B, 153B, and 505B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). “Gul had posted a video of the protest against the killing of Salim Parray, a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) commander. Parray was killed on January 3 in a gunfight in Harwan, Srinagar. After the killing, minor protests and sloganeering happened in (his native area ) Hajin, in north Kashmir,” the organisation said in a report on its website. Inspector General of Police, Kashmir, Vijay Kumar, in a statement said that Sajad Gul uploaded “objectionable videos with anti-national slogans” raised by some women folk on the day when the “most-wanted” terrorist was eliminated in Srinagar. He said that Gul under the “garb of journalism” was habitual of spreading “disinformation and false narratives” through different social media platforms in order to create “ill will” against the government by provoking general masses to resort to violence and disturb public peace and tranquillity. “Moreover, his overall activities are prejudicial to the sovereignty, integrity and unity of India. Accordingly, a case has been registered against him in which he has been arrested and presently is on police remand,” the statement added. The statement also detailed two other FIRs filed against Gul. Editor of The Kashmir Walla, Fahad Shah has, meanwhile, sought Gul’s immediate release. “I strongly condemn this and stress that journalism shouldn’t be criminalised. Our legal team is working to seek his earliest release,” Shah said in a tweet.Kashmir Press Club (KPC) president Shuja ul Haq said, “Scores of journalists like Sajad work on the ground and face difficulties like these. We hope that in this case the authorities will take a note.”The Committee to Protect Journalists also expressed their worry over Gul’s arrest. People’s Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti alleged that laws have been “communalised” by booking Kashmiri journalists for reporting on human rights while leaving those calling for Muslim genocide in the country. “There is a different set of laws applicable to J&K vis a vis rest of India. Radicalised groups openly calling for genocide of Muslims are roaming free while Kashmiri journalists shining a light on state sponsored human rights violations are jailed. Laws too have been communalized,” she said in a tweet.This is not the first time that Gul has been booked following his journalistic work.In February 2021, an FIR was registered against him after he wrote a story about a demolition drive in a village in Hajin. The revenue officer concerned, Ghulam Mohmmad Bhat, Hajin tehsildar, had said that the FIR was registered after stones were pelted during a demolition drive and some structures and shops to be demolished were built by uncles of the reporter concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kashmir-journalist-arrested-for-anti-national-activities-101641707781380.html

09-01-2022||Bangalore||Congress set to begin padayatra despite restrictions by BJP govt in Karnataka||BENGALURU: Hundreds and thousands of people poured into Sangama, in Kanakpura taluk, to take part in the 10-day 100-km padayatra led by the Congress party in Karnataka.Leaders of the Congress party at the national, state, district and other local levels landed at the venue which resembles a large fair with performers, loudspeakers and huge stages to host the sea of people who are in Ramanagara on the first day of the march that is scheduled to cross 15 assembly seats before reaching the Basavanagudi grounds in state capital Bengaluru.The padyatra, aimed at pressuring the Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to initiate work on the contentious Mekedatu project, is an attempt by the Sonia Gandhi-led party to mobilise support ahead of crucial local elections in the state over the next few months, and the 2023 assembly polls.The Mekedatu issue has evoked emotions on both sides of the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border as it is an extension of the century-old Cauvery river water dispute that has defined generations in the two states. The Congress says the additional reservoir in Mekedatu will help Karnataka source an additional 50 Thousand Million Cubic feet (TMC) of water and 400megawatt electricity.DK Shivakumar, Karnataka Congress president, is also hoping to find his footing and get some traction in his favour within a visibly divided outfit torn between him and former chief minister Siddaramaiah.The BJP government has warned of action against the proposed march as it violates covid-19 restrictions over a rise in infections across the state.“I pray with folded hands to the chief minister that he should withdraw the curfew. Take back the ban imposed by the DC (deputy commissioner). This struggle is for you as well since you also want to start the project and it is the duty of any political party to undertake such struggles,” Shivakumar told a local Kannada channel on Sunday morning.Police have warned of penal action if the march does move forward as it violates Covid-19 restrictions. Over the last few days, the Congress has promised to maintain Covid appropriate behaviour “The party has ordered one lakh masks,” DK Shivakumar told reporters on Tuesday when asked about the decision to hold the march at a time the state is battling a surge in Covid cases. But most leaders and participants at the padayatra on Sunday morning were without masks, and were not seen to maintain social distancing either, or take any other precautions.The Congress is hoping for a repeat of the impact that its 300km march from Bengaluru to Ballari had in 2012 when it led a campaign against then BJP minister, Gali Janardhana Reddy, over the illegal mining scandal that eventually led to the collapse of the saffron outfit’s first government in southern India and reduced the party to just 40 seats in 2013 as against 110 in 2008.The Congress is also trying to get various communities to back the march as part of its efforts to mobilise support especially in the Old Mysuru region where is has a tough battle with the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) and even the BJP which has steadily increased its footprint in the Vokkaliga heartland, both organically and inorganically.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/congress-set-to-begin-padayatra-despite-restrictions-by-bjp-govt-in-karnataka-101641704961119.html

09-01-2022||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Singing glories of the sun god||The sun-deprived daylight hours of last week were poor compensation for the relatively warmer winter nights. So, when on Thursday, the sun made a glorious return to the cosmic pulpit, clammy residents flocked to Chandigarh’s sprawling parks, fringed with flora and basking wild creatures. I chose Rajendra Park opposite the Punjab chief minister’s residence to take a ramble, hoping to catch a glimpse of grey partridges (francolins) that dwelled in its patronage of scrubland borders. The ladies were out in strength, walking briskly, some in the typical, flashy pink parkas, while their kids pulled the stumps out for sunny cricket.Around 4pm, the trees on the park fringes resounded with vociferous partridge cackles. The calls were unusually vehement, occasioned by the warmth showered by the sun god. “Partridges call just before sundown to locate each other, so that the covey is within earshot in case danger arises and warning calls can be emitted. It is also a rallying call to reunite the scattered birds of the covey for the night roost on the trees. Compared to the grey partridge, the black partridge displays lesser number and variety of vocalisations, principally because the latter does not form coveys,” zoologist Rajiv Kalsi, who has authored a radio telemetry-based study on ecology and feeding of partridges, told this writer.Burly Punjab Police (PP) cops detailed for the CM’s security also made good the weather break at the park. With assiduously cultivated whiskers and beards, they looked intimidating. It was reminiscent of a notorious era of the PP. “It was not uncommon to hear of 1,500-2,000 partridges being served at feasts hosted for senior cops’ children. The SHOs would be directed to rally illegal trappers, who would use the ‘boolarra’ method of trapping partridges. A male captive partridge would be placed in the wilderness with nets all around. When the captive partridge would call, the resident males and females would make for the spot and get trapped. On one occasion, the then Patiala SSP served hundreds of partridges at the wedding of his child. The press reported it and it came to the notice of then PM Indira Gandhi. Being a committed wildlife conservationist, she took up the matter directly with then Punjab CM Darbara Singh and sought action,” former Punjab chief wildlife warden Gurmit Singh told this writer. Though no longer on that scale, sections of the PP are still known to procure partridges from trappers to curry favour with their bosses. Partridges were once the quintessential game birds of the north-west Indian countryside. These humble birds sporting succulent flesh also enjoyed cultural resonance and the pugnacious cock with spurs on the legs would be put to staged bet fighting. The black one, by far the handsomer of the two species, has had its call phonetically rendered in many variants: Emperor Babar heard it as ‘Shir-darem-shakrak’ (I have a milk and a little sugar), as ‘Suban-teri-qudrat’ (O Omnipotent, thy power) by UP Muslims and as ‘Lehsan-piaz-adrak’ (garlic, onion, ginger) by shikaris salivating at the partridges-in-the-pot fire. No photographer or sportsman can surrender the memory of the black male with his head held high rendering a spirited call to the accompaniment of tail waggles. To the less dapper Grey, goes the credit for possessing the most graceful run. AO Hume documented this when he wrote in the 19th century: “They run very swiftly and gracefully; they seem to glide rather than run, and the native lover can pay no higher compliment to his mistress than to liken her gait to that of the Grey partridge”. While John Lockwood Kipling, Rudyard Kipling’s father, had this to say: “The (tamed partridge) creature follows its master with a rapid and pretty gait that suggests a graceful girl tripping along with a full skirt well held up. The Indian lover can pay his sweetheart no higher compliment than to say she runs like a partridge...In poetry, too, the partridge is associated with the moon, and, like the lotus, is supposed to be perpetually longing for it, while the chukor is said to eat fire.”vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzzsinging-glories-of-the-sun-god-101641692240517.html
09-01-2022||Chandigarh||Witerati | Of third waves and New Year second thoughts||Pray, what be the most curious of casualties of New Year season?Nah, we aren’t alluding to the balderdash being belted out by the Blokes of Breaking News. The toll of two cities.Talking tolls and tales, as is customary, Season 2022 rings in its share of curtain-raisers. And again, curtains of social distancing.Ah, but did you notice, on New Year, there’s one thing that’s a conspicuous casualty of the coronascape? Like life itself.New Year resolutions.Nobody diligently does them in the New Normal, like before, do they?Blame it on pandemics not taking too kindly to resolutions. Pandemics are possessed with a nasty habit of meddling with expiry dates. Of New Year resolutions (NYRs), as also of those deigning to dabble in them.The Pandemic, perhaps, has spawned a new vocabulary that could best be or better be described as New Year Non-Resolution.A state of vacillation that entails eyebrows shooting heavenwards at the stroke of midnight hour, like a million fireworks saluting the skyscape, petitioning for enlightenment from the galaxy of Gods, about whether or not we would survive 2022 Toll Lists to be bothered with trifles like NYR Long Lists or Short Lists.Of New Year Hit Lists and With-It ListsThis Post New Normal vocabulary denotes all demeanour defined by the dilemma: To do or not to do what we were wont to do - New Year Resolution Hit Lists, With-It Lists, Miss Lists, Dismiss Lists, Consolation Lists or Disconsolation Lists.The Pandemic has indeed robbed us of the days when New Year resolutions stood scripted more religiously than Amarnath Yatras or Ayodhya andolans. Never mind, if NYRs proved as fickle as our political coalitions or Donald Trump’s Twitter renditions. Whether it was passionate pledges to quit smoking or saving crash diet plans from ending in smoke, pre-pandemic, there was spelt out a resolution for every reason, every season. Alas, the treason of this season has robbed us of many a reason.This new narrative of New Year Non-Resolution thus tosses up tormenting thoughts:To join or not to join power yoga to empower fitness quotient. For, one knows not whether one would end up learning the likes of shirshasana or end up in a position bearing uncanny resemblance to shavasana.To give up or not to give up vices catastrophic for curves, such as splurging on sinful Double Trouble Donuts. For, one scarce can figure out what’s ordained by the Covid curve, whether it will be Death by Chocolate or Death by Delta.Of bad hair days and being in bad booksTo sport or not to sport makeovers to better bad-hair days in 2022, like a hair transplant or hair sauna from that neighbourhood Chinese hairdresser. First, not to forget that all things Chinese are to be blamed for the Covid spate. Second, not to forget the Third Wave could render inconsequential follicular fate, scarce would it matter whether one exits the stage sporting curly waves or a bald pate.The curious case of hair today, gone tomorrow.This New Year Non-Resolution narrative can be a boon or bane, depending on who’s at the receiving end.“How about a New Year resolution to devote more time to textbooks than texting?” mummy-hood egged on one’s Millennial at the dawn of 2022. Running the risk of further being in bad books.“C’mon, haven’t you heard Third Wave prophesies?” the Millennial glared up from Zoom, to gurgle gyaan as a prophet of doom. “Come Omicron, what matters more is one book - how to book a berth in a Covid centre!”New Year resolutions shall never be the same, it did dawn.The curious case of the untimely demise of a New Year tradition, by ‘book’ or by crook.chetnakeer@yahoo.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/witerati-of-third-waves-and-new-year-second-thoughts-101641692059019.html
09-01-2022||Chandigarh||Guest Column | A sunny disposition dispels life’s blues||I am a fairly good student of life, and over the years, I have realised that whenever I am in an upbeat mood, I become the best version of myself. I perform considerably better on days that I feel good about myself. It is not that a sudden spurt of talent or adroitness descends over me on these feel-good days, rather it is the happiness quotient, which determines my actions.It is only the question of doing enough to stay enthused. Over the last year, most of us have seen crests and troughs of tumultuous emotions dipping from one high to another low. The pathos and sadness of the pandemic had our hearts swinging like a yo-yo and each day passed with a kind of uncertainty. It was hard to rise above the storm, but the proverbial eagle was always inspiring us to soar high.Trigger some cheer at the start of the day So, I consciously started looking for ways to trigger some cheer before embarking on my daily routine. I would get my dose of endorphins doing the simplest of things, and it would leave me bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for the rest of the day.It was sometimes a song that I’d hear in the morning, and hum it as I went about the day’s chores. Whenever I could snatch a few blissful moments with my pets, their positive energy would engulf me. No chore would seem loathsome, and I would end up doing even the hardest of jobs with a smile.I had not been able to go on vacation, but I decided not to sulk about it. A morning sojourn in the beautiful manicured public park with the sunlight kissing my countenance , was immensely exhilarating. And I would earn a nice glow, whenever I would stretch my sinews . It goes without saying that I would walk on air with a pep in my gait.This happiness mode is in all of us, only the ‘press’ button varies. For instance, my mother would remain cheery all through the day, if any of us prepared a nice cup of tea for her in the morning. The magic would linger the entire day and she would sometimes treat us with one of her special delicacies.My friend was a great singer but it was rare that she would let her talent bloom. We would often tease her about having starry tantrums , but she was actually prioritising her duties and sparing no time for what made her happy.Our friendly neighbour, a retired Colonel, was a melancholy soul after he lost his wife to Covid. I knew of his passion for gardening, so I would often talk to him about his plants. That would not only bring a light to his eyes, but also brighten his gardener’s day, as he would tip generously after that.This New Year, kindle a new fervour for life People who seem to have discovered what makes them happy are like a breeze of fresh air who fill a room with their vibrant presence. It is not that they do not have any problems in life, but they chose to have a sunny disposition, which helps them, and those around them.With the advent of the new year, what better time for me to resolve to kindle a new fervour and zest for life, by making my inner self happy.alkagaurkashyap@gmail.com(The writer is a Chandigarh-based lawyer)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-a-sunny-disposition-dispels-life-s-blues-101641691819071.html
09-01-2022||Chandigarh||Guest Column | Let’s catch grammar, you and I||“I could not reach in time to join my family for dinner.” The sentence seemed innocuous enough as I added it to a student’s story, and yet I received a text message from her mother saying, “Shouldn’t it be ‘on time’ and not ‘in time’?” I was sure that I was right, and there was more than one way to frame a sentence. However, before I responded, I decided to verify the usage from a reliable grammar website, just in case, and sure enough, I wasn’t wrong. As per the website, ‘in time’ means “early enough before a deadline or a cut off.” It indicates that one arrived or accomplished a task with sufficient time remaining to do something else, in our case to have dinner with the family. On the other hand, ‘on time’ means arriving at the designated time. As is usually the case, I was not consciously aware of this rule of grammar, and yet I had used it correctly. I probably, learnt the byzantine rules of English grammar, subconsciously – from the books and newspapers I read, the movies, and television shows I watched, and the people I interacted with on a daily basis. Subconscious is key I have always believed that grammar is caught, not taught. The best way to learn a language is gradually and naturally, through real experiences. Language is learnt through figures of speech, phrases, and idioms used by our parents, teachers, siblings, and actors on television. Learning grammar is like driving a car. In the beginning, we fret over the rules of accelerating, slowing down, braking et al, and then comes a time when we drive without a conscious thought, seemingly on auto-pilot, with the myriad rules an indelible part of our subconscious. There needs to be a change in the was grammar is taught in schools. It should not be taught as a standalone activity. The students’ mind and imagination should be teased through immersive activities such as role playing, writing an article for the school magazine, writing to an author, or inviting the school principal to a class assembly, creating short stories in small groups, or reading a newspaper or storybook. However, should one flip through the English notebook of a CBSE school student, it becomes apparent that such concepts are alien to policymakers and curriculum designers. Who is afraid of tenses? Forms of verbs are drilled into students in Class 3, which only induces mighty yawns among students, and anxiety among parents. When the students move to tenses, parents’ anxiety usually increases manifold, and they enrol their wards for special language classes after school, where superfluous rules of grammar are fastidiously hammered into their heads. Little do parents, teachers, and curriculum designers realise that sentence formation comes intuitively. If we were to apply the abundant and contrary rules of grammar consciously, they would only get in our way. We do a gross disservice to our children when we keep them engrossed in worksheets and exercises, leaving them with little time to speak, read or write, and thereby interfering with their subconscious learning. Making children as young as ten years of age, identify the different types of adjectives and adverbs will not help matters either, or help them get proficient in the language. This is not to say that one should completely do away with the conventional way of teaching grammar. While the teachers can be ‘upholders’ of grammar, the ‘keepers’ of pronunciation and the ‘correctors’ of wrongly placed apostrophes, they need to plan lessons that are enjoyable, engaging and fun. But, remember not to dive too deep into it. rupymand@gmail.com (The writer is a Jalandhar-based educator)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-let-s-catch-grammar-you-and-i-101641691698849.html

Four cases were approved as “untraced” by the court in 2017, three in 2018 and one case each in 2019 and 2020.Elaborating on the use of “untraced” terminology, an official said, “In cases where only the contraband is recovered with the accused being untraced, the court accepts these cases as untraced after the filing of a detailed report by the GRP.”Conviction numbers also fall significantlyOnly nine people accused in NDPS cases held by GRP were convicted between 2020-2021, a significantly smaller number in comparison to a total of 54 people convicted between 2019-2018.Notably, no accused was convicted in the three cases decided by the court in 2020. In comparison, nine of 14 accused in cases in 2021faced conviction. The numbers are significantly lower than those recorded in 2018 and 2019, when 30 out of 41 and 24 out of 29 accused were convicted for the crimes.Explaining the trend, a senior official said, “Criminals were convicted in most of the cases. A high number of accused were held before the lockdown and thus more cases were decided then resulting in high conviction rates.” “After all the trains stopped operations post lockdown, no accused was held. In 2021, after the resumption of railway traffic, GRP held people with the contraband on trains or railway platforms during checking,” the official added.The GRP has filed an appeal against a 2021 acquittal. The same year, regular bail was granted to the accused in as many as six cases, in comparison to nine in 2020, 11 in 2019, 49 in 2018 and 56 in 2017.

He further claims that the state was apprised of the threat perception, but still failed to take proper action.“CM Channi said that nothing happened to the PM. Does this mean that he was waiting for something to happen to the PM of the country. A number of blasts have been reported in border areas of Ferozepur/Jalalabad in the past, but still the PM’s security was compromised. Channi did not accompany the PM as the Congress had orchestrated the entire episode. This is why Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is keeping mum on the entire episode,” said Sharma.Responding to the allegations levelled by Sidhu regarding disrespect of Punjabis by the BJP, Sharma said the PPCC president should first answer whether calling Pakistan’s PM Imran Khan and hugging the Pakistani army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa was not disrespectful to the tricolor.Sharma added that Sidhu and the Congress just wanted to gain power and were not concerned with Punjab or Punjabis. Other BJP leaders also raised questions over the FIR lodged by the state in the case. Speaking on imposition of the Model Code of Conduct in the state, Sharma said it will be a challenge for the Election Commission to conduct peaceful polls in the state as concerns regarding the law and order has taken a back seat under the Congress-led government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pms-security-breach-congress-orchestrated-the-episode-punjab-bjp-president-ashwani-sharma-101641690979309.html

Around 1,018 applications have been received under the scheme, which has been relaunched for the third time in the last one decade.While 854 applications have been received for HIG flats, 164 residents have applied for MIG flats. The applicants have submitted ₹2.4 lakh and ₹1.87 lakhs as earnest money for HIG and MIG flats, respectively, which will be returned to unsuccessful applicants.The officials said as the applicants for MIG flats are less than the number of flats to be constructed under the project, the names of unsuccessful applicants of HIG flats will be added to the lot of MIG flats, to give them a chance and complete the process.Tenders for construction soonLIT chairperson Raman Balasubramaniam said, “The decision to adjourn the draw of lots has been taken due to imposition of model code of conduct. The trust has now written to principal secretary of the local bodies department to seek permission from the election commission for conducting the draw and the next date will be announced as per the response from the commission. The department is also in process to float the tenders for initiating construction works at the site.”Scheme broached third timeThe scheme was initially launched in 2011 when the then local bodies minister Tikshan Sood laid the foundation stone for the project wherein construction of 450 flats was proposed. The LIT organised a draw of lots for allotment of flats with a delay of around five years in 2016 and even allotted 110 flats to residents but the scheme was dropped in 2017 and the allottees were a harried lot. The scheme was again mooted in 2018 but dropped again. In the third attempt, chief minister Charanjit Channi again laid the foundation for the project on December 16, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-improvement-trust-puts-off-draw-of-lots-for-atal-apartment-scheme-101641690920678.html

09-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Heavy rain, water logging throw life out of gear||Life in the industrial hub, which has received the highest rainfall for January in at least 50 years, was thrown out of gear after low-lying areas were inundated with rainwater on Saturday. Waterlogging was seen in almost all parts of the upcoming smart city, leaving motorists and locals a harried lot. Potholed roads and traffic jams added to the commuters’ misery. Some vehicles also developed a snag due to water accumulation. Ferozepur Road, Pakhowal Road, BRS Nagar Market, Gill Road, Model Town Extension, Shastri Nagar, Hambran Road, Chaura Bazar, Shivaji Nagar, and Dugri fared the worse, while the area outside the municipal corporation’s Zone C office was also in a bad shape. Slamming the government for making tall claims about development ahead of the polls, the residents demanded a solution to the waterlogging issue which flares up each year after heavy rainfall. Confederation of Indian Industries (CII- Ludhiana Zone) vice-chairman Ashpreet Sahni said, “The rainfall witnessed on Saturday has exposed the municipal corporation and political parties who claim to have spent crores on developing the city. We were stuck in a five-hour traffic jam due to water accumulation. Many vehicles were stuck in deep potholes, and finished goods could be seen floating in the accumulated sewer water.” A local, Premjeet Singh of Chandigarh Road, said, “Repeated complaints have been submitted to the authorities, and also to the chief minister’s office, but to no avail. “It is difficult to step out of the house due to water logging. The sewer lines get choked and a foul odour pervades the area,” said Singh. In BRS Nagar main market, Ferozepur Road, and Shastri Nagar residents were unable to step out of their cars or houses due to water accumulation. The level of buddha nullah also increased, after which authorities moved to the field to keep a check on the situation.Drainage affected due to power outage at Bhattian STPDrainage of rainwater at Chaura Bazar, New Shivaji Nagar, Transport Nagar, Hargobind Nagar, and Jalandhar bypass was affected due to a power outage at the Bhattian sewer treatment plant (STP) of the MC on Saturday evening, after power supply lines developed a snag. As motors and pumps were unable to pump water out of the sewer lines, the drainage process was delayed. Punjab water supply and sewerage board executive engineer GP Singh said the power line had developed a snag in the evening. However, the generator was used to resume operations. Covering manholes delayed drainage process: Ex-Councillor Former councillor and mayor Balkar Sandhu’s officer on special duty, Parminder Mehta, slammed the authorities for failing to clear the hot mix poured on the manhole covers in old city areas, which hampered water drainage. “Earlier, shopkeepers would open the manholes to drain the water, but they could not even find the manholes on Saturday as they had been covered by the contractor,” said Mehta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-heavy-rain-water-logging-throw-life-out-of-gear-101641690798459.html

09-01-2022||Delhi||Capital adds over 20k cases; nearly 89% beds still vacant||Delhi on Saturday added over 20,000 cases of Covid-19 for the first time in nearly 250 days, as the fifth wave of infections continued to spread across the city, even as hospitalisations remained a fraction of the Capital’s total caseload, with around 89% of the city’s reserved beds vacant.Seven more people in the city succumbed to the infection, showed data released by the government on Saturday.The city recorded 20,181 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, infections that came as daily tests jumped past the 100,000 mark for the first time since mid-April last year. Of the 102,965 samples collected on Saturday, 19.6% returned positive results, showed the state government’s health bulletin.The test positivity rate is now the highest it has been since May 9 last year, when the statistic hit 21.67%.Currently, 48,178 patients in the city are fighting Covid-19.However, a vast majority of hospital beds kept aside for Covid-19 patients in the city continue to remain vacant. The bulletin showed that 1,586 people were admitted to hospitals in the city with the infection, leaving nearly 89% (over 12,500) Covid-19 beds in the city free as of Saturday evening.Hospitalisation rates in Delhi have risen much slower than cases have as the city battles a fifth wave of Covid-19 infections, which experts and authorities have said is likely being driven by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. Experts have said that while the variant is highly transmissible, it is also much less likely to cause severe illness, and resultant hospitalisations, especially when compared with the Delta variant that fuelled Delhi’s fourth (and India’s second) wave of infections.Testing has also picked up over the past week, as the state looks to increase daily sampling to around 300,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/capital-adds-over-20k-cases-nearly-89-beds-still-vacant-101641684018847.html
09-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh govt teachers detest message to join schools after order to shut schools||After the UT administration declared that schools will remain closed till further orders from Monday (January 10) onwards and the district education officer (DEO) further issued an order on the same lines, government teachers are crying hoarse as they have been asked to take online classes from school. After the UT war room meeting on Thursday, it was declared that all educational institutions, including schools, colleges and coaching centres, will remain closed and they will maintain the academic schedule through online teaching. The DEO also issued an order on Friday endorsing the same. However on Saturday, a Whatsapp message was sent by the DEO to the heads of all government schools, asking teaching and non-teaching staff to be present in schools from Monday. The fresh order has left the teachers confused. The UT Cadre Educational Employees’ Union has also written to the UT education department regarding this. “Teachers don’t mind coming to schools but the 50% staff criteria that is being followed in other government offices must also apply to schools. We all have families and are also concerned about the rising Covid cases in the tricity,” said president of the union Swarn Singh Kamboj. Another teacher, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The DEO had already issued an order regarding closure of schools on Friday. The condition for teachers should have been there. Communicating such instructions through informal channels leads to confusion.” Meanwhile, director school education (DSE) Palika Arora confirmed that teachers will have to start coming to school from Monday. Another senior official of the department said, “Some teachers may face issues with conducting online classes so they have been asked to come. The number of teachers is not less and they can maintain social distancing in schools. During the second wave also, teachers took online classes from schools.” Private schools are also likely to follow this model. President of the Independent School Association and chairman of Vivek High School, HS Mamik, said, “Currently, we are closed for winter vacations but once we open, we will also call teachers to school for online classes.” He added that teachers will be asked to come to school two-to-three times a week as it’s easy to monitor the classes this way and adjustments can be made in case the Covid situation of the city gets worse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-govt-teachers-detest-message-to-join-schools-after-order-to-shut-schools-101641681971495.html

The proposal was moved by senator Satya Pal Jain and was endorsed by most of the senate members, but opposed by some. The senate also authorised the V-C to fix the dates for allotment of faculties. The senate meeting was held after a two-year gap and it ratified all the actions taken and orders passed by the V-C in the absence of the governing body. Eleven agenda items were tabled in the meeting for taking the decision. “It may be recalled that the PU syndicate could not be constituted for the last two years, which has led to pendency of some important decisions, including the PU budget and the board of finance,” the university said in an official communiqué. The elected candidates from two constituencies of the senate – faculties and teachers of affiliated arts colleges – are yet to be notified. Most of them belong to the Goyal group which had a majority in the previous senate and syndicate. Former senator, Navdeep Goyal, who is among the candidates yet to be notified, said, “Never in the past was the syndicate election held with an incomplete senate. Even in 2000 when the result of the registered graduate constituency was withheld on the directions of high court (HC), the syndicate election was not held till the complete senate was formed.” Senator Satya Pal Jain, said, “The dates for the election are fixed by the syndicate and there is no syndicate presently. So how can its election be held? I gave a proposal and around 65 members out of 70 supported it.” ‘Proposal passed in haste’ Som Parkash, Union minister of state for commerce and industry, the nominated senator during the meeting objected to the way the proposal was passed. He said, “The proposal was passed in a hurry and I request that all the members are honoured and done in a democratic way.” Few members object to online meetingThree senators - President of Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA), Mritunjay Kumar, Rajat Sandhir and Jatinder Grover, in a joint statement, said they protest the holding of an online senate meeting. They said that it is completely illegal in the absence of any such provision in the PU calendar. “The online senate meeting has proved to be absolutely anti-democratic as the microphones were in the entire control of authorities who were allowing only certain members to speak and our audios were muted multiple times because what we spoke was not to their liking,” they said. V-C asked to give hearing to dental faculty on promotionsThe senate turned down the report of a committee regarding the promotion policy for the faculty members at DrHarvansh Singh Judge Institute of Dental Sciences and Hospital, and authorised the vice-chancellor to give a hearing to the faculty members. The syndicate, in its meeting in July 2020, had resolved to approve the report of the committee, which was formed in 2019 to give suggestions regarding the policy. The report had recommended that the existing policy should continue, as it already had promotional avenues. The varsity had also submitted the report before the Punjab and Haryana high court following a plea by some dental faculty members.However, deliberating on the matter on Saturday, the governing body did not approve the report, and authorised the V-C to give a hearing to the dental faculty members on the matter.Senator Jagat Bhushan, a former principal of the dental institute, said, “Implementation of health and family welfare ministry’s Dynamic Assured Career Progression (DACP) scheme for dental faculty is a viable solution.” The dental faculty members had also maintained in the past that the DACP scheme had already been implemented for medical/dental teachers in all universities across the country. In May 2019, 37 faculty members had approached the high court, arguing that PU had framed a promotion policy/career advancement scheme as per regulations of the University Grants Commission for faculty of all colleges. But the same benefit was not being given to faculty of the dental institute. Thereafter, HC, in its June 2019 order, had directed PU and the Dental Council of India (DCI) to decide on a promotion policy for the dental faculty.Other decisions The PU senate approved the new fee structure and charges for NRI students of MSc forensic science and criminology. The NRI students will be charged 2,860 US Dollars per annum as tuition fee and development funds, which will be at par with the departments of microbiology and biochemistry. The senate also approved the recommendations of the board of finance (BoF) meeting held on January 7, 2020.

09-01-2022||Chandigarh||Hate crime: Sikh cabbie assaulted, turban knocked off outside US airport||In a yet another case of suspected hate crime, an Indian-origin Sikh taxi driver in the US has been assaulted by an unidentified man, who knocked off his turban and also used expletives against him outside the JFK International Airport here, according to a video on social media.The undated 26-second video was uploaded by Navjot Pal Kaur on micro-blogging site Twitter on January 4, showing a man assaulting the Sikh taxi driver outside the airport. She said the video was shot by a bystander at the airport. The person can be heard allegedly using expletives against the victim. He repeatedly hits and punches him and knocks off his turban.“This video was taken by a bystander at John F Kennedy International Airport. I do not own the rights to this video. But I just wanted to highlight the fact that hatred continues to remain in our society and unfortunately I’ve seen Sikh cab drivers get assaulted again and again,” Kaur tweeted.Further details about the driver or the cause of the incident were not available.The video led to angry reactions by the community members.“Another Sikh cab driver assaulted. This one at JFK Airport in NYC. So upsetting to see. But it’s crucial that we don’t look away… What I am sure of is how painful it is to watch our fathers and elders get assaulted while they’re just trying to live an honest life.“For those who aren’t Sikh, I can’t put into words what it means to have your turban knocked off — or to see someone else’s turban knocked off. It’s visceral and gut-wrenching and just so disheartening to witness,” Simran Jeet Singh, author and Director for the Aspen Institute’s Inclusive America Project, tweeted.The National Sikh Campaign said: “We are only a few days into the New Year and there has already been a hate crime committed against a Sikh. A bystander recorded an unidentified man attacking a Sikh taxi driver, ultimately knocking off the driver’s turban.” “No additional details have been released outside of the video, but we know this story too well. A Sikh person goes about their daily lives only to be senselessly attacked by someone. Common road rage between people can escalate when someone who is ignorant of who we are takes their disdain for our turbans and becomes violent,” it said.This is not the first time a Sikh taxi driver has been assaulted in the US.An Indian-origin Sikh Uber driver was in 2019 assaulted and racially abused in the US state of Washington in a suspected hate crime. The driver told the police that he believes his race promoted the attack.In 2017, a 25-year-old Sikh cab driver in New York was assaulted and his turban knocked off by drunk passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hate-crime-sikh-cabbie-assaulted-turban-knocked-off-outside-us-airport-101641678480644.html
09-01-2022||Chandigarh||Chandigarh mayoral election: Chairs won, but running the House won’t be easy for BJP||Chandigarh Only ten-days after being reduced to second position in the municipal corporation elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured all three mayoral posts in the election held here on Saturday. But the road ahead won’t be easy for the BJP as the party is in a minority with 13 seats in the 35-member House. Having mayor’s post, BJP might be able to set agenda for the MC House meet, but getting it passed will be a challenge. It could face stubborn resistance from both the AAP and the Congress members in passing of agenda items. “An invalid vote and cross-voting helped the BJP prevail in the mayoral elections. When the actual business of the House starts, it will be an altogether different game. It will find that managing votes in absence of secret ballot isn’t easy and many of its proposed policy decisions might get stuck,” said a senior Congress leader who didn’t want to be named. With AAP already showing its will to fight it out on the floor of the House, the BJP will have to either seek support from the Congress or attempt at reaching consensus among all the parties. Newly-elected mayor Sarabjit Kaur said, “We will work with all the parties and try to bring them together for the good of the city. With the elections, the politics should end and work for the people’s welfare must start.” SAD, Congress kept themselves at bayBoth the Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) abstained from the mayoral elections keeping in mind the forthcoming Punjab elections. All four – AAP, BJP, Congress and SAD — are locked in a tight contest against each other in Punjab. Congress has seven councillors and SAD has one in the Chandigarh MC House. “Supporting each other in Chandigarh can be counter-productive for the parties in Punjab. So, Congress and SAD opted out of voting,” said a Congress leader. Many political experts feel that the city’s politics will change after the Punjab elections are over. “The opposition parties are likely to come closer, at least issue-based help can be expected to corner the BJP,” said another leader. After din and drama, allegations fly thick and fastAam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Punjab and Chandigarh affairs in-charge Jarnail Singh accused the BJP of murdering democracy in the mayoral election. “City residents gave AAP the maximum 14 seats. Our victory in the mayor’s election was certain, but one of the AAP candidate votes was declared invalid,” he said. At a press conference later, he also accused the officials of “helping” the BJP. AAP’s Punjab affairs co-in-charge Raghav Chadha said it has become clear that the BJP had contested the mayor’s election after having a ‘secret alliance’ with the Congress. “The two parties entered into a secret pact to keep AAP out of the mayor’s race. We will contest the mayor’s election in court,” he said. Responding to AAP allegations, city BJP president Arun Sood rubbished the allegations. “All the rules and regulations were followed in the mayoral elections. Today, the people of Chandigarh go to know the anarchic behaviour of the AAP. Physically attacking the newly elected mayor was a shameful act,” he said. Meanwhile, city Congress spokesperson Rajiv Sharma said, “AAP has once again proved that it is the ‘B-team’ of the BJP. One AAP councillor ensured that his vote gets invalid so that the post goes to the BJP. Another cross-voted in favour of the BJP for senior deputy mayor’s post.” On AAP’s hue and cry over the invalid vote, deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said, “As per Municipal Regulations 1996, the onus of counting of votes is on the presiding authority. The vote was declared invalid by the presiding authority on ground of an identification mark. There is provision of election petition in law to challenge any elections.” 
09-01-2022||Chandigarh||BJP’s Sarabjit Kaur is Chandigarh mayor, Aam Aadmi Party cries foul||Blurb:Chandigarh Amid unruly scenes and protests by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), BJP’s first-time councillor Sarabjit Kaur Dhillon took over as the new Chandigarh mayor on Saturday. This was the seventh successive win for the BJP in the mayoral election. An invalid vote, one cross-vote and draw of lots decided the fate of the mayoral elections as the BJP clean-swept all the three posts – mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor. Sarabjit defeated her rival Anju Katyal of the AAP by one vote. She received 14 votes, while Katyal managed 13 and one vote was declared invalid. At the start of the election proceedings, both the BJP and the AAP had 14 votes each in the House, and seven councillors of the Congress and the lone member of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in the 36-member Chandigarh Municipal Corporation abstained from the voting. In the senior deputy mayor elections, the BJP candidate Dalip Sharma pipped the AAP candidate Prem Lata by two votes, after one of the AAP councillors voted for him instead of AAP. Sharma was polled 15 votes, while Lata got 13. For the deputy mayor’s post, after BJP’s Anup Gupta and AAP’s Ram Chander Yadav were tied at 14 votes each, a draw of lot was conducted, which went in favour of Gupta. The results of the Chandigarh civic body polls, which were declared on December 27 last year, threw up a hung House, with the AAP winning 14 of the 35 wards in its first civic body elections. The BJP won 12 seats, Congress eight while the SAD got one. The BJP’s vote count in the House increased to 13 after Congress’s Harpreet Kaur Babla, the wife of party’s former Chandigarh vice-president Devinder Babla, along with him, joined the BJP on January 2. One more vote for the BJP came from city Lok Sabha MP Kirron Kher. AAP CREATES RUCKUS OVER INVALID VOTE During the mayor election, one AAP vote was declared invalid, which tipped the election in favour of BJP’s Sarabjit. The presiding officer Maheshinder Singh Sidhu, a BJP councillor himself, ruled that an “identification mark” in the form of a “tick” found on the backside of one of the ballot papers, which makes it invalid. Meanwhile, AAP’s polling agent objected to a BJP vote, alleging that it was torn at the bottom, which he claimed was also mark of identification. But Sidhu declared that rules don’t term a torn ballot as a mark of identification. Soon after the mayor’s result was declared, AAP councillors created ruckus in the House and resorted to sloganeering. They rushed to the mayor’s chair on the dais and tried to stop Sarabjit from occupying the mayor’s chair. They also tried to stop MC commissioner, deputy commissioner and other officials from leaving their seats. With BJP councillors, too, rushing to the dais, there was a lot of jostling and pushing between the councillors of the two parties. BJP councillors led by Kanwarjit Singh Rana surrounded mayor’s chair to stop rival councillors to reach her as she addressed the House. Soon afterwards, marshals (police) were called in who removed the AAP councillors off the dais. But as the situation was calming down, things again precipitated as Chandigarh AAP president Prem Garg, who is not a councillor, entered the well of the House from the visitor’s gallery. One of the BJP councillors got hold of him before the marshals escorted him out of the House. Later deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh read out the law, rules and regulations, and eventually AAP councillors sat back on their seats. This was followed by the elections of the senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor.

09-01-2022||Chandigarh||STF head, former ED director want role of Bikram Majithia probed in drug case||The two key senior officials, who probed Punjab’s drugs menace have both called for probing the role of Shiromani Akali Dal minister Bikram Singh Majithia in their statements given to the Punjab Police. One was the special task force (STF), head, Harpreet Singh Sidhu and second, former deputy director of the Enforcement Directorate, Niranjan Singh. Their statements were recorded by Punjab police SIT, probing December 20 NDPS case against Majithia on December 22, 2021. Sidhu, head of STF in drugs cases was asked to probe findings of Niranjan Singh on the role of Majithia in 2017. STF was constituted to fight drugs menace in Punjab. It submitted reports from time to time to high court. As of Singh, he had given a report in high court on the “role” of Majithia, which too was examined by STF and a report was submitted in high court. The third statement is of Jagdish Singh Bhola, the sacked deputy superintendent of police, who has more or less spoken on the same lines accusing Majithia. He is the kingpin of racked busted in 2013. Sidhu said his report in high court be considered as his statement. In his statement Sidhu said, ED documents were called and examined and four 2013 drug FIRs were also examined to check whether Majithia had an association with the accused persons, whether he played a role in supply of drugs and whether there are monetary transactions between Majithia and them. “It was found that Bikram Singh Majithia has a close and extended association with Satpreet Singh @Satta and he was well known to Maninder Singh alias Bittu Aulakh and Jagjit Singh Chahal,” Sidhu says referring to the ED probe, adding that Majithia was also connected to Parminder Singh alias Pindi and Amrinder Singh Laddi. ED had concluded that allegations of providing vehicles, security etc as well as involvement of Satta during election of Majithia are “believable”. They knew each other since 2003-04. Laddi and Pindi had admitted to their association with Majithia, ED probe cited by him says. While some of the accused persons were convicted in drugs cases, others are sitting abroad and the process of bringing them back is underway. Often referred to as drug lords, Laddi, Satta, Pindi are absconding and sitting abroad. Chahal is a local businessman and Aulakh is a SAD leader. It was found from the analysis of all statements of persons together by the ED that Bikram Singh Majithia had a role in “facilitating” supply of pseudoephedrine to Satta and Pindi. Majithia, however, denied this. Majithia directly asked Chahal to supply pseudoephedrine to Satta and Pindi and also made a similar arrangement with Chahal through Aulakh, Sidhu says referring to ED findings. He also refers to ED’s findings of Chahal giving ₹35 lakh to Majithia and Majithia’s “involvement” in sand-mining business. In his statement Niranjan Singh has submitted that he had quizzed Majithia, and submitted a note before the high court, which was later examined by the STF. Sidhu has referred to the same note in his depositions. He further said he had mentioned the “role” of Majithia, obtained details of the latter’s properties, bank accounts and CDRs and the same can be collected from ED office. Singh has now retired. 
09-01-2022||Chandigarh||Government machinery used to benefit drug cartels, SIT tells HC in drug case against Bikram Majithia||Underlining the need for custodial interrogation of former minister and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA Bikram Singh Majithia, Punjab police special investigation team (SIT) told the high court that government machinery was used for the benefit of drug cartels during the Akali regime in the state.The SIT response has come following the anticipatory bail plea filed by the SAD leader. The high court is to take up the matter on Monday.The SIT says incriminating material has come on record against Majithia, which it has given in a sealed cover. On filing the evidence in a sealed cover, it reasoned that if made public, his supporters would browbeat and threaten witnesses from deposing against him.‘Case filed on prima facie evidence’The SIT also denied allegations of political vendetta and stated that the FIR has been registered on the basis of prima facie evidence. It said, Majithia was a key minister in the Akali government and it was during their term that the offences of drugs trade had taken place and “government machinery was used for the benefit of drug cartels operating in and outside Punjab”. Without his custodial interrogation, the case can’t be cracked and “backward and forward linkages” can’t be established, stated the SIT.Minister’s whereabouts still not knownOn December 20, 2021, Majithia was booked by Punjab police in a drugs case. Majithia’s whereabouts are still not known. On December 24, a Mohali court had dismissed his plea observing that though his claims are of political vendetta, he himself was a powerful person in state politics till 2017, when SAD was in power. Against this order, he had approached high court, alleging “political vendetta”. “The petitioner is a sitting MLA and a very influential politician and as such can use his influence and muscle power to threaten, influence and intimidate witnesses from deposing against him and can also destroy evidence which investigating agencies are in the process of collecting,” said the SIT, adding that till date, he has not cooperated and has gone into hiding despite repeated attempts made by SIT to make him join the investigation. The SIT, without naming anyone, also claimed that a close relative of the petitioner has time and again threatened officials of the police department, at public rallies, and told them to be ready to face dire consequences for registering this criminal case. It also filed newspaper cuttings and audio clippings of statements made by former deputy chief minister Sukhbir Badal, who is the brother-in-law of Majithia.The SIT response stated that the initial FIR was registered on May 15, 2013 at Banur police station against Satinder Dhama, Baljinder Singh and others. Later, sacked DSP Jagdish Bhola, Jagjit Singh Chahal and Manjinder Singh Aulakh were nominated as accused. Initially, Bhola made a statement about Majithia’s involvement before the Enforcement Directorate. Subsequently, Jagjit Singh Chahal, another accused, stated that he met Satpreet Singh Satta, who used to live at Majithia’s house with Parminder Singh Pindi and Maninder Singh Ladi with Bittu Aulakh and that these persons were involved in the drugs case in “connivance” with Majithia. Their statements revealed that they were running the drugs racket and were continuously “in touch with Majithia”. Police have stated that the statements of Harpreet Singh Sidhu, the STF head, who had submitted the 2018 report in high court, which became the basis of the FIR has been recorded, along with that of former deputy director, ED, Niranjan Singh, who had summoned Majithia in 2014, and Bhola.

09-01-2022||Chandigarh||PM’s security breach: BJP claims police overlooked assembly of unknown persons near Ferozepur helipad||Amid uproar over Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s security breach, the Bharatiya Janata Party claimed that the Punjab police overlooked the gathering of nearly 100 unidentified persons near the temporary helipad that was to be used for the PM’s travel to Ferozepur on January 5. BJP national executive member Harjit Singh Grewal said on Saturday that in the presence of director general of police (DGP) S Chhattopadhya, nearly 100 non-BJP activists were spotted near the helipad. Those people were not removed by the police, he added. Grewal said he, along with senior Punjab BJP leaders Avinash Rai Khanna, Rajinder Bhandari and some government officials, were present at the helipad to receive the PM. Next to the chopper landing site, the PM was to lay the foundation stone of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research’s satellite centre for Ferozepur and other development projects worth ₹43,000 crore. “We reached the venue before 10 am as the PM was expected to reach Ferozepur around noon. While some BJP leaders were barred from reaching the venue, Punjab police personnel overlooked the assembly of nearly 90-100 unknown people around the helipad. They appeared to be activists of farmer unions or members of other political parties who remained there till 2 pm,” said Grewal, a former vice-president of the party’s Punjab unit. He said since it was raining, PM’s travel from Bathinda airport to Ferozepur was expected to get delayed. “We were advised to stay back at the foundation stone site till 2 pm as the PM was expected to arrive late. But the PM’s cavalcade was stuck just a few kilometres from the rally venue due to a road blockade by farmers. The gathering of protesters en route PM’s motorcade and assembly of unidentified persons around the helipad smacks a conspiracy of the ruling Congress and police administration who used farmer unions to jeopardise BJP’s event,” he added. ‘Model code will boost BJP’s morale’ Grewal said the “ultra-Left associations” like Ughrahan and Dakaunda factions of the Bhartiya Kisan Unions have selectively launched a political campaign against the BJP. “Several of our leaders faced harassment by these unions for over a year. They staged a round-the-clock sit-in outside the residences of BJP leaders for several months. It all happened due to the support of the police. As the model code of conduct has been invoked, undue political pressure on police would ease and our leaders and supporters will campaign vigorously,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pms-security-breach-bjp-claims-police-overlooked-assembly-of-unknown-persons-near-ferozepur-helipad-101641674280325.html

The integrity of the entire country is maintained through the sacrifices of Sikhs. Now, Sikhs are being targeted on social media with regards to the PM’s Punjab visit, under a well-planned conspiracy,” he said.Dhami said some leaders of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are playing with the Sikh sentiments by giving statements like “repeat 1984 Sikh genocide”.The SGPC president said government agencies and forces are responsible for the security top leaders and it is their responsibility to make timely arrangements.“It is sad the PM returned due to laxity of governments but this entire issue is being given a communal colour,” said Dhami.He also demanded that action against those tarnishing the image of Sikhs and spreading hate propaganda against the community.“Freedom of expression on social media does not mean creating an atmosphere of hatred by targeting anyone or any community. Strict laws should be enacted against those offending religious sentiments on social media and for disturbing the peace and harmony of the country,” Dhami added.He said the SGPC will write to the PM regarding the hate propaganda against Sikhs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dont-drag-sikhs-into-pm-s-security-breach-issue-sgpc-president-harjinder-dhami-101641673440072.html

09-01-2022||Mumbai||Maharashtra imposes restrictions daily cases cross 40k||Mumbai: The state government issued new restrictions on Saturday in light of the rising number of cases of Covid-19, as Maharashtra added 41,434 fresh cases, with 20,318 from Mumbai alone.People are disallowed from stepping out between 11 pm and 5 am unless it is for essential work. The order also disallowed movement of five or more people between 5 am and 11 pm — a likely reference to prevent crowding in public places. However, citizens will be allowed to travel by public transport provided they are fully vaccinated, the order said. Essential work includes medical emergencies, essential services, and movement to and from airports, railway stations and bus stations with a valid ticket, as well as travel to and from sites of work that are open for 24 hours, such as call centres. State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the government looked at people’s livelihood, especially daily wage labourers while introducing the restrictions. “We aim to control the movement of people as much as possible. We want the businesses of people to continue, especially the daily wage earners. We have taken a middle path [in restrictions]. The government’s focus is on reducing crowding,” he said.The order signed by chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty shuts down gymnasiums, spas, wellness centres and beauty salons — which had been permitted to open up on August 12, 2021, at reduced capacity. Swimming pools, which are yet to open up in the state, were to continue to remain shut. Entertainment parks, zoos, museums and forts as well as other local tourist spots will be shut down till further notice, the order stated. Any order on beaches and bandstands would be issued by the Mumbai civic body. Restaurants and eateries will be allowed to operate but with 50% capacity. They will be required to shut at 10 pm and open at 8 am. Home deliveries will be permitted on all days and even beyond 10 pm. Cinema halls, theatres, and auditoriums will continue to operate at 50% capacity but must shut between 10 pm and 8 am, the order stated. The order directed management of these places to set up rapid antigen test booths and allow entry to only fully vaccinated people. Hair cutting saloons will continue to operate at 50% capacity and strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour was expected. Iqbal Singh Chahal, Mumbai municipal commissioner on Saturday said that the restrictions laid down by the state government will be enforced by the civic administration. No fresh guidelines will be issued by the municipal corporation, he said.“These are primary measures to contain the spread of the virus. Though the daily numbers are high, it is not an alarming situation. We can dial up the restrictions in a gradual manner as we progress in this current wave,” said a government senior official requesting anonymity.The order restricted entry into government offices unless the person possessed written permission from the head of the department. The order also directed private offices to stagger work hours and prioritise work from home for their employees. Not more than 50% attendance in office would be permitted. The state capped gatherings at weddings, social, religious, cultural and political events at 50 people and only 20 people would be allowed for funerals and last rites. Meanwhile, as the drive to give the ‘precautionary’ dose for senior citizens kicks off from tomorrow (Monday, January 10), the state health department is short of vaccines, the minister said. Tope said that the state had demanded Covaxin and Covishield doses from the Centre as the booster dose for people over age 60 will commence from next week.“As the vaccination of 15 to 18 years is underway, along with the regular immunisation drive. We will start the drive for the precautionary dose for people over age 60. We need 60 lakh Covishield and 40 lakh Covaxin doses. The demand for the same has been made to the ministry of health and family welfare and we are confident the doses will be provided, as there is no shortage,” Tope said.Maharashtra reported 133 new cases of the Omicron variant, taking the tally to 1,009 in the state. Of these, 439 have been discharged following a negative RT-PCR test.

09-01-2022||Noida||Noida restaurants write to landowners, mall owners seeking relief from rent||The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) on Friday shot a letter to top mall owners and landlords, seeking a complete waiver on rentals and common area maintenance fee, in case food and beverage businesses are completely shut for dine-in due to a rise in Covid-19 cases. Anticipating more restrictions in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases, the association said in the letter that it wants pure revenue share for the period when operations will be restricted and no minimum guaranteed rents for three months post that. The open letter, undersigned by president of NRAI Kabir Suri, said, “We are seeking these reliefs just for ensuring long term survivability of the F&B business. It is going to be a challenge and we assure you that we are willing to walk together with you through these challenging times with all resources at our command and we seek a similar assurance from you.”The letter also states that most of the landlords have been generous and made significant contribution to the survival of the players in the industry.According to Varun Khera, head of NRAI’s Noida chapter, apart from the open letter to landowners, the letter has been written individually to all prominent mall owners in Gautam Buddh Nagar as well. He said there are at least 200 restaurants and eateries in Gautam Budh Nagar, which are still struggling to survive. “During the second wave last year, restaurants were shut in Gautam Budh Nagar for about three months and night curfew restrictions continued till October. As a result, the hospitality industry has been badly affected and we have not been able to recover the losses. Hence, as a pre-emptive measure, we have asked for financial support from land and mall owners,” said Khera, who is the owner of Desi Vibes restaurant in Sector 18 market, Noida. He added, “While we are thankful to the government that restaurants are being allowed to operate at 50% capacity, we are afraid that more restrictions may be imposed. Hence, we have called out land and mall store owners for relief.”. On January 6, the NRAI had also written to the ministry of home affairs asking for immediate relief to restaurants and permit longer operating hours to reduce overcrowding. It had also asked for directions to states to permit delivery of food from restaurants as part of essential services. When asked, Syed Shameem Anwar, associate director (marketing) at Entertainment City in Sector 38-A, said, “We will review the appeal of the sector and take a decision accordingly”. Officials at DLF Mall, Noida did not comment on the issue. Requesting anonymity, a landlord at Noida’s Sector 18 said, “It is too soon to take a decision as restaurants are still running. We will still wait and watch to see how long restrictions are in place and whether there will be more curbs”.According to SK Jain, president of Sector 18 Market Association, landlords should consider the request of the hospitality industry. “Covid has had an adverse impact on restaurants and landlords should consider their appeal for relief. Such an appeal also depends on the relations between restaurant owners and landlords as earlier during first and second wave, landowners have been accommodating in terms of rent pay,” he said.He further suggested both stakeholders to make a permanent provision for impact of lockdown in rent agreements. “We don’t know how long the pandemic will last . Hence, restaurant owners should add a clause or provision for relief in their agreement with landowners,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-restaurants-write-to-landowners-mall-owners-seeking-relief-from-rent-101641669839586.html

Residents from areas such as Palam Vihar, Ashok Vihar, and sectors 5, 22, 56, 57, 45, 40, and 46 on Saturday alleged that the power supply remained erratic since Friday midnight.In some areas, residents complained that the supply was restored only by Saturday evening. Atul Aggarwal, a resident of Sector 57, said that the power supply went off around midnight on Friday and came back only around 8am on Saturday. “There was a power cut again at around 12 noon on Saturday and the supply was restored only at 5.30pm. The authorities should inform residents about such long power cuts in advance,” he said. The residents also said that the power outage hampered their work from home schedule. “I and my wife are working from home. But due to power cuts, we were unable to attend office meetings and use room heaters for parents who are down with Covid-19. The invertor battery also died as there had been no power since Friday night,” said Dinesh Kumar, a resident of Sector 5. The residents of Saraswati Vihar, Maruti Kunj and Chakkarpur complained that there were power cuts throughout the day on Saturday. “The residents of Saraswati Vihar suffered immensely due to the power cut that started around 1.30am. We also faced water issues as we could not switch on the motor to fill our water tank in the morning,” said Rekha Sharma, a resident. In many areas, the power supply was hampered due to feeder breakdown, said officials from the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHVBN), adding that their teams managed to restore power in several localities in the first half of the day. “Teams of DHBVN have been deployed in all the affected areas and they are attending to the complaints to ensure resumption of supply. During rains, power supply gets affected due to falling of trees on power cables. The issues have been resolved in most of the areas, and efforts are being made in the remaining areas to restore power at the earliest,” said PK Chauhan, superintending engineer (operations), Gurugram circle 2, DHBVN. 
09-01-2022||Noida||Ghaziabad’s daily spike in cases hits second wave peak levels||With 683 fresh Covid-19 cases being reported in Ghaziabad city on Saturday, the daily spike in cases in the district is now nearing the peak levels seen during the second wave of the pandemic last April-May, when the daily case count had averaged about 1,000 a day. According to health records of January 8, Ghaziabad has an overall case tally of 58,226 with 2,428 active cases. Of the active cases, 2,312 have come in the month of January and only 14 of the active cases are presently lodged in facilities while rest are in home isolation. According to the records, the overall tally of Covid cases touched 57,000 on Friday and took just a single day to touch 58,000. The last time the district saw a similar spike was during the months of April and May 2021, at the height of the second wave of infections. For instance, the district reached a tally of 38000 cases on April 29 and 40,000 a day later on April 30. A total of 15,000 cases were added in the month of May 2021 before they started declining. From 55,000 total cases as on May 31, 2021, it took the district 217 days to add the next 1,000 -- it touched 56,000 on January 2 this year. But the spike since then has been alarming, officials said. The next 1,000 cases came in five days to clock 57,000 on January 7 and a 1,000 more within a single day to take the tally to 58,000 as on January 8. “The spike is sudden and it is heading towards the peak. In the coming days, more cases are expected and thereafter a decline will be observed. The only advantage as of now is that the severity of infection is very low. Currently, only those who are unvaccinated or having co-morbid conditions are at high risk,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of the Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). As a result of the current spike, the positivity rate -- the number of samples that return positive among the total tested -- during the past fortnight (from December 25 to January 8) has increased from 0.17% to 7.48%. The sample positivity rate in January has reached 6.19% against an overall positivity rate of 2.65%. During the past four days, from January 5 to 8, the district has been conducting tests above the daily target of 7,400 set by the state government. “We are keeping track of all cases coming in at a rapid pace and more rapid response teams will be created as the cases increase. Apart from that, since a majority of our patients are in home isolation, we are ensuring that we provide medicine kits to all patients. The kits will also be given to ‘Nigrani Samitis’ in localities and these are being provided to patients at home and also to patients who test positive at testing centres,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer (CMO). “During the spike, in order to protect children, we will be holding mega vaccination camps at 200-250 schools across the district on Sunday. We have a stock of one lakh of Covaxin shots and we will try to vaccinate as many children as possible on Sunday,” the CMO said. “With increasing number of cases coming in, we have resorted to containment with the help of micro containment zones. This includes the house of the patient and his/her movement outside is strictly restricted during the home isolation period. The teams also sensitise neighbours,” said Vipin Kumar, additional district magistrate (city) who is also the nodal officer for containment zones.

AIG Balraj’s son, Princepreet Singh, was promoted as an inspector (local rank) with Chattopadhyaya signing these orders on December 27. Princepreet is a sub-inspector in Fatehgarh Sahib. A local rank is a temporary promotion which is given for six months by the DGP by exercising special powers vested to him under the Police Act. The appointment of Balraj, a low-profile PPS officer, as the SIT head had also come as a surprise for many. When questioned on his son’s promotion, he said, “This temporary promotion is not a big issue; my son had been recommended for this in 2018.” He added, “My son is a scholar and has done research on tracing stolen vehicles. He has six years of service, but he got the chance to become SHO just six months back. This controversy is unnecessary.”The FIR against Majithia was registered after a few senior officers, including the then Bureau of Investigation head, SK Asthana, refused to lodge any case against Majithia, citing lack of evidence. With the Punjab Police registering the case, the Punjab and Haryana high court will hear Majithia’s anticipatory bail plea on January 10 (Monday).Perfect example of quid pro quo: SADThe Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has alleged that the promotion was the perfect example of a quid pro quo. “Our charge has proved absolutely right. We are claiming from Day 1 that Chattopadhyaya has played foul on the orders of the Channi government. That is why he was brought in the as officiating DGP, because previous officers refused to commit any wrong,” said Youth Akali Dal chief Parambans Singh Bunty Romana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/exdgp-chattopadhyaya-promoted-son-of-aig-heading-sit-against-majithia-101641668461053.html

Police said on Saturday that the gang would steal infants from Delhi hospitals and sell them in neighbouring states. According to police, the three suspects -- Surender Kaur (44), Neha (37) and Harjinder Singh -- booked the taxi near Dhaula Kuan in Delhi for ₹4,000 for travelling to Alwar in Rajasthan. However, their telephonic conversations with a person raised suspicion to driver Umesh Lohia (35), a resident of Gurugram’s Nathupur, that the two infants were stolen and they were trying to make a deal for selling one of them for ₹2.4 lakh and another for ₹2.7 lakh to someone in Alwar, police said. Surender and Harjinder hail from Alwar, while Neha is a resident of Sector 16 in Delhi’s Rohini, police said, adding that they have been arrested. The stolen infants were handed over to the child welfare committee and efforts are on to trace their parents, police said. The infants, hardly 20 days old, were probably stolen from hospitals in Delhi for selling to issueless couples in other states, they said. According to police, the Delhi Police had arrested Surender in 2014 in a child theft case. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), on Saturday said that police teams have been sent to Alwar and Delhi to arrest other gang members. “There are at least 12 more members in the gang which had been operating since 2014,” the ACP said. Sangwan said the Umesh was returning from Delhi when the trio hired his vehicle for travelling to Alwar. “The deal to sell the infants didn’t materialise, following which the trio cancelled their journey to Alwar and asked the driver to drop them to Raghubir Nagar in Delhi,” Sangwan said. “But the driver drove them to DLF Phase 3 police station without letting them know. We will move court for police remand of the suspects for detailed interrogation,” he said. The Gurugram police commissioner has announced ₹25,000 reward for Umesh for helping police, Sangwan said, adding that he is one of the several taxi drivers trained by the Gurugram police for crime control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/taxi-driver-helps-gurugram-cops-bust-infant-trafficking-gang-101641668459417.html

Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said that the department has geared up for providing booster dose to senior citizens and these will be available at the 38 sites run by the department. “The vaccination slots will be most likely available online from Sunday morning. The eligible beneficiaries would be those senior citizens, who are sixty plus and whose nine months have completed after receiving the second dose,” said Yadav. According to the officials, about 40,000 such senior citizens are eligible for taking the booster dose in the district. The messages to eligible beneficiaries are being sent by the authorities, but those who have not received a message can also walk-in at the centres, said the officials. “To ensure smooth vaccination, we have decided to set up separate counters for the senior citizens. One important condition for senior citizens is that they must carry a certificate of a comorbidity from a doctor,” said Yadav, adding that both online booking and walk-ins will be allowed for senior citizens. The health department also said that apart from vaccination of seniors, they are working closely with the district administration to check the preparedness of hospitals, isolation centres and availability of oxygen and medicines required to treat the Covid-19 patients. On Thursday, the state government had directed the deputy commissioners in all the district to set up isolation and Covid care centres in both urban and rural areas in view of the rising cases of Covid 19 cases. It had also asked them to review the stock of Oxygen and other medicines required for treatment and ensure smooth supply and availability of such medicines in future. Meanwhile, Gurugram on Saturday recorded 1,450 fresh Covid-19 cases, which took the total number of active cases to 6,642, of which 47 patients are currently in hospital, according to the bulletin from the health department. The department conducted tests of 11,596 samples on Saturday. On the vaccination front, the health department said that 34,668 persons received Covid-19 vaccine. Of them, 10,296 beneficiaries were in the 15-18 years category. The officials said that on Sunday, 47 session sites will be held where Covid 19 vaccine will be given to eligible beneficiaries. 
09-01-2022||Lucknow||Campaign blitz in Uttar Pradesh precedes curbs||The announcement of the Uttar Pradesh assembly poll schedule and model code of conduct on Saturday was preceded by a campaign blitz by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath in the state over the last few months. Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav, too, has been on campaign trail since October. Even before Election Commission announced a ban on road shows and physical rallies until January 15 in keeping with strict Covid-19 protocols, Akhilesh had put on hold his proposed rath yatras from Ayodhya that was scheduled for January 9. During the campaign blitz by the BJP leaders, series of big-ticket projects were launched in UP, including Kushinagar and Noida international airports, Purvanchal and Ganga Expressways, Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, Saryu Nahar project, Gorakhpur fertilizer factory and Meerut’s sports university. From connecting with farmers to unveiling fleet of electric buses for several cities or inaugurating the metro rail project in Kanpur, Modi was virtually everywhere, travelling to UP frequently to seek “aashirwad (blessings)” of the masses for a second consecutive BJP government in the state. He also connected virtually (through video conference) with beneficiaries of various government schemes in UP. Besides development, he set the political discourse in UP, describing Yogi as “UPYOGI (useful)” and terming the red cap wearing Samajwadi Party (SP) as “red alert”. The Samajwadi Party (SP) is widely seen as the main challenger to the BJP. As experts pointed out, there is good reason for the BJP’s reliance on Modi. “The BJP in UP can be divided into two phases. Pre-Modi and post-Modi. So, in 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP got 17.5 per cent and 22.17 per cent votes. In the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the party’s vote share went up drastically, 42.63 per cent in 2014 and 49.98 per cent in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In the 2012 UP polls, the BJP had a vote share of about 15 per cent and in 2017, this vote share went up to 39.67 per cent. That’s the kind of impact he has had on the party’s electoral fortunes and it is only natural that his party is relying a lot on him in these elections too. That explains the frequent PM visits in the run-up to the polls,” said professor Manuka Khanna of the political science department of Lucknow University (LU). The BJP, which had launched six Jan Vishwas Yatras in UP from December 19, had planned a formal conclusion of these yatras with a mega rally by PM Modi in Lucknow on January 9. An estimated 10 lakh people were expected in Lucknow. “That rally, as it is clear already, isn’t happening now. So we will fall back on virtual rallies and door-to-door connect campaigns, but we will have Modi and Yogi Adityanath’s messages delivered to the people both virtually and through door-to-door format. We are working out newer campaign formats as directed by the election commission,” a party leader said. Modi, who is also the Lok Sabha MP from Varanasi in eastern UP and on whose charisma the BJP is betting on yet again, had started arriving in UP since October 20 when he inaugurated the Kushinagar international airport. He inaugurated the 341-kilometre Purvanchal Expressway on November 16. On December 7, Modi inaugurated a fertilizer factory, AIIMS and a lab in Gorakhpur. On December 13, he dedicated the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi. On December 18, he was back laying the foundation stone of 594 km-long Ganga Expressway at Shahjahanpur which would be the biggest in of India. On December 21, Modi addressed a rally with an all-women audience in Prayagraj, whose blessings he sought to win the elections. On January 2, he laid the foundation stone of a sports university in Meerut. Thus, he covered all the regions across the state. Nearly all the projects that Modi and Yogi inaugurated or laid the foundation stone of have wider connect across several districts. Take the inauguration of the ₹9800 crore Saryu Nahar project on December 11. The Nahar project is expected to help farmers and people in at least 6200 villages across nine districts —Bahraich, Balrampur, Gonda, Siddharthnagar, Basti, Sant Kabir Nagar, Gorakhpur and Maharajganj, all east UP districts. Here, Modi had reminded the people how anyone who quenches someone’s thirst is remembered before cleverly urging the masses to “bless” the BJP. “We never forget anyone who offers water to quench people’s thirst and I am sure that now that your parched fields would get water, your blessings would help us work with greater enthusiasm,” he had said then. As for the Ganga Expressway, it would pass through Meerut, Hapur, Amroha, Bulandshahr, Badaun, Shahjahanpur, Hardoi, Unnao, Pratapgarh, Rae Bareli, Prayagraj, connecting 519 villages and will cut down travel time. It was during this launch that he coined the phrase ‘UPYOGI (useful)’ for chief minister Yogi Adityanath while slamming the opposition for neglect of both ‘vikas and sanskritik virasat (development and cultural heritage), a line that all BJP leaders have been taking since. “Virtually all the projects that Modi inaugurated or laid the foundation stone have the capacity to influence people’s lives in a big way,” said Irshad Ilmi, a political observer. Adityanath was active too, packing several poll meetings besides attending to his work as chief minister till late in the night. “We wouldn’t know when he would sleep because irrespective of how late he went to bed, he was up and about early morning. His energy is boundless,” a UP minister said about Adityanath’s packed schedule. From attending party meetings, accompanying top leaders, addressing party campaigns, Yogi Adityanath has been fuelling the party campaign. “Modi ji is the party’s lifeline. And in UP, there is hardly any assembly constituency or district for which projects worth several thousand crores have not been announced. Whether it is the so far neglected Sonbhadra where a medical college has been sanctioned, where Har Ghar Nal Yojana (tap water scheme in each household) is going to be a reality, increasing of old age, differently abled and widow pensions, to lowering power tariffs, launching wellness centers he has been catering to all the sections of the society. Yogi ji’s energy and his stamina, his honesty and his hard work are amazing,” said UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh. With Modi in the lead, other top party leaders and Union ministers followed. “Virtually every day through November-December, we had top leaders connecting with the masses,” a BJP leader said. Union home minister Amit Shah travelled across the state from Lucknow to Kasganj and from Hardoi to Bareilly, from Ayodhya to Hardoi and from Bhadohi to Bareilly – holding roadshows and rallies. Defence minister Rajnath Singh also addressed well attended rallies and so did BJP chief JP Nadda. For his part, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav had hit the campaign trail on October 13 when he launched Vijay Rath Yatra on a Benz bus coverted into a rath from Kanpur. Ahead of the yatra, the SP released a video in which Akhilesh was seen touching the feet of his father and party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav. Subsequently, Akhilesh’s rath yatra drew impressive crowds at various places across the state, including Hardoi, Gorakhpur, Ghazipur, Banda and Jaunpur. The SP chief also held public meetings at various places, both separately and atop his motorized chariot. One of the most talked about yatras by the SP chief was his virtual non-stop all-day, all-night rath yatra on the entire 341-kilometer long Purvanchal Expressway just after it was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November. The yatra on the expressway was taken out to reiterate the claim that the Purvanchal Expressway was conceived and launched by the SP government. Several sitting MLAs from BSP and few from the BJP have joined the Samajwadi Party, which had opened its doors to all small parties. The BJP which is also wooing smaller, key players, too, got few SP lawmakers to join the ruling party. “I don’t think anyone drew more crowds than Akhilesh ji and they came spontaneously to hear the SP chief. The BJP is afraid as it has read the writing on the wall and that is why it has formed alliance with investigating agencies,” said Samajwadi Party leader IP Singh. IP Singh was referring to the recent income tax raid on some SP leaders. The most talked about income tax exercise was one on the Kannauj-based businessman Piyush Jain from where the tax agency claimed to have detected massive currency notes and gold. The BJP quickly claimed that the businessman was behind the launch of Samajwadi ‘ittra’ (fragrance) though Akhilesh later held a press conference in Kannauj claiming that the businessman was raided as he shared a similar name to that of SP MLC Pushpraj Jain who lived in the same Chipatta locality as Piyush. On the day, Akhilesh held a press conference in Kannauj, the income tax raided Pushpraj Jain too. Akhilesh claimed the exercise was carried out to hide embarrassment. The BJP and the SP also sparred on twitter over the income tax raids.

Traffic was disrupted on several stretches such as the service lanes of the Delhi-Gurugram Expressway, between Khandsa and Kherki Daula toll, Narsinghpur stretch, Sheetla Mata Road, Golf Course Extension Road and Sector 10 stretch, said traffic police officials, adding that personnel were deployed at several spots to drain out water using water pumps. However, the officials said that major congestion was not reported in the city on account of Saturday and weekend curfew in the national capital. Commuters faced issues crossing Golf Course Extension Road, Sheetla Mata Road, and Sector 10 stretch. They alleged that these stretches are riddled with potholes and are unsafe for two-wheelers.Rupesh Saluja, a Delhi resident who commutes to Sohna Road for work, said that he has escaped accidents several times on Golf Course Extension Road due to potholes. “Today, it was very difficult to cross the stretch due to potholes filled with rainwater. The road requires a complete makeover,” he said. The traffic volume on Golf Course Extension Road is usually high as many residential societies, corporate offices and automobile showrooms are located on the stretch. Sonika Khurana, a resident of Sector 5, said that despite repairs the stretch from Atul Karatia Chowk to Sector 5 is in a mess. “Shopkeepers have encroached the road from both the sides, and overnight rain caused waterlogging and congestion on the stretch. It takes more than 40 minutes to cross the 3km stretch,” she said. The traffic officials said that they also filled up more than 100 potholes to prevent accidents on flooded roads. At least 400 police personnel were deployed at 32 vulnerable points in the city to manage the waterlogging situation, they said. Sanjeev Balhara, assistant commissioner of police (traffic), said, “Police personnel filled up potholes on roads for the ease of commuters during the rains. Around 110 potholes were filled up with soil and interlocking tiles to avert mishaps across the city. Our teams have prepared data of stretches where repair work needs to be done and the same will be shared with the agencies concerned,” he said. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Gurugram recorded 54mm of rainfall between 12.30am and 8am on Saturday. The IMD predicted that the city may witness one or two spells of rain or thundershowers on Sunday as well. On Saturday, the minimum temperature in the city was recorded at 13.5°C, while the maximum temperature was 18°C.

A case in the matter was registered on Friday. A complaint was lodged by Kusum Mahendra Budhiya, a housewife living in a society of Kaspate Vasti. Around 11:30 am on January 4, the woman was walking near the Lord Vitthal temple in Kaspate Vasti when two men approached her and told her that they were policemen. The men then allegedly told her that she should keep her valuable jewellery inside her bag and not wear it outside. As the woman complied and tried to put the jewellery in her bag, a third man tried to distract her as the men tried to snatch the jewellery. As they failed to rob the woman, a fourth person helped them flee the spot on a two-wheeler, according to the complainant. “One of them told her that his senior officer is calling her. Took her to a second person who posed as a senior officer. The second person told her that she is making a mistake by roaming around wearing jewellery. A third person walked by and the man pretending to be a senior officer yelled at him for wearing jewellery as well. The poser officer made him take off jewellery and put it in his bag. The complainant then followed suit and started putting her jewellery in her bag when the first man tried to put his hand in her bag. The woman raised an alarm and told them to not touch her bag. The people walking around the area started gathering and the two ran away. We checked the CCTV camera footage and found that the two posers, the third person, and one bike rider (who did not get involved) were working together,” said assistant inspector Santosh Patil of Wakad police station who is investigating the case. A case under Sections 393 (attempt to commit robbery), 170 (personating public servant), 420 (cheating), and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Wakad police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/68yearold-foils-robbery-attempt-by-men-posing-as-cops-in-pune-101641667259250.html

09-01-2022||Lucknow||Indian Post, Railways integrate services to deliver women artisans’ products nationwide||In a major push to the women self-help groups (SHGs) in Uttar Pradesh, the India Post and Railways are set to join hands to deliver the products made by SHGs to every part of the country. The move initiated by minister of railways and communications Ashwini Vaishnaw during his recent visit to Lucknow will also benefit the ongoing One District One Product (ODOP) scheme of the state government.“Indian railway and India post are two major institutions that have evolved a lot with the demands of time and technology. As per the advice of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, both these departments should work closely in a more integrated manner. I want this integration to begin from Uttar Pradesh,” said Vaishnaw while addressing a gathering of officials from Indian Railways and India Post at a programme held at the general post office (GPO) on January 6.“The senior officials of railway and India post in Uttar Pradesh are present here. I want you to get in touch with each other to begin the process of better integration. Over 12 lakh employees of Indian Railways along with two lakh employees of India Post can provide us world’s best system to deliver goods from and to the remotest corners of the country,” the minister added.According to senior officials, the minister reiterated the plan in a gathering with the officials of the two departments after the programme. “The minister asked senior officials of India Post and Indian Railways to work out a method for better integration of services,” said Kaushalendra Kumar Sinha, chief postmaster general, UP.Besides boosting the exiting delivery system via train, the integration will provide the much-needed push to women SHGs in the state by expanding the markets for their products. As per government records, there are over 53,000 registered women SHGs in Uttar Pradesh, one of the largest in the country. More than half of these women SHGs produce products ranging from stricter social, bangles and decorative pieces to food products. According to experts these SHGs are forced to sell their products in the local market at throwaway prices in absence of proper marketing and reach to big markets.The integration will also provide a major push to the ODOP scheme of Uttar Pradesh. “The integration work will benefit the ODOP (scheme). The products made under the ODOP scheme and will be delivered in a much effective manner across the country. This will not only benefit the artisans and workers involved in manufacturing of the products but also help to build brand Uttar Pradesh,” said Vivek Kumar Daksh, postmaster general, HQ region, Lucknow.As part of the integration work, 9147 post offices across Uttar Pradesh have already started providing IRCTC (Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation) services for the booking of rail tickets. At 14,553 post offices, common service centres have been set up that can provide services ranging from Aadhar, banking, pension, insurance etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/indian-post-railways-integrate-services-to-deliver-women-artisans-products-nationwide-101641666839538.html
09-01-2022||Pune||SPPU to conduct research on immunity-boosting properties of Ashwagandha||PUNE The Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) has provided an opportunity to the people to participate in the ongoing research of the ministry of Ayush to prove the immunity-boosting effect of the medicinal plant ‘Ashwagandha’ post-Covid-19 vaccination.As a part of the national programme of the ministry of Ayush, the research project has been started to examine the efficacy of Ashwagandha after vaccination for Covid-19 that can help in boosting immunity. Dr Bhushan Patwardhan, national researcher, ministry of Ayush, said, “The ministry has undertaken such national-level research projects to prove the usefulness of Ayurvedic medicines and to promote them far and wide. Scientific research on Ashwagandha is a part of it. More and more citizens should participate in this research and help to take Ayurveda forward.”The concept of the project was developed by Dr Patwardhan and Dr Arvind Chopra is the head of the study. The medical officer Dr Shashikant Dudhgaonkar at the health centre and Dr Girish Tillu from the department of health sciences, of the university along with the research students are working on the project.Dr NS Umrani, vice-chancellor, SPPU, said, “The university is providing students and teachers with the opportunity to work on the basic issues of the society, instead of just theory-oriented courses at the university.” “It is a matter of pride for the university that many professors and students are working on this subject,” said Umrani.The centre of the research project in Pune is located at SPPU. The project is ongoing at other six centres spread across the country – Mumbai, Nagpur, Jaipur, Delhi, Hassan and Belgaum. Dr Tillu said that citizens participating in this project will be given Ashwagandha capsules after vaccination. “The study aims to evaluate how much immunity is enhanced by taking these capsules additionally. Previous research has shown that Ashwagandha is useful in many ailments; including boosting immunity. The participants in the research will be provided with complete health care and they will not incur any form of financial expenditure,” said Dr Tillu.Who can participate?Individuals between the ages of 18 and 45 years are required to visit the university health centre within seven days after receiving the first or the second dose of the vaccine. There they will be briefed on the details of this research. Citizens who are willing to participate will be given a health check-up and provided with Ashwagandha capsules. These capsules are expected to be taken as instructed. Assessments will be carried out at regular intervals. The cost of travel will be borne by the centre, added Dr Tillu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sppu-to-conduct-research-on-immunity-boosting-properties-of-ashwagandha-101641666719138.html

The blue sky of the city was dominated by thick cloud cover which kept the denizens devoid of sunshine and with the maximum and minimum temperatures both remaining almost the same, residents continued to shiver all day through. Weather experts predict conditions to remain the same for the next 24 hours. The temperature remained almost the same as compared to Friday as there was a difference of just two degrees in terms of maximum temperature while the minimum remained almost the same. The maximum temperature, as recorded on Friday was 17.5 degrees Celsius and it increased to 19.5 degree Celsius on Saturday. Likewise, the minimum temperature on Friday was 14.4 degree Celsius and on Saturday, the minimum temperature was 14.9 degree Celsius. The city also received 0.4 millimetres of scanty rainfall. Although, the cloud cover did give way to a glimpse of sunshine around noon the same was for a brief spell with high dew content in the atmosphere that resulted in ‘Galan’, a condition wherein there is high humidity in the air adding cold waves with a breeze. With the chilly conditions continuing, the city roads witnessed the thin attendance of commuters and vehicles. Even the local parks saw very less attendance of youngsters and kids who too remained cautious against the conditions. Different crossings of the city witnessed locals sitting around bonfires while many others opted for hot tea from roadside vendors. Meanwhile, the weather experts have predicted no respite from the prevailing chilly conditions. “The winds, coming from Himalayan foothills are too strong and a couple of days without fog would soon be replaced with bright sunshine only to invite chilly conditions by next week,” said Prof AR Siddiqui, a weather expert and head of the Department of Geography, Allahabad University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/prayagraj-shivers-amid-sporadic-showers-heavy-cloud-cover-101641666601163.html

Dr Clive Dix called for a new targeted strategy to manage Covid-19 and scrap population-based jabs as the UK witnesses fall in daily Covid-19 cases after registering record numbers, according to several British media reports.“We need to analyse whether we use the current booster campaign to ensure the vulnerable are protected, if this is seen to be necessary,” The Observer quoted Dix as saying. “Mass population-based vaccination in the UK should now end.”The vaccine expert insisted that the government needs to manage the disease and not the spread of coronavirus, adding that the future objective should be “stopping progression to severe disease in vulnerable groups.”Omicron mild? Experts slam earlier presumption as US sees record hospitalisationDix’s statement came after the UK health security agency (UKHSA) reported nearly 147,000 new confirmed Covid cases over the last 24 hours on Saturday. With an 18.5% decline in daily infections from the previous week's figure of 179,637, the UK marked the biggest week-on-week fall since the start of November. But the death toll due to Covid-19 continued to increase with 313 more fatalities recorded, taking the cumulative death toll of Britain over 150,000.“Coronavirus has taken a terrible toll on our country and today the number of deaths recorded has reached 150,000,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote on Twitter.“Each and every one of those is a profound loss to the families, friends and communities affected and my thoughts and condolences are with them. Our way out of this pandemic is for everyone to get their booster or their first or second dose if they haven’t yet,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/treat-covid-like-flu-end-mass-vaccination-after-boosters-uk-vaccine-expert-101641734477007.html

What scientists say about Covid-19 strain found in Cyprus||A researcher in Cyprus has reportedly discovered a strain of the coronavirus that combines the Delta and Omicron variant and has been nicknamed as Deltacron. At a time when the world is in the grip of Omicron, the latest variant of SARS-CoV-2, reports of this apparently new variant triggered fresh apprehension. As Deltacron trended on social media, many experts opined that it is not a real variant. However, the Cyprus scientist has defended the finding. In an emailed statement to Bloomberg, the said that the cases he has identified indicate “an evolutionary pressure to an ancestral strain to acquire these mutations and not a result of a single recombination event”.Here is what we know so far:1. Leondios Kostrikis, professor of biological sciences at the University of Cyprus, called the strain 'Deltacron'. Reports said the strain has Omicron-like genetic signatures within the Delta genomes.2. 25 cases of Deltacron have been found so far, Bloomberg reported. Much about this strain or these cases remains unknown.3. In an interview, Kostrikis said, "We will see in the future if this strain is more pathological or more contagious or if it will prevail."4. The sequences of the 25 Deltacron cases were sent to GISAID, the international database that tracks changes in the virus, on January 7. Small update: the Cypriot 'Deltacron' sequences reported by several large media outlets look to be quite clearly contamination - they do not cluster on a phylogenetic tree and have a whole Artic primer sequencing amplicon of Omicron in an otherwise Delta backbone.5. Virologist Tom Peacock said on social media that Deltacron may not be an actual variant, but possibly a result of contamination. "So when new variants come through sequencing lab, contamination isn't that uncommon (very very tiny volumes of liquid can cause this) - just usually these fairly clearly contaminated sequences are not reported by major media outlets," he explained."Recombinants are definitely worth keeping an eye on and almost definitely will eventually be found, this particular example is almost definitely contamination though," he wrote.

Some documents still bear Nazi stamps."The Nazis hated the Freemasons," Andrzej Karpowicz, who managed the collection for three decades, told AFP.Nazi ideology, he said, was inherently "anti-Masonic" because of its anti-intellectual, anti-elite tendencies.The library puts some select items on show, including the first edition of the earliest Masonic constitution written in 1723, six years after the first lodge was created in England."It's one of our proudest possessions," Grazynska said.The oldest documents in the collection are prints from the 17th century relating to the Rosicrucians -- an esoteric spiritual movement seen as a precursor to the Freemasons whose symbol was a crucifix with a rose at its centre.During the war as Allied bombing intensified, the collection was moved from Germany for safekeeping and broken up into three parts -- two were taken to what is now Poland and one to the Czech Republic.The section left in the town of Slawa Slaska in Poland was seized by Polish authorities in 1945, while the others were taken by the Red Army.In 1959, the Polish Masonic collection was formally established as an archive and curators began studying it -- at that time, Freemasonry was banned in the country under Communism.The collection is open to researchers and other visitors, who have included representatives of German Masonic lodges wanting to recover their pre-war history.It is "a mine of information in which you can dig at will," said Karpowicz.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/still-holds-mysteries-archive-amassed-by-nazis-sheds-light-on-masonic-history-101641722420262.html

The unnamed military officer was reportedly among the athletes who fell sick after attending the World Military Games in Wuhan, China's epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak, in October 2019.“I'm 100 per cent convinced the virus was present in Wuhan when we were there,” the Daily Mail quoted the Canadian officer as saying. “The burden of proof is on the scientific community and intelligence experts to prove – not for athletes.”The report suggests that a quarantine section was set up on their military flight back home as many from the Canadian contingent were hit by the “mysterious virus”. The officer said that the foreign participants of the games found the city of Wuhan ‘like a ghost town’.A World Health Organization (WHO) team of international experts visited Wuhan in January last year to probe the origin of the virus but failed to conclude how the pandemic began. While the joint report prepared by the WHO and Chinese experts ruled out the possibility of a lab leak as “extremely unlikely”, top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said he was not totally convinced with natural introduction theory.Since then, there have been several calls for a renewed probe into the origin of Sars-CoV-2, which China has repeatedly rejected.While the Canadian military officer acknowledged that the debilitating illness athletes suffered from after visiting Wuhan might not be Covid but wondered why everyone seems “reluctant to investigate properly.”“It feels like we were present at Ground Zero of this pandemic that has had such impact on everyone's life, with millions of deaths and economies shut down, so why not carry out due diligence. Are the facts just too big to handle?” he said, as quoted by the British daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/are-facts-too-big-to-handle-canadian-military-officer-fears-he-was-at-covid-ground-zero-in-oct-2019-101641720555631.html

The group accused the professor of “nonsense remarks on social media, which were provoking people against the government and playing with people’s dignity.”The Taliban seized control of Afghanistan last August ahead of America's chaotic Aug. 31 departure after nearly 20 years of war. The Islamic militant guerrillas-turned-rulers previously held power from 1996-2001.In a tweet early Sunday, Jalal's daughter Hasina Jalal pleaded for her father's release. “As I confirm the disturbing news. I ask for the immediate release of my father Professor Faizuallah Jalal,” she tweeted.Afghanistan faces a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions, with the United Nations warning that 90% of the country's 38 million people are in dire need. The arrest of a prominent rights activist was certain to complicate humanitarian aid efforts.It also reinforced fears that the Taliban are imposing the same harsh and repressive rule as their last stint in power before they were ousted by a U.S.-led coalition for harboring al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.TOLO TV, Afghanistan's largest station on which Faizuallah Jalal was a frequent commentator, tweeted that Jalal was arrested “reportedly for making allegations against government departments, a security source said."There was no official response from the government to queries about Jalal's arrest.Jalal is the husband of one of the country's first female presidential candidates, Masooda Jalal, who ran against former President Hamid Karzai in 2004.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-arrest-popular-afghan-professor-critical-of-govt-101641717466228.html

We envision this project as a first-phase engagement and a building block for AIIB’s long-term partnership with India and - in this particular case, Chennai - by supporting the government’s programme of expenditures,” Pandian was quoted in an AIIB statement released after the project was approved.The former Indian bureaucrat has in the past sought to dispel the impression, especially in India, that the AIIB is a Chinese bank, saying it has emerged as a multilateral bank becoming the lead financier of infrastructure projects in Asia.Except the US and Japan, most of the developed and developing countries have joined the bank.An AIIB report in December said that India can capitalise on a higher participation rate in global value chains (GVC) to accelerate the country’s recovery from the pandemic. “AIIB’s 2021 Asian Infrastructure Finance Report said GVC participation across India will largely rely on a combination of improving infrastructure, strengthening institutional quality and increasing port efficiency, capacity and connectivity with the hinterland,” it said.In late December, the AIIB approved the application of Iraq to join, becoming the bank’s 51st regional member to bring its membership to 105.As of October 22, AIIB has overall approved 147 projects in 31 countries valued at $28.97 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-rbi-guv-urjit-patel-appointed-beijing-based-aiib-vicepresident-101641717561771.html

Fact is that the Xi Jinping regime is targeting global supply chains to punish a small country. While a Chinese spokesperson denies blocking imports containing Lithuanian components, the hit is on German automotive suppliers as their precious cargo is said to be languishing at Chinese ports. Germany and France are beneficiaries of a close economic relationship with China, which often uses this leverage to dilute any diplomatic action against Beijing on human rights contemplated by the EU. The German automotive industry players as well as multinational companies, reeling under Chinese potent action, are already putting pressure on Lithuania to rename the Taiwanese office in Vilnius and warning the tiny EU country to back down as German subsidiaries are at risk. German CEOs are known to have warned their political leadership not to conduct confrontational foreign policy with China, clearly showing how the economic leverage of Beijing works globally.Incidentally, the US Congress has passed the Uighur Forced Labour Prevention Act, which would bar goods made by forced labour in the Sinkiang region from entering America. The US multinational companies are bracing for the day when the Act becomes law.While Lithuania’s total exports to China were a mere USD 350 million in 2020 with the balance of trade much in favour of Beijing, but the Xi Jinping regime expanded the sanctions to hurt global supply chains by including Lithuanian parts.Also Read| Eye on India: China to appoint special envoy to Horn of AfricaLithuania, Australia and Norway are examples to show that Beijing refuses to take criticism lying down and India was first to face the brunt after the 14th Dalai Lama was given shelter in Dharamshala in 1959. It was then paramount leader Mao Zedong who made an example out of India by launching the 1962 war across the 3,488 km long Line of Actual Control (LAC). Since then, Beijing has not ceded an inch to India as it is in relentless pursuit of superimposing the 1959 line (first unveiled by Premier Chou En-Lai) on Ladakh LAC and claim Arunachal Pradesh as South Tibet even though it has recognized the same McMahon Line as the border with Myanmar.Under the circumstances, little is expected out of the 14th round of India-China military dialogue to resolve the Ladakh LAC and roll back the PLA aggression over the years. Clearly, for the PLA, the LAC has now become a Line of Control (LoC) with rapid military infrastructure upgrades all along the line that still awaits resolution.

Our diversity makes the US stronger, and we condemn any form of hate-based violence,” the State SCA wrote on Twitter.An un-dated 26-second long video shared on Twitter on January 5 showed the Sikh cab driver being assaulted by an unidentified man. It was posted by Navjot Pal Kaur, who said that it was recorded by a bystander at the John F Kennedy airport.In the video, the man could be heard allegedly using expletives against the cab driver. He repeatedly hit the victim and punched him and also knocked off his turban. Further details about the driver and the cause of the attack were not available.It’s not enough to say that we need to fight AAPI hate. We actually need our elected officials to get involved with consequences for those who commit acts of violence against our community. @GregMeeksNYC @NYCMayor @AdrienneToYou @yuhline @rontkim pic.twitter.com/Dkk23lQw0gThe video derived angry reactions from the Sikh community. A day before the State SCA's remarks, the Indian Consulate in New York took up the matter with the authorities.“The assault against a Sikh taxi driver in New York is deeply disturbing. We have taken up the matter with US authorities and urged them to investigate this violent incident,” the Consulate tweeted on Saturday.The National Sikh Campaign, an organisation that promotes a better understanding of the Sikh community in the US and other Western countries, said, “We are only a few days into the new year and there has already been a hate crime committed against a Sikh.”"A Sikh person goes about their daily lives only to be senselessly attacked by someone. Common road rage between people can escalate when someone who is ignorant of who we are takes their disdain for our turbans and becomes violent,” the NSC added.This is the second such attack on a Sikh cab driver in New York. In 2017, drunk passengers assaulted a 25-year-old driver and knocked his turban off.On December 5, 2019, a Sikh driver working for Uber was racially abused and strangled by a passenger in Bellingham, Washington.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vows-action-against-recent-attack-on-sikh-cab-driver-at-jfk-airport-101641697334825.html
09-01-2022||World||US hones warnings, offers to Russia over Ukraine||The Biden administration on Saturday issued new, forceful warnings to Russia on penalties it may face if it goes ahead with threats to invade Ukraine.US officials raised the possibility of incremental shifts in decisions about America’s future strategic posture in Europe. But they also said Russia would be hit with debilitating sanctions should it intervene in Ukraine.The officials said the administration would be open to discussions with Russia on curtailing possible future deployments of offensive missiles in Ukraine and putting limits on US and NATO military exercises in Eastern Europe.Yet, they said Russia will be hit hard with economic sanctions should it intervene in Ukraine. In addition to direct sanctions on Russian entities, those penalties could include significant restrictions on products exported from the US to Russia and potentially foreign-made products subject to US jurisdiction.The comments came as senior US and Russian officials prepare to meet in Switzerland on Monday amid heightened tensions over Ukraine.The officials said the US is willing to discuss certain, limited aspects of its European security posture in those talks. But they stressed that any agreements would be contingent on Russia removing threats to Ukraine and that no decisions would be made without the consent of Ukraine or NATO.And, they said there is no chance the US will reduce its military presence or arsenal in Eastern Europe as Russia has demanded.While those comments, made to reporters on condition of anonymity in a White House-organized telephone conference call, were the first to suggest a willingness to compromise on issues tangential to Ukraine, they were accompanied by threats for Russian inaction on US demands to step back.In the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, “we – in coordination with our allies and partners – would immediately impose severe and overwhelming costs on Russia’s economy, including its financial system and sectors deemed critical to the Kremlin,” another official said.In addition to sanctions on energy and consumer goods, the US and its allies are considering bans on the export to Russia of advanced electronic components, software and related technology that uses American equipment. Russia could be added to the most restrictive group of countries for export control purposes, together with Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria, officials said.That would mean that Russia’s ability to obtain integrated circuits, and products containing integrated circuits, would be severely restricted, because of the global dominance of US software, technology and equipment in this sector. The impact could extend to aircraft avionics, machine tools, smartphones, game consoles, tablets and televisions.Such sanctions could also target critical Russian industry, including its defense and civil aviation sectors, which would hit Russia’s high-tech ambitions, whether in artificial intelligence or quantum computing.US officials have been careful not to issue ultimatums to Russia, while at the same time demanding that threats to Ukraine cease. But they have also flatly rejected Russian demands that NATO will not further expand eastward and that the US will remove troops and weapons from Eastern Europe.Despite that stance, the US and NATO have signaled a willingness to explore compromises on related issues.“We think we can at least explore the possibility of making progress with the Russians,” one official said Saturday, ahead of Monday’s Strategic and Security Dialogue between the US and Russia in Geneva. He added, though, that “there will be no firm commitments made in these talks.”Monday’s meeting will be followed by discussions between Russia and NATO members on Wednesday and with a broader European audience on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hones-warnings-offers-to-russia-over-ukraine-101641691004405.html

On January 3, the country set a global record in daily tally with 1,080,211 cases.The Omicron variant, first discovered in South Africa in November 2021, is also driving a record surge in the number of hospitalisations in the United States.News agency Reuters reported on Saturday that hospitalisations have been steadily increasing since late December last year, and health officials have warned that the sheer number of cases caused by Omicron is placing a strain on hospitals.Many hospitals across the country are struggling to keep up with the influx of patients as their own workers are out sick.The rising number of Covid-19 patients also brings in burnout and extreme exhaustion for healthcare workers. Doctors and nurses are frustrated at the surge in the number of unvaccinated patients by saying that they are unable to understand why people ignore doctors' advice to get inoculated against Covid-19 but then seek help once infected, Reuters further reported.Authorities in the US, including President Joe Biden, have said that vaccination protects people from severe illness and death.“If you're unvaccinated, you're at a high risk of getting sick. And if you get sick you're likely to spread it to others, including friends and family. We should all be concerned about Omicron, but not panicked,” Biden said during an address from the White House on December 21 last year.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States administered over 518 million vaccine doses as of Saturday morning and nearly 640 million doses were distributed. The CDC's tally includes two-dose vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson's one-shot vaccine.(With Reuters inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-variant-driving-covid-surge-in-cases-hospitalisations-in-united-states-101641688266275.html
09-01-2022||World||Baby lost during evacuations at Kabul airport found, returned to family||An infant boy handed in desperation to a soldier across an airport wall in the chaos of the American evacuation of Afghanistan has been found and was reunited with his relatives in Kabul on Saturday.The baby, Sohail Ahmadi, was just two months old when he went missing on Aug. 19 as thousands of people rushed to leave Afghanistan as it fell to the Taliban.Following an exclusive Reuters story published in November with his pictures, the baby was located in Kabul where a 29-year-old taxi driver named Hamid Safi had found him in the airport and took him home to raise as his own.After more than seven weeks of negotiations and pleas, and ultimately a brief detention by Taliban police, Safi finally handed the child back to his jubilant grandfather and other relatives still in Kabul.They said they would now seek to have him reunited with his parents and siblings who were evacuated months ago to the United States.During the tumultuous Afghan evacuation over the summer, Mirza Ali Ahmadi - the boy's father who had worked as a security guard at the U.S. embassy - and his wife Suraya feared their son would get crushed in the crowd as they neared the airport gates en route to a flight to the United States.Ahmadi told Reuters in early November in his desperation that day, he handed Sohail over the airport wall to a uniformed soldier who he believed to be an American, fully expecting he would soon make it the remaining 5 meters (15 feet) to the entrance to reclaim him.Just at that moment, Taliban forces pushed the crowd back and it would be another half an hour before Ahmadi, his wife and their four other children were able to get inside.But by then the baby was nowhere to be found.Ahmadi said he searched desperately for his son inside the airport and was told by officials that he had likely been taken out of the country separately and could be reunited with them later.The rest of the family was evacuated - eventually ending up at a military base in Texas. For months they had no idea where their son was.The case highlights the plight of many parents separated from their children https://www.reuters.com/world/when-are-my-parents-coming-1300-afghan-children-evacuated-us-limbo-2021-11-10 during the hasty evacuation effort and withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country after a 20-year war.With no U.S. embassy in Afghanistan and international organizations overstretched, Afghan refugees have had trouble getting answers on the timing, or possibility, of complex reunifications like this one.The U.S. Department of Defense, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday.ALONE AT THE AIRPORTOn the same day Ahmadi and his family were separated from their baby, Safi had slipped through the Kabul airport gates after giving a ride to his brother's family who were also set to evacuate.Safi said he found Sohail alone and crying on the ground. After he said he unsuccessfully tried to locate the baby's parents inside, he decided to take the infant home to his wife and children. Safi has three daughters of his own and said his mother's greatest wish before she died was for him to have a son.In that moment he decided: "I am keeping this baby. If his family is found, I will give him to them. If not, I will raise him myself," he told Reuters in an interview in late November.Safi told Reuters that he took him to the doctor for a check-up after he was found and quickly incorporated the child into his family. They called the baby Mohammad Abed and posted pictures of all the children together on his Facebook page.After the Reuters story about the missing child came out, some of Safi's neighbors - who had noticed his return from the airport months earlier with a baby - recognized the photos and posted comments about his whereabouts on a translated version of the article.Ahmadi asked his relatives still in Afghanistan, including his father-in-law Mohammad Qasem Razawi, 67, who lives in the northeastern province of Badakhshan, to seek out Safi and ask him to return Sohail to the family.Razawi said he traveled two days and two nights to the capital bearing gifts - including a slaughtered sheep, several pounds of walnuts and clothing - for Safi and his family.But Safi refused to release Sohail, insisting he also wanted to be evacuated from Afghanistan with his family. Safi's brother, who was evacuated to California, said Safi and his family have no pending applications for U.S. entry.The baby's family sought help from the Red Cross, which has a stated mission to help reconnect people separated by international crises, but said they received little information from the organization. A spokesperson for the Red Cross said it does not comment on individual cases.Finally, after feeling they had run out of options, Razawi contacted the local Taliban police to report a kidnapping. Safi told Reuters he denied the allegations to the police and said he was caring for the baby, not kidnapping him.The complaint was investigated and dismissed and the local police commander told Reuters he helped arrange a settlement, which included an agreement signed with thumbprints by both sides. Razawi said the baby's family in the end agreed to compensate Safi around 100,000 Afghani ($950) for expenses incurred looking after him for five months."The grandfather of the baby complained to us and we found Hamid and based on the evidence we had, we recognized the baby," said Hamid Malang, the chief area controller of the local police station. "With both sides in agreement, the baby will be handed over to his grandfather," he said on Saturday.In the presence of the police, and amid lots of tears, the baby was finally returned to his relatives.Razawi said Safi and his family were devastated to lose Sohail. "Hamid and his wife were crying, I cried too, but assured them that you both are young, Allah will give you male child. Not one, but several. I thanked both of them for saving the child from the airport," Razawi said.The baby's parents told Reuters they were overjoyed as they were able to see with their own eyes the reunion over video chat.    "There are celebrations, dance, singing," said Razawi. "It is just like a wedding indeed."Now Ahmadi and his wife and other children, who in early December were able to move off the military base and resettle in an apartment in Michigan, hope Sohail will soon be brought to the United States."We need to get the baby back to his mother and father. This is my only responsibility," his grandfather said. "My wish is that he should return to them." (Reporting by Mica Rosenberg in New York, Jonathan Landay in Washington and James Mackenzie in Kabul; Editing by Kieran Murray and Daniel Wallis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/baby-lost-during-evacuations-at-kabul-airport-found-returned-to-family-101641684109978.html
09-01-2022||World||At least 22 die in cars trapped by snowstorm||At least 22 people, including 10 children, died in a popular mountain resort town in Pakistan after being stuck in their vehicles overnight during a heavy snowstorm as temperatures plummeted, officials said Son aturday.Most of the victims died of hypothermia, officials said. Among them was an Islamabad police officer and seven other members of his family, fellow police officer Atiq Ahmed said.More than 4 feet (1m) of snow fell in the area of the Murree Hills resort overnight on Friday and early Saturday, trapping thousands of cars on roadways, said interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed.The snow was so severe that heavy equipment brought in to clear it initially got stuck during the night, said Umar Maqbool, assistant commissioner for the town of Murree. Temperatures fell to minus 8 degrees Celsius.Officials called in paramilitary troops and a special military mountain unit to help. By late on Saturday, thousands of vehicles had been pulled from the snow but more than a thousand were still stuck, Ahmed said.Most roads leading to the area’s resorts were largely cleared of snow by late on Saturday, and military troops were working to clear the rest, Maqbool said. The military also converted army-run schools into relief camps where they provided shelter and food for the tourists who had been rescued.Emergency officials distributed food and blankets to people while they were trapped in their snowed-in vehicles, but many died of hypothermia.Others may have died from carbon monoxide poisoning after running their car heaters for long periods of time, said rescue services physician Abdur Rehman. As of late Saturday, the death toll included 10 men, 10 children and two women, Rehman said.In one instance, a husband and wife and their two children all died in their car. In another, four young friends died together, he said. Located 46km north of the capital of Islamabad, Murree is a popular winter resort town that attracts well over a million tourists annually. Streets leading into the town are often blocked by snow in winter.Authorities warned last weekend that too many vehicles were trying to enter Murree, but that failed to discourage hordes of daytrippers from the capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-22-die-in-cars-trapped-by-snowstorm-101641685069949.html
09-01-2022||World||Colombian man dies publicly under new euthanasia policy||Victor Escobar decided to die and to do so publicly, becoming one of the first Latin Americans to end their life without suffering from a terminal disease, under a ground-breaking court ruling in Colombia.Hours before dying on Friday, 60 year old Escobar celebrated what he called victory in his two-year battle with a lung ailment that left him unable to breathe on his own."Little by little, it becomes everyone's turn. So I do not say goodbye but rather, see you soon. And little by little we will end up with God," Escobar, who is a practicing Catholic, said in a video sent to news organizations.He died in the city of Cali with doctors present, his lawyer said on Twitter.The last footage of him alive shows him smiling and surrounded by family. He was sedated and then given a lethal injection.Colombia depenalized assisted death in 1997, and in July 2021 a high court expanded this "right to dignified death" to those not suffering from a terminal illness.It is the first Latin American country to take the step and one of the few in the world, and did so despite being mostly Roman Catholic. The church categorically opposes euthanasia and assisted suicide."I was already feeling sick. I felt like my lungs did not obey me," Escobar told AFP in October as he waged the final chapter of his legal battle.Non terminalDiabetes and a cardiovascular ailment left him in a wheel chair and suffering from spasms that wracked his body.His family backed the idea of euthanasia.In Europe only Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg and Spain have legalized euthanasia.Colombia may have joined that list but access to the procedure is not always smooth.As of mid-2021 patients like Escobar -- with chronic diseases and a life expectancy of more than six months -- could not undergo euthanasia."They were being forced to live in undignified conditions against their will," said Monica Giraldo of an NGO called the Foundation for the Right to Dignified Death.She said that since the court ruling on euthanasia, three people with non-terminal diseases used it to end their lives but Escobar is the first to do so with cameras rolling so the public could witness it."I want my story to be known because it creates a path for patients like me, patients with degenerative conditions, to have an open door to seek rest," Escobar said.Escobar has said he got ill from years of working with exposure to asbestos, an insulating material now known to cause cancer.Permission to dieIn October of last year a panel at the Imbanaco clinic rejected Escobar's request for euthanasia, after two years of earlier petitions that were also rejected.The committee argued that Escobar was not terminal and there were still ways to try to alleviate his suffering.Days earlier in another city, Medellin, 51 year old Martha Sepulveda, suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also saw her request to die cancelled at the last minute on grounds that she was not terminal.Giraldo said hospitals sometimes deny euthanasia requests over "ideological positions" or scrap them at the last minute over legal concerns.But Escobar appealed in court and won. He chose to die on January 7 -- a Friday, so it would be easy for relatives to go to his funeral on the weekend, his lawyer said."I suffer from my diseases, and I suffer watching ny family suffer because of me," Escobar said in October, gasping for breath.The courts also granted permission for Sepulveda to die. Like Escobar she had gone public with her case.The government says at least 157 people have chosen euthanasia since the July 2021 legal change.Giraldo's foundation is now working with five people seeking assisted suicide, two of them with non terminal conditions.Shortly before dying, Escobar said God does not like to see people suffer."I do not think God will punish me for trying to stop suffering," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colombian-man-dies-publicly-under-new-euthanasia-policy-101641682283352.html
09-01-2022||World||US open to discuss with Russia exercises, missile deployments: Official||The United States and its allies are prepared to discuss with Russia in talks about Ukraine the possibility of each side restricting military exercises and missile deployments in the region, a senior U.S. administration official said on Saturday.With a crucial set of talks set to start on Monday in Geneva, the senior Biden administration official said the United States is not willing to discuss limits on U.S. troop deployments or the U.S. force posture in NATO countries in the region.The Geneva talks, to be followed by other sessions in Brussels and Vienna, are aimed at averting a crisis. Russian President Vladimir Putin has massed tens of thousands of troops along the border with Ukraine, generating fears of an invasion.Whether the United States and its European allies can make progress in the talks with Moscow is far from clear. Putin wants an end to NATO's eastward expansion and security guarantees, demands the United States says are unacceptable.But the senior U.S. official, briefing reporters ahead of the talks, said there are some areas that present an opportunity for common ground."Any discussion of those overlapping areas where we might be able to make progress would have to be reciprocal," the official said. "Both sides would need to make essentially the same commitment."Russia says it feels threatened by the prospect of the United States deploying offensive missile systems in Ukraine despite assurances from President Joe Biden to Putin that he has no intention of doing so."So this is one area where we may be able to reach an understanding if Russia is willing to make a reciprocal commitment," the official said.The United States is also willing to discuss imposing restrictions on military exercises in the region by both sides, the official said."We are willing to explore the possibility of reciprocal restrictions on the size and scope of such exercises, including both strategic bombers close to each other's territory and ground-based exercises as well," the official said.The official said Washington is open to a broader discussion on the deployment of missiles in the region, after the previous Trump administration withdrew from the 1987 U.S.-Russia Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019 based on accusations that Moscow was violating the accord.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-open-to-discuss-with-russia-exercises-missile-deployments-official-101641670510120.html
09-01-2022||India||225 central security forces companies to be deployed in UP for polls||New Delhi: The Centre has ordered deployment of 225 companies or around 25,000 personnel of central paramilitary forces in Uttar Pradesh for assembly elections, according to a home ministry communication issued on Sunday. Polling dates for the state were announced by the election commission (EC) on Saturday -- Voting will be held in seven phases between February 10 and March 7. “In pursuance of the recommendations of the ECI (Election Commission of India), it has been decided in the ministry to initially deploy 225 companies of CAPFs in Uttar Pradesh for area domination and confidence building measures to ensure peaceful conduct of assembly elections – 2022,” reads the MHA communication, seen by HT. People familiar with the development said initially 225 companies are being sent to the state, which is sensitive in terms of law-and-order situation during elections. More companies would be sent later depending on the ground situation and to assist Uttar Pradesh police, officials said. The election in Uttar Pradesh is the most complicated of the five states up for polls this year, with identity politics (religion and caste) likely to be the deciding factor. Officials cited above said the force deployment for other states -- Punjab, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand -- is also being finalised. The 225 companies being sent to UP will comprise of 70 companies of central reserve police force (CRPF), 66 companies of border security force, 39 companies of the sashastra seema dal (SSB), and 25 companies each of the central industrial security force (CISF) and indo-tibetan border police (ITBP). A company usually has 110 to 120 personnel each in different forces. They are being sent to the state in two phases – the first 150 companies will reach different districts by January 10 while 75 companies will be sent on January 20, according to the communication, reviewed by HT. The home ministry has asked the UP government to work out a detailed deployment plan in consultation with the respective forces and chief force coordinator for UP, who is an Inspector General rank officer of CRPF. The state government has also been asked to make arrangement for transportation, logistics and accommodation for the troops keeping Covid-19 safety also in mind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/225-central-security-forces-companies-to-be-deployed-in-up-for-polls-101641752423762.html
09-01-2022||India||‘Foreigner’ can register as citizen under CAA: HC||A man from Assam’s Karimganj district, who was declared an illegal migrant by a tribunal, can register as an Indian citizen because he is a Hindu, the Gauhati High Court said in a directive.Bablu Paul, a resident of Patharkandi area of Karimganj district, was declared an illegal migrant by the district’s foreigners tribunal in 2017, as he allegedly entered Assam after March 25, 1971, the cut-off date under the Assam Accord to declare migrants as foreigners.Paul told the court that his grandfather came to West Bengal from Bangladesh in 1964 when he was two years old, much before the 1971 cut-off. The court overruled the tribunal’s verdict.The central government in 2019 brought in the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), but the rules to implement the amendment that allows Indian citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis, Jains and Buddhists, but not Muslims, from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, are yet to be notified.Paul, who came to Assam in 1984, was an Indian citizen as he was a Hindu and thus eligible to register himself as an Indian citizen as per the CAA, justices N Kotiswar Singh and Malasri Nandi said.The court said Paul entered India with his father and grandfather Chintaharan Paul in September 1964 from the then East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. They were given refugee status by the government of India, as was evident from a certificate issued by the West Bengal government to members of the minority community in East Pakistan desiring to stay in India.His grandfather’s name was found in the electoral list of West Bengal of 1966, and his father bought land in Kolkata in 1976, which shows they were considered Indian citizens, the court said. Paul came to Patharkandi in 1984 and settled after starting a jewellery business.The tribunal’s order declaring Paul as illegal immigrant as he entered Assam after 1984 was valid under section 6A(2) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, which defines the cut-off date for granting citizenship to migrants in Assam, the court said. “Under Section 6A(2) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, a person entering India before 01.01.1966 can be deemed to be a citizen provided he enters Assam from the specified territory (East Pakistan/Bangladesh) and he has been ordinarily residing in Assam after the date of entry,” it said.Persons who entered India and Assam between January 1, 1966, and March 25,1971, can get the benefit of citizenship if they register themselves before the competent registering authority, the court said. Those who entered after the 1971 cut-off date will be declared as foreigners, it said.“Since Bablu Paul had been staying in India for more than seven decades, having entered in 1964, in our view, he will be entitled to be considered for grant of citizenship by registration under the Citizenship Act, 1955,” the court said.It was not clear how Paul will get Indian citizenship even if the court has allowed him to apply, according to Saumen Choudhury, a Silchar-based lawyer.“The central government is yet to frame the guidelines on how to implement CAA even two years after its passage in Parliament,” he said. “The honourable high court has given a crucial judgement in this case, but it won’t help the person till clear guidelines on CAA come.”If a person has a valid passport, residential permit and birth certificate of his parents, he is automatically an Indian citizen, another lawyer pointed out. “The court could have provided him relief under these clauses of the citizenship act instead of CAA,” he said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreigner-can-register-as-citizen-under-caa-hc-101641752364525.html

The exercise, involving the use of satellite and drone imagery, was completed in three years. While the land surveyed included 1.61 lakh acres in 62 notified cantonments, about 16.38 lakh acres was located outside cantonments and military stations. “Clear demarcation and boundary survey of defence lands and fixing of the boundaries is necessary for protection of the defence land, safeguarding of the title of the defence ministry, updating land records and maps, and prevention of encroachments,” the ministry said in a statement. The survey was kicked off in October 2018. Of the 16.38 lakh acres outside cantonments, a total of 18,000 acres land is either state hired or proposed for deletion from defence records on account of transfer to other government departments. “For the first time, drone imagery-based survey technology was used…Besides this, satellite imagery-based survey was done for the first time for many defence land pockets,” it said. The statement added that 3D modelling techniques for better visualisation of defence land in hills were introduced by using digital elevation model (DEM) in association with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). Use of modern technology ensured a speedy completion of the survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mod-concludes-survey-of-18-lakh-acres-land-using-satellite-drone-imagery-101641752303746.html
09-01-2022||India||NEET-PG counselling will start from Jan 12||Counselling for postgraduate medical courses to allocate seats to successful candidates for the 2021-22 academic session will begin on January 12, health minister Mansukh Mandaviya announced on Sunday.The Supreme Court on Friday allowed the Centre to go ahead with counselling for NEET-PG and undergraduate medical courses by upholding the government’s decision to introduce 27% quota for other backward classes within the all-India quota (AIQ) seats, and permitted 10% reservation for economically weaker sections among the general category to be applied based on the criteria laid down in January 2019. This came after months of protests by resident doctors across the nation against the delay in NEET-PG counselling.“As assured by the ministry of health to the resident doctors, following the order of the honourable Supreme Court, the NEET-PG counselling is being started by the Medical Counselling Committee from January 12, 2022. This will give more strength to the country in the fight against Corona. My best wishes to all the candidates,” Mandaviya said in a tweet in Hindi.Candidates will be allowed to indicate their course choices from January 13 and online registration for the first round of counselling can be done till January 17, the Medical Counselling Committee that conducts the allotment said soon after the minister’s announcement.The Supreme Court will review the criteria for EWS reservations laid down by a three-member committee headed by former finance secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, when petitions challenging the introduction of EWS quota in NEET-PG through a July 2021 circular are heard later in March.“The validity of 27% OBC quota is upheld in NEET-PG and NEET-UG courses in the AIQ seats,” a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna said, acknowledging the urgency of the matter.On July 29, the Centre had introduced 27% OBC quota and 10% EWS quota in 15% AIQ seats in NEET-UG and 50% AIQ seats in NEET-PG.The exam was held on September 11 after being rescheduled twice in January and April. The results were declared in the last week of September, following which students for nearly 43,000 postgraduate seats had been waiting for counselling to begin.Due to the delay in counselling, protests were held by resident doctors, who stopped emergency services in their hospitals in Delhi for a few days last month to demand that counselling be expedited.The 14-day strike ended last Friday after an assurance was given by the Union health ministry to announce the counselling schedule as soon as the apex court issued directions.The Federation of Resident Doctors Association welcomed the news. “Thankful to Hon’ble @mansukhmandviya Sir for declaring the date of #NEETPGCounselling2021 @PMOIndia @MoHFW_INDIA…,” it tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/neetpg-counselling-will-start-from-jan-12-101641752304308.html
09-01-2022||India||Creator of original hate app circulated its code||A man who allegedly created the first GitHub webpage where doctored photographs of Muslim women were uploaded back in July 2021 to “auction” them has been arrested, the Delhi Police said on Sunday.Identifying the person as Aumkareshwar Thakur, 26, the police said he was arrested from his house in Newyork City Township Indore on Saturday evening. This is the first arrest made in the “Sulli Deals” case, the police said. The development came after recent arrests in a similar case.The Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations (IFSO) unit of the Delhi Police’s special cell said Thakur’s arrest came after receiving information about him from “Bulli Bai” case mastermind Neeraj Bishnoi during investigation. Bishnoi has been arrested for creating webpages targeting Muslim women after such portals first surfaced in July 2021 under “Sulli Deals”.Thakur was a member of a group on Twitter where the plan to defame Muslim women was discussed, according to deputy commissioner of police KPS Malhotra, head of Delhi’s cybercrimes cell. Thakur has a bachelor’s degree in computer application from IPS Academy in Indore and works as a freelance web developer.“He had developed the code on GitHub and its access was with all the members of the group. He had shared the app on his Twitter account. The photos of the Muslim women were uploaded by the group members,” Malhotra said.“He had joined a group on Twitter by the name of Tradmahasabha in January 2020 using the Twitter handle @gangescion. During group discussions, the members had discussed about trolling Muslim women. He had developed the app on GitHub. After the uproar over the first app, he had deleted all his social media footprints,” Malhotra added.Thakur was arrested three days after police arrested Bishnoi, 21, a resident of Jorhat in Assam, on Wednesday night. The police on Saturday morning said Bishnoi, a second-year B Tech student, was part of a group involved in making the first webpage.In the 24 hours before he was arrested on Wednesday night, Bishnoi posted tweets through his Twitter handle, claiming that he knew the makers of the first GitHub webpage under the name “Sulli Deals” and that he had “cloned the repository” and “edited the code as well the graphics” to build the second such platform, “Bulli Bai”.Malhotra confirmed that it was Bishnoi’s interrogation that led the police to Thakur.“Bishnoi used to interact with various virtual identities on social media and engaged in group discussions. In July 2021, in one of the groups, of which Bishnoi was member, the other group member shared the details of the first GitHub app,” he said. “That was the first time Bishnoi had heard about this app. The said Twitter handle was backtracked and it was learnt that after uproar over first app, the said Twitter handle and other digital footprints were erased from various social media platforms.”“Bishnoi also said that the Twitter handle belongs to a person who stays in Indore,” Malhotra said. “Based on backtrack analysis and archive data, one Twitter handle in the name of Aumkar Thakur was identified, and our team arrested him from Indore on Saturday.”Another official said that there were 13 to 14 members of the Twitter group when the first app was planned. “Bishnoi and Thakur had not met in person till then. They had spoken to each other over video call once or twice. They downloaded photographs on the group. Thakur then used it to building the first app,” the officer said requesting anonymity.During interrogation on Sunday, Bishnoi told the police that he wanted to frame a person from his rival camp on social media as the creator of the first app. Before his arrest, Bishnoi, through his Twitter handle @giyo44, claimed that a person named Javed Alam was behind the first app, officials said.“Bishnoi wanted to frame Alam. He said Alam is from a rival group on Twitter. He was even planting the codes of the app on a Twitter ID in the name of Javed Alam. His plan was to get Alam arrested in the first case,” the officials said.In Indore, Thakur’s family refused to believe the police’s theory and news reports. “My son told me over the phone that he has not done anything wrong,” his father Akhilesh Thakur said. “Some accused took his name and he is being implicated wrongly.”Originally from Darbhanga in Bihar, the family shifted to Indore 32 years ago.“My brother completed his Bachelor of Computer Application in 2017-18 from a private college in Indore. He was not active on any social media platform for the past more than a year. He was busy with his IT projects. He was earning well for the past four years,” Thakur’s brother Mandaleshwar said. “He never did anything wrong. He is being implicated in a false case.”Even as Thakur’s family denied wrongdoing, police officers who questioned him said that the man had a different personality in the virtual world.Thakur identified himself as “trad” on Twitter and was in a Twitter group, said an investigating officer, who asked not to be named. “Trads” have a self-created philosophy of ensuring that the world does not change, the officer said.“Even Bishnoi claimed to be a trad on Twitter, which means he is a traditional. In fact, Bishnoi in his Twitter posts had also said that the three suspects arrested by Mumbai police in the second app case were innocent as they were not trads like him,” the officer said. “Thakur identified himself as a trad and had joined the Tradmahasabha group in 2020. We have recovered his electronic device and are trying to trace its contents.”The police are now trying to trace other members of the group, who uploaded the photographs or were part of the Tradmahasabha in 2020.The two controversial webpages on GitHub in July 2021 and January 2022 sparked outrage, after which the Delhi Police registered a case.

09-01-2022||India||PM security breach: Supreme Court to hear matter today||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Monday a plea on the recent breach in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security in Punjab.On January, the prime minister’s convoy was stranded on a flyover due to a blockade by protesters in Ferozepur after which he returned from poll-bound Punjab without attending the planned events, including a rally.A three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli is likely to take up the plea filed by an organisation, Lawyers Voice.The apex court on Friday had directed the Registrar General of the Punjab and Haryana High Court to “secure and preserve” the records pertaining to arrangements made for the prime minister’s visit to Punjab when there was a “massive security breach”.It had also said the inquiry committees set up separately by the state and central governments will hold their horses and not proceed with their respective inquiries till January 10 when the matter will be taken up again by the court. The bench, however, did not dictate it as part of the order, and had asked the counsels to convey its feelings to the authorities.The Registrar General of the High Court will be assisted by the Director General of Police, the Union Territory of Chandigarh, and an officer of the National Investigation Agency not below the rank of Inspector General in securing the requisite records from the state government, its police and central agencies, the bench had said.The plea has sought a thorough investigation into the breach in Prime Minister Modi’s security in Punjab to ensure there is no such event in the future.It has also sought preservation of evidence on security arrangements, court-monitored probe and action against erring officials of the Punjab government responsible for the alleged lapse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmsecurity-breach-supreme-court-to-hear-matter-today-101641752124202.html
09-01-2022||India||Centre surveys 18 lakh acres of defence land using drones, satellites||The defence ministry on Sunday announced that it has concluded a survey of almost 18 lakh acres of defence land scattered across 4,900 pockets across the country for effective land use and planning, and preventing encroachments in what is being dubbed as one of the biggest such surveys in India. The exercise, involving the use of satellite and drone imagery, was completed in three years. While the land surveyed included 1.61 lakh acres in 62 notified cantonments, about 16.38 lakh acres was located outside cantonments and military stations. “Clear demarcation and boundary survey of defence lands and fixing of the boundaries is necessary for protection of the defence land, safeguarding of the title of the defence ministry, updating land records and maps, and prevention of encroachments,” the ministry said in a statement. The survey was kicked off in October 2018. Of the 16.38 lakh acres outside cantonments, a total of 18,000 acres is either state hired or proposed for deletion from defence records on account of transfer to other government departments. “For the first time, drone imagery-based survey technology was used…Besides this, satellite imagery-based survey was done for the first time for many defence land pockets,” it said. The statement added that 3D modelling techniques for better visualisation of defence land in hills were introduced by using digital elevation model (DEM) in association with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). Use of modern technology ensured a speedy completion of the survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-surveys-18-lakh-acres-of-defence-land-using-drones-satellites-101641751943845.html
09-01-2022||India||Mark Dec 26 as ‘Veer Baal diwas’ to pay tribute to Guru Gobind Singh’s sons: PM||December 26 will be celebrated as Veer Baal Diwas from 2022 as a tribute to the bravery and martyrdom of Guru Gobind Singh’s sons, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Sunday on the occasion of the 365th birth anniversary of the 10th Sikh guru. “Today, on the auspicious occasion of the Parkash Purab of Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji, I am honoured to share that starting this year, 26th December shall be marked as ‘Veer Baal Diwas.’ This is a fitting tribute to the courage of the Sahibzades and their quest for justice,” Modi tweeted.The sahibzades, as the four sons of Guru Govind Singh are called, preferred death instead of renouncing their faith, the Prime Minister said. “The bravery and ideals of Mata Gujri, Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji and the 4 Sahibzades give strength to millions of people. They never bowed to injustice. They envisioned a world that is inclusive and harmonious. It is the need of the hour for more people to know about them,” he said in another tweet.“‘Veer Baal Diwas will be on the same day Sahibzada Zorawar Singh Ji and Sahibzada Fateh Singh Ji attained martyrdom after being sealed alive in a wall. These two greats preferred death instead of deviating from the noble principles of Dharma,” Modi said in another tweet.In 2018, BJP parliamentarian from West Delhi Parvesh Sahib Singh, along with 133 MPs, submitted a memorandum to Modi, requesting that Children’s Day should be celebrated in the name of the sahibzades on December 26.Children’s Day in India is observed on November 14, former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s birthday. “The day (Children’s Day) is about the children and their well-being. Thus, it is important to look into India’s rich past and find stories of those children who braved the most difficult circumstances and made history,” the 2018 memorandum said. “26th December, when Chhote Sahibzades were martyred, should be celebrated as Children’s Day in India.” Welcoming Modi’s announcement on Sunday, Singh tweeted along with photographs of the letter. “This is the letter to Prime Minister in 2018 which I along with over 100 MPs had signed asking that December 26 should be celebrated as Children’s Day remembering Sahibzades. @narendramodi ji thank you. I can’t describe how happy I’m today.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mark-dec-26-as-veer-baal-diwas-to-pay-tribute-to-guru-gobind-singh-s-sons-pm-101641751823809.html
09-01-2022||India||IAC Vikrant sets sail for critical sea trials||India’s first indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC) Vikrant, the largest warship to be built in the country, on Sunday set sail for crucial sea trials ahead of its scheduled induction into the navy this year, officials familiar with the matter said. The latest trials are the third set of trials since August 2021. “While the maiden sea trials in August last year were to establish propulsion, navigational suite and basic operations, the second sea trials in October-November witnessed the ship being put through its paces in terms of various machinery trials and flight trials,” the navy said in a statement. President Ram Nath Kovind visited the carrier in Kochi on December 22 followed by a visit by Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on January 2. Designed by the Indian Navy’s Directorate of Naval Design (DND), Vikrant has been built at the state-owned Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL). The warship, with a displacement of 37,500 tonnes, will operate MiG-29K fighter jets, Kamov-31 helicopters, MH-60R multi-role helicopters and the indigenous advanced light helicopters. It has been named after aircraft carrier INS Vikrant operated by the Indian Navy from 1961 to 1997. “Having gained adequate confidence in the ship’s abilities (during the first two trials), IAC now sails to undertake complex manoeuvres to establish specific readings of how the ship performs in various conditions,” the navy added. Vikrant has put India in a select league --- only the US, the UK, Russia, France and China have the capability to build aircraft carriers. India currently operates a solitary aircraft carrier, INS Vikramaditya, bought second-hand from Russia for $2.33 billion. In contrast, China operates two aircraft carriers — CV-16 Liaoning and CV-17 Shandong. It is building a third carrier as it expands its footprint in the Indian Ocean Region. Vikrant has an indigenous content of 76%. The construction of the aircraft carrier began in 2009. IAC is 262 metres long, has a beam of 62 metres and a height of 59 metres. It has 14 decks, including five in the superstructure, 2,300 compartments, can accommodate a crew of 1,700, including specialised cabins for women officers. Vikrant will be the fourth aircraft carrier to be operated by the Indian Navy --- first Vikrant (British origin) from 1961 to 1997, INS Viraat (British origin) from 1987 to 2016 and INS Vikramaditya (Russian origin) 2013 onwards.
09-01-2022||India||Weeks ahead of Budget, nearly 400 Parliament staffers test Covid positive||With less than three weeks left for the Budget session, nearly 400 staffers at Parliament have tested positive for Covid-19, prompting Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to review the situation and direct officials to reimpose restrictions on employees’ attendance.“Six five officers of Rajya Sabha Secretariat, 200 of Lok Sabha Secretariat and 133 of the allied services have tested positive for Covid-19 between January 4 and 8. Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu will review the situation every week,” a Rajya Sabha official said on condition of anonymity.In view of the cases, both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have sent one-third of its staffers to work from home, officials familiar with the matter said. The two Houses have also directed 50% of its officials and staff below the rank of under secretary/executive officer to work from home till the end of January. Besides, the Lower House has pulled a dozen officers from other branches, such as conference or vigilance branches, to join the welfare wing and tackle Covid-related exigencies. “RS Chairman shri M.Venkaiah Naidu has reviewed the situation with Secretary General PC Modi and Advisor Dr PPK Ramacharyulu and directed that necessary measures be taken to contain the spread of virus among the secretariat officials and staff ahead of the Budget session which is to begin towards the end of this month,” a senior Rajya Sabha official said, seeking anonymity. Another senior official told HT that preparations for the upcoming Union budget session, slated to begin from January 31, will take into account that a significant section of officials would not be physically present in the House. “A major part of the work during the Budget session will have to be done online. We have already established an online system for Members of Parliament to function and it would be fully used during the session,” the official said, seeking anonymity.A third senior official maintained that both Houses might revert to the scattered seating arrangement with some Members of Parliament being shifted to the public galleries of the House.A Lok Sabha internal circular, accessed by HT, directed officers visiting Parliament to maintain a staggered working schedule to avoid crowding. “The working hours of all employees who attend office may be staggered between 10 am to 10.30 am with corresponding office exit timings to avoid rush in commuting as also in lifts and corridors,” it said. Officers above the level of under secretary have been asked to avoid coming to Parliament on their off days. Disabled people and pregnant women are exempted from physically attending office and all internal meetings will be conducted online, the circular said.“The latest wave of Covid, fuelled by Omicron, would be major restrictions in place for entry of visitors, journalists and even officials during the upcoming session that is scheduled to start on January 31,” a senior Parliamentary official told HT. 
09-01-2022||India||Focus on Covid testing, genome sequencing to fight evolving virus: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked key officials to accelerate vaccination for adolescents and booster dose for health and front line workers in a mission mode, and emphasized on “continuous scientific research in testing, vaccines and pharmacological interventions including genome sequencing” to tackle the evolving virus in a high-level meeting on Sunday. The Prime Minister also wanted hospitals formulate advance strategies to keep operating, keeping in mind unavailability of a large section of the medical staff, including doctors and nurses, in case they are affected during the surge, according to an official present in the meeting. Modi suggested more use of technology such as telemedicine to handle non-Covid health issues as these patients tend of get impacted whenever there is a surge, the official said. “He also told officials that when we review the situation with the states, they must be told that their decisions should be based on evidence and real-time data,” the official said on condition of anonymity. the Prime Minister also said that effective usage of masks and physical distancing measures must be “a new normal” to control the spread. It was Modi’s fourth review meeting on the Covid-19 situation since November last year. Attended by home minister Amit Shah, health Mansukh Mandaviya, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba, Niti Ayog’s health member VK Paul and other officials, the meeting saw two presentations by Paul and health secretary Rajesh Bhushan. While Paul highlighted international experience in Omicron driven surges, Bhushan focused on comparing the Covid situation globally and India, states which are of concern, preparedness in testing, hospital beds, and buffer stocks of drugs and vaccines. The presentation showed that 31% adolescents aged 15-18 years have been administered with the first dose in 7 days. “PM noted this achievement and urged to further accelerate the vaccine drive for adolescents in mission mode,” an official press release said. He also asked officials to ensure that booster vaccination coverage for health and front line workers are also taken up in a mission mode, the release added. The marathon meeting lasted more than two hours. After detailed discussion, Modi demanded that “intensive containment and active surveillance should continue in clusters reporting higher cases and required technical support be provided to states which are reporting higher cases presently,” while reiterating effective usage of masks and physical distancing measures as a new normal to control the spread. The Prime Minister further emphasized “the need for effective implementation of home Isolation for mild/asymptomatic cases and to disseminate the factual information to the community at large,” the press release said. The meeting also discussed adequate health infrastructure at the district level and close coordination with the states, with the Prime Minister suggesting that a meeting with chief ministers be convened to discuss state-specific scenarios, best practices and the public health response. “The support to the States to upgrade health infrastructure, testing capacity, availability of oxygen & ICU beds, and buffer stock of covid essential drugs under Emergency Covid Response Package (ECRP-II) was presented. PM stressed on the need to ensure adequate health infrastructure at the district level. He asked officials to maintain co-ordination regarding this with the states,” the press release said. 
09-01-2022||India||Transport ministry funding may cross ₹1.5 lakh crore||The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) is once again likely to get a record high allocation in the upcoming Union budget, with the proposed capital outlay likely to cross the ₹1.5 lakh crore mark, officials familiar with the proposal said on Thursday. This would be the highest ever allocation for the ministry so far.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Budget for the financial year 2022-23 on February 1.In the financial year 2021-22, the capital outlay for MoRTH was ₹1.18 lakh crore. In the fiscal year 2022-23, the outlay is likely to be ₹1.8 lakh crore, crossing the ₹1.5 lakh crore mark for the first time ever, officials privy to the development said.The development comes amid work progressing on the central government’s ambitious umbrella highway development scheme - Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase-I. The integrated project includes construction of about 26,000km length of economic corridors, the Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) and North-South and East-West (NS-EW) aimed to ease movement of freight traffic in the country.“A number of greenfield expressways and other road projects are also being planned in the poll-bound states such as Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and so on. So, these projects in these states are also likely to be mentioned in the Union budget this year. Uttar Pradesh alone, for example, will have about seven greenfield expressways. In Punjab, the 669-km long Delhi-Amritsar-Katra expressway will be constructed at a cost of ₹39,500 crore,” said a ministry official on condition of anonymity.The increase in budget allocation for the ministry is also significant because the Centre plans to execute infrastructure projects worth ₹7 lakh crore over the next 2-3 years. “Almost 8,400km greenfield expressways are being built as part of the Bharatmala Pariyojana initiative... So far, projects comprising a length of 19,265 kms have been awarded at a cost of Rs. 5,60,216 crore. Of which, about 6,750 km has been completed,” said a second official on condition of anonymity.As per ministry data, about 4,076 man-days or about 15.5 man-years of employment is required for construction of one kilometer of national highway. This means it would take about 14.2 crore man-days or 5.37 lakh man- years of employment for implementation of Bharatmala Pariyojana.Records showed that since 2014, the capital expenditure of MoRTH has steadily increased compared to the revenue expenditure. It means more money is being spent on infrastructure (roads and highways) than on administrative expenses.Accordingly, the total length of national highways in the country has increased from about 91,287 km to about 1,40,937 km since April, 2014 till date, data showed.
09-01-2022||India||HT This Day: Jan 10, 1980 - Cong-I gets two-thirds majority||New Delhi- After a three-day massacre of electoral opponents and winning seats at a galloping rate the Congress-I today achieved a two-thirds majority in the Lok Sabha the effective strength of which now.is 525. With the capturing of the Saharsa seat in Bihar, the Congress has bagged 351 seats. Election in 17 parliamentary constituencies in Assam, Meghalaya, West Bengal, Orissa Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir will take place later to complete polling for the 542 member Lok Sabha.The Congress-I's electoral success is as stunning as was its drubbing in the 1977 elections. Three years ago, the party had virtually been wiped out from the Hindi-speaking states where it could win only two seats improved on its sound position in the South as was seen in Sin 177, but was triumphed in the Hindi States also with a tally of 141 seats.If voting analysis on the basis of half the results is any guide the Janata Party and the Lok Dal enabled the Congress-I to romp home by separating themselves from each other. In 1977, the two of them contested as one party and had prevented a split in the anti-Congress vote. The analysis indicates that the Congress-I polled 41.67 per cent of -the votes while the Janata and the Lok Dal together secured 46.64 per cent.This would seem to be corroborated by the election results from West Bengal. Although the Congress-I candidates polled handsome votes and was a close second to Left Front candidates almost everywhere, it could win only 4 of- the 41 seats. The CPI-M and its allies were able to mop up 37 seats by avoiding a split in the Left vote.Among the stalwarts who were returned today were Janata Party president Chandra Shekhar, Union Education Minister Karan Singh (Congress-U), Mr Ashok Sen, former Law Minister (Congress-I), former Haryana Chief Minister Devi Lal (Lok Dal), Mr Dharambir Sinha, former Union Deputy Minister for Information and Broadcasting (Congress), Mrs Ram Dulari Sinha, former Labour Minister of Bihar, Jharkhand leader N. E. Horo, and former Lok Sabha Speaker Baliram Bharat (Congress). Notable among those who were defeated were: External Affairs minister Shyam Nandan Mishra and Mrs Rashida Haque Choudhury (Congress), Union Minister of State for Education and Social welfare. On the basis of the results declared so far, it appears that none of the Opposition parties can stake elect claim to the status of a recognised Opposition party. The Lok Dal has emerged as the largest Opposition party with 41 seats. However, it is 12 short of the requisite number of 53 seats for recognition as the Opposition party in a House of 525. Interestingly enough the Left Front can possibly summon the requisite strength for recognition as the Opposition group. The left front has won nine seats from Kerala (CPM 6, CPI 2, Kerala Congress-Mani group 1) and 35 from West Bengal (CPI 25, RSP 4. Forward Bloc 3, CPI 3). The Left Front may win three more seats from West Bengal whose results are yet to be announced. The Left Front seats from Kerala and West Bengal on this basis total 47. To this, one should add four seats from Bihar and one seat from UP which the CPI has won. In addition the Left Front is assured of the support of two more seats from Bihar (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and Marxists Co-ordination Committee-one each). The Left Front total in the House thus comes to 54 seats. The Speaker is the final authority to decide the status of a recognised opposition party. It is yet ' to be seen whether the Front, which has contested the elections in alliance with its partners, will get this status. The leftist parties have indeed considerably improved their position. The Left Front had only 42 seats in the dissolved Lok Sabha - CPI-M 22 (17 from West Bengal), CPI eight, RSP four, Forward Bloc three, PWP (Maharashtra) four and CPI-ML one. TThe PWP is the only left party which has failed to win a single seat||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-jan-10-1980-cong-i-gets-two-thirds-majority-101641750140310.html
09-01-2022||India||Will help India ship humanitarian aid to Afghanistan: Iran||Iran has said it will cooperate with India in shipping humanitarian assistance, including wheat and medicines, to Afghanistan, even as foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian stressed the need for an inclusive government in Kabul.The offer of cooperation – made by Abdollahian during a phone conversation with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on Saturday – assumes significance in view of hurdles created by Pakistan for shipping 50,000 tonnes of wheat offered by the Indian side.The Indian government sent 500,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines to Afghanistan via Tehran on January 1 since there are currently no direct flights between India and Afghanistan.The situation in Afghanistan was a key part of the discussion between Abdollahian and Jaishankar, who reviewed a range of bilateral, regional and international issues. The use of Iran’s Chabahar port, where India operates a key terminal, also figured in the conversation.“A wide-ranging conversation with my Iranian colleague, FM @Amirabdolahian. Discussed the difficulties of Covid, challenges in Afghanistan, prospects of Chabahar and complexities of the Iranian nuclear issue,” Jaishankar said in a tweet.Abdollahian “referred to India’s humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, announcing measures and cooperation by the Islamic Republic of Iran to transfer this aid in the form of wheat, medicine and Covid vaccine to the country”, Iran’s foreign ministry said in a statement.He also “stressed the need to form an inclusive government” in Afghanistan. On January 7, India supplied two tonnes of life-saving medicines to Afghanistan, the third tranche of aid since last month, against the backdrop of a dire humanitarian situation exacerbated by a harsh winter. These medicines were routed through Dubai.The Indian government had sent 1.6 tonnes of life-saving medicines on a special charter flight between New Delhi and Kabul on December 11. All the medicines and vaccines were handed over to the World Health Organization (WHO) for use at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health in Kabul.The Taliban regime, which is not recognised by New Delhi, has welcomed Indian assistance. However, India’s offer to provide 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan via Pakistani land routes has been held up because of conditions attached by Islamabad. The offer was made in October, and Pakistan said last month it would allow wheat and medicines to be shipped via the Wagah land border crossing in Afghan trucks, but is yet to firm up modalities.Jaishankar and Abdollahian also discussed the Covid-19 response of India and Iran. Abdollahian referred to the “good trend” of vaccination in Iran and said, “We have been able to properly contain the virus, and so far 89% of people have been vaccinated and are receiving a third dose of vaccine.”Referring to the talks in Vienna on Iran’s nuclear programme, Abdollahian said the discussions are going in the “right direction”. He added: “We have the necessary will to reach a good agreement in good faith, and if the Western side also has this goodwill and determination, we can reach a good agreement.”Jaishankar said Abdollahian’s forthcoming visit to India would be a “very good opportunity to develop bilateral cooperation”, according to the Iranian foreign ministry’s statement.
09-01-2022||India||Bengal: Family of 3 kills self, streams it live on Facebook||An elderly couple and their son allegedly died by suicide in the Bakkhali area of South 24 Parganas district on Sunday and streamed the incident live on the Facebook page of the young man, police said. The family lived in the district’s Kulpi area. The couple and their son left home early on Sunday and went to a desolate place in the coastal village of Bakkhali where the incident then took place, police officers involved in the probe said. “The bodies have been sent for postmortem examination. We have started an investigation,” Bhaskar Mukherjee, superintendent of Sunderbans police district, told the media. The incident happened hours after the couple’s daughter, who was missing till Sunday evening, was accused of defalcating funds to the tune of ₹3 lakh by members of a self-help group for women, relatives of the family, told the police. The couple’s daughter, who is a member of the group, was allegedly accused by several women from the Sultannagar area of stealing the money they raised and then gave to her as a corpus fund. “A large number of these women stormed the family’s home at Kulpi on Saturday night. It is alleged that they assaulted the couple’s daughter who pleaded innocence. The family filed a complaint at Kulpi police station later in the night. Five of these women are being questioned,” a district police officer said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-family-of-3-kills-self-streams-it-live-on-facebook-101641749903657.html
09-01-2022||India||Changes to forest conservation act delayed after new objections||A proposal to redefine India’s forests is back to the drawing board as the tribal affairs ministry and several states raised concerns that the proposed modifications are not in sync with the law that protects the rights of forest dwellers. The environment ministry had put out a consultation paper on amending the Forest Conservation Act of 1980 on October 2 for public comments. It received over 5,000 comments from individuals, state governments and experts, according to officials familiar with the matter.One of the main objectives of the amendment was to clarify the scope of application of the act. Until December 1996, provisions of the Forest Conservation Act only applied to forests notified under the Indian Forest Act of 1927 or any other local law, and to those managed by the forest department. But a 1996 Supreme Court judgement ordered that all areas that conformed to the dictionary meaning of forest were to be also considered as forests.“Identification of such land is subjective and arbitrary to some extent. This leads to ambiguity and has been observed to have resulted into a lot of resentment and resistance, particularly from private individuals and organisations. Considering any private area as forest would restrict the right of an individual to use his/her own land for any non-forestry activity,” the ministry had said in the consultation paper. But a major concern raised by state governments and the tribal affairs ministry was whether application of the Forest Rights Act of 2006 will be affected based on changes brought in to the scope of forests law due to the modifications.“The Forest Rights Act and the Forest Conservation Act are two different legislations. The Forest Rights Act is very clear that no member of a forest dwelling scheduled tribe or other traditional forest dwellers shall be evicted or removed from the forest land under his occupation till the recognition and verification procedure is complete,” an official of the tribal affairs said on condition of anonymity. “So that is our position, which has been communicated to the environment ministry.” The forest rights law defines forest land as any land falling within any forest area. It includes unclassified forests, non-demarcated forests, existing or deemed forests, protected forests, reserved forests, sanctuaries and national parks.“It completely depends on the states as to where forest rights need to be recognised and whether that process of recognising forest rights is complete. We already held public consultations and over 5,000 comments have been received, which we have compiled,” an environment ministry official said, declining to be named. “But on certain issues like the reconciliation with FRA, more deliberations are needed.” The modifications also propose to raise private plantations on forest land that can be harvested. One of India’s voluntary contributions under the Paris climate pact is to expand carbon sinks by an additional 2.5-3 billion tonnes through more forest and tree cover by 2030. To achieve it, extensive plantations are needed in all available land outside government forests, the paper said. “But to ensure this, there is a need to dispel the apprehension among tree growers that vegetation or tree plantation raised on their private/non-forest lands will attract the provisions of the (forest conservation) Act,” the paper stated.“The ministry’s tentative approach to amend the jurisdiction of the forest conservation act reflects the vexed history of how forest lands have come to be governed through centralized statutes and judicial decisions over the last five decades,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research, a think tank. “This law cannot be tweaked for selective unlocking of lands to encourage private plantations,” she said. “The lands under the regulatory definition of forests are of huge concern to both farmers and forest dwellers belonging to adivasi, Dalit and other forest-dependent communities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/changes-to-forest-conservation-act-delayed-after-new-objections-101641749843786.html
09-01-2022||India||'Surge should be straight up and down ': What India's current Covid figures tell | 10 points||A day before India begins administering the third dose of vaccines to the most vulnerable population of the country, a total of over 1.59 lakh infections were reported, which is the highest in 224 days. The tally and the steady surge of cases in Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, West Bengal indicate that what India is experiencing is a fresh surge that many states have declared as the third wave. How will this wave move? Studying global trends, experts said the surge is likely to be short-lived. The curve is likely to be small with a quick up and down, believe experts who have been warning people against the floating notion that Omicron will act as a natural vaccine. “Let’s all just get Omicron isn’t exactly the best idea. Best to avoid altogether. The surge should be quick, straight up and down. See it through with utmost precautions," Dr Arvinder Singh Soin said on Sunday.Here are the top 10 updates on India's Covid-19 situation:1. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday held a review meeting with the health officials and asked to ramp up vaccination of the youngsters between 15 and 18 years. Union health minister Dr Mansukh Mandaviya will hold a meeting of state/UT health ministers on Monday.2. Delhi on Sunday reported 22,751 fresh infections taking the positivity rate to an alarming 23%. Gurugram on Sunday reported 2,338 cases.Maharashtra reports 44,388 new Covid cases, 12 deaths; Omicron tally at 1,2163. The Delhi government on Sunday said there will be no lockdown in the Capital. "Rising Covid cases are a matter of concern but there is no need to panic. Very few people are getting hospitalised. Wearing a mask is very important. There will be no lockdown if you continue to wear the mask. There is no plan to impose a lockdown as of now," chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said. 4. Tamil Nadu on Sunday reported 12,895 Covid cases. Nearly 80-85% of the Covid cases in the state were of Omicron variant while the remaining 15-20 per cent was Delta variant, health minister Ma Subramanian said, giving the data of genome sequencing of the past few days.Vaccinate teens in mission mode, PM Modi tells officials; asks to convene meeting with CMs5. Karnataka on Sunday reported 12,000 fresh cases and 4 virus-related deaths, taking the tally to 30,51,958 and the fatalities toll to 38,370.6. West Bengal broke all previous records of the single-day surge and reported an all-time high of 24,287 fresh cases, the highest since the first wave of infections in 2020.7. The Himachal Pradesh government on Sunday banned social and religious functions till January 24. It also prohibited any gathering of more than 100 people for indoor and 300 people for outdoor academic, sport, cultural and political events, according to an order.8. Night curfew and other restrictions to avoid ‘unnecessary crowding’ will begin in Maharashtra from Monday. Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu were under partial restrictions on Sunday. 9. Omicron is now the dominant variant across the country, reports said. Till a few days ago, it was only in the western region of the country that the surge in Covid cases was due to Omicron, while in the northeastern states, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Odisha the Delta variant was predominant.

Accordingly, we have now started the bus operations on various routes,” said Ramakant Gaikwad, Pune divisional controller.For the last two months the MSRTC workers and their several unions are protesting for their various demands, a Kruti Samiti of the unions was formed earlier to have a conversation with the state government. But apparently, the main demand of merging the MSRTC into state government was compromised according to the workers, so now all the workers (apart from the union members) have spontaneously started the strike.While to support the state government the private tourist bus association came forward and gave their 2,000 buses across the state.But as these private tourist bus owners are charging high fares and passengers are suffering due to it, this decision to hire contract drivers was taken by the MSRTC.In the MSRTC Pune division, a total of 1,300 employees out of the 4,200 have resumed work. Whereas show cause notices to 69 workers have been sent and after three rounds of inquiry hearing, they would be dismissed from work if they don’t join back duty. The Pune division has suspended 488 workers out of which 66 workers have joined back. Still, the number is less to start back the bus operations in Pune division in full capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/msrtc-starts-process-to-hire-bus-drivers-on-contract-basis-101641749303898.html

09-01-2022||India||Iran to cooperate with India in shipping wheat, medicines to Afghanistan||NEW DELHI: Iran has said it will cooperate with India in shipping humanitarian assistance, including wheat and medicines, to Afghanistan, even as foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian stressed the need for an inclusive government in Kabul. The offer of cooperation – made by Abdollahian during a phone conversation with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on Saturday – assumes significance in view of hurdles created by Pakistan for shipping 50,000 tonnes of wheat offered by the Indian side. The Indian government sent 500,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines to Afghanistan via Tehran on January 1, since there are currently no direct flights between India and Afghanistan. The situation in Afghanistan was a key part of the discussion between Abdollahian and Jaishankar, who reviewed a range of bilateral, regional and international issues. The use of Iran’s Chabahar port, where India operates a key terminal, also figured in the conversation. “A wide ranging conversation with my Iranian colleague, FM @Amirabdolahian. Discussed the difficulties of Covid, challenges in Afghanistan, prospects of Chabahar and complexities of the Iranian nuclear issue,” Jaishankar said in a tweet. Abdollahian “referred to India’s humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, announcing measures and cooperation by the Islamic Republic of Iran to transfer this aid in the form of wheat, medicine and Covid vaccine to the country”, Iran’s foreign ministry said in a statement. He also “stressed the need to form an inclusive government” in Afghanistan. On January 7, India supplied two tonnes of life-saving medicines to Afghanistan, the third tranche of aid since last month, against the backdrop of a dire humanitarian situation exacerbated by a harsh winter. These medicines were routed through Dubai. The Indian government sent 1.6 tonnes of life-saving medicines on a special charter flight between New Delhi and Kabul on December 11. All the medicines and vaccines were handed over to the World Health Organisation (WHO) for use at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health in Kabul. The Taliban regime, which is not recognised by New Delhi, have welcomed the Indian assistance. India’s offer to provide 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan via Pakistani land routes has been held up because of conditions attached by Islamabad. The offer was made in October, and Pakistan said last month it would allow wheat and medicines to be shipped via the Wagah land border crossing in Afghan trucks, but is yet to firm up modalities. Jaishankar and Abdollahian also discussed the Covid-19 response of India and Iran. Abdollahian referred to the “good trend” of vaccination in Iran and said, “We have been able to properly contain the virus, and so far 89% of people have been vaccinated and are receiving a third dose of vaccine.” Referring to the talks in Vienna on Iran’s nuclear programme, Abdollahian said the discussions are going in the “right direction”. He added: “We have the necessary will to reach a good agreement in good faith, and if the Western side also has this goodwill and determination, we can reach a good agreement.” Jaishankar said Abdollahian’s forthcoming visit to India would be a “very good opportunity to develop bilateral cooperation”, according to the Iranian foreign ministry’s statement.

On the other hand, acting civil surgeon Dr Abdul Salam (the civil surgeon is on leave after testing positive for Covid-19) said the FIR has been lodged to stop the man from taking more jabs. “The FIR aims at stopping the man from taking more covid jabs and not to harass him,” Dr Salam said. He added the two teams probing the matter has not yet submitted their report. Mandal said that the civil surgeon who visited his house requested him to withdraw his claim of taking 12 jabs or it will cost the job of at least three health officials. Mandal is still firm on his claim and once again said, “Vaccines have benefitted him to cure him of several ailments.” He wondered that while on the one hand health officials were negating his claim on the other hand an FIR admitting that he had taken multiple jabs was lodged. He said he will resort to legal action against health officials. Mandal has claimed that he has taken Covid jabs 12 times within a year. He took his first jab on February 13 last year and 12th jab on January 4 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-against-octogenarian-for-allegedly-taking-12-covid-jabs-within-a-year-101641734422725.html
09-01-2022||India||FIR on hair stylist Jawed Habib for spitting on a woman||An FIR has been registered against hair stylist Jawed Habib, at Police Station Mansurpur, Muzzafar Nagar on the information provided by victim Puja Gupta under Section 355 (assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour person, otherwise than on grave provocation) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 for the ghastly incident that has shook the entire country - Jawed Habib, has been captured on video spitting on Gupta’s head while styling her hair. The unfortunate victim, Gupta, paid ₹2500 for VIP access to attend one of his seminars. The victim says, “While Habib was explaining hair smoothening to the participants, I pointed out that the process cannot be achieved in 5 minutes, this probably irked Habib.” She says that after lunch, Habib was preparing to give a demonstration and asked for volunteers. Gupta, being a die-hard fan, immediately volunteered. Habib recognised that Gupta was the one who questioned him. In a video now viral, he can be seen smacking her on the head. The victim also alleges that she had requested Habib not to hit her as she suffers from cervical pain. The video recorded by her husband shows Habib spitting on her scalp while announcing “Agar paani ki kami haina... toh iss thuuk mein jaan hai.” The video shows that this act was received with laughter and cheers from the audience.On reaching out to Habib, he denied the entire incident and alleged that the video has been doctored. He said, “Dear its a seminar where I teach hair science & our culture. I tell people to drink haldi pani every morning. In olden age people used to use saliva every morning if you have pimples. It’s antiseptic. If people see the whole video they will know what I’m talking about. But the video is all edited. I’m in an industry since ages so people follow me. I’ve 900+ videos on my social media where I tell how to look after skin and hair. It’s all planned dear and I don’t sell any cosmetics. I sell gyan,” (sic).However, later he took to social media and posted a video where he can be seen explaining that the entire episode was an attempt at humour and he apologises for any offence caused. We also reached out to the victim who narrated her painful ordeal. “I have become a laughing stock for the entire world. I had gone there to learn and not get humiliated,” she says. While Gupta refused to share the entire video of the incident, she stuck to her allegation. Rubbishing the fact that the video has been edited, she said “If that was the case, why are Habib’s people calling me saying that Habib is ready to apologise to me in person.” “I feel my image has been publically eroded and I seek its restoration. I want him to publicly apologise to me,” she adds. The Chairperson, National Commission for Women (NCW), Rekha Sharma says, “We have written to the Delhi Commissioner of Police, and DGP, UP to take action against Jawed Habib. We are also summoning the relevant parties.”Yogita Bhayana, human rights activist says that Jawed Habib’s act is extremely humiliating and he must be taken to task for it. “It hurts the dignity of a human being. It’s shocking that during Covid times when we are not even sharing the same breath, Jawed Habib is seen spitting on someone’s head! He should be booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act,1897. He should not think that just because he is a celebrity, he can get away with a criminal act,” says Bhayana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-on-hair-stylist-jawed-habib-for-spitting-on-a-woman-101641731842807.html

09-01-2022||India||PM Modi reviews Covid-19 situation amid surge of infections||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday held a high-level meeting of officials to review the pandemic situation of the country. The last meeting by PM Modi was held on December 24. Since then, the pandemic situation in the country has changed with daily cases recording a massive surge, Omicron being the dominant variant in many cities. Other developments that took place in the intervening period include the announcement of the election schedule in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa, Manipur, and the extension of the vaccination programme. Teenagers between the ages of 15 and 18 are being vaccinated against Covid, while precaution doses will be available for frontline workers and senior citizens with comorbidities from January 10. India's Covid-19 tally is on an upward trend increasing exponentially in the past few days. On Sunday, India reported 1.59 lakh cases, taking the active caseload to around 6 lakh. Several states have brought back weekend curfew, night curfew and other restrictions to contain the spread of Omicron, which is believed to be driving the present surge.Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur will go to the polls starting from February 10. The Election Commission has announced a one-month long schedule to complete the elections of these five states, which will be done adhering to all Covid guidelines. For the first time, the Election Commission has banned physical rallies in these poll-bound states till January 15 in view of the Omicron situation. Post the commission's review, the ban may get lifted, but EC's campaign curfew after 8pm will remain in place. According to scientists, India is witnessing the third phase of the pandemic which is different from the first two phases because of the wide vaccination coverage and fewer restrictions. The situation is dynamic and India may reach the peak of the wave later this month, experts said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reviews-covid-19-situation-amid-surge-of-infections-101641728581550.html

09-01-2022||India||JD(U) to contest UP polls in alliance with BJP, seats to be decided: Kushwaha||PATNA: The speculations about realignment in Bihar politics ended as quickly as it emerged following Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) state chief Jagtanand Singh’s offer of support to Nitish Kumar on the vexed special state and caste census issues should the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) decides not to come on board. However, now all eyes are on the high stake UP elections, where Janata Dal (United) wants to contest “enough seats” to keep its hopes alive for achieving the national party status, but looks unlikely to get that many seats from the BJP. JD(U) parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha said the party will fight election in UP as part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), but how many seats JD(U) will contest is not yet clear. “We will fight as part of the NDA. It was decided during earlier meeting,” he added. Kushwaha said that union minister RCP Singh has been authorised to coordinate with the BJP in this regard. “With not much time left, this may be decided soon. Our strategy in UP is to contest enough seats so that we could have a chance of achieving national party status. But how many seats we will get to contest is something that will be decided after talks and that must be on. But the fact is that we will contest with BJP,” he added. Social analyst Prof Nawal Kishore Choudhary said that Nitish Kumar was a pragmatic politician and he was aware of his own strengths and weaknesses as well as that of his allies to play his cards deftly. “He knows a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. He will never go for an offer (RJD’s) that remains in the domain of uncertainty. Choudhary Charan Singh is an example who was made the PM, but could not even seek trust vote due to withdrawal of support before that. He is not the one who would be happy being a titular head, but at the same time wants to keep sending messages to the BJP that it has more options and that may help his party get some seats in UP as well for presence. BJP has been accommodating to Nitish, as it also does not want to lose another ally. If JD(U) gets even some seats in UP, where BJP fully dominates, to keep its flock together, that will be a step forward for the party,” he added. Former director of AN Sinha Institute of Special Studies DM Diwakar said that the ongoing political ‘noora-kushti’ (fixed fight) was apparently a balancing game due to future stakes, which will become important with a lot of key decisions to be made, viz. JD(U)’s stake in UP elections, Bihar legislative council elections, Rajya Sabha elections and appointment on a large number of seats, which have remained vacant for a long time. “Everyone knows in UP JD(U) does not have big presence, but as an ally it will like to have commitment for Bihar, where it has higher stakes. BJP-JD(U) alliance suits both in equal measure due to an unavoidable House arithmetic and hardly leaves room for manoeuvres,” he added.

Various seamanship evolutions were also successfully cleared during the second sortie," the Navy official said.Several scientists from the Naval Science and Technological Laboratory, a DRDO facility based at Visakhapatnam, are witnessing the third phase of sea trials of Vikrant.The warship will operate MiG-29K fighter jets, Kamov-31 helicopters, MH-60R multi-role helicopters.It has over 2,300 compartments, designed for a crew of around 1700 people, including specialised cabins to accommodate women officers.Vikrant has a top speed of around 28 knots and a cruising speed of 18 knots with an endurance of about 7,500 nautical miles, officials said.The IAC is 262 metres long, 62 metres wide and it has a height of 59 metres. Its construction began in 2009.The warship has been built by Cochin Shipyard Limited(CSL).India currently has only one aircraft carrier -- INS Vikramaditya,The Indian Navy has been focusing on significantly bolstering its overall capabilities in view of China's growing efforts to increase its military presence in the Indian Ocean Region.The Indian Ocean, considered the backyard of the Indian Navy, is critical to the country's strategic interests."That the ship has been able to carry out basic flying operations from its very first sortie itself is a landmark in Indian warship construction history," Commander Madhwal said."Despite surging COVID cases in the country and the resultant challenges, the combined teams from multiple organisations associated with the project are upbeat and committed to meet the timeliness," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-first-indigenous-aircraft-carrier-begins-another-phase-of-sea-trials-101641727222402.html

Over 150 hospital employees, which include 70% doctors, have so far contracted the virus, he said. “Six of our operation theatres (OTs) functioned for routine cases and three-four for emergencies on Friday. As of now, we are not sure how many OTs will function on Monday because three other resident doctors have reported unwell and we are awaiting their Covid-19 test report. We are already short of hands after 14 of our 30 resident doctors and postgraduate students have tested positive for Covid-19,” said professor and head, department of anesthesiology, Dr Umesh Bhadani, also the Dean (academics) of the institute. The anesthesiology department has 20 post graduate students, 10 senior residents and 12 faculty members in the rank of assistant professor and above. The sanctioned faculty strength in the department is 15. The institute has a total of 33 fully functional operation theatres, but is able to run a maximum of 15-16 OTs on normal days with the existing workforce in the anesthesiology department. During the pandemic, the number of routine OTs have reduced by more than half, said Dr Bhadani. “We cannot stop surgeries in the emergency or the obstetrics and gynecology department. So, we are utilising whatever available manpower resources we have to keep the OTs for emergency surgeries operational,” added Dr Bhadani. The Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), an autonomous institution of the state government, has already stopped elective surgeries. The AIIMS and the IGIMS have also restricted the number of patients to its outdoor patient departments (OPDs) to 50 a day. The two autonomous institutions of repute in the central and state government sector, respectively, have also introduced telemedicine facility and released phone numbers for OPD consultation. Prior telephonic and online appointments are mandatory for OPD consultation at AIIMS and the IGIMS.

Otherwise, you will have to wait until it's 39 weeks since you got your 2nd dose. 4. If you have got Covishield, then your 3rd dose will also be Covishield. Same for Covaxin. The government has not allowed mix and match of vaccines.5. There is no need for fresh registration on Co-Win. Appointments can be booked from the site. Otherwise, walk-ins are also allowed.6. Voter ID, Aadhaar, passport, driving licence are some of the recognised documents by the health ministry.7. Vaccination of priority groups is free of cost in government hospitals. How important is booster dose?Several countries have been administering booster doses to their people. In India, this is not being called a booster dose but has been named as a precaution dose. The decision to administer this 3rd dose has been taken in view of the recent global surge of Covid-19 cases. In India too, cases are increasing exponentially and Omicron, the variant of concern detected on November 24, is being seen as the reason. Vaccinated people are also getting infected as Omicron has properties that can evade the body's immunity shield. Immunity, either from past infection or from vaccination, is also waning in people, scientists have found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/are-you-eligible-for-precaution-3rd-dose-of-covid-vaccine-check-list-as-drive-begins-tomorrow-101641719301583.html

She, along with fellow social reformers Jyotirao Phule and Savitribai Phule, co-founded the Indigenous Library in 1848, one of India’s first schools for girls, the company said.“She lived with her brother Usman, and the siblings opened their home to the Phules after the couple was evicted for attempting to educate people in lower castes. The Indigenous Library opened under the Sheikhs' roof. Here, Savitribai Phule and Fatima Sheikh taught communities of marginalised Dalit and Muslim women and children who were denied education based on class, religion, or gender,” Google said.Sheikh was a champion of the ‘Satyashodhak Samaj’ (Truthseekers’ Society) – the equality movement by the Phules to provide educational opportunities to the downtrodden communities – and went door-to-door and invited the members in her community to learn at the Indigenous Library to escape the rigidity of the Indian caste system. She met great resistance from the dominant classes who attempted to humiliate those involved in the Satyashodhak movement, but Sheikh and her allies persisted.The Indian government, in 2014, shone new light on her achievements by featuring her profile in Urdu textbooks alongside other trailblazing Indian educators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/google-doodle-celebrates-educator-feminist-icon-fatima-sheikh-s-191st-birthday-101641696237485.html

Police identified the two arrested men as Akku alias Akash (19) and Junaid (19) – both residents of Anand Parbat in central Delhi. Their accomplice was identified as Pritam. Police have recovered three cellphones that they stole from the victims.On the morning of January 7, the three allegedly murdered two cab drivers in Anand Parbat and Bharat Nagar after booking rides with these cabs.Shweta Chauhan, deputy commissioner of police (central), said on Friday, around 8.45am, a police team spotted a WagonR car parked on Ramjas Road with a man lying unconscious inside.“The man was taken to RML hospital, where he was declared brought dead. No injury was visible but he had bled from the mouth. The identity of the deceased was later established as Anil Yadav (48), an Uber cab driver.

When police contacted his wife, she said Yadav had left home around 6.30am for work,” Chauhan said.While police were investigating the case, they learnt of another murder in north-west Delhi’s Bharat Nagar. The driver, Chhavi Nath, was found dead and his Hyundai i10 was found parked in Gulabi Bagh area, about 4km from Bharat Nagar“The details of passengers were obtained from the Uber office in Gurugram...

09-01-2022||India||Mercury to drop by 4-6°Celsius in northwest India after heavy rains: IMD||Minimum temperatures over northwest India, particularly Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, are likely to drop by 4 to 6 degrees Celsius over the next two-three days, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted on Saturday, following an intense wet spell over several parts in the region.Intense rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy shower is also likely over Western Himalayan region during next 48 hours and over plains of northwest India during next 24 hours, IMD said. It further predicted that intense thunderstorm activity will continue over Central India from January 8 to 12 and over Eastern India during January 10 to 13.“A western disturbance as a cyclonic circulation lies over north Pakistan and neighbourhood with a trough (line of low pressure) aloft. The induced cyclonic circulation is lying over east Rajasthan and neighbourhood at lower tropospheric levels. There is high moisture incursion from Arabian Sea over northwest and adjoining central India, which is likely to continue during next two days. The confluence of winds from Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal at lower tropospheric levels is likely over central India during next three-four days,” the IMD said in its evening forecast bulletin on Saturday.Widespread light to moderate rainfall or snowfall is likely over Western Himalayan region till Sunday and the same will decrease significantly thereafter. “Isolated very heavy rainfall or snowfall is very likely over Jammu-Kashmir-Ladakh-Gilgit-Baltistan-Muzaffarabad and Himachal Pradesh on January 8. Isolated heavy rainfall/snowfall is very likely over Himachal Pradesh on January 9 and over Uttarakhand on January 8 and 9,” the bulletin added.Widespread rainfall is also likely to continue over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Western Uttar Pradesh, IMD said, adding it will decrease from Sunday. “Scattered to fairly widespread rainfall is very likely over East Uttar Pradesh & West Madhya Pradesh on January 8 and 9, over East Madhya Pradesh during January 8 to 12 and over Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh during January 10 to 12 and over Vidarbha during January 9 to 12, over Odisha and Gangetic West Bengal during January 11 to 12,” the weather bureau said in the bulletin.M Mohapatra, director general, IMD, said Delhi has already recorded moderate rain due to the ongoing wet spell.“Now gradually rainfall will reduce over western parts of Punjab and Haryana. There was widespread snowfall over Jammu and Kashmir on Friday. Now intense rain is expected over Madhya Pradesh and neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. The western disturbance which caused rainfall over northwest India is expected to move eastwards gradually and cause rainfall, thundershowers there,” said Mohapatra.There were two WDs in close succession that caused an extended wet spell over northwest India, he added. “The impact was higher because of moisture incursion from Arabian Sea. Over Central India we are expecting confluence of winds from Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal so there can be widespread and heavy rain over Madhya Pradesh. As the WD moves away, very cold northerly winds blowing from snowclad Himalayas are going to bring down minimum temperatures by around 4 to 6 degrees over northwest India.”According to the weather agency, slight fall in minimum temperatures is likely over Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan during next 24 hours and rapid fall by 4-6 degrees C during next 2-3 days and no significant change thereafter. “No significant change in minimum temperatures is very likely over Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh during next 2-3 days and fall by 2-4 degree C during subsequent 3 days,” IMD said.Several parts of the northwest India reported intense wet spell on Saturday. In Jammu and Kashmir, Udhampur IAF recorded 12 cm rainfall/snowfall, Katra (10 cm) and Jammu (8 cm). In Punjab, Kapurthala recorded 9 cm rainfall, Gurdaspur (6 cm) and Jalandhar (5 cm) each. In Central Delhi, Pusa (7 cm), Ayanagar (5 cm) and Palam recorded 5 cm of rainfall, according to IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mercury-to-drop-by-4-6-celsius-in-northwest-india-after-heavy-rains-imd-101641669239557.html
09-01-2022||India||GitHub case: Accused Bishnoi emotionless, hard to break, say police||Cunning, emotionless, and hard to break – this is how police officers describe Neeraj Bishnoi (21), the second-year BTech student arrested for creating the controversial Bulli Bai app on GitHub where doctored photographs of Muslim women were uploaded.In police custody, Bishnoi asked his interrogators to address him as Giyo -- a name he has taken from Giyu Tomioka, a fictional character who kills the demon in the Japanese comic book and animated series Demon Slayer.In the last two years, Bishnoi had created five Twitter handles using versions of the name Giyo such as @giyu2002, @giyu007, @giyuu84, @giyu94 and @guyi44 to promote the controversial app or make derogatory comments against women on social media.When police scanned his laptop, they found 153 different adult sites as tabs on his browser window.Bishnoi, who has been in police custody for about 48 hours, has been coming up with new revelations every hour. A city court had on Thursday evening sent him to seven days in police custody.“He claims to be a habitual hacker, who has been defacing websites since he was 15. He said he hacked his school’s website at 15. He claims he has in the past hacked or defaced different websites of schools and universities of India as well as of that of Pakistan. We are verifying the claims,” said DCP KPS Malhotra, chief of the IFSO (Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations), the Delhi police’s cyber cell.A team of IFSO and Assam police arrested Bishnoi from his house in Jorhat on Wednesday night.Investigating officials said that in the past 48 hours Bishnoi attempted to harm himself twice and also threatened to kill himself.“He is trying to delay the investigation and is not cooperating. We are ensuring he does not harm himself. We got his medical examination conducted. He is stable. He may be behaving like this due to his current mental condition or is trying to delay the investigation,” DCP Malhotra said.An investigating officer said that Bishnoi had used the Gurmukhi script instead of Devanagari or Roman to mislead investigators into believing that the controversial app may have been created by pro-Khalistan separatist groups.“Using the suspended Twitter handles, he promoted the app by claiming that it was against women who were opposing the construction of the Ram Temple. This was his way to gain more traction on social media from right wing groups. The truth is he was only targeting women. This coupled with the data in his laptop and the sites he browsed indicates that he has no ideology but is addicted to adult sites,” one investigating officer, who asked not to be named, said.Police are now trying to check the extent of his role in the first GitHub app case – a similar one but with a different name – that was surfaced in July last year. In the 24 hours before his arrest, Bishnoi claimed through his Twitter handles that he “cloned the repository” and “edited the code as well the graphics” from that first GitHub app to build the second app. He had also named a person who created the first app. HT is withholding the name of the person because police are yet to identify that person.DCP Malhotra said, “He disclosed that he was also in touch with the creator of the first GitHub case. His claim has been verified from the involvement of a Twitter account used by him in an FIR registered at Kishangarh police station in southwest Delhi. In the said FIR, using one of his Twitter accounts he had posted the photograph of a woman and used the same modus operandi. We are verifying the people he has named.”Delhi police are yet to arrest anyone in the first GitHub case.The second GitHub app and its circulation on social media channels sparked outrage after which different people filed complaints with Delhi and Mumbai police. The Mumbai police and Delhi police are separately investigating the case. Mumbai police have arrested three persons in the case, Sweta Singh (18), her friend Mayank Rawat (20), both residents of Uttarakhand, and Vishal Kumar Jha (21), an engineering student from Bengaluru. The three shared the app and promoted it on social media handles, according to Mumbai police.Explaining Bishnoi’s links with the persons arrested by Mumbai police, DCP Malhotra said, “He has claimed that he was virtually in touch with the persons arrested by Mumbai police and used to chat through Twitter group chats. He had never met those persons and even did not have their contact numbers. He had disclosed that he was using the Twitter account of the girl (Sweta Singh) arrested by Mumbai police.”Bishnoi, son of a grocer, has been suspended from the Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Bhopal, where he was studying for his BTech.

We should work together to avoid a complete shutdown in the state. As of now we are not planning any lockdown,” she told the media.The Minister said the quarantine protocol for those coming from abroad was decided based on the directions issued by the Union government.Kerala reported 5,944 new Covid-19 cases and 242 virus-related fatalities on Saturday taking the total affected people in the state to 5,270,179 and the death toll to 49,547, a health bulletin stated.Of the deaths, 33 were recorded over the last few days and 209 designated as Covid-19 deaths after receiving appeals based on the new guidelines of the Centre and the directions of the Supreme Court.Among the districts, Thiruvananthapuram recorded the highest number of cases on Saturday with 1,219, followed by Ernakulam with 1,214 and Kozhikode with 580 cases.The state has tested 60,075 samples in the last 24 hours.“Currently, there are 31,098 active COVID-19 cases in the state out of which only seven per cent people are hospitalised,” the health department said in a release.Out of those who were found infected on Saturday, 80 people reached the state from outside while 5,479 others contracted the disease from their contacts.

09-01-2022||India||AIADMK welcomes SC verdict on OBC quota in medical admissions||The AIADMK in Tamil Nadu on Saturday welcomed the Supreme Court upholding the 27 per cent reservation in all India Quota (AIQ) seats for medical admissions, and claimed this was a victory for its sustained struggle on the quota issue.The main opposition party also lashed out at its rival, the ruling DMK for claiming credit in the matter, alleging it had not made the smallest effort in the quota issue.AIADMK Coordinator O Panneerselvam and Joint Coordinator K Palaniswami also vowed to oppose the 10 per cent EWS quota.In a joint statement, the two leaders said the Friday judgement of the apex Court was a ‘victory’ to the party’s long-pending and sustained plea on the OBC quota front, they said, adding it will enable increasing seats in medical admissions.Claiming that the AIADMK had taken pioneering steps for the implementation of welfare measures for the socially and educationally backward sections of the population, they recalled reservation for the backward classes was increased from 31 per cent to 50 per cent during the rule of late Chief Minister M G Ramachandran in 1980, which has benefited the members in the areas of admission in professional education and government jobs.Similarly, late chief minister J Jayalalithaa piloted an Assembly bill in 1990, urging the central government to increase OBC quota in jobs from the then announced 27 per cent to 50 per cent, they said.Subsequently, in 1993 she enacted a legislation in Tamil Nadu allowing a total of 69 per cent reservation and ensured it was included in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution and “thus ensured social justice,” they added.The party and its led government earlier moved the court against the non-provision of 27 per cent OBC quota in AIQ in medical admissions and the Madras High Court had in July 2020 directed the Centre to form a panel and decide on the matter, the two leaders recalled.Subsequently, based on the panel’s recommendations the Centre allotted reservation which was upheld by the SC on Friday, they said.“This is a victory for the AIADMK’s sustained struggle and insistence,” they said and lashed out at the DMK, saying the party despite its presence in central governments for 17 years, did not take any effort in the matter but were suddenly claiming credit for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmkwelcomes-sc-verdict-on-obc-quota-in-medical-admissions-101641667560582.html
09-01-2022||India||‘Deliberate, malicious’: Madras high court raps Christian priest for remarks on Hindus||The Madras High Court has ruled that an evangelist who made offending remarks against Hindus cannot claim immunity after outraging religious beliefs of others and stated he cannot be equated as a neutral commentator or a stand-up comedian like Munawar Faruqui.Partly quashing an FIR filed against priest P George Ponniah who was booked under different sections of the IPC including outraging religious sentiments, Justice G R Swaminathan said such immunity would be available only to rationalists or satirists or even academics under the Constitution. The judge, while batting for an individual’s decision to convert from one religion to another, however said “religious conversions cannot be a group agenda.” The judge made the observations while hearing a petition of Ponniah against whom a case was filed by the police for saying Bhooma Devi and Bharat Mata were sources of infection and filth.He had also made critical remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and a state Minister during a meeting at Arumanai in Kanyakumari district in the state.The judge said the petitioner cannot insult or outrage others’ religion or religious beliefs. “There was absolutely no need or necessity to mount a visceral attack on the religious beliefs of the Hindus. It was unwarranted and utterly unrelated to the occasion. That is what makes it deliberate and malicious. The petitioner poked fun at those who walk barefoot out of reverence for Mother Earth (Bhooma Devi). He stated that Christians wear shoes so that they wont catch scabies. He painted Bhuma Devi and Bharat Mata as sources of infection and filth,” the judge said.“A reading of the petitioner’s speech as a whole does not leave any one in doubt. His target is the Hindu community. He is putting them on one side and the Christians and Muslims on the other. He is clearly pitting one group against the other. The distinction is made solely on the ground of religion. The petitioner repeatedly demeans the Hindu community,” the judge said.The court said India was partitioned on the ground of religion and millions died in the ensuing riots. “That is why, our founding fathers consciously adopted secularism as the guiding principle of the new republic. There is something truly enchanting about the idea of India propounded by them. Equality, liberty, fraternity and egalitarianism were real promises meant to be fulfilled. Freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess and propagate one’s religion was made a fundamental right.” “But the tryst with destiny can be achieved only if the multicultural character of the Indian society continues to remain. In other words, the status quo in the matter of religious demography has to be maintained. Our Constitution guarantees freedom of conscience as a fundamental right. If an individual out of personal conviction wants to change his religion, his choice must be respected. The change of religion by such a person cannot be and ought not to be objected to. Dileep Kumar became A R Rahman (the Oscar-winning composer),” he said.The judge also referred to the instances of some other Tamil cinema celebrities embracing Islam and said “these are perfectly understandable and no exception can be taken.” “But religious conversions cannot be a group agenda. Our Constitution speaks of composite culture. This character has to be maintained. The clock of history can never be put back. But the status quo that obtains in the year 2022 as regards religious demographic profile may have to be maintained. When stand-up comedians Munawar Faruqui or Alexander Babu perform on stage, they are exercising their fundamental right to poke fun at others. Again, their religious identity is irrelevant. It is here, the “Who?” and “Where?” tests matter,” the court noted. He said the persons concerned voice their opinions or give vent to their expressions in their capacity as satirists. On the other hand, an evangelist like the petitioner cannot claim a similar privilege. “He cannot insult or outrage others’ religion or their religious beliefs and still claim immunity from the application of Section 295A/153A/505(2) of IPC. This is because he views the other religionists as a constituency to be poached,” he said. Section 295 (a) deals with deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs while 153 (a) is about promoting disharmony, enmity or feelings of hatred between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc. and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony.“The offending speech of the petitioner prima facie attracts the offences under Sections 153A, 295A and 505(2) of IPC,” the judge said, but quashed other sections including one on unlawful assembly. “The impugned FIR is quashed to this limited extent as far as the petitioner is concerned,” the judge ruled.

09-01-2022||India||Kidnapping of infant at Kottayam hospital was pre-planned, say police||The woman who kidnapped a new-born baby from the Kottayam Medical College Hospital dressed as a nurse recently had meticulously planned the crime to show her lover it was her child, Medical Education Department Joint Director Thomas Mathew, who has been probing the incident, said on Saturday.Mathew said the security measures inside the hospital and the maternity ward was up to the mark but the woman was able to bypass all of it as she was disguised as a nurse.“The woman came to the hospital with a proper plan. She entered the hospital and left the premises within a few minutes with the infant. In fact, the security measures inside the hospital are really good. But she was able to bypass all of it as she was disguised as a nurse,” Mathew told the media here.He said a report will be submitted to the minister soon.A woman, dressed as a nurse, entered the gynaecology department of the medical hospital on January 6 and walked away with the infant around 3 pm and it took more than half an hour for the child’s mother and relatives to realise that the baby had been kidnapped. However, police traced the infant within hours and handed it over to the mother.A woman, Neethu (33) who abducted the baby, was arrested.Police had said the woman abducted the child to show her lover, Ibrahim Badusha from Ernakulam that she had delivered a child. Police said Neethu, a married woman, was in a relationship with Badusha and became pregnant. However, she suffered a miscarriage but did not inform this to Badusha.Neethu had told him that she became pregnant and used to blackmail him when he decided to marry another girl, police had said. Neethu had reached Kottayam on January 4 and took a room there.“She visited the maternity ward and identified one child. She took the child to her room and clicked a photo and sent it to her lover. That was the reason behind the abduction,” Kottayam SP Shilpa Dyavaiah said.Police have also registered a case against Badusha after Neethu alleged that he had cheated her after borrowing over ₹30 lakh cash.Health Minister Veena George had ordered a probe into the matter.The Medical College Police was informed about the abduction around 4 pm on Thursday and it immediately swung into action and sent messages to all the police stations in the district and around the hospital.All vehicles arriving from the medical college area were stopped and inspected by police teams and even autorickshaw drivers, ambulance drivers, locals and medical shop staff in the vicinity of the medical college were told to keep an eye out for the baby, police said.Subsequently, an autorickshaw driver informed the police that a woman with a baby was seen entering the Park Hotel around 100 metres from the hospital. Police reached the hotel, arrested the woman and rushed the baby back to its mother at the hospital.

09-01-2022||India||Bengaluru: Ugandan woman with 1kg of synthetic drugs arrested, says NCB||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Bengaluru on Saturday seized around 1 kg of Methamphetamine from a Ugandan lady at Hubbali railway station, the agency said in a statement. The drugs were packed in two baby food packets.“Based on specific intelligence, the officers of NCB Bengaluru seized 995 grams of Methamphetamine at Hubballi Railway Station on 07.01.2022 from the possession of (a) Ugandan lady. She was travelling with the drugs in a concealed form on (the_ train. The drug was sourced from Delhi and for further distribution in the state of Karnataka,” according to the NCB statement on Saturday.“The drug was cleverly packed and further concealed in two Cerelac baby food carton boxes to avoid detection. Each box contained around 500 grams of Methamphetamine. By arresting the said Ugandan national by officers of NCB, Bengaluru has effectively neutralized a drug syndicate which was operating in the southern regions uniquely and systematically,” the statement added.The bust comes a day after the Bengaluru police made startling claims of an increase in the peddling and consumption of drugs in the city, especially those from other nationalities.In a press conference on Friday, Bengaluru city police commissioner Kamal Pant had shared details of the drugs it had seized as part of its ongoing campaign since early 2020. Pant had said that almost all synthetic drugs were coming through foreigners.“In 2021, against drugs, 177 foreigners have been caught and have filed two under NDPS (The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act) and under Goonda Act,” Pant said on Friday.Data also shows an increase in the number of foreigners being arrested since 2019. There were 33 cases and 38 persons arrested in 2019 in Bengaluru under various crimes, and this more than doubled to 66 cases and 84 arrests in 2020. This number further doubled to 139 cases and 177 arrests in 2021, according to the data.The combined total number of cases and persons arrested in 2019 was 768 and 1,260, respectively, which rose to 4555 cases and 5749 persons respectively in 2021.In the same period, the seizure of synthetic drugs rose from 1.62kgs in 2019 to nearly 60 kgs.From a seizure of around 1.617 kgs in 2019, the quantum of seizure has risen to 56.96 kgs of synthetic drugs valued at over ₹2000 crore, data showed. Each gram of Cocaine, Pant said, sells for anywhere between ₹2000- ₹5000. Ganja or marijuana seizures went up from 1,047 kgs to 3,613 kgs while Ecstasy tablets rose from 1,539 to 8,211 in 2021.A total of 155 LSD strips were seized in 2019, which has now gone up to 12,451, data shows.Including all kinds of narcotics, the total seizure has gone up from 1,053 kgs to 3,706 kgs, valued at over ₹6000 crores, data showed.Experts said mental health issues triggered by the Covid pandemic-induced lockdown is part of the cause for the increase in people using more substances to deal with their problems.Dr Pratima Murthy, Director at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), professor and head of the department of psychiatry, said that issues like anxiety around Covid-19, family members getting infected, job losses, inability to travel, education and other social relationships have been deeply impacted.“We need to keep a careful eye on things. Support for people who are in severe distress. Domestic violence, substance use increase all of it is interrelated,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-ugandan-woman-with-1kg-of-synthetic-drugs-arrested-saysncb-101641667439450.html
09-01-2022||India||Karnataka Congress preps for march on Mekedatu amid Covid curbs||Karnataka Congress on Saturday held a meeting at the residence of state president DK Shivakumar in Kanakapura taluka as they began preparations for the 10-day-long 100 km padayatra for Mekedatu from Sunday.The padayatra is part of Congress’s plans to pressurise the Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government to initiate work on the contentious Mekedatu reservoir-cum-drinking water project that has seen vehement opposition from neighbouring Tamil Nadu.The BJP has issued prohibitory orders in Ramanagara district citing the growing number of covid-19 infections in the state, which the Congress has alleged is being used to scuttle the 100-km march.“We had announced this (Padayatra) a month ago. They (BJP government) have done it on purpose and only in Ramanagara district. Why have they clamped only Ramanagara district with Section 144, and why not in other districts? That shows that their intention is not Bonafide,” Siddaramaiah, the Leader of Opposition, said on Saturday.He said that it remains to be seen if they will be “arrested or allowed” to carry on the march.Meanwhile, thousands of Congress workers started congregating in Kanakpura taluka to prepare for the padayatra, scheduled to begin on Sunday.The police and district administration have issued prohibitory orders against the march.“We have informed them of these restrictions. We will take action according to the law if there are any violations,” said a senior police official from the district.While the Congress maintained that the padayatra is to pressure the government to initiate works on the contentious project, it would also help the party mobilise much-needed support in the Old Mysuru region where it has lost some ground, largely due to the BJP and its tacit alliance with the BJP.This is the region where the JD(S) draws most of its strength in terms of elected representatives. The BJP has been trying to make inroads both organically and inorganically to help its ambitions of returning to power with a full majority in 2023.Congress, which both the BJP and JD(S) consider as the common enemy, has been trying to win back ground it lost since the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.“Are there separate rules for Dala (JD(S), Congress or BJP? Whatever rules apply for common people will be implemented here as well. This is a political walk for power, and nothing else,” Araga Jnanendra, Karnataka home minister, said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-congress-preps-for-march-on-mekedatu-amid-covid-curbs-101641667381490.html
09-01-2022||India||Parties in Tamil Nadu take stand to wage united legal battle against NEET||Political parties in Tamil Nadu, except the BJP, on Saturday resolved to wage a unified legal battle to completely abolish National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to medical colleges in the State.A decision to this effect was taken at an all political party leaders meeting chaired by Chief Minister M K Stalin at the Secretariat here.The resolution passed by 12 political parties amid a walkout by the BJP states that NEET examination and the subsequent National Medical Commission Act have greatly affected the Tamil Nadu students by imposing NEET for admissions to medical colleges.“The Centre has deprived the State government of the right to decide on the manner of admitting its students to the State-run medical colleges. This is against State autonomy,” the resolution said.“NEET is the problem of Tamil Nadu - the problem of our students. .. In a country like India where the poor live, where there is inequality in the name of caste, the biggest and most difficult thing is to access education,” Stalin said at the meeting attended by even the opposition AIADMK.Abolishing entrance examinations makes higher education accessible to the poor and those with rural background, he argued.“NEET deprived those sections of the right to education and the State is opposed to NEET as it is an impediment to the educational development of Tamil Nadu students. “How can we accept the two-hour exam called NEET after plus two? Isn’t this social injustice? How many can afford to spend a huge sum for NEET coaching?” the Chief Minister asked. He explained the circumstances prompting him to ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi to exempt TN from NEET, and recalled that the Assembly resolution seeking exemption from the test was passed unanimously on September 13, 2021.“We forwarded the bill to the Governor to be sent to the President for his assent. But the Governor had not sent the bill to the President,” he said and added that he had to meet the Governor in person and insist the bill be sent.“This is a situation where the State’s rights and the legislative power is under question that we have urgently convened this all-party meeting,” Stalin informed.NEET favoured those students who have access to coaching and it created the impression that the 12 years of schooling is of no use for admission to medical courses besides it renders the education system meaningless. “It not only shatters the dreams of the students but also destroys the principle of federalism,” the resolution further said. “Not sending this bill to the President is considered unbefitting to the sovereignty of the legislature,” the resolution said and mentioned about the efforts of the Chief Minister calling on the Governor to urge him to send the bill for Presidential assent. The Union Home Minister’s refusal to meet the all-party delegation is against democratic norms, the resolution said and added that the delegation would meet the Union Home Minister if an audience is given.Senior legal experts will be consulted for necessary legal measures to completely abolish the NEET system which is shattering the higher education dreams of poor and rural students and disrupting the principle of State autonomy. Hence, it was resolved that all political parties would work in unison and make all necessary efforts to ensure a consensus so that other States in the country can realise the disadvantages of NEET, the resolution said.“Nearly 12 out of 13 political party leaders who participated in the meeting resolved to meet the Union Home Minister on demanding exemption from NEET and also to consult legal experts on how to proceed with the legal battle,” Health and Family Welfare Minister Ma Subramanian said emerging from the meeting. The all-party delegation has planned to meet the Governor again to seek the nod for the Tamil Nadu Assembly Bill, he told reporters. Demanding a white paper on the status of admission of poor students to medical colleges and fee structure in and capitation demanded by the medical colleges before NEET came into existence, BJP Mahila Morcha national president and Coimbatore South legislator Vanathi Srinivasan said the DMK and other parties gave a picture that the BJP government at the Centre had introduced NEET.“It was introduced by the Congress-led UPA government in which the DMK was a constituent. The BJP does not agree with the NEET exemption resolution,” she said after staging a walkout from the meeting.She claimed that 69 per cent reservation being followed in Tamil Nadu ensured social justice and the allegation that NEET was discriminatory does not hold water.

09-01-2022||India||Punjab appoints new DGP amid furore over PM’s security breach||Hours before the model code of conduct for assembly elections came into force on Saturday, the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Punjab government appointed 1987-batch IPS officer Viresh Kumar Bhawra as the state’s director general of police (DGP).Bhawra will replace 1986-batch IPS officer S Chattopadhyaya, who landed in a controversy over a security breach during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Ferozepur on January 5. On Friday, Chattopadhyaya, along with 13 other officers, was issued a show-cause notice by the home ministry for the “major security lapse”.An official familiar with the matter said Chattopadhyaya was replaced as his name was not included by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) in the list of three officers sent to the state government earlier this week and in view of the row over the security lapse.The two officers other than Bhawra, who was previously the DGP of Punjab Home Guards, in the list were senior IPS officers Dinkar Gupta and Prabodh Kumar.“On the consideration of the panel received from the UPSC, the Punjab governor is pleased to appoint Viresh Kumar Bhawra, IPS as director general of police, Punjab (Head of Police Force),” an order released by the state government said.“His term shall be for a minimum period of two years from the date of assumption of office in pursuance of the Supreme Court orders,” it added.According to the Supreme Court’s guidelines, out of three shortlisted IPS officers by the UPSC, the state government finalises the name of one officer for the appointment of a DGP.Chattopadhyaya was due to retire on March 31. Channi, along with home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa, however, decided to appoint a new DGP amid the row over the PM’s security lapse, the official cited above said on condition of anonymity.Bhawra, who served as the state intelligence chief when Captain Amarinder Singh was the chief minister of Punjab, is the third DGP to have been appointed by the Channi government during its brief tenure since September last year. After Dinkar Gupta was removed as DGP on October 4, Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota was given the charge of officiating DGP on November 29. He was then replaced by Chattopadhaya on December 16.Immediately after his appointment on Saturday, Bhawra transferred 47 deputy superintendents of police.
09-01-2022||India||20 million kids in 15-18 age group vaccinated already||Over 20 million teenagers aged 15-18 years have been given the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine since January 3, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Saturday.“Shielding young India against Covid-19. Over 2 crore children between the age group of 15-18 vaccinated against Covid-19 since 3rd January. Congratulations to all my young friends who got vaccinated,” Mandaviya tweeted.His tweet was quoted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who congratulated eligible children of the age cohort and urged people to get vaccinated.“Excellent! Well done my young friends. Let us continue this momentum. Urging everyone to follow all COVID-19 related protocols and get vaccinated, if you haven’t already,” Modi tweeted.Since January 3, when the government opened vaccinations for children in the age group of 15-18 years, 20,226,790 teenagers have been vaccinated with the first shot of Covaxin, the central government’s CoWIN dashboard data showed.Uttar Pradesh topped the list of states that administered the most shots to this age category, with 1,715,615 children receiving the jab between January 3 and 7. Tamil Nadu vaccinated 1,463,079 children in the same period. In Maharashtra, 1,483,478 children were vaccinated. In Delhi, 204,902 children have been vaccinated since the drive began.India started its vaccination drive for teenagers on January 3, administering Covaxin for this age group in all states, which according to the central government requires a waiting time of 28 days between two doses.Since this age category is a mobile group, which has a comparatively greater level of interaction with the outside world, it is imperative that the maximum number of teenagers in this cohort is vaccinated at the earliest, according to Dr Piyush Gupta, former president of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics and head of the paediatrics department at the University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi.“The 15-18 age category are a priority because these are the children who will be going for their board exams in a couple of months,” Dr Gupta said. “They cannot be held hostage for long because they have to go out, take their exams, sit in examination halls and mingle with other students. So, they have to be made free of this risk.”

We never thought it would happen so fast. We are delighted.”The Union home ministry’s move on Friday, first reported by The Hindu, coincided with several British MPs raising the Indian government’s decision not to renew the registration in the UK’s Parliament. The MPs asked the Boris Johnson government to take up the matter with India.In India, a political controversy broke out over the Centre’s December 25 decision not to renew the charity’s registration. According to the Union home ministry data, the charity, set up by the Nobel Peace Prize winner in 1950, was among the 5,968 non-profits taken out of FCRA ambit in December 2021.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee was among the first to launch a blistering attack on the Centre, accusing the home ministry of freezing the bank accounts of the charity headquartered in Kolkata.The home ministry promptly denied the charge, insisting that the Catholic religious order and philanthropic organisation requested its bank to freeze the account in view of the MHA’s decision not to renew its FCRA registration mandatory for receiving foreign funds.In a statement on December 27, the MHA said its FCRA registration, which was initially valid till October 31, 2021, was extended till December 31 since a decision on its request for renewal was pending.“However, while considering the MoC’s renewal application, some adverse inputs were noticed,” the statement said. The MHA, however, didn’t elaborate on the nature of the “adverse inputs” that led the government to decide against its renewal.The charity also confirmed in a statement the same day that it has asked its centres not to operate foreign contribution accounts until the matter is resolved.In Odisha, where Missionaries of Charity operates a leprosy home on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar housing 300 people and 12 orphanages with 600-odd inmates, chief minister Naveen Patnaik sanctioned ₹79 lakh to the charity to keep its shelter homes running.As news of Friday’s decision to grant Mother Teresa’s charity emerged, Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien posted a screenshot of the charity figuring in the home ministry’s list of non-profits with FCRA registration. “The ‘adverse inputs’ harassed so many and then disappeared in two weeks,” he said in a swipe at the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-restores-fcra-of-mother-teresa-s-missionaries-of-charity-101641619732033.html
